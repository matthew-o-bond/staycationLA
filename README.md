This repository includes the materials used to generate the staycationLA app (dataispower.me). This app uses topic modeling to recommend local attractions that are similar to international cities. 
Data were collected from tripadvisor.com using selenium web scraping. 
Data were analyzed using LDA topic modeling to identify coherent topics. 
The app was deployed using flask and elastic beanstalk on AWS.


App description:
In 2018, one third of Americans traveled internationally and spent over $100 billion. However, in 2020 many people have concerns about the health risks, cost, and carbon emissions of international travel.
I used online travel reviews to develop staycationLA, a web app that recommends local attractions for people who would prefer to travel domestically so they can find attractions that are similar to international destinations. 
Reviews often contain irrelevant words, so the key to this project was identifying which keywords, phrases, or sentiments indicated meaningful similarity between international destinations and local attractions.
