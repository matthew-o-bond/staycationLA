30,"Beautiful Memorial Park, grounds are immacculate.","The park itself is always immaculate, well kept. The front offices are becoming money hungry and making a difficult time in your life more difficult. They are up selling with almost a strong arm approach, questioning your devotion to family members by the amount of money you spend in services and arrangements. They are also making it EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to utilize family plots, which were purchase years ago and now needed, they have some new policies stating nothing is transferable.This is a blatant attempt to have you purchase new land at today's market value. When plots were purchased over 30 years ago, no such restrictions existed.On 2 occasions in the last 6 years I've had to fight to bury a family member in 2 separate instances.A time of difficulty made even more difficult and stressful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wirtzfam2

40,Beautiful burial areas,"My grandparents are buried here and we come a few times a year to visit them. It's a huge memorial park with tons of graves. There's always a service or memorial going on, and while it's very sad, it's also a reminder of how we're all in this same cycle of life together.I love the different areas and how each has a very distinct feel and theme. My grandparents are in the grass right when you enter. It's a beautiful, sunny plot with some big trees nearby. My uncle is cremated and in an urn in the Buddhist temple area on top of the hill. Going up there, you'd forget where you are. It's almost like being in Asia. There's also a children's area, which is the saddest area to go through (for me). All the staff I've encountered here have been respectful, sensitive, and helpful. I know they helped my family out when we were dealing with the loss of my grandparents.They keep the grounds relatively well, for how big it is. You might have to cut away overgrowth over the tombstone you're visiting, but generally the grass is all trimmed and kept short enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilicedt

They have always provided professional service and the Park is kept in good conditions. Be careful when bringing small children to visit. A few years ago a nearby brush fire caused by an automobile accident, has disturbed wildlife habitats nearby. There are packs of coyotes roaming about the park sometimes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semanticvision
30,"Sorry, it’s a cemetery, not a tourist attraction","Sorry, it’s a cemetery, not a tourist attraction.

50,A day remembering the ones I love,Had to attend a funeral this week so I visited my grandpa since I was early. I forgot how beautiful the memorial park is. I could have wondered around here all day if there was more time. It took a little bit of time to remember where the niche was for my grandpa but we found it. Then we headed off to the Memorial Chapel. The service was after sunset and the view of the city lights was amazing when we got to the top of the hill. Such a beautiful location and so many little areas to see you really could spend a whole day just wondering the grounds. This truly is a beautiful resting place for the one you love.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenJen1865

50,BEAUTIFUL HILLSIDE SETTING FOR SPECIAL MEDITATION,"Located on 1,400-acres of rolling hills west of I-605 and south of CA-60, the ROSE HILLS MEMORIAL CEMETERY is a beautiful and peaceful resting place for friends and relatives. In addition to five small mausoleum, and the four chapels, there are acres and acres of tree-studded rolling hills with graves and memorial plaques. I would advise you to go on a sunny day and stroll through the chapels and gardens and take the time to read the messages of loved ones. Do not wait until you have to attend a loved one’s funeral, because on that day you may the notice the surrounding beauty of the cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertdA8325JD

50,Pretty,"It is a very large memorial park. The kiosk lady will give you a highlighted map telling you where you want to go. The workers were nice and the service was fine. Each chair had a mini water bottle, but it would have been nice if they had been refrigerated. Warm water isn't great. Overall, a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KO2005
50,"Spectacular property, beautiful views and great service","It seems a bit strange, to me, to review a cemetery. But this place is more than that. We don't live here but drove 350 miles to my Aunt's funeral. Our mouths were agape at how huge this property is! There are chapels all over the place, so I can't remember the name of the one where he service was held. It was beautiful and serene. The staff was very friendly and unobtrusive. The next day, we returned for the burial, that began at the same chapel. Again, the staff was very considerate and helpful. We bought flowers, and I was impressed at the beautiful bouquet they created (they even have their own flower shop). As we drove in procession to the burial site, I was overwhelmed with the serenity and beautiful care of the grounds. I can see why my family chose this place as our Aunt's final resting place. What a beautiful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodiewife
