50,Great venue for drag racing,"I loved that there isn't a bad seat and that anyone smoking must leave the bleachers to smoke. There are plenty of places to eat with a variety of foods. The only thing that was a bit uncomfortable for me is they did not ask to search our purses or other belongings and no metal detector. Anyone could come in with weapons, which in this day and age is concerning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelngav
30,a day at the races,"the races here are good but have been a lot better in the past.tailgating is only allowed in one spot and its expensive .for a family of 4 will cost around 350.00 for the day that is food ,entry fee and parking.this dosn't include souvenirs. the racers are friendly and autographs are plenty.the vendors are a little scarce anymore seeing as maingate got claws into everything. but all in all a good time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wpf736
50,"An excellent venue for Drag Racing, Food, Drink and Entertainment","The racing here is excellent! However, if you value great food, drink and other entertainment as well, you can't beat this place. There are so many food and drink vendors and a lot more going on in the pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stripgirl1
50,great place!!!,"went for 2018 finals in november fantastic!!!!! great seating, sat at 330 ft mark very clean and tidy , staff are so nice we took all our food and drinks in backpacks (no glass of course) good parking, cant wait to come back!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lerchie
50,Awesome facility,"Pomona Raceway is always a super experience. Staff are super friendly, the drivers put up with a lot, but they are great! Great time and mind-boggling energy from 12,000 horsepower.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f1nut57
20,In and out car show,Went to the In and out car show and they only accepted cash to get in. Get with the program people. Everyone has card swipe anymore. We were directed to the ATM booth that sucked. First one of the two machine was broken. We had to wait in line and it took everyone about 10 to 15 minutes to get money because the machine was so bad you could not read it. It charged us money and our bank charged us money. This was terrible. The cars were nice. I also thought In and Out should of had fries and shakes. We had to go to Pink vendor to buy fries and would of had to go to another booth to get a shake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40catheye
50,Wicked Experience,Excellent Raceway!! Was here for the NHRA Finals!! Amazing rush of horsepower! The facilities were very great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
50,Amazing 2017 Winternationalsl!!,"If you are a motorsports fan and like racing Fast and LOUD this event has to be on your bucket list. It has been on ours for years so its a BIG TICK!It is a great facility and the grandstands mean you get a good view of the action wherever you are sitting. But please read the warning at the end.NHRA's All Access policy means you can wander round the pit areas and if they are not busy the drivers are happy to sign autographs. Watching the teams servicing (i.e. strip down,rebuilding and tune) the cars between rounds (in about 1 hour) is a revelation! There are lots of trade stands and food outlets. So plenty to see and do.This was the season end meeting with lots of championship titles up for grabs including all the PRO classes so the racing was excellent (as usual). The NHRA safety safari crews do a great job of preparing and looking after the track and any downtime due to incidents is kept to a minimum.We were lucky enough to get to use the Top Eliminator Club for 2 of the 3 days. These are tickets that include parking by the pit area with access on to the Arrow Highway; seats right by the staging area so that you can see the crews setting up the cars and the burnouts; the seats are angled so you get a better view of the track; and you have access to the hospitality area which includes complimentary lunch and soft drinks all day and separate restrooms. The lunch was awesome and there are screens in the facility so you don't miss any of the action on track.WARNING: As other reviewers have mentioned please take good quality ear protection - ideally something that covers the full ear as that leaves your hands free to take pics. We managed with the small sponge earplugs and our hands over our ears but that is not ideal. You can feel the shockwave when the nitro cars race and without protection it would definitely harm your hearing!If you need any more info about drag racing go to NHRA.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAtsill
50,Drag racing at it's best,"If you like cars, you owe yourself a trip to a modern-day professional drag strip. Watching 10,000 plus horsepower racing cars going at 300+ miles an hour is a sight you'll never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,NHRA Nitro Racing,"The best experience in your life. If you have never been to a NHRA event, it is a must do on your bucket list! The Fast cars, the smell of Nitro and the rumbling sound of the cars hitting 330 miles an hour in under 4 seconds, simply the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonGon58
50,This Isn't Rue Paul's Drag Race!,"The NHRA (National Hot Rod Association) hosts the first drag race of the season in late January at Pomona Raceway called WinterNationals and also the last race of the season in mid-November, the NHRA Finals. We attended our first drag race, the WinterNationals and had a lot of fun! Although morning races were delayed by rain, that didn't dampen the spirits of the race fans that I saw, although it's likely that it kept a larger crowd away. We spent $30 and bought Pit Parking, which was very close the events' entrance; otherwise we would have had to hike through a bunch of rain puddles in the much larger parking lot. It was interesting to watch the pit crews work; the pits are not on the tracks, they're behind the tracks where the food trucks are located. Although I'm new at this sport, our friends pointed out some of the drivers to us, and many were right there with their crews. This is a lot more than one would see at the typical IndyCar races. Once the rain let up and the track dried, the races began. I will warn you. YOU MUST PROTECT YOUR HEARING WITH GOOD EAR PLUGS! We had good ear plugs, but would have been better off if we had bought the kind that look like the big earphones that cover the whole ear, which are sold at the racetrack and from places like Home Depot, from what our friends said. Even with good ear plugs, I had to cover my ears with my hands, because the deafening noise of the cars was painful otherwise. All in all, it was a fun day. A couple of guys from Texas in front of us have been fans for a long time, so they schooled us a bit on what was going on, which was very nice and helpful for them to do. Our seats at the track were near the start, and I appreciated the nearby big screen showing us how each race ended. I greatly appreciated being allowed to take in outside food, except for alcohol. Who allows that anymore? Bringing our own lunch saved us a lot of money, that's for sure. Would I go again? Boy howdy, I would!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patty49er
40,Great day at the races!,"Auto Club Raceway at Pomona is located at the Fairplex. We decided at the last minute to attend Winternationals (4th visit for my husband...his favorite venue for drag racing because of the generally nice weather and layout of the track and grounds). We decided on lodging at San Dimas, as some of the lodging very close by was already booked up or else pretty pricey. (See separate review of Red Roof Inn Fairplex, San Dimas...we were well pleased and would stay again) There's plenty of parking, good variety of food choices which are tasty but expensive! and always a good car show in the pits. Nitro Alley is fun, with the typical assortment of merchandise for sale, but I also noticed quite a few displays and games to engage the race fan, and of course it is fun to see the pit crews at work. This venue advertises ""Every ticket a pit pass!""Our one beef was that the mass exodus after the races ended on Sunday was not well organized. There was no one directing traffic, or if there was, we didn't see them and they weren't in control. Actually, even going in, the parking attendants weren't really directing traffic but mostly just standing around. If we go again, we'll just take our time at the track before walking to the parking lot. We'll get some food, use the restroom, take a look around the exhibits and pits for a while. There is a ""tailgate"" parking lot, and it might be well worth the extra cost; or, just pack a cooler in the trunk or purchase food at the track and plan on eating supper in your car to give the parking lot a little time to clear out.We heard a couple of complaints that they were really cracking down and checking disabled parking tags. We spoke to one disabled vet who said he didn't mind being checked, because they were having trouble with people (kids mostly) who were trying to park in disabled parking using grandpa's parking permit.It is permissable to bring in bottled water in a backpack or small bag. I don't know if you can bring in snacks or food and was unable to locate any policy about that. Take sunscreen, earplugs or earphones (if you've never been...it is LOUD!!!), a hat or cap, and maybe a stadium seat. Wear comfortable shoes! Hubby says it is worth considering renting the headphones that allow you to hear the track commentary.One of the review questions is whether this attraction requires advance planning, reservations, etc. While there were plenty of empty seats on the day we attended, it is advisable to plan ahead. The pit side seats closer to the starting line tend to be preferable. We like to sit about midway up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misspWestSlope_CO
50,Amazing place to see in City of Pomona,"If you are a car racing lover, this is the place to go and enjoy with the family and friends and have fun, fun and fun. You will not regret to come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rztravels
50,Fantastic Entertainment!,You can attend 1 day or multi-day. We bought tickets online but there are booths at the gate. There is a display of old cars called 'Hot Rod junction' that is very interesting. You are able to walk about the pits and talk to mechanics and drivers anytime. There is an area of vendors with all kinds of automotive displays and concessions. You can bring in a backpack with water and snacks. Bring / buy a cushion as the alu seats get hard! There are permanent restrooms under the stands and lots of plastic box ones everywhere else. The race action goes all day long with different classes. Bring ear protection! General parking is $12 - handicap parking is available also. Tail gate and upgraded parking is also an option.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reginalds842

50,Best track I've ever visited,"I attended the NHRA Winternationals for the 2nd year in a row and plan to make it a yearly tradition. Pomona is the nicest drag strip I have ever seen, hands down! It is very clean, the staff are very helpful and friendly. The food is unbelievable for a race track and they have the best margaritas! They clean and maintain the bathrooms all day long. I cannot say enough good things about this track (and this event)! I HIGHLY recommend it for all fans of drag racing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286edc
40,drags,"Since the days of Big Daddy Garlitz and Cha Cha Muldowney, Pomona has attracted the biggest names and the fastest cars. It is one of the best venues in the country for the fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikek794
50,An excellent place to view dragracing,I have been attending NHRA drag races for 20 plus years. This was the first time I attended the finals at Auto Club Raceway at Pomona and I was thoroughly impressed. The venue is easy to find with ample parking and a well organized staff. sight lines are excellent for taking pictures and you are very close to the action. I would recommend that any racing fan or even a first timer make the trip to Pomona.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregS963
50,Wow! Was worth the detour,"My husband and I had the most awesome time, was great to see and experience, we made sure we arrived early from Australia just to see the finals. Although there were a few rain delays it didn't spoil our day and man were those things loud! Glad I packed my ear plugs, was a great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/537teganf
50,Superb Place For Drag Racing and Also for Viewing Pomona Auto Club Raceway,We were impressed by the racetrack and viewing stands at Auto Club Raceway at Pomona. It is a great place for drag racing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,"If you like drag racing, you'll love this place!","We've been attending the NHRA finals every November for several years. We enjoy rooting for our favorite drivers (John Force in particular). You can walk past the pits where the cars are rebuilt and see the crew and sometimes the race car drivers. There are lots of food booths to choose from but don't expect too much in the way of healthy items. Overall, it's a great place to spend a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyE918
50,Simply the Best,"This is the best drag strip on the schedule. A real old school feel at the racetrack. Pits are spacious for viewing the cars and crew members. The seating are bleacher style seats, but they seem a lot closer than other tracks I have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
50,Best Drag Race in the Country,This was my second trip to the Pomona Winter Nats. This is the oldest track in the USA . I've been to many NHRA events around the country . Pomona puts on the best show of them all . The pits have lots of room to walk around and watch the crews at work . I was in the Top Eliminator Club . They feed you a hot lunch Sat-Sun . The seating is great . The food was good and service was better. If your going to attend one NHRA race this is the place to do it . Lots to do around that area for car people . The season opener and closer are at this track .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chevyns
50,HOT CARS!,So many different models. I liked the written histories of the vehicles along with the history of the drivers. The dragsters were the most fascinating. You have to wonder how anyone could even drive some of them--they are s-o-o-o-o long. Nothing no to like if you like looking at race cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldfolks51
40,Super-FAN-tastic,"NHRA Drag racing was awesome!! Parking safe & secure. Food good but NOT worth the PRICES!!! Be prepared for ALOT of walking!! Go early, pack an ice chest and tailgate your lunch. It sure was beautiful weather!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglerockGertie
50,Great Races!!!,"Secure parking, Good food and seats. On the downside, it's a long walk, from parking to gate, and they've cut back on the shuttle rides for disabled people, but I would recommend going there, for any races",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigm917
50,One of the best races of the year,Came to watch my friend take home the World Title in NHRA Top Fuel Funny Car. He did as expected. I will be back to see the beginning of the 2015 Mello Yellow series.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winecountrylovers
50,World Finals - WORLD CLASS - Mark your Calendar,"Well having been a fan of drag racing since 67 I am speaking from a most likely biased opinion. But it my opinion and looking at the size of the crowds I think it is shared a lot. The Top Fuel and Funny Car classes are blow your socks off full body experiences of the energy waves that these professional racers and crew tune and drive that are so world class it must be seen up close and personal to understand. I have said many times, you must go once live, and you will know if you want to go again. Live and TV is like AM radio and live opera, No Comparison. The pits are accessible to all who come, and it is so nice to be able to really meet people, really see what these racers and mechanics do right up close!When in the stands Front row is good and top row is good. Test them both as once you are in the stands you can roam a bit, very easily.The midway has so many things it can consume hours. Meet and greet with people of all classes of racing, Too much fun. Free stuff from vendors - cool. Autographed pictures (come early)On the subject of parking. Just get the cheap parking. It takes a while to get in and out, so chat with friends and flow with it. we were in in about 10 minutes and out in about thirty, so the way i see it that is excellent when you consider the number of people wanting in and out. For comparison, dodger stadium or Hollywood bowl are a lot tougher to deal with. Be patient and relish the fabulous event.Also - For rookies - Come on Friday or Saturday for Qualifying smaller crowds and more Nitro runs as they fight it out for the top 16 positions.Remember ear plus, sun hats, coat for later as the sun sets (and to sit on for padding earlier) and the Nitro flames come blasting out at sunset. Stay for the last runs of the day - The very best as the sun goes over the horizon - bring some pocket snacks - and bring a good attitude and patience. It is so worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
50,"Fun, fun, Fun!","Great Times, Come hungry, great food, restrooms R clean, bleachers are great. Fun for all ages!Tip: Bring a thick blanket to sit on and one to keep you warm on cool evenings.You can bring your cooler with food & drinks. However make sure their is NO Glass bottles water etc.Enjoy and have a Great Time.Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WSJSS
