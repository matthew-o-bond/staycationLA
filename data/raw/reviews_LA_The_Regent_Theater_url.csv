50,The Stranglers play The Regent LA.,"Good smaller venue to watch the band. Security straight forward. No hassle all night. Good view of stage & sound great. Great gig.The really really annoying thing was that because we travelled from the UK, the Regent wouldn't sell us tickets because we came from Europe. Yes really. Had to find a local to make the purchase on our behalf.Spaeland / Ticketfly just were completely un-interested in sorting this out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanRound
10,They threw an audience member who was just SCALPED into the crowd.,So at the Vio-Lence show an audience member who was stage diving got his/her caught in the guitar players headstock resulting in an accidental scalping. Yes I am aware the audience member was breaking the rules however security still need to do their job and if an audience member receives an injury they must act. The security guards thought the best course of action was to throw the person into the crowd. This person had just been scalped which is very seriously they may become semi-conscious or be bleeding out. Security didn't check for any of this before making their decision to throw them into the crowd (a decision which shouldn't have been made regardless of the scalping or not). The security guards should have detained the audience member and checked the extent of their injuries and then removing them or contacting an ambulance. Their security guards are clearly untrained and dangerous to be left in charge of a crowd as they clearly had no control and no common sense either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJFlyingV
10,Kicked Out for Complying with Rules LOL,"Hi Regent!Last night my friends and I were rather excited to go see Kero Kero Bonito, but were kicked out by your venue.Why, you ask? Let's start at the beginning.In the process of being patted down, I was first inappropriately searched by way of squeezing my breasts from behind, by an incredible aggressive woman on your security team.When she patted me down, she took out my vape from my pocket and said I couldn't bring this inside the venue. I obliged, but said that I needed to grab another member of my party in order to walk back to my car and put said vape into it. Now, I have ZERO issues with whatever policy the regent wants to enforce on outside tobacco and marijuana vape practices, but when my boyfriend was let in SECONDS prior with the SAME exact vape, and when I want to COOPERATE and take my vape back to the car so that I won't disrupt whatever power trip she was on, I get kicked. His security detail even asked what FLAVOR his was.I signaled over to my friend to come and said, ""hey, we have to go take this back to the car, otherwise I wont be let in."" which at that point, the woman interrupts my conversation, points in my face, and says, "" YOU have to go, not WE.""To which I look her in the eye and say, ""I am going to take this back to my car, but please don't talk to me like I am challenging you or acting drunk or crazy. I demand your respect."" To which she then SNATCHES my vape out of my hand and throws it away. ???then says YOU ARE OUT. YOU ARE KICKED OUT. I TRIED TO BE NICE, BUT YOU WERE A B****.Funny how I am the person who didn't raise their voice ONCE and was COMPLYING with the security guards instructions.Helpful and courteous security tactics, Regent. Your ticketholders must feel safe knowing that at any moment they could be kicked out by simply complying with your guidelines or by questioning your bouncers' authority.Is this the way you handle your security? Are you proud of the way this situation resolved itself? I am a grown a** woman, and I was kicked out of a venue because your staff was on a power trip.Don't get me wrong, the two individuals I am writing about were both inside, on the left, and were named Kimberly and Ann if I am not mistaken.The gentlemen outside checking tickets and keeping line decorum were very respectful and level headed, and it was disgusting to see the way those women inside behaved.The 5 of us want a refund for our tickets, and you can rest assured that i will raise hell until this is addressed.In my 4 years going to the regent I have seen staff behave inappropriately, but I have also known them to keep decorum at the very least. Tonight was a disgrace.Last night was not this way. My name is Lynora Valdez and my email is acucumberisafruit@gmail.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambassador687178
50,Combichrist!,I love this place and the location. Orange Country sucks! So glad to get back to a real life location. Parking near by. I love the sloping floor so that you can see from everywhere. Was just a great evening. Enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorgenw79
40,"It was built, they came. Everything old is new again...","On the particular night of my visit, I couldn’t get a feeling about the (history of the) theatre…it was dark by the time we ate next door and got inside and I was excited to see The Mavericks. Worth researching, this venue hosts a great variety of musical and performance artists. The basic ticket price is most likely what the band gets, but be prepared to pay surcharges and fees when you buy your ticket, which most likely is the theater’s take for providing a venue and ticketing service. It’s the way of the world. Note, Downtown Los Angeles is FULL of theaters that are no longer used, sitting mostly vacant, save for old storefronts that became the hub of the jewelry and electronics exchanges. Some are used for one-off concerts or even filming locations for movies and television. After the hey-days, when old L.A. grew from its sleepy beginnings and became new and glamorous with tall buildings and glitzy theaters, it’s a wonder now anyone asks themselves, What was it like back then? Well, the Regent is a glimpse. Now, it’s a simple, fairly small venue…no chairs, no glitz, just SRO on the gradient floor. There were probably 400 people there; I’d be surprised if it were more. If there were chairs, it would not seat enough people to make a go of it—and keep the price of the ticket affordable to the masses. There was an upper deck of sorts, accessible by stairs. There was some seating in that area but appeared to be mostly bar stools and cocktail tables. It didn’t seem to be a private party but who knows; I got the feeling it was open to everyone but it may depend on who is playing. It was a great show but to stand at a slight slant for the duration was a challenge. The restrooms were clean enough. The Mavericks are worth seeing so it was worth seeing them in an “old Hollywood” theater; it was their only L.A. area so the Regent was it. Prufrock Pizza is next door if you are hungry before a show but if you are there just for a show, get in and get out…lots of homeless and panhandlers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
40,Intimate venue and good accoustics,"I was there for the band Mashrou Leila. I have never been to this theater in DTLA. First, there is a parking lot across the street but if you come late, it will be full. A short distance away, there is a huge lot but it was closed for shooting crews. We had to go a few blocks further and we found a parking that charged us 11$ flat fee. It would be difficult to get to the theater by metro: you’d have to walk. Getting inside was easy. They will ask for IDs and give you bracelets acc. to age. That’s because inside they serve alcohol. Beers are 7-8$ and wine 10$. The venue has a slanting floor which allows you to see from anywhere especially if you are short like me. There is also a balcony. I was able, thanks to my short stature, to make my way to the front. Acoustics were good. Since the venue is small artists can really interact with audience. That night, didn’t have or witnessed any problems. No problem also walking back to the car although there are a lot of homeless people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanancha
50,Great small theater!!,"The Regent Theater is a great small theater!! We went to ""The Moth"" there last night, and had a great time. An older brick building in downtown Los Angeles. Great place.Prufrock Pizza was next door, and we were able to take food in with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
