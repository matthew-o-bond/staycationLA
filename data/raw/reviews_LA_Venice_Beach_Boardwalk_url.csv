30,Great for a walk.,"We walked along the Boardwalk as its one of California's most iconic sites and a perfect way to get up to Santa Monica.I was shocked by the number of homeless people, the number of street vendors trying to force sell CD;s and the groups of people trying to get you to donate money to make the Boardwalk a better place. It simply didn't all fit together.Some of the shops and artists along here are great, some really good paintings, prints and alike but also a lot of 'branded' t-shirts and hoodies for sale at every other stand.If you like this kind of thing then its 100% worth a visit and, to be fair if you dont it is still 100% worth the visit. Stop off at one of the coffee shops along the way, get a coffee and watch the world go by before heading up the coast to Santa Monica.",Christopher
30,Take a walk on the boardwalk,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk is a hip place to visit at any time of day. You have the beachgoers, outdoor people, and those that are just plain interesting. It's well worth a visit to grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants and browse the interesting stores.",Bx2L
40,Yes. Visit the Boardwalk. It's Southern California at it's Most Unique,"There was a time when the boardwalk was gritty. Venice did not have a great reputation when I moved to Southern California in the late '70's. But now all that has changed. Locals complain that gentrification and sky-high real estate prices have polished Venice into an almost unrecognizable reflection of its former self. For me, returning as a tourist many years after leaving Southern California, I found the Boardwalk to be an often quirky and engaging (but perhaps a touch too safe) slice of SoCal greatness. Find parking then simply budget an hour or two to stroll the boardwalk, put your feet in the sand, grab a bite and soak up LA's many flavors and characters.",MrGaucho1987
30,Smell the dope,"As you walk past endless tattoo places, homeless people, T-shirt shops, CBD emporiums, painted mini-surfboards and admire the beautiful beach and water. Lots of images of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, etc. on display at the various vendors to remind you of.....",cgny1fwd
40,Good place to watch street performers,"On a beautiful day you can stroll along watching the tumblers, musicians and skate boarders performing.Only problem is parking in the area",lbrb97
50,Vibrant,Visited here with my partner as part of a tour. Got to see muscle beach and just enjoyed this vibrant place,shagron
20,Check it off and leave,"We were visiting LA for the first time so I felt that Venice Beach was a necessity. I'd say the same almost anyone going to LA for the first time. Muscle Beach, the view out on the ocean, the shops. Cool for about 5 minutes. Then come the ""musicians"" selling CD's for donations. The homeless, the smell.... Like I said, was cool for a bit, then time to go.",Cdn927
40,Lot to see,"There is so much to see as you walk along the Boardwalk all sorts of shops and people. Everyone seems to be busy going somewhere either on foot; walking or running but you also see some on skateboards, bikes and even roller blades. It was areal experience and an eye opener too. Easy for people to walk along and suitable for all ages",holiday-view23-7-11
40,A Stroll,The Boardwalk is an interesting place to stroll where people from all income brackets mingle. It’s a colourful experience with many small stalls on one side and tourist shops and cafés on the other. Arrive early and park next to the beach for $9.,BT3rd
40,Interesting experience,"I can say I went, but don't know that I'll be back. I loved seeing the artists along the boardwalk and the beach was beautiful. It was crowded.",Mattie J
10,Yuck!,"This boardwalk attraction is not at all attractive. The beach looks beautiful, but the shops are tacky and often look disgusting. We felt uncomfortable in the area and did not choose to enter any of the establishments.",Maryann R.
40,"Rented bikes at Santa Monica pier and rode to Marina del Ray ,,,,",Stopped at Venice Beach to people watch and walk the CanalsWas a bit surprised by its cheesey beach vibe.... saw many restaurant possibilites and some shopping but really came to do the Canal Walk,caminorey
50,Grand morning stroll over a mile,"We enjoyed a splendid morning stroll of over a mile along the promenade. Delightful in the clear blue-sky sunshine.It fully lived up its image, with shop-fronts, stalls and entertainers of many kinds. One that took our attention was a grand piano that had evidently been towed to the beachfront and the player was busy tuning up before his recital.Murals were another highlight. A fine one of Arnie shows him displaying his body-building prowess. Another portrait was of LA favourite Jim Morrison of Doors renown who spent many years in the area.",permia
50,Interesting Art and people,Lots of great boardwalk art vendors as you travel between Venice Beach Pier and Santa Monica Pier. I started on the South end and walked (rented a Bird scooter also) to Santa Monica Pier. The South end is where you see more homeless people but they don’t really bother you and the Souvenirs are less $ than when you get towards Santa Monica. There is a lot of dog poop on the Venice Pier so watch your step. You can see surfers catching smaller waves there.I rented a Bird scooter a few times to zip past the stretches of residential area. The scooters are easy to find but I found out after my Bird scooter stopped working that you’re not allowed to use them on the beach boardwalk. You have to use the Speedway alley 1 block West of the beach.If you’re a dog lover there’s a cool artist about halfway along the boardwalk (IG: linnysart) that makes art from recycled pop cans. I got one made of my dog and it’s awesome. Really nice lady.There’s also another cool artist I bought a mushroom print from (IG: 2storeycory). His dog Daisy rides a skateboard.I enjoyed the southern end of the boardwalk more than the north “ritzier” end where the boardwalk has crushed sea shells embedded in the cement.,Ken
20,Nice Beach but dirty area otherwise,The beach is nice but the area is very dirty and overwhelmed with homeless. Not worth visiting in my opinion. You can find street parking a few blocks away.,Robert K
50,Must Do,"This iconic boardwalk is very famous, and quite neat to stroll along. You can also rent electric scooters or bikes (including tandem bikes).",Mark42139
10,From Australia and Venice Beach was our first stop.,Venice Beach and Boardwalk would be so beautiful and culture filled if it wasn’t for all the homeless people. Broke my heart that the Government can allow this. For tourists the problems of drug addiction and mental health are shown to not be taken care of. We were harassed for money. We would of liked to of sat down and relaxed after our flight but the seated areas were surrounded by homeless and were filthy. Wouldn’t recommend to my Family and Friends.,Kim T
50,Great place to visit,"One of the coolest place on the CA coast with so much to do. The boardwalk has a lot of shops and food and the beach, who could ask for more. Worth checking out when in the area.",GixxerWoody
30,Fun to shop,"I really enjoyed the boardwalk but once again they are false advertising because it would not ever look as it does in the picture or pictures. The homeless have managed to take over the streets, beaches, sidewalks, and they have the audacity to think that eliminating straws is the key? As their pollution thickens the creators of plastic have actually made them to disintegrate faster. From 450 years to mere days. Meanwhile your homelessness is a crisis situation!",JerriVice
30,Interesting,Definitely wanted to check this out during our SoCal trip. Interesting mix of people and things to do. The ocean views are amazing. We were there on Christmas Day and there were lots of people. Can’t imagine what it would be like any other day. We didn’t purchase anything there but it was cool to say we were there and saw the sign.,Jspsihota
30,Venice Sign,"The only reason we went there was to have a picture taken with the VENICE sign. Other than that, the place was expensive, way too crowded and nothing to rave about.",NoinahJaeb
50,Very Lively Area and Great Sunsets,"Venice beach is a must see tourist attraction. Our favorite area is from Venice beach boardwalk to the Santa Monica Pier. We really enjoyed watching the skilled skateboarders at the skateboard park. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, shops, kiosk stores and souvenir shops all along the area. Venice beach is a great place to go for a walk and experience the lively area.",Lucky L
40,Nice walk with strong smell of weed,Great place to visit and relax. However you can smell strong weed perfume everywhere. No judgement on that but it is really everywhere.,Lovegoodfoodgoodwine
10,The best bit was leaving,"What an absolute dump! We walked from Santa Monica beach to Venice beach. We were continually harassed by the massive homeless section that covers the walk, the amount of cannabis shops is frightening and there were police dismantling homeless tents whilst being abused! It does not feel safe and our plans to eat there were disbanded.",Daveygrohl
30,People watching,"A great place to people watch, with interesting shops and stalls.Beach was quite amazing. Worth a visit",RichardN28
50,Perfect place to inhale - the scent of the ocean and not only :-),"I like Venice Beach Boardwalk. It is always full of weird people, talented ones and those who only think they do have talents. But it is always colorful, joyfull and interesting to watch. Some nice houses, wide beach, a few places to eat and drink (nothing extraordinary, regular beach food), this atmosphere of never ending vacation, people who dance and sing. Just a perfect place to enjoy your free time. You can run, bike, go on a board or just have a seat and observe others. They also have little arts market, where you can sometime find something of your interest (however do not expect PIcasso there). And when tired,you can always visit dr. Kush for come inhalation! :-)",786malgorzatac
50,Romantic and bohemic,"I loved the beach, the boardwalk and the Venice Canal. Be aware of car theft ! In the last 5 years, the vandalism increase because of drug crisis.",ViorikaMontreal
10,There are much better beaches to visit,Would not return and felt the need to share my opinion with others. California has such beautiful beaches but this is not one of them. Santa Monica which is nearby is much better and Huntington is amazing.,_elaine_
10,Not like the movies,"We walked from Santa Monica pier, lovely walk until you hit the start of Venice beach board walk. Straight away I felt so uneasy with many unsavoury looking people watching you and trying to sell you crap. The plan was to stop and have lunch, we could have got the munchies from inhaling second hand cannabis smoke, but alas turned straight around and walked back to Santa Monica. Massive let down, unsafe, dirty and nothing like the movies.",Boi80
50,a mini vacation,Stayed in Marina Del Ray just 10 mins from Venice Beach. Venice Beach is the perfect place for people watching. We had lunch at the fig cafe and had the fish tacos which were an excellent choice of 3 different fish tacos then walked most of the boardwalk and were entertained by all the different people along the boardwalk with more things for sale than you can imagine,John N
40,visit for once especially in sun set on the beach,Boardwalk with shops but are my kind of shops the arts there not for a show it is for sale walking before dark it is preferred as it scary and not safe.the sunset is marvelous on the beach.,AKARRR
40,Need to See Once,"Walking along the boardwalk you see interesting shops, athletic endevours and street performers. It is definitely a place to experience at least once.",mark2016-57
50,One of a kind,"No visit to L.A. is complete until you've had a chance to stroll the world's famous Venice Beach Boardwalk. Home to palm and rarest readers, sand sculptors, street performers and artists, street hustlers and body builders. It is one of the best places in Los Angeles for people watching.",Russ Lacuata
10,Grim,"This place was grim - no need to visit unless of course you need to purchase cannabis. It was a bit scary, we felt unsafe and were hassled within a minute of arriving at the beach. The only positive was that they were filming NCIS on one of the side streets, which was interesting. I certainly wouldn’t take my family back there. Not how we imagined.",itsnotaboutthemoney
50,Not to be missed,"We paid $10 to park and my wife and I walked along the boardwalk for a few hours. Lots of street vendors and shops, along with a few restaurants. Lots of 'interesting' people and a great place to rent a bike or take a nice walk.",Gregsky
50,Bohemian heaven,I love venice beach..the intermingaling of the wealthy..hippies...artists...homeless folks ..musiciansI love the freedom vibe here and am saddened that big Corp businesses are trying to push away the locals...but its colorful and its excellent for people watching ..just watch out for touts,revsooz
40,Good walk!,"Venice beach stretches for miles all the way to Santa Monica Pier. Theres lots to see - The Skate Park, Muscle beach, lots of shops and stalls. The beach itself is beautiful, but the water is surprisingly cold!",WCookie
40,Interesting Place,"I walked all the way from Santa Monica Pier to the end of Venice Beach Boardwalk. Venice beach is quite interesting for people watching. There are a lot of independent shops, street art vendors and some food stalls. There are also many gift shops selling souvenirs and t-shirts with funny designs. Towards the end, there is also the famous muscle beach. All in all, an interesting and different place to visit.",Karim Maarouf
30,Dirty,"The Boardwalk is dirty with so many homeless living there. The food prices were pretty expensive. Paid $6 for a small scoop of ice cream. Loved people watching though...so many interesting characters. Great photo ops, nice too see once, but no desire to return.",MamaP73
40,Lazy Sunday afternoon,The cosmopolitan ambiance of this walk is unique and entertaining. A wide variety of people all living their lives as they want.,Tony S
50,Always fun!,My hubby and I often go down to the Boardwalk for a stroll and sometimes lunch... we try to go during the week as weekends are so busy but still fun... lots of vendors selling mostly handmade items... paintings gadgets Knick knacks jewelry...fun to look at even if you don’t buy... stop for lunch and glass of wine and listen to street musicians who are really wonderful! Lots of delicious restaurants and walk up windows... on a side street fab fab English chips (French fries) also a fav restaurant is Fig Tree...organic I think... very very good...,Trudi G
50,"Sun, sand, surf",Lots of the boardwalk is residential homes and parts are with shops and restaurants. Not like a typical boardwalk in the sense it is mostly made of concrete sidewalks. Fun to people watch or gaze at the ocean. Parking can be expensive. People watching is fun with all types of interesting characters.,Norjeff2
30,It lives on its reputation,"I recently visited Venice Beach broad walk to accompany my wife who insisted on walking there from Santa Monica. Having ridden past it on rides along the excellent Los Angeles bike way I couldn’t let her go alone. It’s immediately obvious when one passes from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Venice beac itself and is ok, as indeed is the suburb of Venice, but the board walk is dirty and rundown. It has a reputation which reflects a period long gone. It’s now a home to the homeless and hawkers selling overpriced crap and providing nothing of interest to travellers.Venice Beach today is a poor representation of the the image forged in the 70s",Whitefox100
40,Do it just to do it,"I would recommend you do it just to see what the Venice boardwalk is when people talk about it. However, avoid the shops and don't get roped in to any street vendors/performers.If you want to enjoy the beach views and a nice bike ride there is a great bike path.",constantlymoving
50,Good place to go!,"This was a great place for us to go visit today. We had a two-year-old triplets that were nine years old a 16-year-old and two moms in our group. We felt pretty safe there’s a lot to do regarding pickle ball, basketball, racquetball, skateboarding, lots of fun shopping that was pretty inexpensive and it was a beautiful day all around! Get there early for good parking and stay all day for $18! The one thing I didn’t like was how it smelled like weed and there was quite a bit of trash on the ground. Other than that it was a beautiful place to go!",Amy H
30,Bizarre,"Walking along those beautiful beaches is an experience. The surroundings are not what we expected or imagined. A pity to see lots of homeless,drug addicts, strange performers,and an assortment of non-interesting stores along the shore.",Laurie Dargent
50,oh what a time but bring a hat,Fun time just walking and looking at people and sights. The sun was hot but on occasion came a breeze from the water. Nice people everywhere. Great fun just to people watch.,Rosa B
30,"Everything, yet nothing?",The boardwalk is a great walk from Venice to Santa Monica but I would do the Santa Monica part over the Venice section if I did it again. Since I visited two years ago it has become a lot dirtier and hasn’t been well maintained at all. If you’re going to do it I recommend biking over walking as the bike path is a lot cleaner and on the beach side!,Georgia R
50,Little bit of everything!,Awesome board walk with lots of novelty store and street food! It’s heaven on a Saturday! Every walk of life can be found at this beach! Very exciting place indeed! Everybody was just having fun and it was great! I spent all day there!!,Buttacup_k
30,"Lots of Interesting Sights, but Not my Favorite","We spent an afternoon doing Santa Monica and Venice Beach. It was nice to see once, but it was not the highlight of my trip. There are a lot of art vendors and unique shops along the boardwalk, but lots of homeless mixed in. The skate park was cool to watch for a little while. The area is kind of dirty, so this is not a good place to spend time on the beach. If you are looking for the beach, skip Venice, but the boardwalk is interesting for some.",EaglesFan27
50,Great walk and must see,"One of the best boardwalks with good vibes and nice scenery, good food just in meters away from main entrance to Venice beach, surfers will definitely enjoy the place",M1 traveler
10,Disgusting,"My wife and I visited on the morning of Labour Day. This area, whilst having quirky shops and street vendors, is full of homeless and predominantly dirty people and accumulated trash. As pensioners we felt quite unsafe. Nothing is cheap, private parking areas near the Boardwalk charge premium prices to park and often for only 3 hours, which for us was 2Hours 30 minutes too long! Two small bottles of water from a mini market cost $7, which you would normally pay less than $1 dollar each for in a reputable supermarket. I would hate to think what this place is like at night, because we were approached by far too many characters who clearly had mental stability problems.",Reacher33
40,Interesting enough for a walk,Lots of shops restaurants and things to look at. Great if you like people watching. Tons of souvenir options if you are interested and restaurants with patio seating. There's a lot of interesting looking people to say the least.,westcoast778
40,As edgy as it can get,Great place for people watching and getting the artsy edgy vibe of Venice.It gets really dark and dodgy there after 8pm so I wouldn't recommend to walk there alone that time.,Maja Rogalska
20,Don’t visit at night,"Super scary to visit at night. My 12 year old and I wanted to walk on the pier at night, big mistake. We felt like we might be mugged at any minute. A lot of homeless people and questionable people. We think we saw a drug deal. Goodness. Be warned.",Rayne E
20,Really dissapointing,"Being from NY I expected a cleaner act. What I found was a messy, dirty, touristy trap like atmosphere with extremely ugly businesses, surroundings and people. Two good things; the beach is pretty, very wide and in good shape and there is a huge police presence, which in itself should tell you something. The boardwalk itself is crowded and uninviting. Glad I visited because it gave me a better perspective of what I left back home. Parking could be a problem or be costly even by NY standards.",AJS-NY
50,Iconic “must-do” for Los Angeles trip,This location is iconic for a reason. A visit to Los Angeles would not be complete without visiting at least once. Plenty is cheesy shops and places to grab a bite or souvenirs. The weight lifting compound is closed right now and undergoing long-needed renovations. (We visited in August ). Be sure to check the incredible skate boarding talent and the basketball court at the south end of ten strip. Parking is usually very difficult to find.,Aldo B
30,Not impressed,You have to do the boardwalk. But it was not that impressive. Way too many vendors selling the same thing. Too many bums.,J P
10,Touristic and sad,Lots of life-challenged people lying on the sidewalks and other behaving erratically and staggering around on the boardwalk among hordes of tourists.,HannaBragberg
40,Great for Instagram pics!,"The beach is beautiful, there’s no denying that, it’s so clean and picturesque. We cycled from the pier down to Venice which was nice. The iconic Venice sign is great for an Insta, doing it for the gram pic, but the rest of it seemed to be like Camden (uk) but by the see, not that I dislike Camden, but we didn’t fly 5000 miles for that. All in all just a tad overrated, which is a shame.",OurWorldMyOyster
50,I always enjoy Venice when in LA,"Most times I'm in LA, I go to Venice Beach. There are always people there, someone doing some kind of show, a basketball game going on and people working out. Basically, Venice Beach Boardwalk is a great people watching spot!The last time I was there (June 2019), I stopped by to see my incense man. I've been buying my incense from him for at least the last 10 years. His name is Moussa and during this trip, I found out he is going home to Senegal. I am super bummed about this, but Moussa assured me the incense will still be there once he's not.Someone in the group grabbed some kettle corn (delicious! Mad I didn't get my own bag), and I usually hit this ice cream spot when I'm there as well.I think that's what I like most about this place -- it really hasn't changed much since I've been going there. I see the same people selling the same things, and that's a good thing (In my opinion).If you want a quiet beach, this is not the spot for you!",LiveInTheMoment75
20,Pretty gross,"My friend and I walked along the boardwalk for a little bit, but I found it to be a very seedy and grimy place. Lots of cliche tourist shops, lots of trash, and a fair amount of homeless people. It was cool to see it after hearing so much about it, but really worth a short visit. I spent most of my time at the skate park honestly.",hmill42894
20,Disapointing...,"I had visited Venice Boardwalk in the past and enjoyed it for what it is, a quirky, crazy, colorful, all inclusive place but... this time, the amount of homeless people was overwhelming!!! Camping on the sand, sidewalks, everywhere, saw a guy with a huge knife in his hand sitting on the grass, surrounding by people, children, scary stuff! Dirt, garbage everywhere, smell of pee everywhere, the public bathrooms were disgusting!!! Not welcoming feeling anymore, did not feel safe walking around, sad.",joinville
40,Very nice walk or bike,Venice beach boardwalk is very vibrant with lots of shops and artists. You might be able to watch some performers over the weekend. Lots of souvenirs and gift shops too. A must visit .,mariana48
20,Grimey..,"People touting, masses of litter, numerous bad smells, homeless shouting at each other, human waste, tat shops, need I go on?",jonny5678
10,An excellent place to visit if you like the smell of urine/weed/body odour,"Ah, the film/media industry, what a wonderful job you've done convincing the unsuspecting tourist that Venice beach boardwalk is a wonderful place to visit. I would recommend you only come here if you enjoy the smell of urine, weed and other people's bodily odour. As for the shopping experience, you can certainly buy a wide range of complete tat if you are that way inclined.",James W
10,So gross,"It's hard to describe how terrible this place is now. Once a gem to spend the day walking around, people watching. Is now like a dystopian city. It's not only dirty, but it also smells of urine, body odor and pot. There is nothing but junk to buy at the stores that used to sell interesting art and handmade jewelry and other bohemian style stuff. We literally saw a group of high/drunk dancing locals dancing, and making noise being mistaken for a street performance group. We also did not feel safe as there are a lot of shady characters walking around sizing you up. And I'm not talking about the homeless in the surrounding areas. That is a separate topic to what the Venice Boardwalk has become.",flaura
50,Must visit!,Took my three kids to Venice Beach and walked the boardwalk. There really isn't anywhere else in the world that has the same vibe and energy as this place. Throw in the great beach and this is a good way to spend the whole day. The boardwalk is filled with unique arts and some great stores.,EasyTravellerLam
20,Scruffy,"Our family walked the boardwalk from Venice to Santa Monica on a Saturday morning. There are a few nice shops , but generally it is a messy place, with lots of graffiti, the smell of urine and dope and lots of opportunity to hear the F word. Get a taxi direct to Santa Monica and do yourself a favour.",SB01
20,"Crowded, strong pot odors, homeless abound, what's not to like.","Venice Beach Boardwalk will always be a top tourist attraction. The people watching, proximity of sand, water, shopping, etc so that's expected. The street performers and sidewalk vendors add a bit of character most of the time. What doesn't? Well, when the boardwalk becomes so crowded that you can't walk easily trying to dodge all of the selfie-takers. When the overpowering odor that you smell on the entire strip is that of marijuana. Perhaps some folks find that aroma awesome, but, for sure, it can be quite strong and overpowering. And lastly, the homeless population abounds. Most homeless folks are on the boardwalk due to issues that you have no control over but if they have mental health issues, you don't know what they will do or are capable of doing.",PA_Denizen
40,Good beach with great people watching,"Legendary Venice beach boardwalk is a must as a tourist, you will see a variety of artists, musicians, magicians, skateboarders and ”performers” that is hard to beat anywhere else in the world.Sit down at one of the many bars/restaurants (recommend The Venice Beach Bar) and just watch.Lots of real shops selling ”everything”, but everything is overpriced.",Reijo B
40,Don’t miss the Sunday evening drum circle!,"An interesting eclectic mix of people and things to see. The Sunday eve drum circle is past the skate park, can’t miss it. Hundreds of people in a big circle enjoying it they’re own way. Feel free to ease into the circle, the beats are so powerful it’s impossible to be in there and not start moving. Felt totally safe and welcomed, no judgement zone.tThe Baiardwalk doesn’t seem safe at night, so definitely head somewhere for dinner, there are plenty of homeless and sketchy people during they day, seems like more creep out at night. Still keep your wits about you during the day.Watch great basketball skills, skaters doing tricks, you can sit at the skate park for hours watching the talent...and it’s all right on the wide wide beach. Public bathrooms are NASTY avoid at all costs.Rent bikes and ride down to Santa Monica Pier. It’s a bout a 3 mile ride, but easy and fun, some beach cafes along the bike path to eat or drink while watching people, or beach volleyball. As soon as you enter into Santa Monica, it I’d cleaner, no homeless, no sketchy shops, a brighter vibe. The park near the pier is amazing for gymnastics and the talent on the rings is amazing. Fun to run around the pier and walk through the carnival. Buy rife tickets on the pier...long wait for rides on the weekend.You could spend days and never be bored.",MACVirginia
50,Walking around artist and free spirited souls,"The vibe is a true California feeling. The people watching is worth the visit. You can buy old art , healing crystals wood beads and tons of t-shirts. Stop off at one of the bars grab a snack and watch the sunset over the ocean.",idayne
50,Wonderfully Fun Day,"There is definitely not a shortage of things to see, eat, and do on the Venice Beach Boardwalk! We loved the food-try the takis corn on the cob!!! We loved watching the skaters. But, my all time favorite activity was tandem bikes! We had 2 bikes, 2 of us on each, and we biked the whole thing. So much fun!!!",Mom2Twincesses
40,Enjoyed the experience but DO NOT visit this store!,"It’s a different experience in Venice. Lots of different types of people all along the boardwalk. Cute and cheap souvenir shops to patronize. Do not make the mistake of going to this one to browse. Owner is super rude and pressures you to buy something. He cursed at us and other customers for browsing too king. We went next door and bought something instead and watched him do it AGAIN to someone else on our way out! Muscle Beach is cool. Different apparatuses to use. The beach area is huge and not crowded. After dark, however, is disgusting. Homeless people everywhere. Poop on the boardwalk. Weed smell everywhere. Doesn’t feel safe.",Jessica
30,Nice Walk,"Parking is Difficult to get but nice walk specially if you have teenagers with you. Lots of Street Stalls , performers.",sorabh
30,Definately unique,It was cold the day and some rain so we didn't get all the crazies that it's known for. Parking is crazy. We pulled into a lot and were charged $10. When we left they were charging $15. It's dirty and very touristy. Good prices on t shirts. A place you have to see once and never go back,Loretta Veronic... L
10,What a hideous place,Was in Venice Beach several years ago and enjoyed the funky bohemian vibe. Now it is disgusting.It is amazing to see people walk by homeless people sleeping on benches...urinating in shop doirways and harassing passersby as if nothing is wrong. The idea of eating at any if the restaurants was revolting...hard to imagine they could pass a health department inspection.We had friends from NZ with us and they were appalled that these conditions are prevalent in the US. Their guide book suggested visiting Venice Beach...they wondered why. So did we.What an embarrassment.,Mirandalou
30,Definitely a touristic spot,"In Santa monica, loads of souvenier stalls/ street performers and some restaurants.Famouos skateboarding spot, park and beach.worth a visit",Sonali K
50,Still the interesting place it has always been,"Boardwalk is interesting looking at the buildings, the people, the beach, and the ocean... not to mention the Muscle beach outdoor workout area along with tennis courts, etc. Park for free in residential area around Venice Canals or even more straight forward along S Venice Beach or N Venice Beach. I parked about 3 blocks from the boardwalk on S Venice for free.",Thomas B
30,A bygone era,Like clock stopped In 1960 and nothing spent on it since. Very dingey but an eye opener for those more fortunate but I suspect occupants love the place as it has a real vibe. Glad I came and walked the broad walk. Not quite how such a beautiful location isn’t developed and left in 1960s scene.,K4kev
10,Terrible,In the 10years since I last visit it was so sad to see what’s happened. I would advise all parents NOT to take your children the smell of pot was so strong the entire boardwalk there was hundreds of homeless people I had to walk over crap 5 times I am telling myself it was dogs.I would always travel in a group never alone. And be carefully of the side streetsI got back to my hotel and feel so ill from the pot smoke my eyes also stingThere is also a lot of trip and fall hazards for every one but especially kids and the elderly and prams from the 1000s of rented and abandoned scooters and bikes they block the crosswalkYou also have to be careful on the boardwalk from the bikesScoters the fly around without care for anyone. There is abandoned houses which I don’t blame I wouldn’t even think about staying near here even where I’m staying has changed but that’s another reviewI feel Sorry for the people of Venice you have you local government to blame and all the homeless hope they get help. And ban pot in public areas not safe for every one and bit does Brian damage to an undeveloped brain of innocent kids,BRT K
50,Love Venice Beach,We came to Venice Beach to ride our bicycles along the boardwalk bike paths. They are the greatest and easy to ride. Well anyway for in May. I glimpsed someone else's review and they said bikes got in the way but maybe they were on the bike path. I found that a problem once in a while someone would be walking on the bike path and I didn't want to hit them. Many places to stop along the way for a bite to eat or a refreshing drink. We will be back.,KCinAZ
10,An absolute dump. I wouldn’t waste your time,"I have no idea why this place is famous. It’s an absolute dump of a place. Scruffy, dirty with loads of scary looking people about. You are constantly badgered by people trying to sell you things or scamming you into trying their “music CD”. We were advised not to go to this area in the evening. We heeded this advice but even in the day it felt unsafe. There were many shops selling absolute junk. This is not somewhere I’d recommend.",TheSimpsonfamily
50,We Love IT!!,"Venice beach is full of culture, everyone seems to get well with another. The place is clean the beach is clean and you can find any activity in place. We mainly enjoy watching the skaters.",LittleOasis
50,So much going on yet it remains a peaceful experience,"Laid back, beautiful, calm, and friendly. I enjoyed the boardwalk and the beach is extremely laid back. While there is so much going on, restaurants, people selling things, it still remains friendly and peaceful.",Amanda Moss
50,Always action,"The boardwalk’s supposed to be for pedestrians but bikes and scooters are always getting in the way, which is the biggest hassle. It’s still easy to wander along with thousands of others and see the many performers (don’t waste time on the timewasters, there’s always more to see). Sit on the grass and watch the people going up and down the bike path - in an hour, I saw someone jogging backwards, someone with a large parrot on their handlebar, and two people on skateboards being pulled by dogs.",mrdom
50,Enjoy!,Rent a bicycle and make sure you'll have enough time to enjoy everything you can there! its a great place to stay especially in the afternoon.,BRUNO LASSMAR B... V
50,See It All At Venice Beach,"This is a happening place. From artists to performers, cheap swag to swanky outfits, you can see and get it all in Venice Beach.Before you go you should read up a bit on the history of the area. It is quiet interesting and will provide you with a better understanding of why Venice is what it is.We stayed in an Airbnb on the North end of the city just blocks from Santa Monica. We were on Pacific which is a fairly busy road. We were two blocks from the beach and were able to stroll down peaceful courts to get there. On my first day I woke early and went for a run. Within the 20 minutes it took for me to get from my start to my turn-around point the entire boardwalk had changed. It was amazing to see the shift. I recommended waking early to take it all in.The boardwalk is worth a few strolls up and back. Each time you will notice someone or something new. A few blocks away from the water and just East of Pacific is a great little area for shopping. Beyond that Abbot Kinney is worth checking out. The food and bar scene is incredible. If you have the means, the shopping is amazing, as well.Be sure to schedule some beach time in. The endless sand and water gave me hours of enjoyment. The water wasn't that chilly, either, but that is coming from a girl who grew up swimming off of Connecticut and now in Tahoe.No need for a car when you visit this area. You can easily get around by requesting drivers or grabbing a scooter or bicycle. The land is so flat that you can walk for blocks and not realize how far you have gone.",LakeTahoeYoga
40,Happy Days,"Loved this place, a great lively atmosphere in the air. Loads to do and see, with plenty of places to eat and drink. The fairground certainly met expectations, with rides and stalls to meet every age range. A little bit of something for everyone. The usual characters after your money, but at no time did we feel threatened or pressurised into giving money away.A really great place to visit.",Fosterfour
50,A great place to people watch.,"This is a classic place to walk, people watch, and get some interesting fast food. It's not for everyone as it can get pretty vulgar here. Lots of entertainment but also lots of sad looking people just hanging out. One can rent bikes and scooter in multiple places. Park right on the beach side for $9 a day.",GenotheViking
30,Rowdy area,"Venice Beach was definitely an interesting experience. The beach itself is very nice, but this area/neighborhood is pretty crazy. Loud music blasting at all hours of the day and night, tons of interesting characters, scooters darting all over, strange fashion, etc. Not for little kids or older folks who are faint of heart!",Sarah
10,Uncomfortable,"When planning our trip, I assumed the trashiest tourist trap in LA was the walk of fame. Whilst it is certainly that way, I’d go as far as to rate this as worse by far. The closest UK equivalent is Blackpool on crystal meth. The shops are tacky, the walk is dirty and littered with druggies selling cheap knock-offs and thrusting blank CDs into your hand. Oh the glamour! Muscle beach is as expected, and there are plenty of other sports courts around which are good to watch, but otherwise I don’t advise anyone wasting their time with this one. The best bit was the palm lined walkway but frankly these can be seen all over the city.",Tom S
30,Great people watching — not family friendly!,"Very crowded, busy and vibrant. We saw fights, photo shoots, cheap vulgar T-shirts and lots of street vendors. Definitely interesting and fun for a while but risk of sensory overload is high. It was ok with teens; wouldn’t recommend with younger kids.",Peggy T
10,Stay away,"Seedy, trash strewn area where you will be smacked full on with the smell of urine and weed. Not a nice place to visit.",AC W
10,Skip it,"I have no idea why this is rated so high. We are vacationing from across the country. Read the reviews and thought it would be a fun afternoon. It’s dirty and run down. We actually got dropped off from our Uber, walked to see the water, considered getting a sweatshirt only to realize we didn’t even want one, went back out to the road and called an Uber to take us away.",23KK28
30,Certainly interesting...,"We were in Santa Monica during a horrible week full of rain and cold weather. We didn't want to let that stop us, so we headed out to walk the Venice boardwalk on a drizzly Saturday morning. The rain certainly kept the crowds down, but even so it was a very interesting walk to say the least. Lots of joggers to dodge (even in the rain), and as others have mentioned the content on many of the t-shirts was a little questionable if you had younger children. We were there when a food shelter arrived to throw parcels of food, bottles of water, etc. out to the standing crowd of homeless, which was interesting, but I have to admit that I really really loved the street art. So many things to see, and some really out there but that's what art is all about right? Glad we made the attempt to get a look, but sad that we didn't get to see it all active and vibrant.",worleybird98
30,Beware of crazy shirts with inappropriate logos !,"Crazy shirts, very inappropriate for young kids to see! There are lots of beach vendors who sell odd items such as art work with cats!",Rob F
50,worth a visit!,"while i was glad we opted to stay in Malibu during our visit, this cute (very busy) city was fun to visit for an afternoon!",Rachael R
50,Amazing catwalk for all the beauty;-)),"Venice area is lively and vibrant and you feel the California way of living: here you have all!It takes hours to see all, we booked an open bus- the weather was gorgeous and we saw all the villas of the celebrities for two hours and then back into the crowds enjoy 😉",Sven-Papa
30,Venice Beach and Boardwalk,We visited in March. Very interesting area. Guys walking up and down the boardwalk trying to hand you their cd's. Don't take them unless you are willing to pay. Lot of homeless people. Some seemed harmless but there were some shady characters. Stay home and YouTube it.,grueninger_karen
30,Maybe not what you might expect...,"We visited this February and can only reiterate what some previous reviewers have commented: homeless people, people getting high, smells really bad, shack after shack of tutt, vagrants sleeping rough, freakishly weird, spooky in the evening, pretty crowded. But, as another reviewer says, it can also be 'colorful, fun, frantic, energetic, artistic'. Depends on your mindset and the judgements you bring with you. One thing's for sure – it's a unique place and, as such, a must-see. But you may not have an overwhelming desire to return...",Baz B
30,Strolling and...,"Though there are some stores and street vendors, I find that there is nothing much to do in this area other than strolling. There are a couple of people I see with their roller skates and surfboard. The water is rough (mane depending on the season) but I don’t think this beach is for swimming. I think Santa Monica pier/beach area is way better as there are restos, rides and recreational family activities.",DuchessDiaz
10,So Disapointing,After seeing so many movies and shows shot here we were very much looking forward to seeing the legendary basketball courts and skateboarding parks in real life. We couldn't have been more disappointed in what it was. Coming from another country the amount of homeless people was so sad to see. The entire board walk is just rows and rows of tents and people sleeping. The Bathrooms are are filled with people getting high. The only positive thing we saw were some locals in the skate board park. Other than that I would avoid going here as a tourist.,44isballn
20,Tacky and filthy,This is a huge beach and on the boardwalk there is just shack after shack of tutt.Intimidating guys selling CDs and the Muscle Beach area is full of vagrants sleeping rough.There is no reason to go back there at all.,Epicureously
40,Movie scene,"2 families with teens spent some days in LA, at Marina Del Rey, and took a ""trip"" to Venice Beach Boardwalk everyday. A must see. Crowded with tourists, yes, but anyway something you just have to do. Some found it a little bit spooky in the evening, due to all the hobos, but we never felt ""threatened"" in any way.We rented both bicycles, electrical scooters and even did some running. A great way to get around and see everything.You have everything from the ""Baywatch"" towers, Mucle Beach and Santa Monica Pier. Feels like being on a movie set.",MisterTNorway
50,very cool to see in real life when you see it everywhere on tv,def somewhere you have to come if you are in CALIyou see this place is tv movies etc.to have it all come togeher in real life is pretty damn cool,Zachary R
50,People Watching!,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk may be one of the greatest places on Earth for people watching. Just about anything goes so maybe not the best place for impressionable children. Lots of little eateries and shops. Some weird local art from the locals. Just be warned, there are a lot of homeless people in the area but they are not a bother. Muscle beach is here, a skate board park, basketball, paddle tennis and other activities. A great place to walk or jog too, although it gets pretty crowded on the weekends.",befriedman
50,It's Everything!,"We loved our afternoon strolling the boardwalk--so colorful, fun, frantic, energetic, artistic--so much to see no matter where you look. If in the area, its a must!",AndrewBeach
30,Interesting for People Watching,"Basically, you have a boardwalk filled with trashy stores selling trashy items. Muscle Beach would have been more interesting if more people were there. The area seaward of MB had some people doing things that were interesting.The area is mostly filled with an electic group of people which seemed to vary from the freakishly weird to the freakishly normal. There seemed to be a lot of thuggish people hanging out and walking about.This is not someplace that I would go again since there is really not that much to see.I certainly would not take my children there unless it was to Muscle Beach only for a contest or something similar.",TravelDonCA
50,Fun for people watching,"Very eclectic group of people that hang around the boardwalk. The skatepark is always fun to watch. The boardwalk is lined with street artists, tourist shops, and weed shops. Be sure to be aware around you because people on bikes and scooters do not follow the rules and go on the pedestrian path. It smells really bad but definitely worth a visit at least once.",constancescalia
40,Very colorful,For somebody who is from another country it is very interesting just to sit and watch how many different people can be on one spot.,Audrey loves to travel
40,Stroll along the beach among artists,"The walk along the beach of Venice is a visit to another dimension. You have a lot of artists showing their work, a lot of stores and shops catering to the passing tourist, a view restaurants and bars, the muscle beach gym where you can watch people pump iron and then you have a lot of homeless people living in camps or semi permanent shelters along the beach.",Andreas Matthes
30,Not sure why this is rated so high,"Granted there are a few cool bars near here, the actual boardwalk itself if full of people trying to sell you CDs and skuzzy shops full of cheap clothing. Not worth going too far out of your way to see.",Carina R
50,A Blast,One of my favorite places since I was young. I wish I could go every year. I love the sunsets on the boardwalk.,Audrey F
10,Go only during the day and not alone,"I would say skip it if you don’t do or buy drugs. Homeless ask you for money, cigarettes, pot. Brother In Law saw a guy go to the BR in broad daylight so there was human feces on the sidewalk.I am fine with new places but the hair on the back of my neck stood up here. I did see a parked police car with two officers looking around",pup427
30,Great Sunset,Interesting place to visit. People watching seems to be main event. Lots of action going on. I’m glad we were there for sunset because it brought beauty to the area.,KeyWestTravelinGirl

50,Really Enjoyed,"We really enjoyed the Venice beach boardwalk. Less touristy and packed than Santa Monica. Chill vibes with good people and food. Plus, great views of the ocean and mountains!",Chris
50,Edgy and Fun But Leave Tiny Kids At Home!,Venice Beach Boardwalk is a MUST DO if you are in Los Angeles but it is not necessarily the best place to take toddlers and small children. Lots of funky/fun shops geared more for adults. Highly recommend!,misopiso88
30,"Ok during the day, a bit sketchy at night.","Now I'm from SF so Im used to homeless people hanging out. The problem is that when the run goes down, all of the businesses around here close and its really dark on the boardwalk. Theres not much lighting and it would be fooling to go down to the beach to hangout and smoke at night. Its just not safe because of the darkness and people on the street. I would recommend going towards the actual Venice Boardwalk where the rides are.",Nathalie P
30,Not hip and trendy as advertised,"This is a nice walk or roller blade spot, but the area is run down and full of homeless souls. I would skip it.",BCsaralou
30,Diverse!,"If you're down that way, taking a walk doe. The Venice Beach boardwalk is a must. A multitude of ""Street sellers"" exhibiting their wares and talents. It's worth going just so you can say you've been, not necessarily because it's amazing. The scenery is obviously beautiful and it's well maintained, but an open mind is necessary.",Bev S
40,A must visit,"Lots of tee shirt shops and beautiful beach, really is everything you have imagined, and of course Musle beach, lots of bars and restaurants to relax and enjoy the view.",OSUWASHMAN
40,Still my favourite part of town,"Venice Beach is my favourite part of town. It's edgy & funky & has a very unique vibe about it. So i was really excited to take my teenage children there.They wanted to see Muscle beach & look in the tourist shops.It was a sunny but cold day in December when we visited & it was very busy. You have to be careful when you are walking along the Boardwalk as there are so many cyclists, roller skaters, people jogging with buggies, people jogging without buggies, speed walkers, people on skateboards, lots of people wanting to get places fast.I was dismayed by the increase in number of homeless people that we saw on the boardwalk since last year though.Still a great place to visit.",bl0ndie72
50,Awesome restaurants!!,Love walking down the boardwalk and seeing all the people! Great place to grab a bite to eat or rent a bike or scooter!! Great that it is right of the beach!,Traycie B
50,Plenty to see along the Boardwalk,"Walking down the Venice Beach Boardwalk is a visual extravaganza from seeing brightly painted Murals on buildings, various characters busking to the interesting crafted items sold by colourful artistic individuals along the way. There are plenty of shops to visit and places to get food on the boardwalk as well.",Jody T
30,Not what I expected,"I knew Venice Beach would be full of all kinds of interesting sights. I expected what I thought was shown on tv - lots of ""beautiful"" people on the on the boardwalk, lots of weight lifters at Muscle Beach, and just the healthy vibe of CA. We were there on a Saturday night and I think all the ""beautiful"" people had left for the day. I was shocked by the large amount of homeless people on every side street and the extent of their situation. The place was very dirty, hard to find dinner items from the various vendors, as it got darker, it felt very unsafe. The skatepark was fun to watch the skate boarders, the graffiti beautiful, sunset with palm trees beautiful, and there is a great photo location at the wall with Venice Beach on it. If you want any souvenirs with pot stamped on them, here's where you stock up! My teenage son was intrigued with all the sites he saw and yet my husband and I were both uncomfortable. I'm glad we went and would go again - just wish I was mentally better prepared before we went.",Karin D
40,So different to most cities,"Partly ""romantic"", partly ""seedy"", love it for its differences to downtown and modern cities although it has lost some of the charm compared to my first visit some 30 years. Still enjoy sitting on the boardwalk with a coffee watching everybody watching everybody there is nothing superficial here, what you see is what you getGreat sunsets",RonWamberal
20,Disappointing,"I wouldn't bother going there. It's crowded, with tacky stores, and you are likely to be knocked over by people on bikes and electric scooters",MS06
20,Lots of homeless and drugs,"We came in the later afternoon with our kids aged 5-10. While during daylight hours it had a fun feel to the area with lots of shops to look in,restaurants, art work along the walkway, skateboard park and all beside a very long wide beach.It was mid December so not very busy on the beach or on the boardwalk which made it easier to look around.We went in to a shop around 6pm and when we came out approx half hour later it was dark and everything around us had closed up. There was suddenly a not good feel to the area, homeless people and the scent of drugs was overwhelming and although it was there before it was much more apparent when everything around us was dark and closed.The public bathrooms are absolutely disgusting with a horrid stench in them.The homeless have tents set up all over the beach just beside the walkway. Although we weren't really bothered by them we did have some asking for money and cigarettes.The sunset was stunning, probably the best part of being there.I have never been to this area before so didn't know what to expect or how it is now compared to how it used to be but it's not a place that I have much desire to visit again.",Rebecca P
10,OMG,Whatever this place once was that made it an attraction it's now a freakshow. It's nothing but a bunch of hustlers and druggies along with a few homeless up and down both sides of the street.I definitely would not get on here with young children or anybody with good vision. This is what deinstitutionalization and legalized marijuana can do for your neighborhood. Look on YouTube for some of the old videos 20 years ago. Disgusting,Chuck B
40,You have entertainment food and shopping at world famous Venice Boardwalk,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk is world famous. If you are going to LA, you must visit this place. The Boardwalk has a bike path, roller skaters and skateboard ramps. It has several restaurants, juice spots, bars, tattoo and piercing stores, skate and surf shops, sunglasses, t-shirts and plenty of tourists. You can see street artists doing mimes or musicians or jugglers etc. In short the boardwalk has more diversity in demographics and retail then probably anywhere else in the world.",VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
40,Funky,"Worth wandering to see the colorful street shops and arts. It’s quiet in the morning but will be full in the afternoon and evenings. Shows real local life with the paddle ball, open air gym and surfers.",Nav1go
10,Welcome to the Marijuana Mile of Mediocrity,"We couldn't enjoy the boardwalk at all, due to the stench of marijuana. Near the shops, on the walking and bike paths, on the beach. You can't escape it. No law enforcement presence whatsoever.If you think that's how public space should be, enjoy the trashy shops (with a couple of exceptions), unoriginal (and sometimes untalented) street performances and mediocre (to the eye of this beholder) art.",Robert M
20,Unless you know exactly what you’re getting and don’t mind...,"If you are a tourist from out of town and you’ve heard of the famous Venice Boardwalk you might think it’s a glamorous beach with exciting people watching, kitschy shops, colorful decor, and a wild night life. All of this is true in a sense, if pot head homeless people screaming obscenities and throwing trash is your thing. Otherwise please go somewhere else. Venice is a dump.",jasonjarvis
30,Stay off the market lane! And keep on the boardwalk closer to the beach – the market lane is a hideous place!,Venice Beach is of course worth a trip. But the long market lane is ruining the experience so stay off that track. It's extremely touristy and it's all a big hustler lane with so many shady and rowdy people on drugs trying to sell you things you don't need or want. Instead stay on the boardwalk and bike lane track next to the beach where it's cozy and nice. The marketplace is Hell on Earth. Total tourist trap.,S. Moeller
40,See and smell it all!,"Venice has it going on. Lots of different walks of life, smokers, tokers, skaters, homeless, beggers, movie stars, musical acts, dog acts, dogs, couples, families, and on and on. It's a lot of fun and can go wrong fast if you're not paying attention. Keep your wits about you. The boardwalk in a landmark and steeped with history.",Lisa Wheeler
40,great place to walk,this is a place to walk have something to eat and some drinks a lot of vendors of food and souvenirs,ada92871
30,A unique boardwalk,"Living on the east coast, I've been to a number of commercialized boardwalks in Florida, New Jersey, Delaware, etc. Venice has some things in common with those -- cheesy gift shops, unhealthy fried snacks/pizza, ice cream joints and the odd decent-looking restaurant. What is unique about this place is the other entertainment (a bagpiper, a guy playing a grand piano outside, skaters in the skate park, the famous Muscle Beach) and the numerous homeless folks (especially towards the end of the main drag). All of this is set against the beautiful backdrop of ocean and mountains. So, it is definitely a mixed bag, but certainly worth checking out if you're in the area. You can walk from Venice to the Santa Monica pier (which is nicer) in a little over an hour I would say, or more quickly on a bike.",Alberto T
50,Free sightseeing,Recommended to see and feel like local.Souvenir shops are expensive.Snacks are good. Fruits are available.,madeang
20,An unexpected let down .,"Had seen pictures , glossaries and films of Venice Beach, but the reality is it's nowhere what I anticipated . So sorry to any one living there , I definitely wouldn't go there again .",raymonddavies
30,You will see it all,"Venice Beach is a great place if you’re into people watching, but the amount of homeless people and lack of cleanliness on the boardwalk in general is a bit off-putting. Go for a stroll during the day as the beach is great, but I wouldn’t trust coming here at night time. If anything just play it safe and head to Santa Monica instead.",CostasDaGreek
30,Funky,"I am not quite sure what to make of this place. It was interesting to see, sort of funky but largely sad to see it has left a large swath of social destruction that reminded me of a Mad Max meets Heidi and Gilligan.An amazing amount of homeless people, drug abuse and the like. It was interesting walking around in the daytime but I would not be comfortable being there at night ( and I am a big guy ).Expensive with some neat treats.",Donaldtrout
30,"Tacky, tatty and you get harassed!!","We had high hopes that it would be trendy and fun, a bit of people (poser) watching and generally a great atmosphere.....What it is, is somewhere you get ripped off on parking, harassed by many guys trying to ‘give’ you their music cd’s. Tacky T-shirt shops (about 40) interspersed with prescription weed shops.If you are from Europe, think Benidorm and you will be close.Plus side - the beach is sandy and clean.We wouldn’t plan to go back.",AshBush
40,A mix of all things human,"This is an interesting walk.The architecture has its own personality , the vibrancy of the people pedalling their wares, the street performers, the skaters, the homeless, the cannabis smell - all of this and more is out there on the boardwalk waiting for you to discover it.The sights and sounds are constantly changing and for this reason I would go back again.The beach is very nice and continues on from Santa Monica State Beach all the way down to Marina Del Rey.",toddlerpants

40,Different,"The best way to put it is it’s different. I’ve never walked down a beach road or any road which was diverse as this one. Amazing talents, awesome artists, mind blowing music, dances and stunts. This place is good to hang out and observe. I also met a famous youtuber Jesse Wellens.",MahmoudAGD
40,Oh the sights you will see....,Venice Beach Boardwalk is worth a stroll if you want to see some of the unusual people that hang out in the LA area. There is definitely lots of people watching you can do as you walk by all the interesting characters that are trying to sell their wares along the boardwalk.,soccermom13
20,Disappointed,"We walked from Santa Monica’s pier along to Venice beach which was a pleasant walk with the many cyclists, skaters & people on the beach playing volleyball etc.We was looking forward to Venice beach as it was really hyped up in the later 1900’s being on tell a lot in different programs but boy were we disappointed.The homeless had taken over, I think looking at all the stuff they had they must just lived there all the time as they all had shelters. To get some money some tried to sell what they called art, I think there was maybe 1 or 2 artists that were any good, the rest was what a little child would do & some of the prices were so high you’d think they just came out of the Louvre.The place seemed dirty with litter & rubbish every where & it seemed most of the people were high on grass which smelt everywhere the shops looked dirty & mostly sold the normal beach souvenier tat.We were so disappointed with what we saw, however at no time did we ever feel threatened & we spoke to a few people and they seemed really nice people, just fallen on bad times & they have to stay somewhere.We were told by a tour guide that other cities actually pay the fare for homeless to get to LA & this appears to be the place they end up.",Sandie-mitch
50,Boardwalk,"Venice Beach's claim to fame is its boardwalk. Hosting a daily procession of eclectic characters and scantily clad beachgoers, the boardwalk never fails to impress out-of-towners. Past visitors loved checking out the area's unique scene (including the open-air Muscle Beach and the Hotel Erwin's High Rooftop Lounge), although some cautioned that the parts away from the pier were not appropriate for younger children. Also, remember that Venice Beach can get crowded on sunny days and is better suited for sunbathing, not swimming.",RockyCZ
40,Balling Boardwalk,"I was in LA for 2 days and made sure to check out the Venice Beach boardwalk. I was happy with my choice to go because it was definitely an experience.Truly unique, the boardwalk offers something for everyone. I personally enjoyed walking around checking out the graffiti and different shops and smelling the different aromas.The beach itself? Not a huge fan. I'm an East Coast guy and swimming in the pacific was something new to me. It was cold and seaweedy. Two of my least favorite things, unless some ice cream and toothpaste redeems seaweed.But check it out, find whatever it is your looking for. Embrace the eccentricity.",Matthew W
30,Eclectic and weird.,"If you want to see some weird sights and eclectic people, the Venice Boardwalk is for you. There are a lot of vendors selling (tourist) stuff along the beach, so if you want a souvenir of your visit to L.A., this a good spot to spend a lot of money. Parking is tough!",Jerry Crawford
10,Very grotty and quite sad,"I thought it might be a good idea to walk along the boardwalk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice.It starts quite promisingly with the wide beach and the ocean to the right and some attractive buildings on the left. There were a few joggers, dog walkers, bikes and scooters at the beginning but the closer one gets to Venice the more grotty and depressing it all looks and feels. Most of the buildings are ugly and blend in with the vast number of homeless people’s ‘homes’ on both the beach and down the side streets. Lot of tattoo and piercing parlours, and other shops selling assorted tat. A large population of hobos, homeless and sad individuals some of whom appear to set up tables/stalls on the boardwalk selling works of art etc. Quite eye opening and depressing. Clearly highlights an issue for LA to address. Not a nice experience. Granted it was a wet and miserable day and perhaps in the sunshine it might all look a little nicer.",GCR484
50,So in love with Venice ❤,"The boardwalk is a colourful, liberating, accepting place that we fell head over heels in love with! A must visit for everyone who visits LA!Unlike mentioned in a review below, there is a great restaurant called The Sidewalk right on/in the middle of the boardwalk that we went to twice, it was perfect for people watching! There are so many little eateries on the little roads that lead up to the boardwalk to, just a few steps off the front and there are plenty of fast food outlets with great selections. The scooters are an absolute MUST, $1 to unlock and and just 15 cents per minute of use and you cam leave them anywhere! Since of the best fun we had all holiday.You do get an intermittent smell of cannabis but as cannabis users ourselves it doesnt bother us at all, although it's not as rife or as frequent as some are making out. And it just adds to the atmosphere, vibe and freedom of Venice!",LKS85

40,Historic and a lot of fun subculture!!,"It was created in 1905. So some of the shops and restaurants are really showing their age. It is a very eclectic boardwalk with the beach, skateboarders & a lot of impromptu entertainers. The day we were there it was cloudy & cold. Hated that I didn't get to experience a good beach vibe. The stores are very eclectic with some really odd to collectible goods. The prices of stores we went in were very typical. Didn't find any bargains, but, we didn't get to cover the entire boardwalk. We dined at the Sidewalk Cafe. Very nice historic place with great food. Would definitely recommend to spend an afternoon or day at the boardwalk if you can!!",Debi M
20,Sketchy and unimpressive,"The vast majority of what is available to do/see on the boardwalk is downright gross. The street ""artists"" are not, and the most interesting store I saw was one who welded spare parts into figurines. Add the impressively permanent homeless encampments, horrible public toilets, plentiful garbage, and the random insane person screaming and swearing at no one in particular and it makes me wonder why anyone comes here. Well, the beach is great, but this is a review of the boardwalk! There are lots of things to see in and around LA- this is one to cross off the list before going. There are lots of great beaches elsewhere- go to one of those instead.",Jason T
10,Get ready for a reality check!,"There are many homeless people in the area, many of them under the influence of drugs. The area is full of cool street art but it can be a little bit hectic to walk around with so many people acting like crazy.",Patrick Vollert
40,Very Active,"Venice beach and boardwalk are iconic. The beaches are beautiful and there are tons of opportunities for bike rentals, scooters and other modes and touristy transport. The weather was beautiful for this early fall visit. As the evening came on it was heart breaking to see the large and diverse homeless population.",Lanita R
20,Not impressed,Tackey tourist shops - mediocre restaurants. Did enjoy a couple of the private vendors. The skateboard park - saw some great talent.,Altius10
30,Worth seeing once,"People can do jogging, skateboarding, skating, biking, etc… Many artists trying to sell you what they think is their piece of art. Almost all the shops have the same tourist cheap items. Public restrooms are to be avoided as they are very dirty and smell very bad. There is marijuana smell all over the place and many homeless people.",gincar2016
20,Great for people watching,"Tons of interesting people if you're into people watching. However, smelled like pot most of the way and I was concerned that my car was going to get broken into back in the parking lot (which it didn't). I would not recommend bringing the family to this place.",Freddy G
10,There are better beaches,"I’ve been to many countries and many beaches and this was not a pleasant experience. The beach itself is beautiful, but everything else was poor. The public toilets were quite disgusting. I appreciate marijuana is legal but the smell is everywhere. The shops and food places are also not very nice inviting. I read that Venice Beach is supposed to be ‘funky’ and ‘hipster’ but we found it tired. We went along the coast to Santa Monica pier which we found to be a nicer experience.",673AndreaC
30,Worth going but!,"Yes it's eclectic and alternative etc but most shops sell the same repetitive tourist cheap tat, that it seems to have lost some of its originality, not what I expected, could do with a return to the roots from which it came.",Tennants♥️travel
10,"Avoid, should be renamed Scamtime Boardwalk","Venice Boardwalk will appeal to.. certain types of people. If you want to smoke a joint and well... Burn in the sun?Avoid the people trying to give you ""free CDs""... They'll want a 'tip' after they've scrawled your name over one of the CDr's they'll thrust into your mitts... Sadly, this creates a pretty hostile atmosphere that leaves you looking over your shoulder constantly...Avoid the mentally ill homeless screaming at you when they walk past you...Avoid the disgusting public toilets...Best way to avoid: don't go there at all.",RoundCat_2000
50,Just brillant,I love it. My husband loves it. My daughters love it! ! We'll be back from Denmark soon. Cannot wait.,Diana G
40,"Colourful and unique, just be cautious","There is no place like this anywhere else I have ever been. It's definitely colourful, loud, entertaining and interesting and worth visiting at least once if you're staying in the area.The boardwalk spans much of the expansive length of the beach and is lined with all manner of interesting tourist-oriented shops, restaurants and cafes. There are also many street vendors selling interesting art, souvenirs, mementos and doing henna tattoos, different forms of hair braiding and so forth. Much of this is very reasonably priced though in the shops bear in mind the ticket price may not include the VAT.You have the view of the beach and the ocean parallel to the boardwalk the whole way down. Interesting street art appears on several of the buildings and there is nearly always some sort of street entertainment happening from singers and dancers, to stuntmen, to sports people.You do need to be careful. It's very busy and I have been told that it's a prime place for pick-pocketing. My friend I was staying with told me it gets sketchy down there at night, and I kept to daytime walks down there. There are a lot of homeless people around down there too so do be prepared for what you might see if that bothers you. Also watch out for people stopping you in the street ""giving"" you CDs because actually they will get into a conversation and then pressure you for a donation.There is lots of interesting, cheap, good value street food and I would particularly recommend Jody Moroni's for a delicious filling burger and gorgeous fresh lemonade.",ladyvalkyrie22
50,Know what you're getting into,"Yes, there are homeless people.Yes, getting there almost certainly means passing by urine soaked corners and resident's signs asking people not to poop on their yard.Yes, you'll smell a whole lot of weed.... but it is all ok, as the eclectic awesomeness of the shops and restaurants and everything else makes it all just work. Beautiful beaches too. People to watch. It was really great.",Jon P
20,Sunshine and sea - but also dirty and dangerous,This place is a juxtaposition between the beautiful sandy beach with great waves on one side and the boardwalk. Yes there is some interesting street art but it's mainly dirty and has homeless people begging or touting for money by pushing CDs into your hands. It also smells of weed - I know cannabis has been legalised but I didn't expect to be so aware of it. More concerning was the man who pulled a knife and slashed the tyres of a bicycle he happened to trip over - do LAPD exist or is it just on TV? This was at lunchtime so I would definitely avoid this place at dusk/night.,JAF_Wales
50,"Entertainment, Eats and View","Very interesting and very pretty, The view is beautiful, there is boardwalk entertainment, lots of items to view such as clothes, trinkets, jewelry. Lots of people, just having fun. There are activities, including a skateboard park, bike route and the beautiful view of the ocean and Mountains in the distance. Just dress comfortable and wear comfortable shoes, you will want to walk and take in the happenings.",15receptionist
40,Go in the morning! People watching,"We went a little later in the afternoon and it was already dwindling out. By about 4p everyone is packing up. I've gone in the morning in the past, even on weekends and not as crowded AAAAAAAAND all the street performers are there! There are a lot of little shops and people trying to get you to pay them to take pictures with them. All in all it's a good entertainment day. And you can always hit the beach in between. Parking can be expensive, shop around. One parking lot said seventy dollars! We found one for 20. And saw signs later for 10$. Take better pictures than I did lol",SnakPak3
40,Always fun,"We came early, parked right at the official parking at Venice Beach (good idea, otherwise you waste time looking for a parking), and enjoyed strolling up and down Venice beach. Always fun, and at 10 in the morning we felt safe and enjoyed the walk.",swissami19
20,"Lovely Sunset Views, for the Young","The sand, surf and sunsets are spectacular-- if you can see them through the crowds. The boardwalk is jammed with tattoo parlors, fast food, bars and cannabus stores. Definitely one for the under 30 crowd. If you are a senior citizen, you probably want to skip it.",annefmh
20,too crowded in the summer!,"You will be amazed at the street artists. It is fun watch the skateboarders do tricks at the skateboard park and also to watch the roller blade dancers. You can buy all kinds of things -- jewelry, art, knick-knacks, T-shirts, hats, souvenirs at good prices. You can also eat everything from pizza to shaved ice, sit-down restaurants and food trucks. Dress is casual (like a bathing suit and cover-up), but wear walking shoes and a hat - and bring sunscreen. A short walk to the ocean - so bring a towel if you plan to go in. However, if you don't like crowds, stay away!",baumgold
10,Only regret during SoCal vacation,"Do yourself and your family a favor and avoid the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Unless, of course, you enjoy exposing your wife and children to open use of drugs, filth, violent behavior, and worse... all of which appears to be perfectly fine with local law enforcement. Yes, I get that not everything in life is perfect, and that some people hit hard times. I have been all over the country and internationally with my family. This is different. It is fully in the open and totally out of control. Be aware and guard yourself even if you're only passing through. I couldn't even imagine a night time visit.",travel4290
40,Just like in the movies!,"Going to Venice Beach is always a treat. There's always something that surprises you. Worth going every time. You can do a lot from biking, skateboarding, inline skating, jogging or simply people watching while eating your favorite ice cream.",Cliffy930
40,Fun and Funky,We spent a fun few hours browsing the shops and people watching. We loved the drum circle that was happening. Could easily spend a couple of days hanging out in the area looking at al the art and great alternative sights.,Matt P
50,A bucket list experience!,Spending the day here was so much fun. It was worth the walk up and down and back again. The people are fascinating and watching the baby boomers whiz by or try to on the birds was hysterical. No place else like it. $15 parking...but the entertainment...priceless.Tip: No dogs allowed on the beach,ralindal
30,Nice walk.,"We took off from Santa Monica Pier and walk the boardwalk all the way down to Venice Beach. Its a nice walk. It took us 1 hour. In the Venice Beach area we went for lunch, enjoyed the beach, and walked back to Santa Monica while quickly looked at shops and artists works, if we can call those arts, some are good, you can feel a big stress and frustration in those paints, lots of naked pictures a-la-picasso, large man organ. I open to arty styles but there are not many real artists there. Plus, like another traveler said Venice Beach is disgusting. Its dirty, it stinks and I would need to be very very sick to use the public rest rooms. They should charge a fee to use the bathrooms. It does smell marijuana, street people camp along the boardwalk, they all look high and depressing and use poor language. I am really amazed Los Angeles Police let them camp there. Let say I would not suggest a visit to any of my best friends, skip it, or do as we did, walk down, lunch, come back before dawn. Santa Monica is fare more better for its beaches and safer area.",Nancy B
40,Well worth a walk along,"Don’t expect a pretty, scenic beach side. It’s busy, with buskers and street stalls. But such a great atmosphere and a perfect place for people watching if that’s what you like!Don’t be put off by the long toilet queues, they go down quickly.",CharlotteKirsch
50,So much fun,"I love this place my second time here..... Great fun for all ages, date-night family outing,or just hanging with friends. It does cost to park.....There is plenty to do, there are rides like at a carnival, roller coaster s, bumper cars( kind small area can’t really drive).....high drop, twister and many more....Ferris wheel, and they have games for prizes..They have plenty of restaurants, and they have the beach you can chill on.... volley ball, play ground, American Ninga warrior type courses ......Also they have these bird scooters you will see everyone riding.. fairly cheap .15 a minYou must download app to use , u have to put credit card , driver license info......google bird app scooter.. those were really cool...",kthom29
10,Disgusting!,"If I could give this place negative stars I would! Bathrooms are sickening and have no locks. People are doing drugs, trashy junk shops, and overall just felt filthy! We paid $10 to park and walk over. Stayed about 20 minutes and left. Not a place for families for sure. Didn't feel safe here and definitely wouldn't go at night! Don't waste your time!",Shannon W
50,Beach Boards & Souvenirs,"Beach, Boards, & Souvenirs. People watching, eating, & saw some street entertainment. The Souvenir we picked up personalized & the guy was great. We got a surf board (personalized) dated etc... Also heard live music",GayleP866
40,Nice Place,We came on a Sunday evening. Parked our car near the beach. Walking around the shops and beautiful beaches. Seeing sunset and a lot of skaters. Street performance was nice and fun.,Beatrice KEE
50,Venice Beach,Just Beautiful and there’s places to shop and eat ..It seems to get very crowded on the weekend and make sure you have shoes for the beach and walking,Renee N
50,We had amazing time,"Amazing place need to be visited on the day, take rug and supply , the groceries are expensive there. Take cash no credit card since they will steal u",Ahlam A
50,So much fun!,The boardwalk is definitely different and filed with unique people but it really is so fun. Walk the boardwalk or grab a scooter or bike. There is so much to see and shops to stop at. Had a great full day walking up and down and checking out the street performers.,DubStub
50,interesting place,The Venice Beach walk is great during the day but i would not recommend it so much at night we have been there twice at night & both times we felt unsafe the second time was not to bad as we were in a pretty big group of people.,57chevycustom
30,Beautiful Sunset!,We visited the Venice Beach in late June. The beach is beautiful. The sand is clean. The street performance was good. The skaters looked amazing. We paid $10 for the parking near beach. We watched sunset there. After the sunset most shops were closed. My partner didn’t like the area. It was cold at the sunset. The sunset is beautiful.,BangkokSachse
50,Great place for a casual walk with friends and family,It was not too crowded but had enough people to lend character to the boardwalk. We also walked on the pier that extended into the water and wonderful views of the sunset and marvelous weather.,Frank V
50,Tons of fun,"My family and I really enjoyed the boardwalk. We went on Saturday, so things were live action. I enjoyed the live entertainment. Weather was beautiful. There's so much to do.",katinarabb
10,First Day in California,"If you are looking for a flash from the past (early 90s) this is it. The beach is very clean and the water is beautiful. However, there is a lot to avoid and recommend if your heart is truly set on going please go during the day.",sarah c
30,Underwhelming and overwhelming,"My fiance and I visited the famed Venice Boardwalk on a recent trip to LA (we stayed in Venice but away from the boardwalk) and were simultaneously underwhelmed by what was there and overwhelmed by the chaos of the area. We saw many neat street vendors and some street performers but that was overtaken by the boardwalk tourist trap type stores that were all run down and the walkways were so crowded it was difficult to navigate. If you find your self in the area, don't go out of your way to stop by the boardwalk. The beach is a much better way to spend your time.",Kaitlyn F
40,Different to expectations but still fun,My wife and I recently decided to detour here on the way to the airport as we had time to kill and its a staple of so many Hollywood shows/movies. What we found was quite different to expectations including being quite run down but there was lots going on and we hired Lime scooters which was extremely easy for a first time user and then had a blast going up and down the board walk. I doubt I would ever return and if I was walking probably wouldn't have enjoyed it but if you get a scooter its a good time.,James F
30,A shock to the system,"We went to Venice beach while in California because my adult Grandson an art student wanted to go he loved it. However there were some aspect that were really sad to see so many homeless people a young couple trying to sell two small puppies. There was an odour in the air I was told that it was drug and apparently legal. The beach was beautiful and went on for miles the Boardwalk selling everything from paintings tee shirts mugs I purchased two woven blankets that were lovely. It was an experience, an experience but would not go again. A word of warning if you arrive by car do not been tempted to go in a car park on the out skirts were there are waving you in with a board then rip you off with a high charge go as near to the from as possible you will see the car park who advertise the price a more reasonable rate.",KAZ059
30,Carnival atmosphere,"This is a tough call, because if you’re from the West Coast, nothing you see surprises you. If you’re not and you’re a half way conservative parent looking for a fun outing with your kids 13 and under, you’ll probably be disappointed. If you have older teens and you’re not easily offended, by all means go.You will smell weed. You will see homelessness. You will be asked for $$. You will see sadness in souls...BUT, you will also be entertained by talented people of all ages. You will have a chance to bike, jog or scooter along a gorgeous beach, and reward yourself with a cup of cold fresh fruit or ice-cream afterward. You can find cheap T-shirts to prove you were there and end with a sunset that will take your breath away. Know before you go.",bailarina5678
10,Oh Dear,"This would probably be my idea of hell. Tasteless T Shirt shops, tacky souvenirs, bad street performers, crowds of people wandering aimlessly and lots of garish and unpleasant art to admire. If you're looking for bad tie dye, a rickety dream catcher and some other kind of 'arty' dreck you've come to the right place.Set alongside the Pacific ocean, a park with volleyball and basketball courts, this area could have been developed into a lovely esplanade with a much lower key and family friendly environment. It's crowded, the mood is sour and frankly, if it weren't for one independent bookshop, Small World Books, I'd say avoid this area completely.",pookala
20,Vacation,"Visited Santa Monica & Venice Beach for 2 days. Loved our stay Venice Beach not what I expected, sad to see the many homeless people living there especially on the 4th July !!!Had lunch at Venice Diner, appalling service, had to send drinks back as they tasted foul, the waitress spilt one drink over me and just said she would get a cloth, no apology. We then had to wait over 30 minutes for a tuna melt and it was disgusting.",Patterz
40,"Fun, Touristy Attraction","The only time that I frequent the Venice Beach Boardwalk is when I am showing tourist friends and family around LA. They enjoy the one-of-a-kind Venice scene. It is an experience, but do not come here expecting anything luxurious as it often gets a bit dirty and you will definitely encounter some homeless people.",Rachel L

10,Not take care of.,"Graffiti, pan handling, homeless people, smell of weed, people high on harder drugs as well. Lots of the bathrooms don't lock, don't have toilet paper, or have people doing drugs in them. ""Know before you go.""",Erica I
30,Not our kind of vaca,"Love visiting California, but walking some of these boardwalks is upsetting and not something my kids should see. Bums all over. The smell of marijuana all over as well.

20,Ewww,"This place is gross. Its dirty and run down, lots of peddlers harassing you, all walks of life and I don't mean that in a good way.

40,Must do,It was not as nice an area as Malibu beach or Santa Monica beach; but it was cool to see muscle beach.,449mathewb
30,A little on the dirty side,Muscle beach was my favorite part. It was fun to play around on the bars and rings in the sand. My daughter enjoyed it as well. Otherwise it was a lot of touristy shops and stands and just felt like a carnival to me. Bathrooms reminded me of outhouses. We didn't stay long. It was somewhat hard to find a parking spot but eventually found one on a side street.,sheljowo
40,Stroll along,"The first thing you notice when you start at Washington Boulevard and head towards Santa Monica is the amount of homeless people, it’s a real eye opener. I must say they didn’t hassle us for money or anything but it’s something you can’t miss. As you walk towards Santa Monica there are less homeless people. It’s also not the cleanest of areas and I guess this is due to the homeless population.",NicoleM8
10,"safety hazard and dirty, visit in a group","Bikes, scooters, skateboards everywhere...fun yet hazardous for pedestrians and small children. Lots to watch and experience from weight lifting, basketball, handball, beach basketball tour, performers but dirty and unsafe.

50,Lots to experience here,"Enjoy the beach, music, street performances, food, drum circles, a gym on the beach, shopping, and funny signs. A funny sign someone is holding may keep you laughing and telling great stories for years to come.",Vinesmith
10,Dirty Place,"So many homeless and drug users in this place, it’s not even funny. You got some street performers putting a show and extorting money from you. I laughed in their faces when approached and pressured about giving them money. Not a good place to go to or put your family safety in jeopardy.",Peter S
10,Don't waste your time.,"This place is dirty, gross and scary. There are so many other wonderful things to see and do in LA, I don't understand why Venice Beach makes it on to recommended itineraries. The smell of weed is prevalent, and there is nothing ""artsy"" or cool about the endless t-shirt shops full of crap you wouldn't buy. Definitely not a place to bring your family, even the panhandlers are offensive with signs like, ""f-you, pay me."" We went in the morning thinking it would be better and we wanted to check out the skate park. So not worth it.",nancyhZ8694IZ
10,Don’t Go,"Putrid and dirtyPretty much describes this boardwalk.Not family friendlyLooks like a poor third world countryPublic restrooms, dirty, dank and dark.Much better beaches to go to",ChuckOregon
10,Disappointing,"We had high expectations and were expecting a cool, buzzy place filled with lots of trendy places to eat and drink in. The beach looked great but unfortunately the walkway is full of tourist tat shops and people living on the beach. We felt uneasy walking around here. Such a shame.There are some nice places to eat/ high streets in Venice but avoid the beach.",Jamierocker
40,Great fun & entertaining,"We went to Venice beach on a Sunday. Make sure to arrive early so you can get better parking. Parking on the beach is $18. There are many street entertainers. There is muscle beach that was pretty empty. The kids loved the skateboard park! The basketball courts had some games going on and sometimes you can spot some famous players! It does smell like weed all along as remember it is legal :) be sure to wear walking shoes and have your cameras ready! They also have bikes, scooters, etc for rent. Have fun!!!",Lisa R
20,Eclectic but trashy,"Walking from Santa Monica Pier, there was plenty of people watching happening. Thinking we’d get some dinner by the time we got to Venice, we found nothing but cheap take away “hole in the wall” (literally, order at a window) food retailers selling pizza slices, hot dogs and hot chips. The strong smell of marijuana in the air and an abundance of smoke shops left no doubt what this place has become. No judgment, but if you are not into that, it seemed rather pointless to be here. A nice enough beach, which is the same beach we left at Santa Monica. A range of craft stores along the walkway, so long as you like your craft weed-based. The muscle-beach gym had closed for the day but a lot of other people playing basketball, skateboarding and otherwise, smoking weed. I did manage to capture some nice sunset photos walking back to Santa Monica. Glad I can say I’ve been but it is far from a highlight. My final thought: if people weren’t so stoned, you might expect a gun fight to break out at any time.",PeterF_Syd
20,Very Disappointing (Maybe off Season?),"We walked the path fromSanta Monica Pier to Venice beach thinking it would be a nice area with shops and things to do.Once we got outside of Santa Monica it was disappointing and sketchy until you walked pass all the marijuana smells outdoor shops and homeless people. The area right outside of Venice Beach is a place to avoid, it was safe but I personally was very surprised how run down, vacant, and sad the area looked.",Josh K

40,I may be biased .... but I liked it,"I came here because I love the Doors/Jim Morrison, so I wanted to visit the place where the Doors was born. A lot of the spots that you would associate with Jim Morrison and the Doors are already gone but it was still great to be here, where he was. Yes, there are homeless people here, and you can smell weed. San Francisco has homeless people too, and I still love it!",spiewaa
20,Overdone....,"Venice used to be a trendy place full of eclectic people, music and good restaurants. All that is long gone. Last time I went it was full of junkies, bad food and garbage. Not worth the trip. For an ""LA beach"" experience you can go to Santa Monica or Manhattan beach. Mucho more worth your while.",JustTravl
10,Awful,Wasted a day walking to and from Venice beach which is actually a stunning beach if it weren’t for the constant wafts of marijuana and feral humans lining the path dismayed that onlookers didn’t find their depressing scribbles of art worth buying. Then there’s the legit vendors selling the worst land fill souvenir tshirts. If your into that sort of thing go for it.,Grace B
20,big let down,"you can see that this place probably once was a free spirited floaty cool place to visit .unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a crap hole . couple of interesting small stalls with cool stuff but everything else was just repetitive overpriced rubbish . and the shops seemingly all offer the same thing of t shirts / sweat shirts / shorts which can be printed on at over priced rates .my advice is sure go visit and see for yourself , it's a pleasant wander through if you're not harassed .but leave you're wallet at home .",WalterWhite01

30,Has to be done on a Bird!,Venice Beach Boardwalk varies so much from Santa Monica pier...can be classy and tawdry in equal amounts...On super BIRD great fun...amazed to see so many homeless people ( all men ) sleeping rough...at least they will never freeze in the wonderful Cali climate!,mhold
50,Don't miss the Skate Park,"We rented bikes in Marina del Ray and rode to Palisades Park. The bike path is flat and easy to navigate with plenty of room for bikes going in either direction.The highlight of our ride was the hour we spent at the Venice Skatepark. The skaters are amazing and so fun to watch, especially the couple of kids who skate here. Check out TJ Taiyo Misawa (age 9 1/2) who will for sure be an Olympian one day. He is crazy good.",GraniteSprite
50,Real LA,"We loved the boardwalk. Very ecclectic, good food, multi-cultural, and a beautiful beach. We walked from Santa Monica Pier along the beach walk. Not much in between the two, but a nice walk in good weather. When at Venice don't miss the canals and the skate park.",pedz55
30,Meh,"Lots of homeless and street performers. Good for people watching but the homeless outnumbered visitors. I never felt unsafe but I’m from New Orleans and felt that it was too much homeless with little police intervention from the begging and weed. Not sure if I’d bring kids here when Santa Monica down the way is far more family friendly, in my opinion.",Jennifer B
40,Lots of sights here!,If you want to go somewhere and people watch.. This is the spot. Long walk area with plenty of tourist tour stores for souvineers. Muscle beach is there too. Skate park.

30,Little bit of everything,"One of these attractions around Los Angeles, which is famous for sociological point of view then any other. Plenty of characters performing here on a daily basis, in addition to beach goers, tourists, beggars and homeless. Not really a good place to eat, since there’s only few not so decent looking places with cheap fast food. Smell of marijuana is noticeable and is everywhere.",Mr_Nobody_1979

50,Must see bit of so-cal culture,"Venice Beach is a unique place. Watch your valuables, but do come and enjoy the freak show. There is a skate park, murals that constantly in flux, 100 kinds of junk food, and very colorful artists, addicts, and musicians, and kiosks selling all manner of tchotchkes.A bit further south there are some interesting bars on the side streets.",Paul D
30,Touristy and a bit grubby,"Venice Beach is a classic that everyone has seen in the movies and tv shows, and the real thing is pretty touristy with all kinds of overpriced souveniers being peddled from numerous stores.The boardwalk also attracts the street dwellers, who try to make a buck off the visitors via various means ranging from singing and playing to shouting incoherently at passers by. Also, not all of the turds on the sidewalk are from dogs.So it can be kinda seedy and grubby, especially the quiet stretch before you hit Santa Monica pier, but there is also some really interesting architecture along the way, and there is definitely a vibe about the place.In short, it's worth a visit, but it's not going to be like in the movies.",JDSor
50,"So much color, culture and true California feel!!","Loved Venice Beach! There are tons of shops, restaurants and sights to take in. I spent most of my time at the Santa Monica Pier, I wish I'd spent more time here. More to see and do and it's such a colorful place to be.",Lsalcarr

40,Great People Watching - Nice Walk,"We had heard about the boardwalk at Venice Beach and decided to check it out on a long layover at LAX. It's only 4 miles from LAX but takes about 25 minutes with traffic. There are several parking places - we found one close to Muscle Beach that lets you stay for 4 hours for $15.There is a very definite vibe when you walk along the boardwalk. You can't help but smell pot in the air and there are all kinds of interesting people to see. It's a unique subculture.We spent 30 minutes just watching people at the skateboard park then continued on towards Santa Monica. There are plenty of places to buy trinkets, t-shorts, and food.",gl0baltraveler

40,Great for people watching,"Yes this is another tourist must do, but the stroll is great for people watching and getting to see another side of LA. All of the stereotypes of different characters are true; it's especially 'interesting' now that marijuana can be purchased legally.",geetarchurchy

30,Touristy but interesting in spots,"Very touristy with the same sunglass, t-shirt, etc shops repeating every other block. There is also a fair amount of homeless but actually minimal begging or panhandling. It is people watching that is the main activity with the weight lifting area and skate park 2 of the more iconic things to spend a few minutes on. The murals scattered on various building and some of the graffiti is actually very interesting and, in some cases, artistic.",dsj5777
30,A bit grubby but great for people watching,If you like people watching there is a lot going on. There are some good bars and restuarants but it seems to look a bit old now. Needs and uplift,Lorna D
20,Down at Heel,"What you see on TV, what is portrayed by movies, what is said about it - hype. When you actually stand here - it's pretty run down and disappointing. The buildings are very shabby, the murals and paint jobs just aren't cutting it at hiding the decay. There's a skate park - whoo. There's an outdoor gym - whoo. There's a loads of people milling around probably thinking the same as this review.If you're in the area - go, to say you've been. Don't go out of your way or make a special trip though.",WillyFogger
30,if you like crazies,"then this is perfect for you, I personally never liked the boardwalk here, I don't see it, some people love it but it is not my cup of tea. I wouldn't call it a beautiful beach, nor can I remember a good place to eat around here. Muscle beach is interesting but for about 5 minutes. A lot of homeless people panhandling and trinkets if they are your thing",sethmichaels2017

30,"Nice walk on the beach, weed everywhere","We walked down from Santa monica to Venice. It is nice to have visited, but if you are not used to the smell of weed you will be after walking here. Not much to see, but a nice beach and a few nice bars are ok.",Sindre P
20,Pick another beach,"Unfortunately a beautiful beach has become a sad tent city for the homeless. My wife and I had numerous people trying to hand us cds, which thankfully we declined after hearing from others how they then try to swindle money from you. We were approached by a homeless man asking for a few dollars and when we declined he proceeded to harass us and follow us muttering to himself how we were rich f**ks and couldn’t help out someone who has nothing. His following us made us both feel as though we were in danger.",mscottsedona
40,"Beautiful, unique crowd","Lots to do here, bike, skate, etc. people watching is great. It's a bit touristy. And don't take anything anyone tries to hand you.

50,A Fantastic People Watching Extravaganza!,"By far one of the best parts of my trip to LA. The people are energetic and interesting. From the body builders to the skaters, everyone is doing their own thing and it's incredible to see. Take your time to look at the artist who are set up and the musicians who are playing their instruments or singng. Don't be afraid to talk to people - everyone has their story and they are usually quite interesting. Don't be deterred by the smell of Marijuana. People are smoking and stoned faced, but no one is a hassle and everyone is just trying to chill and go about their lives. Would definitely go back in a heartbeat.",Stephanie J
20,Venice beach -muscle beach no more - people are strange,"We had the unfortunate experience of walking to Venice beach from Santa Monica beach. Oh my, what did we stumble across? As we were walking from Santa Monica you cross the border to Venice Beach, gone are the beautiful kept pathways and facilities, hello third world country, dirty boardwalk, homeless people everywhere and shops trying to sell anything to the gulliable. Shady characters seem to be part of the landscape and muscle beach is a rundown building that hasn’t seen improvements in decades. What a shame. Strange people, no need to watch the movies, you can come here and experience it for yourself, just make sure you leave before the sun goes down or you may become a statistic/victim. Dope smells everywhere, did I feel unsafe - you bet I did. The sad reality is that they have beautiful beaches, unmanned with homeless people living in the lifeguard shacks. Junkies and paraphernalia galore. Do I recommend this place - only if you have a Death wish. Stay in Santa Monica and head up to Malibu, don’t waste your time here.",BaxterE15

30,Certainly different,"It is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA itself. You have an eclectic mix of old and new.There's lots of shonky souvenir shops if you need to get some last minute gifts for those back home.The beach is nice, and you do get nice sunset shots.But its nothing spectacular, and if you don't have time, you're not missing much.",b_long176

30,Mixed thoughts,"Our first time here; went because friends said don’t miss it. It IS interesting but also sad. Lots of homeless people living alongside the boardwalk, together with people setting up tables of things to sell. Lots of t-shirt shops, a few restaurants and a variety of other shops along the way. Several of the buildings are colorfully painted with murals and interesting designs. Skaters whizzing by, singers sitting in beach chairs singer their favorite tunes and LOTS of people walking, checking out the scene. Interesting, but I left feeling sad for the overall plight of many that I saw.",houstontravelingfool

50,Very Interesting Place,We walked along the Boardwalk from Venice Beach back to Santa Monica Pier which was only about 20 Minutes but a nice wall with great views.Venice Beach has some real characters and has a lot of homeless living along the boardwalk but don’t be put off there are great shops and market stuff to buy. We found a man selling great wooden souvenirs which we bought.Ther is some fantastic artwork on buildings which make for some beautiful photos. Just have fun and go with it!,Jen9966
40,Absolutely An Experience,"This was an experience, along one side of the boardwalk are mostly Tee Shirt, Souvenir Shops, Food Places, and then a Green Doctor something I did not know about, then for the people the ones that obviously spend lots of time here, a guy on home made Roller Skates playing a Guitar and selling Tee Shirts as well, a young lady came up to us and spoke about her wish to travel, obviously homeless but harmless enough, people thrusting CDs at you but make sure you don't take them just keep walking, we saw Muscle Beach with very athletic guys flexing and working out, very pleased we visited.",Dell E.

40,Quintessential and quirky California beach/boardwalk scene,Lots of parking for a few bucks makes this a very accessible beach/boardwalk area. And the shops and 'Muscle Beach' areas are a quirky yet quintessential California scene. A wide variety of people watching makes for a fun time just walking along the boardwalk. Touristy? Heck yeah. But fun to do for a couple of hours. Definitely recommend.,Rich H

40,Uniquely California,"This is a must visit place if you have not been here. It's hard to find a parking spot if you arrive after 10:00 AM. It's definitely one of the busiest beach areas in Los Angeles. It was cool to see the unique and weird scene on the colorful boardwalk. Much of the area is a little run down. Many strange and unique people to watch, depending on your interest. To me, it's a been there done that experience, but many people enjoy coming back again and again .",MandC0218
30,Unique experience - Both good and bad,"Visited there many times as our hostel was located in close proximity of the boardwalk. The beach is very beautiful. The boardwalk in itself is quite amazing with all the palms, ocean and everything. But on the boardwalk there also are ALL SORTS of weird stuff going on. Didn't feel dangerous there though. But if you want to enjoy a walk by the beach without seeing guys doing their weird performances - go somewhere else or walk on the actual beach instead of the boardwalk. I would STAY AWAY by night but at the daytime it is quite safe.",samitintti
30,Alternative and a bit scruffy but fun,"Venice Beach still attracts a colorful mix of residents and visitors.

(We took an Uber, but one of our local relatives drove, and it took him over half an hour to find parking). There's so much going on, in kind of a festival atmosphere. There's great people-watching, tons of souvenir shops, a weightlifting area, and the basketball courts. There are also places that prescribe medical marijuana. The beach is pretty, the pier is nice, and there are numeous places to eat.",Adrienne S
50,Craziest Beach,"Full of graffiti and art, this beach is unlike any other in the world. There are houses behind which are lakes (to replicate the Venetian canals).

Expect to see fashion shoots here.",Sahilbanga
50,Awesome & Very Cool,"We were on a tour of LA several summers ago & went to Venice Beach for the day. Along the boardwalk there so many storefronts & street vendors that you can buy almost anything imaginable. As you stroll along be sure to stay off the bike & rollerblade path so as not to get run over. Enjoy a stop at ""Muscle Beach"" to watch the weight lifters show off their bodies. This 1 1/2 mile long boardwalk is one of the coolest places I have ever seen & this was a truly magnificent day.",GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat

We both found the area to be very hip, and full of people living a bohemian lifestyle. Artwork is everywhere, and creative people can be found 'doing their thing'. Especially loved the bike parade that came riding past the hotel, all lite up and with their own sound systems....very cool indeed.What we did notice was the area in general had a feel of being run-down, both in the buildings and general ambiance. There is also a lot of homeless in the area; so don't be surprised if you have to step over someone sleeping on a mattress on your morning walk.Parking's a nightmare too.",Hello in 10 Languages
30,Such a Contrast,"As a visitor i nearly felt compelled to go. Overall, it's one of those iconic places that you must visit when in LA. But, dont go looking for nice places to eat and drink.

Go for an hour or two, watch the street performers, watch the skate boarders and then leave before you catch something unwanted.",Sammo55
50,"Maybe touristy, but nevertheless entertaining",Any trip to LA has to have a stop in Venice. The area has featured in so many movies it’s hard not to feel like you’re in a familiar environment.

Some boardwalk entertainment brought to you via the locals. They also have an outdoor gym-weight lifting area on the boardwalk. Sometimes that can be entertaining in itself.

50,Always a Suprise.,"Struggling to find parking in the summertime, you wonder if a visit to Venice Beach Boardwalk is worth it. But once you are on the boardwalk, you know it was. You can go a dozen times and never fail to see new things each and every time. In the winter, the boardwalk is ever better (in my opinion) and local street parking is much easier. Not ""easy"" but easier. My usual walk goes from Navy Street as a northern end and West Washington Boulevard as a southern end. Take is slow and enjoy all the strange and often delightful things going on both in the shops and along the boardwalk itself.",kentennen

I can see why it inspired the Doors song ""people are strange"" which they wrote after Jim Morrison met Ray Manzarek here in the 60""s , fast forward to today and it's like people are strange on steroids.I felt uncomfortable having my daughter here so we left after a little over an hour of should I say ""strange scenes"".",deanroc

Always a fascinating place with street performers, souvenir shops, and people who have tables set up along the boardwalk selling their crafts/items. My personal favorite this trip was that there is now the ""Green Doctors"" on the boardwalk...a place to get a prescription for weed.

50,A Must Visit,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk is a place I know fairly well. I lived a 15 minute walk from the Venice pier for one year (2015-16). It's fair to say that we spent a good amount of time here taking long walks, sometimes even up to Santa Monica.If you are visiting LA for the first time and love beaches, you have to come visit Venice and nearby Santa Monica. SM has more of a family friendly vibe with a smaller side of grit, Venice Beach is the reverse. Venice is an interesting cultural experience and I haven't been to any other place like it. Both cities still have some of that quintessential California surf vibe to them.You will find homeless people camped out on the sides of the boardwalk and $3 million+ homes nearby. I recently read an article about how Venice is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in LA. The controversial Venice Stakeholders Association would love to change Venice and ""clean"" it up. Tech multi-millionaires (ahem, Google employees) are also changing the dynamic of this neighborhood and driving up real estate prices. Venice is part of what LA likes to call ""Silicon Beach"" which is their attempt to emulate Silicon Valley.One of the best parts of coming to Venice is the people watching. You will see so many characters here. There are legends like Harry Perry (in his turban) who has been skating the boardwalk and rocking out on his guitar since the 1970's. It's always entertaining to stop by Muscle Beach and see what's cracking.Be sure to check out the skate park, it's not far from the Venice ""V."" It's fun to watch the skaters in the park perform stunts with the ocean as a backdrop.There is shopping here, but a lot of touristy and junky shops. As you walk down the boardwalk you will see tables set up with vendors, this was a great place to pick up a piece of wall art. The shops on the other side sell a lot of t-shirts and other touristy goods. It is fun to read the offensive captions on the t-shirts and booty shorts.If you like to bike, you could rent one and hit the nearby bike path, it provides a lengthy ride by the beach. Please don't ride your bike in the area with the shops, there is a separate area for you closer to the ocean for biking!I recommend staying for the sunsets if you can, they are amazing, but it might be a good time to cut out right after that. You do need to keep your wits about you on the Venice Boardwalk. It's probably not the best place to be after dark. There have been issues with homeless people attacking people on the boardwalk. I remember the story of one woman swinging a vacuum cleaner at tourists.There aren't many great places to eat on the boardwalk, but you can wander over to nearby Abbott Kinney for hipster eateries galore.You can access the start of the Venice Boardwalk from Santa Monica, it's about a 2-2.5 mile walk. Parking is tricky in Venice. If you don't mind a small walk, I would recommend parking by Mother's Beach in adjacent Marina del Rey.",NYCaliKara
40,Easy walking along back of beach,We enjoyed several long strolls along the boardwalk which runs along the back of the beach. There are lots of things to see including the skateboard park and there are plenty of restrooms and places to eat and drink.,Martin N
30,Tacky and more tacky,Beautiful beach ideal for surfers but very tacky and dirty. Lots of homeless people sleeping on the beach some with heavy drug habits or mental health issues. Very sad 😭,JaneWeeks

10,Dirty,"Even knowing that Venice beach is described as quirky/cultural/hippy doesn't actually reflect that this place is an overrated dump. Tacky tourist shops selling the same stuff line the front along with ""quirky"" street sellers. The place is very dirty and attracts a lot of homeless people. The police and sanitation department were cleaning up areas of the street whilst we were there (I guess they were trying to do something but I think it's an ongoing problem). The skatepark was fun to watch but the muscle beach was awful! Rusty gym equipment, padding split open and cling filmed up. It was laughable! We walked there from santa monica... And then turned round and walked back! I really don't know what the fuss is about!",Holly C
20,Shady but historic,"Provided you know the background of this area, and are aware safety never takes a holiday, you should visit briefly.",KaRap17
40,Kind of Like a Circus Freak Show,"Interesting for people from other states. Definitely check it out for a few pix and to see some real characters. It's not the best beach however because there are a lot of homeless and thieves there so tourists beware. Just go to see the freak show on the boardwalk, then go down to the Marina del Rey Penninsula or Malibu to actually go out on the beach. Don't have your wallet in your back pocket, hang on to your purse and just watch your back. Don't be there past sunset, but definitely worth checking out for a few laughs.",HollywoodLexx
50,Best hidden secret,"Truly a great place to visit, filled with eclectic creatives ranging from crafters , cartoonists, psychics, artists, and precious stone stands. I highly recommend you stop by Frank B. Gentile's spot and admire his beautiful renditions of day to day life. I also recommend stopping by Miracle Vibrations. It is a gemstone stand that carries numerous precious stones. The owner of the shop also hand makes many of the jewelry he sells. The boardwalk also houses some great restaurants that offer a variety of different fares.",Bnajar16
30,Lost its Appeal,Now it is hard to say if places like Venice Beach have lost their appeal or if they are just simply trying too hard to be what they once were in a changing world. You will see this also in places like Haight Ashbury. However in the case of Venice Beach it has been overrun with cheap tourist souvenir shops and restaurants. The type shops where you buy shorts and tshirts with cute and often tacky sayings. The booty shorts were even worse. Somehow it has lost its appeal of its poetic and beat generation past. Even the Muscle Beach now seems packaged and ready for sale. I could not help feeling that it has lost the aspects which made it famous and loved. Now it is just too normal and too cheap. The beach itself is still amazing with plenty of area to get a tan but the rest is just too tacky even for LA.,Steven L
40,People Watching at a New Level,"If you like to people watch, then this is a place to checkout. My teenage son and I rented some bikes and rode up and down the area.

40,This Attraction Is A Must See!,"Each time I am in LA I enjoy stopping by Venice Beach to ""people watch"" and peruse the shops and restaurants along the boardwalk.

It is still a wonderful stop as one works their way from Marina Del Rey up the coastline to Santa Monica, Malibu etc.",apatejr

10,"Sad, dirty, and not worth it","40 year old couple, we went to check out Santa Monica/pier, and thought we could walk down to Venice Beach/boardwalk/muscle beach and see the sights. Although we can 'tick' this off our list, it really was not that enjoyable of a day. The whole Venice Boardwalk is a long row of terrible shops that have cheap, bad food and souvenir shops (we didn't go in the shops). The beach side of the boardwalk had an array of terrible art, very rough looking homeless/addicted/mental illness suffering folks. We were able to witness a man deficating against a building, a different man throwing up on himself on a park bench, a clearly deranged woman YELLING at a passer by whilst swinging a large metal bar...just to name a few sights. These poor people need not be celebrated, just need help. Muscle beach gym....nothing to see. No where to sit as all benches were disgusting or littered with the belongings of the local homeless.The beach....beautiful. If you are going to just use the beach, then you may remain blissfully ignorant, unless you need to use the public toilets (smeared in feces with drug paraphernalia littering the floor).So, I just hope that the local city has some sort of plan to try and sort the poor people of Venice Beach out",CB19772016

Lots of shops along the way, tourist traps I am sure but you can get water, snacks, t shirts... Anything you may need. Lots of homeless artists, everyone is friendly.What made this enjoyable was watching the roller skaters - bring something to sit on and chill out in the park.

We were there for 90 minute and walked about a mile down the strip before we decided that we had enough. I would suggest to anyone to visit 1-2 hours and then go elsewhere. A lot of the same t-shirt shops, pot dispensaries or pizza by the slice shops. We saw two down and out men is a street brawl and many individuals in an altered state which bummed us out due to some form of substance abuse. I know all this stuff is what makes Venice Beach, Venice Beach but still better in small doses.",SClemens

Sunday afternoons are when it is really happening if that helps you to plan. Start in Windward Circle (pictured) and head north to Santa Monica. Bring cash if you want to support the vendors on the beach side and the east side vendors in stores obviously take credit cards. There will be street performers, Muscle Beach, restaurants and bars. You can rent bikes if you desire. Ride a bike to the Santa Monica pier for more fun. Lots of homeless as well so be prepared. It is a bit gritty here but still worthwhile. Have fun!",JanD442

50,"When it's both free and interesting, how's that not excellent?","I lived pretty much next door in Marina Del Rey (MDR) 30-35 years ago. Venice Beach and the concrete strand along it were an interesting walk then (or skateboard, or roller-skate/rollerblade, or bike ride on an adjacent path) and it was every bit as interesting now that I visited it again, several days in a row in mid-July 2017. It was an every day walk, as I stayed locally for a combined business and pleasure trip and wanted a bit of exercise each day before heading out elsewhere.The walking strand is jam packed with interesting looking residences and shops (though many fall into the cheap tourist type category), as well as various craft artisans and people-watching; add in muscle beach (a workout area with equipment where the very fit and muscular show off, as well as work-out), paddle tennis courts (basically a shrunken tennis court played with short-handle hardwood paddles and deadened tennis balls), basketball courts, a skate park, and numerous beach volleyball nets, and there is much to observe, including plenty of amateur acts of all varieties.There are plenty of offerings to eat along the way too. If you walked from one end to the other and back (MDR to Santa Monica) you could make it in a few hours, or take the whole day, if you made many stops, which is what is most likely. If you wanted to spend an entire day, walking east to the canal district (from where Venice got its name) would also take up a few hours if you wanted to check out another batch of interesting California living residences.",Blackie B

There are a lot of shops and vendors, (some junk) muscle beach, a skateboarding park, a big sandy beach and bike rentals. I recommend biking the trail to and from Santa Monica pier. It isn't what all of So Cal is like but a very fun spot to visit!",Cindy D
40,Vacation,"Had fun. Street performers need to do more performing and less talking. Lots of knick nacks to buy as gifts. Parking is nightmare, but it was the 4th of July.",Kenneth C
30,Not my kinda place,On our trip out to the west coast we drove to Venice Beach. The beach itself was nice but it looked old and I felt like I was in Mexico with all the little sheds selling the same stuff. If you are headed to California there are much nicer areas to visit,cathy d
40,"What I imagined Southern California to be, quirky & fun!","My first trip to California from the east coast & Venice Beach was one of the first places I went. It was everything I expected southern California to be...quirky, crazy, sunny, fun! Yes, there are lots of homeless people, tacky souvenir shops, people peddling anything you can think of but it's an amazing array of entertainers, artists,& interesting people. It's the kind of place I would want to visit at least once and spend a few hours just to see it. The boardwalk is full of shops, some with the same old t-shirts but some very unique. You can see the famous muscle beach with fit people showing off or watch some amazing street ball on the basketball court. Our favorite thing was the skate park. Some incredible local skaters & we were amazed by the little kids that showed up everyone there! Beautiful beach and palm trees in the background & it was just a whole different atmosphere. Lots of cool murals on the buildings & if you are a Doors fan, you will appreciate the Morrison one & the fact he lived nearby. Beautiful bike trails & lots of rental places. You can easily ride a bike up to Santa Monica & check out the beach & pier there. Lots of eating choices of street food or sit down. The new Venice Surfside was an awesome place for good, fresh food & clean bathrooms. My biggest complaint of Venice were the public bathrooms. So gross that we just couldn't use them. Find a decent restaurant & have a meal to use the bathrooms. Public parking & if you are lucky cheap or free street parking. For a total change of pace, walk to the canal streets & enjoy a peaceful walk through the adorable houses & their whimsical gardens. Walk the street one block off the beach to see the Venice sign & other interesting sights. Probably not the beach I would want to get a hotel room at but definitely fun to get the feel of California!",cindytwigg
40,always fun,"Venice Beach is always a fun place to go. However, it was very cold the night we were there and crowded. It's becoming more of a tourist site and losing some of its charm.",MurrayOhio
40,Nice beach but many homeless people there,"We think the beach is very nice. The soft sands, long beach with small souvenir shops and beautiful (some very colourful) houses. There are lots of sports activities such as a skater park, fitness work out, people running/skating/cycling etc. However we think it is sad to see so many poor people living on the beach. Not that we dont have empathy with them, but they attract the attention and some in an uncomfortable way.",Per
20,Tacky,"I find this place too touristy and tacky for my taste. It doesn't have a hip vibe about it at all, rather something pretentious. A lot of kitsch souvenir stalls and that's about it.",anaismalli
40,A Slice of Los Angeles,"If you're heading to the Venice Beach Boardwalk, keep three things in mind... 1) this is not an upscale place, so don't be in a suite, 2) it's street vendor heaven so be prepared to have people asking you to look at their wares, and 3) the marijuana seems to flow freely in this area. With that being said, it's also a historically classic part of Los Angeles and is worth checking out. You've got this amazing beach on one side and then rows of little shops and street vendors and artists (sometimes that term is used loosely in this location, other times it's quite accurate). There's a great skateboarding park that's worth checking out as well.",ViktorTrue

40,Great,Very long Boardwalk and lots to see and do with people watching.There is also a lot of souvenir shops along the boardwalk reasonably priced. We did a large part of the board walk so typically we did it in a hour and a half- thats because we were taking out time. I also saw many visitors hiring bicycles and skating down the boardwalk as an activity.,Althea M
20,bettee places to go,You get bombarded by people wanting you to buy their wares as you walk down the boardwalk... I guess because they don't or can't pay for a space to rent to sell their stuff.Every freaking night.... LOUD ARGUING...ECT.. OK SO IT'S MORNING RIGHT NOW AND SOME HOOD RAT SCREAMS LIKE SHE IS ON CRACK.You won't rest here if you want to sleep at night...You have a long trek to the beach.If you want pics with something or someone.. Like Harry Perry.... Expect to pay.... I went to take a picture of A MERMAID SAND SCULPTURE... And was halted.... I DIDN'T SEE THE SIGN .. AND I SURE WASN'T paying for something I wasn't buying and keeping. ...ill keep my free SAND SCULPTURE PICS FROM OCEAN CITY MARYLAND... WHICH IS A FANTASTIC PLACE! There is a place 4 skating.. Biking and skate boarding... But it appears the boardwalk seems preffered.A lot better places to go,mariab4real

20,"Dirty, Seedy Place to Run, Even Early in the Day","Ran from MDR Marriott to Santa Monica Pier and back early Tuesday morning, via Venice Boardwalk. While not crowded at this time of day, tons of homeless loitering around with several getting into loud arguments. Would not feel comfortable if my wife was running alone here. Boardwalk area was dirty with trash and lots of sketchy looking tourist traps. Got miraculously cleaner once into City of Santa Monica. Would not return if in the area.",downslopewind

Be warned if you or your kids aren't familiar with the smell of the green stuff you will be after you leave here. There are LOADS of shops and artists here as well as an abundance of beach bums. You will leave with an education of the local culture for sure. We biked from Santa Monica to Venice. The paved path was perfect for skaters, bikers, skateboarders etc. We also visited the Venice skate park which my boys really enjoyed.",tborntreger

30,"Tattoos, marijuana, tee shirts and bathing suits . . .","People come to the boardwalk to see oddity, and there is no shortage of it. It seems every fourth building sells ""licensed"" marijuana with signs reading, ""The Doctor is In."" There is no shortage of Tee shirt and bathing suits among the tattoo parlors and smoke shops.

With the said we didn't have any problem with crime and didn't really see an above average number of homeless people. There are a lot of artist selling their wares. Some are very talented and some aren't really very good. We had a good time watching people and seeing all of the activity.",sportsinfoguy

So many interesting people and vendors.Visit Muscle beach... rent a bike... shop for souvenirs... Grab a bite!

30,It's Okay If You Keep Your Expectations Low,"We've all heard of Venice Beach so, if you go to LA, you have to pay a visit to say ""I've been there"". We visited quite early, well early for this place, so it wasn't too busy but there were still a few sketchy characters around, and I don't just mean the homeless - ""no mate, I don't want your CD""! The whole area just seemed a little run down to me with lots of little shops selling the usual tourist tack.Once we'd cleared the area on our walk along the front to Santa Monica it was much better.",newspapertaxi

30,Bucket list check off...that's about it,"Venice beach is a place that just doesn't change. It's good to visit to check it off of your bucket list, but just beware of the pickpockets on the boardwalk, and in the stores. Yes, the stores try to get over on the customers, so ask, ask, ask questions before you whip out the dough.The beach is mostly clean and there are definitely lots of sights to see though, from the street performers to the muscle beach, basketball courts & skate park. And, there's no shortage of interesting characters walking around.",tonyl552

Yes there are homeless and street people but we've never been bothered",sccrref
10,Don't bother,"We walked from Santa Monica pier to look at the iconic Venice Beach, wish we hadn't. Was the worst place I've been to, beggars, homeless, rubbish everywhere. The place stunk, had so many people come up to us asking for weed or money for weed, we turned around and walked back. Muscle beach consisted of a guy of about 75 in a pair of sandals trying to do a workout, just a joke.",Jules141110

50,"GRITTY, COLORFUL, ARTSY, FARTSY, MECCA FOR PEOPLE-WATCHING","Located in the more than old seaside resort of Venice Beach, two miles south of the terminus of I-10 in Santa Monica or two miles west of the terminus of CA-90 in Marina Del Rey to Windward Avenue, the famous VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK, with its blend of locals, tourists, artists, hucksters, street performers, artists, bodybuilders, vendors, fortune tellers, and police, offers the greatest selection of “beautiful people,” “weirdos” and “lowlifes” for serious people-watching. Besides the human drama, Venice Beach, once the roller skating capital and birthplace of the tiny Bikini, is also home to a $2-million Skatepark, a 2-mile long Ocean Boardwalk, the legendary Muscle Beach, a broad white sand beach, tee-shirt shops, dive bars and some restaurants. You can buy a tee-shirt, eat a corn dog and get a prescription from the storefront Marijuana doctor. Although smoking of any kind and alcohol consumption is prohibited, the smell is in the air and you will see a lot of “wide-eyed” individuals.",Robert D
30,Not a must see,"It was just okay. The boardwalk was pretty interesting, and the crowd even more so.

It's a bit busy because there are people who are walking, skating, or biking so you always have to watch out for people. There are shops many shops and places to eat. There is a bodybuilders working out there, there are basketball games going on, and there are park for kids to go on swings and what not. Last but not least there is a good beach to swim, and there are places to change your clothes.",xtine

30,Iconic but lost its buzz and lacks atmosphere,"The Venice beach boardwalk has gone down hill over the years and seriously lacks atmosphere these days. As its iconic from appearing in so many movies and TV series its ok for a look and a stioll to say you have been there, but seriously it has lost a lot of its atmosphere and impact and vibrant vibe that it used to have many years ago.You can see some people doing a work out at the open air gym and there are some very ordinary boring stalls along the walk.

50,Fascinatingly funky,"The inland side of the boardwalk has head shops, medical marijuana doctors, American Indian goods, tattoos, a good Chinese (legit) massage parlor. The seaside is a long line of locals, often indigent, who line up each morning for space. They offer artwork, henna tattoos, There are regular breakdance performances. It's relatively safe--there's usually a pretty good police presence, but watch your back pocket.You can appreciate the creative panhandlers. One won honesty points for his sign: ""Am an Alcoholic and Need Money For Beer"". People were donating.The City Council has discussed shutting down the seaside, but evidently came to realize that that would destroy the boardwalk's uniqueness and charm, and hugely reduce its value as a tourist destination.Street parking is hard to come by, but there are paid lots in the $15-20 range.",Paul S
50,Even in the daytime the energy is amazing,"Parking at a meter down from the beach, we were happy to see it accepted credit cards. Entered the boardwalk by some skateboarders and headed right for the ocean. Beautiful and surprisingly clean beach. The Boardwalk did not disappoint!

I think adults would like the boardwalk part a bit more than families would.

50,Realised a dream!!!,"This place has always been a dream of mine to visit. We did do a tour through here but the coach did not stop here at the time and I promised myself that we would stop next time.I realised a goal of mine to play basketball at the iconic courts here on Venice Beach. We weren't dressed for the occasion and it was cold and raining but never the less, we befriended a local and played around the hoops for a bit.A really nice guy for letting us have some time with him on the court and play around with the kids and dads alike.Venice is a little different, very bohemian and as the tour guide said, things that are not normally allowed in other areas of LA are standard in Venice. I won't go into detail but there are interesting characters there.This is a must do on your next LA trip.",royptraveller
30,Interesting area - very different from Santa MOnica!,"I walked the Santa Monica boardwalk and stumbled into Venice Beach - it was not the nicest beach area, but had some really great local artists selling their pieces which was really cool.

30,Interesting to say the least,"It's one of those places that you have to see once, and that's probably enough. The sheer volume of people makes it a great place to people watch. But the number of homeless makes it very sad at the same time. I wouldn't venture down the boardwalk after dark. The shops are the typical boardwalk sights. the food is typical boardwalk fare with the exception of a very good poke place. muscle beach is something to see, we came, we saw, and we probably wouldn't go back unfortunately.",Jeffrey J

The beach is great, though, and some restaurants in the area were worth checking out, but a very particular place for very particular people.",Francesc
50,Get FUNKY.,"Do nothing but watch the variety of everything that the boardwalk offers OR be an ACTIVE participant. Enjoy food from a multitude of food vendors - Snacks, to fast food, sit and eat at the food court or relax and take in the active scene at Sidewalk Cafe.Take a bicycle ride at Ride! Venice. Opt for an all-electric fat tire for a change of pace and ride all the way up to Santa Monica.Either way. Have fun in the California sun. That's why YOU are here.",H T
10,Smelt of cannabis!,This place was a little bit scary I'm not going to lie and I wouldn't have wanted to be there after dark. Full of homeless drunken and high people selling their wares. Absolutely stunk of cannabis the whole walk along! stay in Santa Monica its so much nicer.,SamFLolF
20,"Been there, got the tee shirt glad to be out.","This place looks like any down market seaside, apart from the nice beach, wonderful sea and lifeguards. The Boardwalk is covered with stalls, entertainers and ""medical marijuana checkups"" and sales.",devoir
30,Sleepy place.,"Plenty of our friends said we shouldn't miss it...so we didn't. Wish we had! Nothing of great interest here, except the great street art, but didnt like being hassled by guys trying to shove CD's in our hands. When we declined, lewd comments came our way. Definitely wanted to leave before dark. The homelessness was confronting too.",Llewelyn R
40,"Sand, Shops, and Muscle Beach",Visited (not for the first time) on a trip where we otherwise spent a lot of time in the Valley. Nice change of pace. Palm trees have an iconic look. We discovered a shop just South of Muscle Beach which rents paddles for paddle tennis (in addition to selling bikinis) and played on one of the public courts. Muscle Beach was pretty quiety but one guy was showing his stuff. We did smell a lot of weed (not just from the several marijuana clinics along the boardwalk). Love the murals in Venice and the carnival atmosphere along the boardwalk (nice for a visit - wouldn't want to hang there all the time).,Claire W
50,Eclectic,This beach is a perfect representation of LA - lots of different characters and always flooded with people.,joliefolie
20,Pot smoking homeless camp,"If you've never been, go and see what its all about and unless you like smoking weed and spending time with the great unwashed, leave soon after. It's a trashy place and full of weirdos but one thing I will say is that I saw no crime and felt safe. I think its character is from the street performers, artists and street vendors. It's nice to see that the LAPD have an outpost there and seemed to be proactive cleaning up the homeless trash camps. The beaches were very clean and well patrolled.It's a ""been there, done that"" type of place.",Jacknclare8289
10,RUN FAR AND FAST AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!,"This was a stop recommended by a friend who i later found out had never been there. If she had been, i'm certain she would not have recommended it. It is a very sad and trashy place. Even if there were nice eateries, (which there was not) i wouldn't even sit down to eat there. The entire walkway is lined with homeless either begging for money, or trying to sell you cheap trinkets. We spent about 45 minutes walking through, and as we were leaving i saw a young family ready to start their walk and i wanted to tell them to turn around. I'm not so sure what it 'famous' in its day. I did research this on Trip Advisor before making a stop, and no where did i see what i would call an 'honest review' of the place, which is why i'm writing here. The word ""eclectic"" was used a lot, but that is certainly not how i would describe it. There were no real street performers, only homeless with their guitars and cups out... Don't bother stopping here, especially with kids, i went with my husband and 23 year old, and all 3 of us agreed it was one of the trashiest places we had ever been.",JerseyTraveller21
20,Tourist overload,Once is enough. You should check it out but sadly it's just a long stretch of souvenir shops with a significant homeless population. The only reason to go is to snap a shot of the iconic 'Baywatch' lifeguard stations.,jilliansays
40,Fun,"Very interesting place... lots of ""lost"" folks line the walkway... the beach is beautiful! Great places to eat along the way.",JR R
10,THE SIXTIES HAVE LONG PASSED!,"Venice Beach is -- to put it simply -- really depressing. Shabby. Its glory days are long gone. Today is the tragic site of much homelessness (alongside ""Silicon Beach"" wealth), doctors' reps hawking prescriptions for weed, and run down shops. Take a walk on the beach in Santa Monica instead.",Miriyam
50,Walking for a generation,"32 years ago I started walking with my 1 year old daughter. Almost every Sunday we took my bike with a child seat and started to walk. Listened to the street musicians, counted the weights at the muscle beach gym, was amazed by all the roller skaters dancing in unison, winced at the famous guy juggling chain saws, walked by the spray painters dreaming up farfetched futuristic planets with 5 suns and moons, looked at the palm readers and always had a home made ice-cream.Last month my first granddaughter was born and after a little walk I realized how much this place has changed!The blue ocean is still there, seems the palm trees are reaching for the skies the same way, a couple of restaurants are still the same, but everything else is gone.Now I love to listen to the famous singer Charles Aznavour: yesterday, when I was young...The future however is sleeping without a worry, she knows that grandpa is pushing her towards new discoveries...",hanyecz
40,Fun place to be,"We walked from Santa Monica bay to Venice beach which is a short 1.5 mile walk. It is a entertaining place to be, filled with unique characters along the way. A variety of small vendors and restaurants.",Andreas S
30,Just like the movies,"The place is just like they show it in the movies. Crowded and lively and very busy, with all types of people, and probably a place you may want to avoid late at night time. However, the white sandy beach is marvelous.",SeaKayak25
40,Nice sandy beach,"Took a walk along Venice beach, plenty of shops to browse in, there is a big skatepark area, basketball court and of course the outside gym. There are also street traders",dee068
40,Always Quirky,"Spring Break visit had to include a trip to Venice Beach. We got there early so a lot of the vendors and people were not up/out and about yet. The parks department was cleaning and washing the paths, benches and roads. They were getting ready for the day. It is a fun location to people watch. Our kids enjoyed watching the skateboarders do their stunts and tricks at the skate park. The amount of homeless people hasn't changed. Sad to see but a life lesson for our kids.",Debbie M
20,Did you see any boards in the boardwalk?,"No boards here. Almost making Atlantic City look good?Wow, homeless, street vendors that want to sell you ""medical analysis"", and just odd folks. It is kind of like Time Square without the high rise buildings and with sand.We did find a good poke salad for not too much cash and that was not bad. Least we did that did not have to buy the t-shirt.",smokeater55
50,something different,"A beautiful beach and an interesting place for people watching, I wouldn't say it was suitable for children as there are some wacky-out there things going on, although the beach is ok. There is a lot of homeless people around and its certainly not the happy carefree place it is made out to be.",Frances E
50,"Nice walk, avoid weekends!",I enjoyed walking up and down the boardwalk from Santa Monica to Venice and just experiencing all the characters that were out there.,Brian W
40,Spectacular walk,"Walk from Venice Beach, or ride to Santa Monica. Great ocean views and shops along the way, including Muscle beach outdoor gym. Beautiful sunsets. Several homeless people camped along the esplanade but harmless and clean. Santa Monica Pier was amazing too.",Slldcl
40,Nice hangout,"The beach and the area was all well kept, loved the surfing trials, the basketball and the relaxed atmosphere.",Tatukochi
10,Trash,I'm sure many people hear about Venice beach and want to visit it but it's really a shame. Venice beach used to be nice in the early 90's but is now one of the trashiest beaches Ever! Don't waste your time or money on talent-less performers or imported cheap goods from China.,Priskilla6
30,People watching,"Great place to walk. Definitely see all types of people here. People trying to peddle their CDs, art, etc.. Place is kind of dirty and a lot of homeless people.",WIBadger10

40,You have to see this,"The whole strip from Santa Monica Pier to the Venice Beach Boardwalk is such a unique experience, and so familiar to movie watchers, that you have to go to experience it. Muscle Beach was not full of muscles--- athletes seems to have replaced body builders--- but there is a mural of Governor Arnold if you look carefully. The architecture of the area is indeed, old Venice. The locals and the visitors add to the experience.",daviddD3505IR
50,Definitively my favorite place in LA,"Easy-going, relaxed, hipster, diverse, multicultural and musical. In a nutshell, it's an artistic canvas for street performers, huskers, green doctors, painters and all sort of people with different quirks and talents that give to this area a feeling like no other in the city that makes you wish to come back for more. Locals shop owners are lovely and eager to engage in conversations promoting their little pot smelling paradise. I don't say this to often but definitely I was left with the desire to come back to this little spot of diversity",Luís G
50,Iconic beach walkway,"Great big wide open boardwalk borders the beach and separates it from shopping and restaurants. Bike, roller skate or just stroll--lots of room for everyone. Some public restrooms along the way.",MaryKop
20,Very Disappointing,"We had a certain expectation of Venice beack Boardwalk from what we had seen on travel shows, but when we got there we were so disappointed. The atmosphere was very bohemian and we didn't feel confortable ""ladies hold on to your bags"" Kept going through my mind as we walked along the boardwalk. There are small ""Pot Shops"" selling weed to the public and then you come across these so called artists selling off their art work which arn't very good (to be polite). It's a sleezy area and we would not recommend going there.",norma_gordon
20,Didn't do a thing for us,"There is a nice walk along the ocean and a big sandy beach, but the touristy and sketchy stores did not appeal to us. It felt like a place where some shady folks would hang out.",R2Regina

50,excellent,"i visited Venice beach on the excursion, i walked passed the basket ball courts the muscle beach were they weight train great experience well worth a visit.",David W
50,Essential for a trip to LA,"We loved our afternoon along the Boardwalk. Hiring bikes is the best way to do it, as there's a safe, separate, cycling lane. We made all the essential stops: the Marina del Ray pier (with all the people fishing), muscle beach, graffiti artist area and the mesmerising skateboarding area (checking out the skateboarding kids is a must) and the Santa Monica Pier.Yes it's seedy in areas, with some interesting characters, but that's all part of it. We were careful to watch our belongings and secure the bikes, but we didn't feel unsafe at all, even with young kids in tow.There are public toilets at various places and several playgrounds for young kids dotted along.",Munchkin208
50,"Amazing, eccentric place!","I'm in a wheelchair so love seeing crazy things happening all around me and this is definitely the place to go. It was foggy and a bit cold but I loved every minute, especially the man playing a guitar while on rollerblades!",Alison H
30,Average,"The boardwalk itself is clean and spacious. I don't know if it is because we went in the morning, but only a few people were there compared to Santa Monica Pier/ beach. People can go biking peacefully.",Joanne S
50,Long walk beachside,This is a great walk along a huge open beach. Great for soaking in rays. Stop by one of the restaurants for some people watching and a cold one.,C H
30,Mixed Views,"Had been expecting a much better experience but was disappointed by some of the characters lying beside the footpath in places. The beach itself was lovely and there was a lot of activity on both the beach and on the footpaths as cyclists, walkers and runners made use of the Californian sun",DanMcG_media
10,Do not go to The green Doctors,"All three of The Green Doctor locations lead you to believe that you can obtaina letter in order to get Marijuana from the local dispensary for $40. Nothing could be further from the truth. Only the location East of Muscle Beach states starting at $40.Once you see the doctor, then your told after signing their statement in front of the office manager. That its only for growing Marijuana at home. Then they tell you the letter maycost up to $200, and only for 3-6 months. After persistent complaining, I had to pay $80 fora letter that was good for one year.They tell you what you want to hear and lead you on, including paying an additional $25 for aMarijuana ID card.Better to get your pot from a friend, or wait a year when the laws change, unless you reallyneed it.",jazz398
50,Great way to spend a day,Every time I come here it is a different experience even though it's the same place. Fun place to visit the beach and experience some culture.,Jimmy Rex

30,"Busy, busy, busy!","We went on a sunny Sunday & it was heaving! That said, for all it was busy most people harmoniously share the walk/cycleway along the beach. It's interesting to see the tightrope walkers & acrobats on the gym equipment as you go along, that bit is nice. Along the side of the beach there are lots of people trying to sell tacky things, the smell of marijuana is often prevalent & there are lots of homeless people wandering round scavenging through bins for plastic bottles.",Sarah E
50,Visit!,"Walking along Venice Beach is a must-do activity while visiting L.A. This activity is easily paired with a visit to Santa Monica Pier.While you're here, visit the Venice Canals, Muscle Beach, Venice Beach Freakshow, and much more. Consider the weirdos and aroma of pot as part of the experience.",product-of-canada
50,Lots of people watching,Really cool place to hang out for an hour or two. You can walk on the side walk and see shops and some attractions (like the Freak Show) or you can go to the beach side and see people skateboarding or working out (big big muscle kind lol),Vanessamtz910
40,Really Cool Place.,Venice Beach Boardwalk is great if you are looking for something a little different to fill in your day. Lots of street entertainers and artists and shops selling everything from medicinal marijuana to thongs. Food is easy to find and you will be spoilt for choice.,Pat H
50,Just what you expect at Muscle Beach,Lots of shops and places to eat. The outdoor gym was busling with bodyt builders. The skate board park was way cool. Its a beach board walk so you never know what you are gonna see.,goldfieldguss
20,Feel like you need a shower after,"We had our young kids with us and the place just feels gross. People walking around smoking pot everywhere. My poor kids probably got contact high just walking down the sidewalk. I was expecting the ""funky"" street performers.... There was only one guy hustlin for money, calling people out if they didn't pay him. We didn't even stop to watch him. He wasn't doing anything worth watching. Street performers you actually want to see are in Key West. Take my advice and skip Venice and stay longer in Santa Monica.",wanderlust86

40,People watching at its best.,"By now Venice Beach's boardwalk has been included in many movies, made famous by their ""muscle beach"" area.

30,Its OK,"We visited for the day, it was very cold and windy. We were not that impressed by it, there were many little shops, they all had the same merchandise with the exception of an egyption one and all were over priced",Gaile1958
50,Never know what you're going to see.,I didn't know what Venice Beach was like at all. Surprised is mild. It has a little bit of everything and everybody. It's almost carnival like. The food choices were good. Of course you have the beach and you will never get bored people watching..,tnoceantravel
50,Beautiful in the off season,A great place to enjoy an afternoon of people watching and picking up trinkets from the vendors. The beach was nearly deserted and still warm enough to enjoy.,rlaw24
50,"The ultimate place to go,......for people watching","Of all the places I have walked around,......The boardwalk from Santa Monica Pier to the end of Venice beach, is so full of surprises, that you will not want to stop. It's a long walk there & back, i'm guessing something like about 15 plus miles, but all of it, is on the flat. Or you can choose a hire bike, or roller blades if thats your thing. Muscle beach comes up first, and there is an outdoor Gym, full of very muscular folk, who love an audience,....there are tennis courts, food eateries, one of the most magnificent beaches you will ever see in your life. As you get into Venice beach, things start to get crowded,..... there are tourist type shops of every description,.... The board walk is now full of the crazy Californians, Bikini's & roller blades, Old guys in skimpy speedo's with muscles on their muscles, and ghetto blasters perched on their shoulders, ....mounted cops on Horses, and yes, even a marijuana shop. This place has it all, and much more ....",aultz
40,Is This Too Much L.A.?,"Venice is not for everyone. It is very streety, gritty, and can be rough. That said, it is beloved by Angelenos. We love our urban beach vibe spot, with all of the craziest people in town along one strip of funky shops, corny tourist t-shirt boutiques, cannabis outlets (legal in Cali), tattoo parlors, and oddly decent cafes, restaurants, and pubs. Be careful crossing bike paths. You will get mown down by a cyclist if you don't look out!",JJHappyTraveler
40,Unique walking area full of life.,Venice Beach is in a class all its own; it teems with people walking or working out (Muscle Beach has more than its share of glistening bodies as they work-out on the equipment in the outdoor gym that is fence enclosed). There are also courts for more mundane activities - basketball or table tennis courts were much in use. Clearly it's an action oriented place. Good for joining in or just good people watching.There are numerous shops that line the boulevard that sell anything from quartz crystals to T shirts to coffee.An interesting look at people on the go.,Terry H

10,Hold your breath!,"You can't help but suck in the Marijuana ...it is everywhere! It was so strong and nauseating that I couldn't just enjoy the culture. It was a chilly and foggy day but that didn't keep people from going. It was so crowded at times you couldn't move. Very dirty, and DON'T go into the bathrooms. My son (18) enjoyed skateboarding but the rest of us where miserable. We paid $30 for parking!",Brandi S
10,Over rated....,"Don't go out of your way to see Venice, its dirty, seedy and ordinary in my opinion. Lots of homeless people, far better places to see in LA.",packa9

50,As seen on the movies,We walked from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach and what a lovely walk it was. Had a beautiful sunny day not too hot and not too many people about which was unusual but it was morning and a weekend. By the time we got to Venice beach it was much much busier. Walk only took maybe 30-40 mins. Thinking by afternoon to evening the walk would be crowded. Lots of activity on the beach with volleyball and other activities to do like a gym bars for acrobatic work. JUST LOVED IT. We should have similar here in Australia a great healthier beach style.,Catherine P

The best place to park is off of Rose Ave, the food is ok. not great but the pizza stands aren;t bad. it is really a throwback to the 60's, kind of psychedelic and a little dirty but a fun way to spend the day, you donot want to be there at night though , i think that is when the vampires come out to play.",Melodie L

50,You´ll feel yourself like being in a movie,"I loved it. I went on my own and I felt safe and amused by the magic atmosphere.You can go for a long walk and admire the overwhelming paintings in the buildings.There are market stalls along the boardwalk and there is something that will surprise you for sure: the water canals (after all you are in ""Venice"":-)Maybe, the best choice is renting a bike (it´s really long).You´ll see a lot of people working out, cycling and skating.If you are looking for a different and unforgettable adventure, this is your place.",Luna
30,Could be better with little effort,"Although the entire area has a huge potential being a top sport and outdoor activity area, it is spoiled by many ""strange and odd"" people, mostly junkies and drunks, and homeless lying down as well.

I can't recommend Venice enough....if your scared of the old Venice reputation put it in a bag, lock it away and get to Venice",AWilson321
10,Depressing!,"I guess if you want to submerge yourself in the toilet bowl of LA this is the place. It is run down, for sure not safe at night and is a mecca for homeless down and out people. The smell and smoke of pot is everywhere, very profusive! Well that's no surpise since you can see people openly smoking. Hey, whatever I'm not for or against it but I would for sure never bring young kids to this place. Open drug deals being done on the boardwalk, saw a guy rubbing magic marker on his tongue and gums over and over in an attempt to get high. It's dirtly, nastly, depressing and the only thing positive I can say is if you like to watch bizarre, sad, mentally impaired, drugged out people then this is your place. I was so sad with the total poverty and total broken atmosphere I had to leave. I've been here over the years and since my last visit 2 years ago it has gone from sorta not great to absolutely terrible.",tessalovestravel
10,TALK ABOUT DIRTY,"I wast most excited about the boradwalk when traveling to California and boy was it a huge let down. It is EXTREMELY dirty and filled with rude sales people. Of course you expect some things you should or could leave a tip for, but this was way different. When you walk they hassle you to buy stuff or even to donate to them shoving cd's in your face. They don't know how to take no for an answer. Unless you go to get a medical marijuana evaluation (cuz that have like 4 on the same little strip) or see the same 10 tshirts in 10 different shops don't bother. We got 2 shirts printed and it was $100 and was very misleading. There is one lady there with glass bottles and she was probably the nicest person there that doesnt hassle and harrass you. Muscle beach? what a joke, surrounded by homeless people and a dirty bathroom area. Be careful walking the boardwalk to the beach and ocean as you walk it is FILTHY of litter and trash until the ocean. I was literally afriad to take my shoes off till we got close to the water. After being by the ocean we wnt back to the boardwalk bathroom and showers where there were a few homeless people sneaking the corner to have sex... yes, in the middle of the day. The showers are disgusting and we turn around and there was a BLOODY TAMPON on the ground. I can't even make this stuff up. Such a let down. NOT A PLACE FOR KIDS AT ALL.",bsbbeckybsb
30,Better places in SoCal to visit,"Visited during a Hollywood tour. There was a film crew at Venice beach when we got there. We had lunch here with our tour, but we're glad to leave. Some sketchy characters here. No longer the days of body builders like Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are better places in SoCal to visit and walk about.",mariedesjardins
40,the vibe is amazing,"I was amazed by how different is this place. A local friend told me that this the same thing as Santa Monica, not even a little bit! the vibe is totally different, as well as the place. The only thing they have in common is the beach!

40,Best people watching ever,"Venice Beach is far from just any beach. This is a place where you can sit on the boardwalk and be entertained all day! It seems to attract (and has forever) non-conformists from all walks of life, whether you choose to wear a suit and tie or just a thong everyone seems to fit in here and no one seems to judge. The boardwalk is where you will find most of the action. The beach itself isn't too crowded during the week and is a decent place to sunbathe. The skatepark is a great place to spend some time just watching the skaters do their thing as some of these guys and girls are really good! A lot of pro skaters grew up here and a lot still come back. The boardwalk is where most of the action is, after walking up and down checking out the shops its great to grab a bench and just take in the vibe and surroundings that you will not find anywhere else because there really is no where like Venice Beach. Some people find it to be a bit intimidating but its safe, it may be a little gritty and seem rough around the edges but hey, this is Venice, not Disneyland. Have fun!",Brad S

30,Washington Square Park on the beach (but some good architecture),"Venice Beach is great for enjoying views of the water and checking out the beach front mod architecture (including Frank Gehry's Norton House--you will know it when you see it because, well, it's crazy). Be prepared for local flavor, though, including encampments of beach residents, skateboarders, and that faint sniff of patchouli plus whatever.

30,"It's not a must see, but if you have time","I think we went there once or twice in the past years, simply because the culture is fun and some of the stores are really eclectic. Is it a must see? No, I think there are nicer beaches in the area, but it is fun for people watching and some of the skateboarders are super talented and it is amazing watching them for a while. I think if you simply want a quiet beach, Redondo might be less crowded and better.",Jesena
50,The beach,"It is all about freedom. A lot of hand made art , paintings, jelwery ,street art, sport. And the beach actually is a good one to relax, make tan and enjoy one Sunday with the family.",Tsvetislava I
10,Pathetic! Forgettable!,"Why is this place mentioned so often and held in such high regard? The stretch from Venice Beach via Muscle Beach to Santa Monica Pier is full of homeless people, whom I feel sorry for, human wrecks who have had too much alcohol or drugs and wheeler dealers flogging their junk... what a waste of time",744olep
40,Cool place to check out local culture,Love visiting this place. I've been to California twice and made time to come here twice both visits. Tons of street vendors and shops all along the boardwalk. Clean beaches with lots of local culture. The beach is not dog friendly but the boardwalk and most shops are.,kp1128
40,Early morning visit,"I decided to go visit the boardwalk early before it got busy. Wonderful views of the ocean and I saw a lot of the local characters at this time of day, before the shop were open.I even saw a movie being filmed there on the basketball courts.The highlights were I saw the Arnold biking with a friend and I saw Muscle Beach.A must see when there are loads of people around.",Darryl Stewart Wellness
30,Its a Must See,"Well I was expecting more, it was a bit disappointing. Lots of homeless people everywhere, I'm use to that being in the Detroit area but this was was way over the top, they are all over the place and just yell and scream a lot. It definitely brought down the experience for me, but the vendors and scene is very cool, surfers, muscle beach area and skate shops are very cool, its a must do when in Venice",KylefromWindsor

40,California Hot Shock!,"OMG! Venice Beach boardwalk is a bit difficult to describe. It’s definitely interesting but also strange. You get to see all kinds of strange activities including street performers, pot shops, t-short vendors and cafes. This is definitely the place to spend a Sunday afternoon. Parking is a bit tight, so prepare to walk a bit. Do bring a hat for the sun and drinking water to stay hydrated.",Dude_IN_LosAngeles
50,A must see,"You can't come to LA and not visit Venice Beach. It's exactly as you see in the movies, with its famous boardwalk and eclectic mix of visitors and residents. There are plenty of souvenir shops and food outlets, and it's easy to spend a few hours watching the world go by. The outdoor gym area is fun to watch, and there is always someone showing off their gym skills.",Evalu8
40,Venice Boardwalk is Adventure by the Sea a Southern California treasure,"Imagine Sun Sea Surf and array of characters from all walks of life.

Of course try surfing or body surfing in ocean waves, eat at Hot Dog on Stick, lemonade so refreshing, fly a kite walk Venice pier see all the shops, bars, restaurants-great to people watch. See the area of characters on walking path as you walk by performers doing magic tricks, masseuses, musicians dancing shows, juggling to eating glass you never know what will pop up!

50,"Interesting, eye-opening place","I felt compelled to write this review after having seen so many of the adverse comments left by others. I own a home on the Boardwalk and visit Venice several times a year with my children who are 13, 12 and 8 years old. There is no doubt that Venice is gritty. Yes there are homeless people around. Human beings that have fallen on hard times that live in a supportive community in Venice. Yes, there is a lot of Marijuana around and for sale - but this is legal in California. Clearly you have to be very careful at night. But that's true for so many parts of LA. During the day this is an interesting, diverse and exciting place to be with an atmosphere and energy that's almost unique. The skate park is fantastic, and this part of the Strand is amazing for walking, running, biking. There is an amazing range of restaurants in the area. I think if you come from a more conservative part of the country and have a point of view about society that's less tolerant, maybe this isn't the right place for you. But I think for most people this would make a great place to visit.",ahs0304
30,OK,"Tons of stores selling T-shirts, a lot of folks just hanging out. Some areas of the boardwalk are NOT open to bikers but you can bike on the designated bike path that goes all the way to Santa Monica. I would not make a special trip to see this place.",Cruisinbob
40,All wakes of life,"This will always be somewhere you have to tick off your must see list if you're ever in LA. It's got everything. It's seedy and romantic, it's old fashioned and full of life. There are sellers, surfers, homeless, cafes, tattooists, freaks, families, palm trees, cyclists, dancers, druggies, music, art, signs, beach.... I could just go on. I would recommend only coming here during daylight hours. As I've mentioned in another post, it does have an element of Lost Boys about it! Don't hang out here at night!",Suzy M

Its totally a tourist village of silly t shirt shops and junk to buy you dont need or really want. if you have to have a Venice Beach t shirt, then go.

I guess in a way I did too. The beach is very wide from the shops to the water, unlike the beaches we have in Australia, so you tend to just walk along the pathway next to the shops ( it was January so not the best time to go swimming anyway). The exercise/gym area was not being used by anyone but there were people playing basketball and a type of tennis with small racquets on a smaller court. There is also a large skate park area with several pools not far from the shops connected by path There are plenty of shops selling food, drinks, clothes, souvenirs, skateboards, etc....Been there now!",retePPeter
40,Experience it Once,"Yes, this is probably the Times Square of LA but go just once to say you've been there.

50,The ultimate summary of LA is here!!,"Having previously worked as a photographer on the boardwalk I can tell you that for locals and tourists alike, this place has everyone from every walk of life and just about everything for sale you could think of that a beach town could offer, not to mention free when you don't include cost of transportation/food. It used to be the #1 tourist attraction but it fell after a car drove through the public but as everything, it is making a comeback! This place can be driven to but try to take the streets off of the 10 or better yet take public transportation! From union station there is the 733 bus that takes you directly there!!",yeyalorente
50,Relaxing,It's a nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. It's always nice to see the water even though it was a bit chilly in December.

40,Fun,"Great fun just had watching everyone. The skaters were great entertainment, even if it took 5 attempts to jump the cone...see picture! A vast array of shops catering for just about every taste available...some ok, some great, some not to our tastes, but heh ho that is Venice Beach Boardwalk! There is plenty to do apart from looking at all the shops. The beach is great, another vast expanse of Californian sand with great views. We weren't there for that long but I'm sure with more time you could spend hours exploring and continually finding new and wacky things!",Kohinoor12

When we went to Muscle beach (work out station} was closed as we got there just befors sunset. They have a skateboad park along the path that's interesting to watch. During the week the shops were closing at 4:30 I hear they stay open a bit longer on Saturdays. Warning after the sun sets the wierdness starts,the shops are closed and not a place for familys or children after dark. Some of the vendors and locals are homeless and apparently take up the night show.

20,Sketchy,"We went here on a cold and very windy day, maybe that kept some of the tourists away. There was a mix of tourists, families with young kids, and then the locals. Standard low-end souvenir shops galore. Several with drug paraphernalia, which my kids (older ones 15 and 12) caught onto. We saw someone get arrested though not sure for what. We walked up and down the boardwalk, then my kids said they were getting scared so we left. I didn't necessarily feel unsafe though. No need to come back, but perhaps a more eclectic atmosphere in the summer if more people are skateboarding, etc.",ebs0303

30,"Tacky, teeshirts and tattoos","Disappointing visit to something that is promoted as a ""must to see""! The area was not clean and appeared to be neglected apart from the street vendors and a few tourists. The approach to the area suggests beach car parks are away from the boardwalk and the unsuspecting follows the signs and pays USD 10 per visit whilst the knowledgeable proceed to the beach front and pay USD 6 ! The boardwalk is full of tee shirt shops and tattoo artists with street vendors and their carts selling everything from pictures, paintings, carvings and fortune telling. All rather tacky. There were a few examples of body building facilities and the beach area was clean and well cared for but the boardwalk and cafes and shops were probably not worth the effort to visit during December. Time of visit was between 12 and 2 so could be better later in day.",pavakeal

On to the basket ball counts ( famous for the filming of ""White Men can't Jump"") with its basketball Giants and a rather interesting aroma floating through the air.Next to the skate park, the only place that wasn't really accessible in my wheelchair and involved using crutches a several pairs of hands to get up to watch some amazing shows of 'air time', as well as some crashes of those who were not so successful!There are plenty of stalls selling items at a range of prices, as well as whatever food you fancied.Parking nearby did involve getting there early or having to be very patient driving around waiting for a spot. There are private car parks but if you can wait it is better.",FamilyCW

Don't fall for it, be strong and they will back downBasically the same 10-15 shops repeated all up and down the boardwalk, it's very overrated, if you feel you must go an hour at most will be enough.

30,Tacky,"A must see to believe, Venice beach is a full of fake doctors surgeries selling weed, and fake posers flexing their muscle bound bodies. Keep your hand on your wallet and don't go there at night.",Gary M
30,Day Trip,Nice place to go for a walk along the beach on a sunny day. Boardwalk is also good to buy souvenirs.,keelia_1221
30,A little seedy,The Venice Beach Boardwalk certainly shows you the poorer side of LA. Unfortunately lots of homeless people. Having said that during the day it is safe and lively.,squashed_boxer
40,Tacky,Really quite disappointed with how tacky the place was but having said that we had a pleasant long walk in the sun people watching and just soaking up the atmosphere.Venice Beach walk was something I had wanted to do for so many years but now it is done there is no way I would go back. Santa Monica is so much nicer.,Patrick M
50,Don't Hyde the Boardwalk!,"Burton Chase Park, nearby, was our breezy and shady picnic spotfrom stifling LAX. It was what the Doctor (Jekyll) ordered.On the other side of shady ...Next was our post picnic walk and carnival time at the Mr. Hyde 'Boardwalk.'A one, and a two punch for Wing Commander.Definitely the 'Boardwalk' brings out the best and an entertaining worseabout LA.People watching was off the medical chart of Dr. Jekyll.",Lorenzo el Jefe
10,Ugly,"Only potheads love it. Ugly sleazy does not even begin to describe Venice Beach. This is a freak show. With green marijuana shops on every corner. definitely don't take your kids.Go elsewhere to Hermosa ,Manhattan or Redondo Beach",Joyce and Dean
10,Ugly,"Not what you think, it's very dirty and once the sun goes down don't even think about going over there. It's the same shops over and over again, nothing special. You'll find better shops in downtown Venice.",kaitlin8899
40,Great People Watching,"The beach and boardwalk itself are nice, but people watching is the draw. Eclectic is an understatement. Everything from bodybuilders to roller skaters in bikinis. It's interesting, that's for sure.",MrsW93
40,Gotta see at least once!,Definitely a must see while visiting. Surprised by all the bums and dope smokers. Beach is awesome but boardwalk is just full of shops and homeless.,Ken J
40,Beautiful!,"The ocean and surrounding area was absolutely beautiful. It was a little chilly and windy so I did not walk into the water. The view was worth it and the houses across from the beach were eclectic and stunning. There was a variety of shops and restaurants with great food. Lot's of fun and sight-seeing. But, quite surprised by the homeless that actually live on the beach in makeshift structures.",yjbonner
40,Experience the Boardwalk,"On a clear day, you can't beat the beach. Venice beach has many vendors, food establishments and activities, you will most certainly enjoy feeling the ""flavor"" of the beach side of the city. I run down here a lot and you even get to know a lot of the ""locals"" who live on the beach with their dogs. If you have a few hours, it is definitely worth a visit.",Dee Dee U
20,not very attractive,"maybe because it was not summer, we didn't find this place very attractive. would not go back. the beach looks nice anyway.",MelPhUK
20,disappointed in what we saw and experienced,beautiful beach - nice skateboard park - but was disappointed in the number of homeless people on the boardwalk. 1 morning a beach worker actually ran over a sleeping individual in the sand - didn't hear how the individual survived the incident - but after visiting there i see how it could easily happen.,tndawoods
40,Color of LA CA.,Bohemian drag of LA. The beachfront shops and ateliers cater to the eclectic taste and fills your eyes with sights that are hard to find anywhere else.,vincent13520
40,Must See Urban Park,"It's great to visit and you see a bit of everything. Very scenic and iconic place for pictures. People that find it objectionable for various reasons need to go back to the farm. With that said, it isn't exactly family fare with small kids. Older kids would enjoy it. It's basically an urban park with all that entails.I'd recommend staying away at night. Everything closes down and it's pretty deserted. I was with my partner and the sunset was so beautiful we decided to have dinner at one of the places that stays open. We had parked some distance away during the day because parking is tight. We lingered a bit too long over our beers and by the time we were walking back it was very dark and empty. We saw some gangs pulling in and I was wearing an expensive watch. I quickly took off the watch and pulled all my ID from my wallet and started telling myself I didn't like the watch that much anyhow! But we were alright and made it back to the car with no problems. I've not gotten surprised like that by an area in a long time and usually know when to dress down ahead of time, so just be aware.",Hairspring
50,So much to see!,"This is the beach to go to if you like people watching! There are so many talented artists, musicians, skaters of all differing ages( even old men in business suits) must be a means of transportation, surfers, bicyclists and out door venues, gift shops and restaurants setup on the boardwalk! This is a must see area, don't be surprised at the homeless sleeping there even in the day. Also, this is where muscle beach is, really cool!",Pup101
30,Interesting Place!,"Just got back from visiting this place. Lot's of vendors, places to eat, and activities. Great place to people watch!",Tina M
30,Over rated,We found the boardwalk not that exciting. We thought it was very overrated. The best part was going over to the Skate park,Phil D
40,Crazy - good and bad,"Definitely not your normal beach walk. Lots of strange people, mostly entertaining, but a few scary ones. Worth the visit but gets worse after dark. Lots of small gift shops and the muscle beach area. Skateboarders doing tricks on the walk too. Its an experience!",jasonmbrook
30,A little crubby and the number of homeless people is disturbing.,"The beach is huge and so wide, but its a dirty walk among the most unfortunate people living under umbrellas and cardboard boxes. Lots of little shops and places to eat, but not really very inviting. Such a shame we expected so much more.",Wayne C
50,Excellent,"Well worth the time and effort, something for everyone including Muscle Beach. If you like different cultures all come together then this is definitely the place for you",sirjoker
50,Whacky but great!,"I never thought I would ever understand this boardwalk. Now I live close by and run the boardwalk many times per week. Great place, rich diversity of life.",Ian A
40,Good Work out,we enjoyed wandering along the beach and hired bikes for a couple of hours so we could see Santa Monica beach and pier too. Lots of gift shops etc. great to say you've been to Venice Beach!,Sals1701
10,SMELLS,This place smells like piss. It was an okay walk but not worth it in my opinion. I woudlnt go again.,Shayna W
10,Down and Out Theme Park,I ran here from Santa Monica Pier and experienced nothing but down and outs looking through bins or sleeping rough in ramshackle shelters made out of junk. Jim Morrison and the 60's chill out vibe has long gone and there really is nothing worth visiting for.,Darren W
50,I want to live here!,"I loved this place, the vendors, tons of people all over, the beautiful beach, the drumming session that was taking place, the diversity and the sunset! The only thing I didn't like was the constant smell of marijuana, it truly was overwhelming. It's a total beach paradise so don't expect to find luxury restaurants, flip flops and beach wear is it. Lots of vendors with so many different things to sell and such creative stuff, the skateboarding, roller skating, and muscle beach....it truly was a fun experience. Highly recommend it.",made1024
50,Always a side show,"You never know what you will see, yet it's always a slice of oddities, street performers and vendors.",SMOgal
30,Like Blackpool but with sun and weed,"Definitely a tad seedy, but worth the walk to experience it. If you are in the market for a tattoo or a t shirt this is your place. The kids enjoyed watching the skate boarders.",hmsbimble
50,Such a slice of LA,"If you want a slice of LA life, amongst the beach bums, skaters and dogwalkers, this if for you. We felt so at home here.",DAJT
40,Biked it,"Venice Beach area and boardwalk can be overwhelming with the different people you encounter, the smells, the craziness and carnival like atmosphere. But, we rented a tandem and biked the whole pathway from Venice beach to well past Santa Monica. Spent a couple of hours enjoying the ride, away form the crowds, just taking in the views.If you've never been on this boardwalk, go in the day time. The boardwalk is wide but full of people, tourists, homeless and beggars. No need to pay and go to see the 'Freak show' because there are enough of them out on the boardwalk to see for free!",Usia2014
20,Full of weirdos!,"We wanted to check this place out as we'd heard great things but when we visited (midweek one afternoon in October) we were pretty disappointed. The whole place seemed super tacky with souvenir gift shops selling cheap tacky t-shirts, a lot of homeless, rubbish and people approaching you offering weed and god knows what other stuff. In my opinion there's far nicer beaches in LA to spend your time.",Chantelle L
50,Great for people watching!!!!!,"This is a must for any tourist.. Plenty of things to do and see. Great for people watching. You can walk, skate , or bike. Plenty of interesting people, dogs. Crazy vendors selling all kinds of stuff. Lots of places to eat and drink along the way. Stay all day and hit the beach!!!!!!",Props555
40,Fun Early in the Day; Perhaps Not Worth the Hype,"Venice Beach Boardwalk is a fun cement path ""on the beach"" and that borders typical ""boardwalk type junk/t-shirt stores."" It's a fun place to people watch, from hip Hollywood to the unfortunate homeless who seem to gravitate to this part of town. All kinds of characters walking, sitting and riding on the boardwalk. Go for the walk, go for the people watching - no need to go for any of the vendors! Personally, near lunch and later traffic is a bear; parking is very expensive and, for my time, money and effort, it's not worth it. But, fun if you have the patience for crown.",Richard G
20,Do you need a medical marijuana card?,That's literally all they try to push you here for. Great area if it wasn't for all the rift raft trying to push that part of the culture.,gotfondue
50,The Camden of California,"Venice Beach can be likened to London's Camden, full of interesting one-off shops and stalls. The people are equally interesting characters, each quirky and bizarre breaking up the mass of tourists who walk up and down the strip. The famous 'muscle beach' work out area was widely photographed as was a semi-naked man protecting his modesty with a sign offering to reveal whats behind it in exchange for some money (which i actually found quite amusing). There are plenty of touristy shops selling merchandise pertaining to the area as well as well-stocked 'fake designer' t-shirt shops. All in all a vibrant and interesting place and a must-see for tourists and locals alike.",Laura Didden
40,Venice,"It's Venice Beach, beautifully grungy. Nice place to get low priced souvenirs, see street performers, are hang out with your friends",Bianka S

40,Still in the 70s,This place still feels like the 70s and 80s with all its art and graffiti and unique architecture. The beach was beautiful and its fun to watch all the surfers.,marield1990
40,Amazing,"Nothing else like it. Diverse with amazing art and music all the way down the boardwalk. Would recommend renting a bike and riding along the paths, as well as visiting the skatepark and muscle beach. Nice food, although there could be more choice. The frozen yoghurt place is excellent. Also the toilets along the boardwalk are very untidy would recommend going to one in a bar or cafe. Wouldn't be the same if the homeless didn't find refuge there, it seems that they provide a large amount of the music up and down the boardwalk but not all of it. The retail shops are mostly all the same selling the same things- could be more choice / diversity of what products the shops sell. If you visit LA you need to go to Venice boardwalk.",Jmemul
40,Sunny afternoon,"It was great to shop along the board walk. There are a variety of shops located on the broad walk. It was great to see lots of walkers, travelers and skaters out on the boardwalk on the day I was there.",Apopka1564
10,"Dirty, Dangerous, No Longer A Great Place To Visit","I rated Venice Beach only one star as well because of how dangerous it is now. People that sell their items will get into your personal space, so that they can intimidate you into buying their trinkets. They will even follow you if you don't. My mom who is bearly 5 feet tall in her 80's had three men surround her to pressure her into buying something. A local said that there was a shooting not too long ago and that crime is up in that area. Not surprised in the least because we witnessed an actual physical fight between two random strangers. Venice Beach has always been dirty, but now any redeeming qualities it has are no longer remdeeming enough for us to visit.",7books

50,It is a 'human' spectacle - and an associated experience of...,"The boardwalk at Venice Beach was important for us to see for several reasons, on very different, yet connected levels. These are, of course, entirely personal, and what this place will mean to you will be generated by what you want from it.The boardwalk is full of characters, from all walks of life. It is a real spectacle to see and superb for just hanging around, experiencing and people watching. Make of it what you will.Parking can a be a little tight, but is obviously easier first thing in the morning or later in the afternoon. We loved our visit here.",Harrison F. Carter

30,Dirty,Great for a bike ride. Shops along the promenade tacky and not cheap. Buildings look a bit run down. Cheaper cousin of Santa Monica,Isobel S
30,Average boardwalk on a nice beach,"Visited the boardwalk at Venice Beach. There seemed to be quite a bit going on, between the handball courts, the skate park and all the boardwalk shops. Quite a bit of homeless people and police where around quite a bit. Looked like they were issuing tickets to the homeless people, but not sure if there was more to it.",JeffR200

50,The premier place to people-watch and soak up sun in LA,"I love this place. Totally funky - shops and people both. Crowded afternoons on the weekends, great place to sit and eat, walk around, shop for crafts or just soak up the sun. Can walk to the surf anytime. Never the same twice. Watch out for all sorts of wheeled transport as you wander around.",erikkieser
50,What a place,"This boardwalk is mental, cool, fun, scary, beautiful and mesmerising. If you are in LA you have to see this place. I would definitely advise not to go at NIGHT. Go any time up to the early evening. This boardwalk has all sorts going on and it is a great place to people watch.IT IS A DIFFERENT WORLD. I went here 3 days in a row for a couple of hours because I loved Venice so much. See the canals and don't venture up any dodgy alley ways on your own, this place can be dodgy so don't think you know this place or get to confident, just enjoy it and be safe. You may see drugs being taken, lots of homeless and possibly people, fighting, my advice is just ignore it and enjoy the rest.",Centre p
50,A WOW place to Walk or Bike,Freaky is a good description of a walk along this strip of beach but Bike riding superb. Lots of choices to indulge your throwback days in terms of dress and shops. Best part is bike riding which is further out from walkers/shop areas and only a couple of miles to Santa Monica Pier. And Sunsets to marvel at while having a Gelato--what's not to love??,Forrest L
10,Terrible disappointment,"Walked along this way walkway for a short distance, could not tolerate the smell of weed and urine, people approaching and trying to sell things. Homeless tent people living all along the walkway, so very sad to see. Very dirty, the outhouse bathroom facility was the most disgusting thing I've ever had to use. Muscle beach was nothing to look at, skateboard area was entertaining. Tourist gift shops all along the path. Parking areas nearby and cost $15 for 3 hours or $20 for the day. Would not go again, once is more than enough!",DmcA61
50,Great place to visit!!,"This place is fun, specially on weekends. If you don't mind the crowd, this is a great place to enjoy music, shows, food and just people watch. rent a bike and go up to Santa Monica and back.",John W
50,Just Fun Fun Fun!,"I just had the best time cycling along this boardwalk. I stayed in Marina del Rey so cycled to Santa Monica most days, it’s probably the thing I miss most. The people, the sights, the ocean, the mountains, so much to take in and all at your own pace. Brilliant!",SwissSooosi
50,A carnival of strange delights.,"Venice Beach is a smorgasbord of people and experiences. From the smell of weed wafting over the boardwalk to the homeless rodeo opposite the shops, it's an experience not to be missed. You've got music, muscle men, acrobats, hustlers, losers, tourists, wannabes, weirdo's and everything in between. Go there and enjoy the best people watching in the world!",Kevin W
50,Lot's of fun,"Venice beach boardwalks offers a variety of nice stores and places to eat as well. it is way better than ocean drive in Miami. I rented a bicycle to cruise around and made the experience much better. The Venice beach freak show on the boardwalk is a must watch as well, I believe the entrance to the freak show was only $10. I recommend to rent a bicycle they give you a lock as well and it's very inexpensive and saves time.",mario v
50,I loved it here,I absolutely loved Venice Beach - I hired rollerskates from 'Venice Bike and Skate In' for $8 for one hour. Skating along the boardwalk is so much fun and there are two lanes - one for walking and one for cyclists etc. This makes it easy to move along and not bump into everyone! I would definitely come back here.,Chloe D
30,nice boardwalk,a long boardwalk to take a walk. We went there in september and it was still enough warm to go walk. Some people here are walking with their dogs some ride bicycle so be carefull not to ocupy bicycle road.,Semih A
50,There's more than 1 Freak Show!,"There are many many many free shows going on at the Venice Beach Boardwalk in LA thankfully! And although I haven't partied with the five dollars to see the two headed chicken nor the bearded lady I enjoy watching all the street performers from one end to the other. In fact, if you can score a table near the sidewalk you definitely should do so. That way you can watch the freak show us your body while sipping your favorite libation! EnJOY",Papa G
30,Nice getaway area,Definitely a spot to visit while in LA. Its very vibrant and lots of places to shop or you can just take the day and chill on the beach. You might even see some surfers.,bluehova
50,BRING YOUR ROLLER BLADES AND JOIN IN,"LA deserves an award. The genius of their 'boardwalk' system, that runs north-south from Santa Monica to Redondo is amazing. One can cruise all day on a bike, stop and enjoy. The boardwalk around Venice is especially fun given the unique demographic that migrates to this area. A must do!",SenorGancho
30,"Ok, slightly dirty. Sunny","Often considered a must do in LA so it was a bit of a let down. Beach is gorgeous but the boardwalk is a bit dirty. I guess there is a movement to ""keep Venice weird"" but by weird they mean leathery and with dogs roaming off leash. Worth a quick look for people watching or if you want souvenirs. Bring a hat if you're sensitive to the sun.",Magellan1492
40,ode to a special friend,"We went not sure what to expect & were not disappointedIt was a very busy bustling area, not quite as glamorous as I've seen on TV but still very alive.

10,horrible,"Stayed in Santa Monica and went for a walk along the boardwalk. Horrible place, so many homeless (but that seems to be a problem in the area generally), dirty, seedy and tatty shops. Beautiful beach but let down by the boardwalk area. So glad we did not stay there.",Jonesy1974
20,Pretty Underwhelming,"This is often on the list of things you 'must do' when going to LA. It is worth checking out I guess but just be wary before going, there are a lot of homeless people scattered around.We stayed right on the beach front for 4 nights which was nice and quite close to a few of the local bars (which were all good fun).Be aware there are going to be people approaching you with things to buy and quite a large homeless community that live along the boardwalk. The shops sell Venice branded clothing which are good for gifts but not overly impressive.I would say it is worth a trip out to look at, but quite overrated.",curlu
50,Great for artsy and people-watching types!,"The Boardwalk is great for a nice afternoon or early evening stroll. You can catch street performers and entertainers, buy some pop art, or check out one of many shops along the sidewalk (both for souvenirs and other products). I probably wouldn't recommend eating around there; I've never really craved anything along the sidewalk, and it's overpriced anyway. Parking can definitely be a problem with nearby parking lots at full capacity, especially in the afternoons with pleasant beach weather (it helps to be an excellent parallel parker). If that's the case, be prepared to walk further out or pay a bit extra.",adrenalinejunkie007
50,The mother of all beaches,"This is the most varied, lively and stretched/spacious beach I have ever been. It also has a great wow-factor mainly caused by the (remarkable and sometimes crazy) people walking here, and the available sport facilities, shops, restaurants, attractions and it has the greatest pier on the US west coast . I find it the mother of all beaches.",Glenn M
50,Great for people watching!,"Venice beach is the perfect place to take a stroll and people watch. I didn't do any shopping, but there are tons of little shops to explore.",Naturespeak

30,Interesting,"This is another tourist trap with shops selling usual tourist merchandise and restaurants with over priced food, good to see the area the best part is the beach it was beautiful. there is a lot of homeless in the area but they don't bother you and a lot of guys trying to give you FREE CDs just walk on or it'll cost you $. There is various parking areas costing around $10 a day.",Kev977

10,Dirty,Ugh is all I can say. Strong smells of cannabis and very dirty. Typical beach type stores with cheap t-shirts and trinkets. Some curbside street entertainment. I suppose when there are volleyball tournaments it can be fun. You are either into this type of stuff or you're not. It definitely was not for me.,Dlbos
50,Always fun,"Venice boardwalk is fun for anyone, tourist or local. You have the beach and ocean right there, volleyball courts and a boardwalk full of restaurants and shops. While the restaurants are not amazing, they are ok for lunch. There is a great poke shack down the boardwalk closer to the beginning of it. The shops, while mostly sell tourist items, there are a few cool spots.Be careful though, do not take pictures of the ""artists"" work on the boardwalk. They do not allow it and it could get ugly if you do.Also, once in a awhile, a man in a red van toward the opposite end of the boardwalk comes down and sells semi-precious stones for a good price.",Easton E
50,Great place to spend the day,"This is a wonderful place to spend the day. It is a quick 3 mile walk from the Santa Monica Pier and you can meet people from all over the place in those 3 miles.

50,Great place to relax and see the wacky,Venice beach is great to go for a stroll but be prepared to see some bizarre characters. Nothing dangerous just out of the norm.

If you're in town this is a must see and when you're all set enjoy the beach!,Pole K
30,A bit deceiving...,"The view is very nice, there are a lot of little shops full of cute and fun stuff to buy. But the big downside is that you cannot walk a meter without seeing a homeless person.

50,Great place for people watching,"Went here with company from Germany because they hear so much about it. Unfortunately, we got there close to sunset time and most the performers had left. Still walked up and down the nice boardwalk, enjoyed the sunset, and walked by the famous Muscle Beach. I have been before several times and is a great place to people watch and sometimes get lucky to see a great performer. Tourist type shops to shop in with many places to get food.",Patricia F

40,So much more than I expected,During our brief stay in Santa Monica I thought it would be interesting to see Fisherman's Village. Took a taxi there and was underwhelmed so we decided to walk back to SM pier via the Broadwalk. So pleased that we did. So many sights and sounds. Really busy as it was Labor day weekend. Amazing never seen anything like it before and all free entertainment. Also visited Venice Canals Walkway on the way back to the pier another sight well worth a visit.,midengland2016
40,"I love it, but it's not for everyone","Read the reviews. They're pretty spot-on, both the positive reviews and the negative ones.The good: great people watching, iconic sights like Muscle Beach, huge drum circles, and the skate park. I could spend hours watching the skateboarders, especially the little ankle-biters mixing up with the adults -- I swear you're likely to see the next Tony Hawk! The shops sell all kinds of silly tourist swag, beach food, and yes, ""medical"" weed. You can rent a bike and see a lot more -- it's a quick ride down to the Santa Monica Pier. If you walk out to the ocean where the rocks are (just south of Muscle Beach), you can see teensy crabs scrabbling around on the huge boulders.The bad: Yes, there are scammers. Just be smart and watch your wallet, and don't talk to anyone you don't want to talk to. It's perfectly safe during the day, but extremely crowded at times, which is pickpocket heaven for any large city's busiest tourist traps. That said, many of the buskers are playing truly beautiful music. Just stroll around 'til you find someone good. There are a few pop-up shows that are funny and entertaining, and will draw large crowds. If you're lucky (or not depending on your personality), it'll be a weekend when they're having some kind of ""parade"" or other. The people watching gets REALLY good when that happens.Basically, if you're uncomfortable in large crowds, around homeless people (there are many on the boardwalk, so you will definitely see them and their over-full shopping carts), in an area where people are smoking pot, then skip Venice Beach. Otherwise, you can spend a fun afternoon hanging out with all the freaks and geeks down at the beach.",jooley_ann
50,Great Boardwalk,LOTS to see and do.... MANY MANY Shops and good places to eat.... not mention the famed MUSCLE beach.....,David P
30,A little unusual for my liking but worth a visit,"It's a place where the homeless hang out, an overflow of London's Camden Town for hippies and born agains, with a strong aroma of ganja weed and hashish in most places. Perhaps the reader will love an opportunity to breath it all in (literally) but for me, it lacks the qualities of other beach towns such as Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey.There are times when the beach is decent, usually early in the morning and the beach itself is decent enough. The promenade/ broad walk itself is full of eclectic restaurants, bars, gift shops, tattoo parlours and yoga centres. There's even a freak show about mid way down but I didn't need to pay the $5 to enter as you'll see plenty of unusual characters walking (and sitting) along there.The broadwalk comes to life on weekends but rest assured, it quietens down each evening. Go to be curious but not because it's amazing!",Craig M
50,It's all happening on the boardwalk!,"Stretching well over a kilometre the Venice Beach boardwalk is a visual feast with so much happening - men pumping iron at the outdoor gymnasium; street performers doing their thing; religious zealots declaring we will go to hell if we don't profess our love for Jesus; shops and stalls selling clothing, food, and even medicinal marihuana.The skateboard rink is a must see with local skateboarders trying to outdo each other on the elaborate course.",John v
40,Just have to visit,"If in LA you have to go here, even if its just to say you have been. We went at the weekend and lots going on, not sure how busy it would be mid week. Super soft sand, grab a bite to eat at the Sidewalk Cafe, be prepared to wait for a table",John T
30,Not what I expected,"Television and movies have given me the wrong perception of what Venice Beach would look like. Its not what I expected. You would think that the city would maintain the physical appearance of the beach since its such a huge tourist attraction but they don't. It was dirty and smelly walking on the boardwalk. They have tons of shops and vendors to visit while on the boardwalk. You can rent bikes or skates but stay away from the skateboarding area. They do not care about invading your personal space. Overall, it was an average beach.",kdoug19
50,See previous Santa Monica Pier review,"Great place to go solo, or with friends, no better place to exercise, or just kick back and people watch. Something for everyone!",carl c
10,Basicall a Cesspool,"The entire place looks like a third-world bazaar and smells like sewage. If you want to see skateboarders and body builders, OK, but the so-called ""art wall"" is just graffiti-covered concrete. Lots of seedy-looking hustlers.",gkras
50,"Super nice boardwalk, under the californian sun","We had a really great time over there, cycling all along the boardwalk (2 hours max), under a perfect sun.Make sure to make a stop to the Venice canals.The beach is amazing, this is really a must-see in LA.",Thomas0902

50,Funky and Fun!!,"Greatest bike ride path on the west coast. Full of all colorful walks of life with character and warmth. You can see it all here and along the stretch of the beautiful beach and coast line with sailboats in the distance.

40,Muscle Beach,Go early if you want the beach to yourself. Plenty of space to build sandcastles and get your fix for the beach. If you go early you can get parking near to walking distance to the sea front.,kamali_kuri
50,Take In The Postcard View of California,"If you're in LA, Venice Beach Boardwalk is not to be missed. A bit of a carnival atmosphere in some places, the fish tacos near Muscle Beach are great. Tattoo parlours, skateboarders and guys whizzing by on blades. People walking dogs, children and generally a fun walk. One block East on the main and side streets you'll find good restaurants, reasonably priced with fresh ingredients. Not for a rainy day, but the sun is always shining in Califoirnia!!",Art-Fashion-Travel
40,"Great beach, fun boardwalk","The actual beach is fantastic - clean, soft sand, reasonable surf, and far less crowded at the w/e than nearby Santa Monica. The boardwalk is packed with beach clothes, skier, and surf shops - some pretty good. Loads of cheap eats: Jodi Maroni's was our favourite for tacos or grilled cheese sandwiches.",FoodKGB
40,"Lots of homeless, some crazies, entertaining acts",The best beach food is the smoothie and taco stand right in front of the basketball courts adjacent to Muscle Beach. The fish and korean beef tacos $2 each are AMAZING and so much better than other taco places we went to all over the city!,married2agreek
40,Love Street,"The Venice boardwalk is a filled with many souvenir shops, tattoo parlors, restaurants and everything in between. Local artists line up and sell everything from paintings, wind chimes and melted down vinyl records. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. You can walk over and check out the skateboarders in the skate park or hang out and people watch. They have a freak show exhibit (I didn't check out) and lots of colorful characters around. Rent a bicycle and cruise up and down the coast line, best way to see everything.",Rgd973

50,"Fun, fun, fun - people are great","Venice Beach is a world apart. The boardwalk is like being on another planet. Coming from Switzerland where everything is neat, pretty, perfect, boring (?), the Venice Beach boardwalk is out of this world! I really loved and will go there at different times of day and night in the next 3 days. The first day - Sunday - this is what we experienced:- The drum Circle on the beach- The crazy and skilled skaters in the giant skate park on the beach- The disco on the beach with simple, nice people from all races and religions having a lot of fun together- my son skating- my son playing street chess and winning :-)- hundreds of people showing their art, giving a message, making fun of donald trump, telling a joke for 1$- wierdos- sunshine- fun, fun, fun- humanityI will go back tomorrow morning!",Frenchfrog39
50,Fun,This is a great place to people watch. Some catch you by surprise some are very typical. Lots of shops and sand. Truly a fun place to visit.,Pamela M
40,A fun Sunday,"What more is there to add? People-watching, ice-creams, cafes, sun, fun, dodging bicycles, occasionally hopping over hot sand....quintessential LA ""freak show"" territory, but pretty laid back and relaxed. Pics show lots of sights from our recent (31 July 2016) visit.",Arncliffegirl
40,It's an experience!,If your visiting great place to shop for souvenirs for cheap.. If you like to people watch this is the place to go! What turned me off about it though is all the freaky homeless people.. Me and my son were walking and a big fight broke out with 4 homeless men! We are talking on the ground punching and kicking each other screaming! It made me extremely uncomfortable,Brenda B
50,Great place for all,"This is great area to walk, enjoy, shop etc there are plenty of shops and speciality kiosks selling all sorts of things, the beach, cycle and walking pathsPlaces to sit and drink and people watchHeaven",Barry B

50,Fun!!!,"This place can get somewhat crowded but you haven't visited L.A. if you haven't been at Venice Beach. There is lots to do here, walk, people watch, soak at the beach, bicycling, skate boarding, tattoos, eating, freak show.... plain cheap awesome fun. The water was c-c-c-cold but the kids didn't mind. The $1.00 churros are better than $3.00 ones at Santa Monica.I would recommend you the Firehouse restaurant, it is not at the boardwalk though, it would take you probably a 10-12 minute walk, but it is worth it.",Sandra V

10,"Terrible, sleazy and dirty",What an awful place - full of drunks and addicts / cheap tacky goods sold at twice the price of anywhere else - nothing at all to recommend it. Best bit was getting out safely.,Steve H
50,Another Fun Place,Another fun place to go and get exercise at the same time. You'll find all types of shops from clothes to tees shirts to local food as well as the regular boardwalk pizza and ice cream shops.,John Y
50,Lots to see,"From the quiet end of Venice beach you walk passed houses before hitting the shops and many takeaways. Because the bike route is separate, the walk is much more enjoyable. Best walked at the beginning of the day before it gets too hot. It's fun to stop and watch the games being played including the skate bowl.",Catrina D
40,Must visit! (Don't go early though),A very cool place to visit. A lot of stuff to see. A lot of (weird) people to watch. Relax with a drink at one of the bars. Get some sun on the beach. Visit muscle beach. Awesome street art. Don't go before 10AM if you want the full experience!,Ben_1985_02
40,People Watchers' Paradise,I'm usually not a people watcher - but Venice Beach is the exception! Find a nice cafe on the walkway - order a nice drink and watch the world of interesting people go by.,Susanne L
30,Not what the mind conjures,"Yes its dirty crowded and full of young people on skateboards and just people left over from the 60's and 70's who have not grown up yet.I would come and have alook then I probably would not come back again. Maybe its cool for young people and if I was in my early 20's I would probably find it attractive. Lots of shops selling cheap funny T shirts 3 for $9 and lots of ""Green Medicine "" shops .Put it at the end of your list of things to do.",RickX01
50,VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - WHAT A VARIETY,The boardwalk is hard to describe - you just have to experience it. One could spend the afternoon just people watching. There is just about every type of food that you would want here. There are funky shops with a variety of merchandise. While I was there a few band/music shows popped up - and they were free!! One can go to Venice Beach Boardwalk just to get exercise. I was using my walker and there were some teenagers and young adults on skateboards who weren't watching where they were going but that was the only downside.,kkh8306

30,Great For People Watching,Great place to visit with adults (not with children). You will see some very interesting people. It was my first visit there and it was much dirtier than I expected and lots of homeless people in the area.,Riz29
30,"As previously noted, the Venice Beach area is fun; especially via bike!","Had a great afternoon biking along the path that runs north of the Santa Monica Pier south to Marina Del Ray. Worth the effort? Depends on whether biking is something you enjoy doing. If not, then avoid. If so, then DO go. It's a blast and the folks in Venice Beach are sooooo incredibly stoned . . . er . . . ""laid back"".",JeanValJeanNAZ
40,Best For People-watching,"If you're into people-watching, this is the stroll for you. Almost everyone is on foot, so the pace is comfortable and there is ample time to gawk at the freaks and geeks, the one-man band, the henna and other artists, jewelry sellers and other tourists.

40,young crowd can enjoy,"considering LA you will find a little shabby homeless people on this beach its good to go with a companion and good to go during the day since i had been during the day time when there were tourists.. its quite a sight .. you will find loads of street performers .. and they are entertaining.. its a lively lovely beach..dozens of shops with funny t-shirts, tattoo parlors, massage parlors, gift shops etc",sachindedhia
40,Great Way to Spend an Hour,"Located on Venice Beach and a short stroll or bike ride from Santa Monica Beach, this is a great way to see lots of entertainers, tattoo and souvenir shops, as well as a few restaurants.

It is interesting with lots of local flavor.",J0hnPM10

10,Watch out for t shirt scammers,"This place is very interesting if you dont mind the occasional homeless and mentally questionable occupants, really average food and the ""struggling independent artist"" that wants to sell you their CD. Most was okay and trouble avoidable. Its just a place that you just want to walk through but not touch or buy anything.Trouble was when we had walked into a tshirt souvenir shop to make some memorable tshirts on Venice boardwalk.I recommend that if one must buy a tshirt, buy a preprinted shirt from rack with fixed price. We had some custom made and ended up paying heaps like 100$ total for a sweater and singlet. They smooth talk u into buying a long sleave and singlet for $50 + printing fees; the bloody printing fees are $25 each. When they talk about it they are really vague and try to not talk about it.**We bought a pre printer jumper next door for $17.By the time we realised it was too late and they were printed. If tshirts have to be printed in the store, just walk away. All the designs are the same between most the shops anyways.",Sangsu S

30,A lot of Bums,"It is a unique experience, yes. I think you should do it at least once. However, you need to brace yourself for the bums, weed, and black dudes trying to sell you autographed CD's. It really is annoying. Luckily, there is a police presence should you need it.",runaway2travel

40,Lots to See,"This was my first, and only time to visit Venice Beach. I'd see it many times in movies and TV shows, and expected to see the homage to Jim Morrison and the Doors.If people watching interests you, this is a fantastic place to go. Of course, people are also watching you. The weather was sunny and warm, and the boardwalk was jammed with people and sidewalk vendors. Many of the storefronts and vendors sold cheap souvenirs. We stopped and watched a tumbling/acrobatic act that used audience volunteers as part of the act. Though free to watch, the performers vigorously pressed the crowd for donations...they didn't want change or dollars, rather $5, 10 or 20! Watching the skateboarders practicing their tricks at the skateboard park was fun.We stopped at a couple of places for a quick lunch and beers...numerous places to choose from.",jann191
50,You haven't experienced Venice until you've walked the Boardwalk,"We've been to Venice Beach many times in the past 15 years, each time strolling the Boardwalk at least once during each visit. It's a perfect place to find that beach t-shirt (at a great price!) or get a piece of jewelry or hand-made souvenir. We don't usually spend much, but checking out the businesses is fun, and people-watching is certain. If you start at the Venice pier and walk north you'll get all the way to the Santa Monica pier, a good long walk, and sometimes more fun by bike if it's pretty busy. Bikes are available at several locations, and there are eating places all over. Check out Trattoria (near the Venice pier) for a delicious dinner! Take a side journey east a few blocks and you'll reach the canals, a beautiful stroll!",cynsha
40,There are no words..,There is definitely something to say about the Venice Beach Boardwalk.. It's not like what you've seen in the movies.. There's tons of people watching.. Lots of people selling goods.. Lots of musicians... Very very busy with a variety of people.. Most locals have said this is not a place you want to be at night.. I see why.. I may venture down there one more time this week for souvenir shopping,Jamie C
30,People watching,"It is different and depending on what you would like to see and diverse. It has homeless, drugged up hippies and hipsters. Also muscle beach is an interesting attraction. The beach is vast and great for bike riding, walking and taking in a swim and some sun. Shopping opportunities available and lots of foodie and drink places. Interesting place and awesome for people watching.",IstanbulRaine
30,Smells of wee and pot!,"Whilst travelling the PCH we stopped here in the early evening for a look and something to eat and to say we'd been. It was still light and we found a car park one block back from the boardwalk. There were lovely murals on the buildings. The first indication of its seediness, though, was the smell of wee in the car park. Then, when I asked how to get to the canals from there the parking attendant told us it was not far but not to walk there!! We were hungry and he told us the place to eat was round the corner at the Sidewalk Cafe because of the people and the food. It was a great place to people-watch right beside the skate park. It was quite atmospheric because a very scruffy guy, who I think was homeless, played a grand piano on the boardwalk outside while we ate. He played Pachelbel's Canon in D amongst other things. But by the time we had finished and before I could give him some money he had covered it up with cardboard, blankets and tarpaulin and left... Or maybe he was sleeping under it! The boardwalk felt seedy, the atmosphere intimidating and not a place to hang about after sunset. Lots of homeless people and many people were smoking pot on our route back to the car park with the children. We did not bother trying to find the canals and we're glad to drive back into Los Angeles!",Falkirkdolly
50,People Watching Paradise!,Enjoy a beautiful day in the Sun on the Beach by watching the people on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Watch and enjoy your children play or go without the kids and watch the people. There is no peer for watching people. Your eyes will bug out at times!,wwileyb

Touristy shops that aren't worth your time line the streets but go for the people. Wide comfortable board walk rolls along some of the US's most beautiful beaches!,Penny J
40,People Watching Overload,Pick any day of the week and you will gain an appreciation for humanity by simply picking a spot on the boardwalk and observing what happens around you. There are lots of cheap eating establishments to support you while you invest time on the beach. The beach itself is fairly accessible and most of the tourists find themselves at some point leaving the beach and shopping in the shops or watching the weight lifters do their thing. If you combine a few hour commitment to this area (with or without getting in the water) with a stroll up the canals you won't be disappointed.,Troy L
50,Something to see,"I was familiar with Venice and Venice Boardwalk from californication and other movies/tv shows. My boyfriend and I parked and walked down the boardwalk and just people watched and 'window shopped' by vendors. It's a pretty wild scene, anything goes.

40,Famous Venice Boardwalk,"Venice Beach Boardwalk it's really great, full of people, colorful and loud during the weekend, calm and relaxing at the weekdays.

You look on the left: wide sand beach and the blue ocean, you look on the right: stores selling sunglasses and t-shirts. Typical beach scene, until you see homeless men living under grand piano on the boardwalk and playing it too, when he had enough to drink. You can entertain yourself by watching or participating in the women's weight lifting competition on the ""muscle beach"". You can eat, drink, roller skate, fly kites, bike, swim, play chess and get marijuana prescription from numerous shops. Each one of this shops have helpful ""doctor"" who will find medical reason for you to use their product. No gondolas and nobody is singing Santa Lucia.",Tanya Len
40,Venice Beach and Santa Monica Beach Boardwalks,"While the boardwalks at Venice Beach and Santa Monica are very different, I'd recommend both for different reasons. The Venice boardwalk is the place to be if you want excellent people watching. You'll find everything from khaki wearing parents with strollers to freaks and skateboarders and artists. Regardless, everyone is friendly (it's hard for anyone to be upset at a beach like this), and hanging out for a bite to eat or drink is a great way to catch a glimpse of it. Venice has more grit than Santa Monica, but it's a lot of fun. At Venice, you'll find more shops, boardwalk vendors, a skateboard park, performers, and options for eat & drink.The boardwalk in Venice connects to Santa Monica's. Right away, you'll notice that Santa Monica is much more refined. While its boardwalk is nice and leisurely to take a walk or bike ride, the Santa Monica pier has more action with their theme park, vendors, and restaurants. On one stretch of the boardwalk, they have a fitness course with balance bands, monkey bars, and rings that anyone can try. At night, the crowd at the pier is more lively and the ferris wheel lights are something to catch if you get a chance.Also, if you are handicapped, you will want to consider bringing your own walker or wheel chair. We had issues trying to reserve a motorized beach wheel chair for my mom. Both Los Angeles and Santa Monica governments advertise on their web sites that they supply non-motorized and motorized beach wheelchairs to various locations up and down the boardwalk at Perry's Café and at a community center with a list stating how many wheel chairs they have at each location. However, we found that this was NOT the case! I called every location in Santa Monica and Venice, and they either didn't carry them anymore, said they were out for maintenance, only had a single non-motorized wheel chair, or didn't know what I was talking about. As a result, my mom couldn't access the beach like we hoped. So handicapped people should be aware of this issue and that the LA and SM web sites are either outdated or incorrect; and they should plan to bring their own equipment if they want to enjoy the beach or a lengthy stretch of the boardwalk.Overall, we did like both boardwalks. Venice for the people watching and Santa Monica for the pier. The beach is wide and clean, although the water is a bit chilly.",Mike S

Between the diverse variety of people(,some normal, some not so much) & the 50 shades of ganja smell, it's the Capitol for People Watching. There's lots of arts & craft vendors(most shady, some actually decent) & a good variety of food choices. There's also a rooftop bar, High Rooftop Lounge, that has awesome views for picture taking. Just a heads up, the pathway from Venice Boardwalk to Santa Monica Beach, if you plan on walking, is pretty darn long.",SharkInAFishTank
50,Great place to take a stroll,"Whether you are with friends or family the Venice boardwalk is a must. Watch the people, shop the stores or just come by.

For me the place feels worldly!",Footloose73
30,It Depends...,We personally did not like the area. But I think it depends on what you like really. Lots of shops with reasonable stuff but I feel it's geared more toward adults. The skate board park is interesting to see. But the boardwalk was kinda a dirty area.We also did see a homeless man getting picked on and pushed around. Luckily enough there are police patrolling the area often.Glad we seen it but won't be going back.I would say it's not a good area to go with little kids.,MsshellyB

50,If In Town You Have to Take a Walk on Our Boardwalk,"It is not made of boards, it is all cement, but it is a great boardwalk. Start at Windward in Venice and start walking North. It is great fun. There are artists, and singers, and crazy people, there is a bunch of stuff you don't want to buy from vendors, there is a pot shop (get your medical card there) and there are incense stands.Mixed in with all the above are skateboarders, the bike path near by, some great little restaurants and a couple really bad ones.There are still houses on the boardwalk so please don't get drunk and act like an idiot, you know the way a lot of the locals do.Parking is okay. You will pay, but it is not crazy.On the weekends it is packed but you will be able to walk and have fun.The boardwalk is not spotless, we have a homeless population there and we have drug addicts. Ignore what you can and have fun. There are good homeless projects right in the area. Please do not give money to people. Many will use it, sadly, for meth.While in Venice, your wallet is in your front pocket. The area is well patrolled and it is fun.",elizabethlascheid

20,Disappointing,"Let's just say walking through here, on a day that wasn't a particularly nice beach day so fairly quiet, I made sure to hold my child's hand a little tighter. Plenty of homeless people around, smells of urine, and cheesy tourist type shops. The highlight was the marijuana store right there on the strip. People were taking pictures in front of it. There are far nicer beaches to walk around. The outdoor work out area was run down with a high charge to walk inside the caged area.",Baybreez

I loved strolling down and looking at all the interesting market stalls and people.Obviously we knew it could be a bit of a dodgy place, but I certainly didn't expect for my partner to start being grabbed and have CDs forced into his hands. After politely saying no and giving them back to the disgruntled young men they came from, we were a little tired of this happening. So much so that I saw one coming towards my boyfriend, smiled and nodded no thank you before he got to us and he proceeded to shout at me and tell my boyfriend to keep me on a leash. That added a sourness to our afternoon for about 5 minutes, but never the less, it was irritating.Other than the harassment and rude cd sellers, we had a great time!",Lauren Grace

Venice Beach is pure LA style - dripping with urban art, vagrants and panhandlers, great food, and interesting characters.

A bit touristy and fake, but I'm pretty sure that still just describes LA overall.Definitely worth stopping by.",Jared M

All genres are represented, anti government, dope smoking, old hippies, muscle dudes at the outdoor gym, all very relaxed and a great atmosphere. Lots of T shirts and cheap eats.

Great bar scene at night.",Dar
30,Interesting but really a lot of hustlers,"At first it's interesting but wears on you quickly. There are some genuine artists along the way but most are hustlers trying to get your money. It's too bad because I think it overshadows the real artists and musicians. its not a bad place to get cheap souvenirs but if you have a chance to go downtown, The Santee Alley is better.",daverich
30,One to tick off the list,After reading a lot of 'top things to do in LA' lists we made a trip to Venice beach a priority. While we are glad we went and saw it I must say we probably wouldn't visit again and certainly wouldn't go alone. Enjoyed watching the skateboarders and the fact it was so easily accessible by public transport but found walks along other boardwalks in California a lot more enjoyable than here.,bethcopp
30,"Colorful, and not necessarily in a good way","I have been here two times, and don't have any plans for a 3rd time. Not a family-friendly part of town nor a place I would recommend going alone, especially if you turn off the main boardwalk.

If you go, I would definitely not recommend going after dark.",Joy A

40,Try the cheap funky sunnies,"We hired a bike from Santa Monica Pier and rode down to Venice Beach. Bike riding is a must and probably the best way to enjoy the sun, surf and wind.Venice Beach boardwalk is a really interesting strip of shops and characters. Everyone was very friendly. There was a vendor further down the strip who sold cheap sunnies and wooden souvenir surfboards who was really friendly. We didn't catch his name but bought a pair of tortoiseshell rimmed round sunnies for Coachella (I got many compliments on them!) and a souvenir surfboard for home.Be careful with the t-shirt printing, we were promised a discount but it actually worked out to be quite expensive.

The boardwalk was filled primarily with homeless people and mentally disturbed people. Between the weed shops trying to lure you and the rap artist trying to get you to buy a CD it was a bad experience. This is a place where you feel like you will get mugged any minute. There is nothing entertaining about this place. I recommend you cross this off of your list",Juancop
10,Dirty and intimidating.,"This was the final stop for my tour group at the end of a fourteen day trip around various parts of California, the Grand Canyon, Vegas and Yosemite. The rest of my group were thrilled because ""Yay, beach!"", but given that I can't sit on sand for more than ninety seconds without wanting to die of boredom I decided I was going to go and walk around a bit.Mistake.The boardwalk is dirty, covered in graffiti (even on the frickin' trees!) and full of wannabe gangsters who eye you as though you're invading their territory. I travel by myself a lot and I know that most places aren't as bad as they appear on the surface, but this area has a genuinely scary vibe. The shops are tiny little kiosks that don't show any prices externally, presumably so that they can rip you off at their leisure if you're stupid enough to go inside. There are public restrooms. I did use them. I still have nightmares.Rather than walk back along the boardwalk, I cut across onto the beach and stumbled across an area roped off with yellow crime scene tape. At that point, I was done.Good points: nothing I can think of.Bad points: nasty vibe, rip off merchants.",SarahKnowsThisOne

There are a lot of homeless people and street performers and folks with their political views completely written out on boards. Not very many good restaurants from what I saw but they do have neat scenery to experience from a skateboard park, basketball courts and outdoor muscle beach gym. Some of the gift shops along here made me feel like they are hustling you because they don't have prices on the items and they are trying to size you up the moment you walk into the store. One of my biggest concerns were the amount of dogs that are walked along this Boardwalk including many pit bulls. I would recommend seeing this place at least once if you have the opportunity.",MichaelLong1963

There are a variety of stalls and shops all along the boardwalk that have a variety of things like art, junk or junky art. My recommendation is you go earlier rather than later, as it gets very crowded, it opens at 10ish. There is also plenty to look at with skateboarding, muscle beach, tennis courts all along the boardwalk too. Keep an eye on your wallet while you are keeping your eye on the weird and wonderful sites of Venice Beach boardwalk.",Aceagent

Some of these vendors are extremely creative and artistic, and their unique items are pretty cheap.You get the whole classic LA feel with bikers and rollerbladers passing you by as you wander.

The only drawback of the boardwalk is there are far too many homeless people (which is extremely sad) and this seems to give off a ""dirty"" vibe to the beach and boardwalk areas. All in all, it's a classic part of LA that is a must see.",JustAGuy4465
30,Not impressive,"It is famous and worth visiting, but not impressive. The food served in the many restaurants available is less than average. The toilets are unclean.",AbirViews
50,Really buzzing atmosphere!,"This is a great place to people watch. You wander past all the shops selling weed and henna tattoos to watch rollerbladers, break dancers and street performers",Sarsywarsy
30,Worthwhile walk in daylight,"Despite the city attempting to keep this place clean, it just has a grunge appearance which is not helped by the many homeless people sleeping in makeshift tents and carts. The street vendors on the weekend are cool but even some of them look like they just crawled out of a basement and set up a tent. Lots of police around watching as well as paramedics and fire equipment. It is a cool place to rent a bike and see for what it was but the city clearly has a problem keeping a modern look at you would find in places like Miami Beach.",RalphDailey
20,Scenic but creepy,"Lots of scammers here. Go see it, but don't dilly dally and DON'T take anything they hand you!! It's safe during the day but I wouldn't hang around at night for long.",Amber R
20,There are much better places to visit,"It's interesting and the beach is nice, but it's far from relaxing. Between all of the famous rappers trying to place ""free"" CDs in your hands and the multitude of ""doctors"" available to prescribe medicinal marijuana for your apparent glaucoma issues, it's just not a place for a relaxing stroll. Try Santa Monica or Manhatten Beach instead.",Krob2u
50,Favourite boardwalk anywhere,Brings back so many memories - this was my first place to see on my first trip to States many years ago and it is still special. Touch of kitsch and grunge with all the souvenir shops etc. but it is those elements that make it different and special. Hard to park so best just to pay the $8 in the car park or whatever and just flow with it.Love the crowds and buskers - the cafes are not the best in the world but just fun to sit and relax and enjoy it.,RonWamberal
10,Major dislike!,"Disappointing. After spending time in New York and Mexico, we were surprised that we all felt unsafe here. Couldn't get out of there fast enough (sorry!)...",lissonholidays
50,A visual feast for the art and culture lovers.,"I've always loved going to where the locals hangout every time I'm in a new place. I've been to Santa Monica years before and I loved the amusement theme. Venice shows you a more local and organic feel; skaters, artists, businessmen, tourists. It was a treat walking in the sand while watching the skaters rip or eating shaved ice while watching street performers. The street art was absolutely delightful. Venice is a must-go to if you want something different and local.",isteyp
50,Most UNIQUE Beach Experience Ever,"Let's be honest, most beaches generally have the same layouts and attractions. You have the water, sand, a few shops across the way, lots of crappy parking, and the occasional homeless person. Venice is a whole other experience! You have an awesome beach that stretches on for miles, beautiful grass areas, a huge skate park, graffiti walls for artists, lots of surface area for skating activities, and so many shops, restaurants, bars, and merchants to choose from!Ya it's a bit weird and wacky, but that's why we love it! You can buy all sorts of cool stuff and each time will leave you with a new experience. I have done many professional photo shoots here, been shopping, and even went to Float Lab! Check my review of that for more information if you have time to check it out.All in all, it has something for everyone... the whole family! Definitely recommend it if there is a beach trip in your future.",Ples R
50,wow so much to see,i loved getting to Venice Beach it was all i had expected the people were awesome and the little stalls with some really good tops and jewellery but most of the thing we loved the most was the beautiful beach and the pictures we could take while there. we would loved to have had more time but sadly time was crunched but we will surely go back.,Donna P
50,Fun to people watch,Great vendors with very unique talents. The beach is beautiful. Lots of people riding bikes and enjoying the day. Muscle beach is a must see. Some overpriced shops but over all a great day out.,Shauna R
50,Nostalgia with a strange twist,"This is a strange place. The beach is good and the people? All kinds of weirdos with nostalgia thrown in. Safe? Probably not, but it is worth a trip just for the photo op.",137rick
50,A must visit for the eccentric,Great street venders and artists plus a beautiful beach - a must visit! Don't be alarmed by all the homeless beach bums and makeshift tents - a lot of them are the ones creating the beautiful artwork and trinkets you can pick up here! Very laid back atmosphere - might be a bit startling to older folks that are more conservative.,Renee K
50,Must see,Tourism at it's best. Great people watching. AMAZING food just off the boardwalk. Beautiful views and great surfing,Blair S
30,Ok Once,"It was interesting for a one time experience. We saw muscle beach, walked a little, absorbed the atmosphere. It is a little tacky. One of the people I was with almost got knocked over by a bicyclist who banged right into her and kept going. The architecture is really interesting to look at. Nice place to ride bikes.",Stephanie G
40,Nice walk,Enjoyed a walk along in the sun. People skating and enjoying been out in the sun. Some small snack bars and souvenir shops. Also some nice little crafty/arty shops selling nicknacks,EMT999
50,It's all there,"Music, food, dancing, art, people, weight lifters, singers, bikes, roller skating, beach, ocean and every kind of person you can think of, you will most likely see as you walk around this area.",as4beatles
40,Antics,"This place is filled with its share of vendors, street performers, little shops and interesting people. I find that it's best to go during the day, it gets a little sketchy at night due to the volume of homeless people who sleep/live on the boardwalk.",Sanyika Sooalo
40,Very fun place to go for a walk...,"It's a very nice area to go for a walk, specially during the day time. Plenty of people running, skating, and etc. Besides you get an amazing view of beach.",Rafnagud
30,Glad I went but won't go back,"I wanted to go here because I had seen it on TV shows and movies etc but it really is quite sleazy. There are people trying to ""give"" you something and there are homeless people around as well. The shops are a mix of junk and good brands. The beach looked nice but it was cold and windy the day we went so didn't stay. It is hard to get a parking spot without paying. It is interesting to see but the public toilets are not good.",Juli G
30,Good view for relaxing afternoon walk,"Was here for a short walk, it is a good relaxing view. It offers a good view and I am sure everyone will enjoy such view. However, we went on sunday and it was very crowded.",Alvin V
40,What a boardwalk...,This place was a massive shock. I was expecting to see it like in the ads but this was not to be. I was able to see aspects of all the California ads here but the street vendors and homeless people really made it difficult. We felt very safe here but seeing the carnie folk really surprised me. Mr Muscle gym was great and worth seeing. Definitely a place to visit but be prepared for a shock as you walk down the boardwalk....,Rob K
40,Sight seeing for the whole family!,"Recommend as part of your Hop on Hop off tour,the bus drops you off right near the picturesque cross road.Allow plenty of time & wear comfy shoes, you can walk from hear to the beautiful Santa Monica Pier where you can get back on the bus & continue.Plenty of souvenir shops & market stalls in addition to sideshow buskers & artists.FYI - If you take photo's of the artists or buskers you are required to tip/donate $$'s",jodies807
30,Interesting people and shops,"If you care for offbeat and interesting people and shops, you can find them here. There are the usual T-shirt and tattoo shops, as well.",Jeanne S
30,Worth a fly by - once - take a few photos - then never go back!,"Venice Beach - we've all seen it in the movies/TV shows - the golden sandy beaches, crystal blue waters and gorgeous people strutting around in swimwear make you yearn to be there...like much of Hollywood, the illusion is more potent than the reality....I loved coming to Venice Beach when I first arrived in LA, early 90's, it has so changed and not for the better; I still bring people here, just so they can say they've been, but I wouldn't come here for fun/unless I had to - sad to say...Nowadays, it's buskers, posers, tourists, stalls and shops selling cheap t-shirts/sunglasses and souvenirs. Muscle Beach is now very clean and feels like you're at the zoo!There is not so many gangs as there used to be, but i'd stay away after dark, know that parking is going to be an expensive nightmare - if you have good legs, park in Santa Monica, and walk down the bike path that runs all along the front, but don't walk in a chain across the path or you'll really annoy the roller blader/runner/bicyclists! That way you'll get fresh air and a bit of exercise and not be so disappointed at Venice.",Yvonne M
20,"Are you ready for snake charmers, tacky souvenir shops and crowds? Venice is the place!","Who doesn't want to see Venice Beach? That is what I thought before I actually went there but ugh--yes, parking is hard to find, weekend crowds are dense and the shops, ""street people"" just hanging out and tacky atmosphere put this location into the ""glad I saw it but I would never go back"" category. I will say that the actual beach was huge and lovely but in April it was too windy and cool to just hang out there so we walked the boardwalk and it literally turned me off to the ""Venice"" scene. We had originally thought of renting a bike and riding to Santa Monica and I should have done that as it would have limited my actual time in Venice and I could have seen more beaches. This one is not a must.",LaViajera007
40,Great for exercise,"Nice long and wide Boardwalk to run, walk, bike, skateboard or even rollerblade. Nice how they have two parts where ones for pedestrians and the other is for people on bikes. I used it daily to get from Venice beach to Santa Monica pier. Very crowded with people and good place to people watch or see interesting things off of it. Safe area as well and lots of bathrooms which is nice.",Banny9949
40,Waking on the beach,Very interesting place. Very hard to find a parking spot. Not bat if you are willing to pay a lot but it was ok. We found on the street for free but had to walk a little. Maybe it's the California thing but it was so entertaining on the beach side in front of the shops.,yhk611
10,THIS IS ONE SCARY PLACE,"I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would want to go here!!!! There isn't anything to see unless you like half dressed, drunken stoner people acting crazy. I don't understand why they call this place famous. I guess it may have been worth it since I certainly have a good story to tell. Don't go after dark. It was scary enough at noon, I can't imagine what the ""night life"" is like!! My husband is much more outgoing than me and when he says this place is like being in a different country let's get out of here, you know it's bad!",Livin Life
40,So cool it hurts... USE SUNSCREEN and bring cash!,"Went by bicycle from Santa Monica all the way to Venice beach and the markets. It was really nice and although it gets a bit hectic with pedestrians and cyclist, that doesn't get in the way to live the L.A. beach style. Loads of sculpted bodies and cool/crazy people",Felipe A
50,weekend a must,"This is a good place to go anytime, but the weekend is the best. There is no parking fee at the lots if you have a disabled placecard or license. This is probably the best place to people watch ever! Rent a bike and ride along the boardwalk if you have trouble walking. There are also a lot of places to get a foot and lower leg massage. make sure to take in muscle beach and the skateboard park, who knows what famous people you might see. This can be a fun place for the whole family, but beware there are several marijuana pharmacies along the boardwalk which you may have to explain to them.",traveljo1988
50,Touristy but locals seem to love it also,"The beach is really amazing and laid back. There are plenty of cheesy souvenir shops if you're into that sort of thing as a tourist, but it's also clear that the locals enjoy the area too. That's always a good sign.",Brandon P
30,"OK, guess it depends on your interests","My husband +I weren't impressed. We walked quite a ways, but he wanted to get back to the car to drive to the area where the canals are. That was much more relaxing.",Alicia C
40,Enjoyed our time on Venice Beach,Lots of vendors and interesting things to see on the boardwalk. Beautiful stretch of sand and many things to do here,Jewelz1976
50,Yes you gotta see the human show...,"It's a menagerie of humans: good and bad, sad and forlorn, amazing and intriguing.It's world famous-infamous all sorts of worlds coming together.People watching--The best human show anywhere/anytime. It has everything you could imagine and what you don't imagine.The flea market stands are eclectic with everything from junk to art.The store fronts have all the tourist trinkets and t-shirts you don't want.Food stands that are average and overpriced.Medical marijuana dispensaries.I always suggest boardwalk fans return to the board walk at sunrise as the homeless break down their shelters and move along for the tourist trade.Two different worlds operating at two different times in the exact same spaces.",Summerasalifestyle
30,Not my favorite but a must for first-timers,"As I've been to LA multiple times, I tend not to visit as much as it's a bit ghetto/hipster for my tastes. I prefer heading north to Malibu or a bit south to Manhattan Beach for a classier vibe. Having said that, you always meet interesting personalities/buskers and will be kept entertained especially if it's your first time. I would recommend renting a bike to experience the entire stretch of the boardwalk. Don't forget to try the $2 fish tacos sold by an old Korean lady at a stand by the basketball courts, I thought they offered great taste, value and convenience by the beach!",Leegrego
50,My Favorite Spot on a Sunday Afternoon,"For people watching, dancing, singing, shopping, walking, biking, skating, swimming, weight-lifting, you just can't beat Venice Beach. There are many talented street artists performing a variety of acts. There are souvenir shops and eateries, and LOTS of interesting people to see and talk to. Just a really fun place to be especially if you like a quasi-Bohemian scene...",Cruzin404
40,Definitely worth a stroll,"Venice Beach is a very unique area in LA and is certainly worth a visit. While visiting the boardwalk, you can check out the shops and cafes along the way and you'll have plenty of opportunities for people watching as well. While the boardwalk is certainly touristy, it's worth a visit. There are street performers doing various activities as well. Beyond the boardwalk, the beach itself is awesome and if the boardwalk isn't enough for you to visit the area, the beach should be enough to make you come. But if you're here, stroll the boardwalk, take in the sights, see people from all over the world along with the locals all enjoying this unique beach community.",ssy24
40,"Crowded, but fun","The HoHo-bus stops close to this boardwalk and it right next to the beach. There are several shops, bike and skate rentals and restaurants. Not great for a full day but for 1 hour and then maybe hit the beach afterwards, you are all set.",MyrtheStouwdam
10,A trip to Venice during our stay in LA,"We were excited having been told it was a great place to visit, what a disappointment we found it to be! The beach itself was lovely but surrounded by tacky gift shops & strewn with litter just makes the whole place dirty, the area was full of homeless which is incredibly sad but they have large amounts of rubbish which is dumped around them there are also side stalls trying to sell things. it is ironic that the signs located stating there will be a clean up on May 6th are presumably in readiness for the the vacation season, I would not recommend this place as a stop off its definitely not a suitable place to take children & it stinks of weed!!!",karen123308
50,"Very fun, funky, hip place","Fun, funky, old, cool, and always fun. If you're close, do stop by and spend an hour or more just roaming around the Venice Beach famous boardwalk. Expect to see some really far out people, for sure!",Tommy O
30,Entertainment and Chaos!,"Growing up in LA I spent a LOT of time trolling the Venice Boardwalk. As a teenager it was a staple for buying crazy clothes, jewelry, etc, but at some point it became quite dangerous. Since then there has been a massive upgrade to the whole area! The boardwalk is still the crazy, chaotic, incredibly entertaining place to go buy weird clothes, decor, jewelry, incense, etc. It can be difficult even to walk around this place there are so many people, bicycles, street performers, but turning off any side street or onto the beach can provide some reprieve. Both Saturday and Sunday there are fantastic farmers markets nearby and great restaurants and shops just a few blocks off the boardwalk.Parking is a nightmare even on cloudy days so plan on walking long distances or constantly running back to your 1hour meter to add a few quarters. Parking lots can easily be $20.I would still recommend getting off the boardwalk by dark. It's not the best area so move up to Abbott Kinney or Main Street or Santa Monica for evening activities.",CignoNero
50,Probably my favourite place,"Lovely beach, interesting people, impromptu parties, flags, roller skaters, seg ways, muscle beach, stalls selling art, freak show, yoga, henna... so much to see and do, spend a day here and walk or wheel yourself to santa Monica pier. Go on a Sunday. You'll love it",Soph
30,A very hippie feel,"The boardwalk is always busy and is nice on a lovely day. However the atmosphere isn't great. There were young people advertising drugs and a lot of people selling stuff. The beach is crowded with young people, so it isn't the best for families. There are a lot of food stalls and markets, although the cleanliness of them is questionable.",Sam_Cassaniti
50,Full of life and colour!,"This is a bit of a cop out, as the main ""boardwalk"" is actually all concrete/asphalt. There are, however, smaller boardwalks/pathways leading off in all directions once you hit the sand. A veritable human zoo, this is people-watching paradise! Spend a day, or at least an afternoon, wandering from vendor to vendor and lazing around on the beach. The best time to go is Sunday afternoon, for the Drum Circle - tribal jamming and spontaneous dancing on the grass beyond the skate park. Go during the day, NOT night. Nighttime is pretty seedy there. Don't miss Muscle beach, at the southern end of the beach; and Graffiti Park (near the skate park) for the best street art in LA. The combined beachfront of Venice and Santa Monica is actually very long, so wear comfy shoes and don't plan on doing it all in one go. Walking, biking, skating and rollerblading are the best ways to explore this place. There's plenty of places to chill out and refuel (eating, not filling your gas tank haha) all along the boardwalk, and also a public toilet block and outdoor showers for sand-lubbers. An essential LA experience!",ladyyavanna
50,Interesting but some dicey people,"It's my favorite place to go walking when in LA, either solo, with friends and/or family. Walking to Santa Monica pier and back. It's always something going on. However, there are some dicey characters so beware of your surroundings.",AndreaF346
30,Go in the day,You can be whoever you want here. Anything goes. Skaters...artists.....weed smoking hippies.....tat buying tourists....sunseekers...basketballers.........homeless people waiting for dark so they can reclaim the sand. The beach is kept clean and its a people watchers dream but at night it does turn sinister and has a very uneasy vibe.,Amanda H
40,A must see,"This place has to be seen to believed. I am not sure the locals would venture there but as a tourist it is a must. It is full of activity, street vendors, shops, and people doing there ""own thing"" but makes for a good day of people watching",Natalie073
40,Crazy fun!,Not sure what I was expecting but it was a fun time for sure. Lots of people but never felt claustrophobic. Mostly souvenir shops with a good variety of local art as well. Could use some more restaurants that offer something other than burgers. Gorgeous beach!,Amy D
50,Never a dull day on the VB Boardwalk,"Local artists line the boardwalk as well as craft artists, political activists, human robots, impromptu dancers, drum circles, musicians, piano players, palm trees, skate parks, incense vendors, sunglasses, clothes, souvenirs, food stands, cafes, bike rentals, tattoo shops and now of course, the medical marijuana ""clinics"". Don't forget all the street performers, skateboarders, roller skaters, bicyclists, dogs, the freak show (for real!), Muscle Beach, a fortune telling Zoltar and much much more. All right next to the beach which offers amazing and free daily sunsets. Kind of a free for all, to say the least. While this is not really where you should want to be after dark, it is pure gold entertainment during the day. A good long walk from one end to the other if you have time. If not, grab a pedicab and they can give you a fast-forward tour. A quintessential must-see in Los Angeles. Tons of lots, just pay the fee so you don't have to worry about getting a ticket for running over at the meter (which you will).Something for everyone at this beach side circus.",Sally M
10,Horrific,Definitely would not go here again. Wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. It's very depressing and quite scary actually,Tanya W
30,Great For People Watching,Not what I expected to see when we arrived on the first day. Lots of homeless people. Too scared to go out at night because its a very rough place.,jaimiaus
50,A 'must see LA/California experience,"You know all those scenes from movies and TV shows you've been watching for years? They're real! And they're here! The Venice boardwalk has all the character, the views, the muscles and the bikini bodies you could ever with for. Muscle Beach is real...watch guys, and gals, with impossible bodies work out. The do what I do and have an ice cream cone, or a cocktail, or try one of the hundreds of snacks, treats, and meals on offer along the beach:) Don't eat too much though because there's also the bikini boutiques, the skate stores, the shoes, souvenir, and dress shops.....on the ocean side there are craftsmen, singers, musicians, acrobat, skate dancers, artists sculptures, and, yes, some kooks:) They add to the colour and fun:) Not to be sneezed at is the long, wide stretch of white sand and white topped waves beckoning....though swimmers beware....the ocean in LA NEVER warms up...sorry, but it had to be said....",Robyn M
50,Interesting Viewing,"This was a lovely walk of a couple of miles from Venice to Santa Monica Pier, there are loads of little shops selling souvenirs and snacks. There are loads of people working out including the world famous gym on the beach. There are also loads of people practicing on bars and beams Olympic style - fabulous. I wasn't prepared for the amount of people smoking and selling marijuana though which was offputting.",Love To Travel
50,Funky!,"If you're into funk, this is the place to visit. Sidewalk performers, bicycles, Muscle Beach, people-watching, shopping for goodies, food. A lovely walk with the Pacific by your side. During winter, at times you can see spewing migrating whales. Quirky people, residents, tourists. Fun for all. Be broad minded !!",Rhoda D
40,This show is free and always on,"Never been to this beach but the tour guide recommend that after the tour to go back, So we did, and it was a hoot and a half. There are a lot of tattoo places, eateries and lots of music and sidewalk entertainers. We stop inside one of the many open air pubs and just watched as a world of characters passed by. If you want see massive humanity at its best and occasionally worst, this is the beach to people watch at. Word to the wise, keep your kids close.",Raymond J
50,Walk with ice cream - cant ask for more,I was there with my wife and the weather was just perfect. We had couple of margaritas and just walked. Could not ask for more. Then picked up cold stone. Best day ever. You can find a lot of interesting people here.,Cinesanky
30,Nice but very crowded,"The beach was okay. There are many resturants and shops around. It was full of young tourists and school-age kids. Some people can be rude there. So if you hate crowded places, and you like more enjoying a quiet and relaxing time at the beach, then maybe you wouldn't like it so much.",SF_BeachLovers
40,SUNDAYFREAKSHOWALK,"Wow, you will literally see everything here, amazing, everyone is out and about, excercising, cheerful homeless, grumpy locals, fun people, beautiful people, large people, this is CA at its most entertaining, we walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica then up into the shopping district for food, a great way to spend an afternoon, don't forget your sunscreen x",NEWRADICAL
40,A Local POV,Venice is everything you have seen in the movies and tv shows but a little dingier. There are more t-shirt a weed shops than ever before. Go to see the people. It's amazing. I've taken visitors here and have enjoyed watching their reactions to all the characters that stroll up and down the boardwalk. On Sundays there's a drum circle out on the sand. It's full of character and spectacle...it's the home of where the Doors played. It's a trip. It's dirty. Go and have fun but keep your wits about ya! As for beaches? There are way better beaches. The rings and rope swings at the end of the boardwalk provide some excellent viewing. It really has everything from hippies to acrobats.,JKLIVIN77
20,"Very poor people, good and bad art, and angry addicts","There were some very interesting artists and people, the pier itself was nice. I would not really call this a boardwalk though as it is more just a path along the beach. Lots of poor and homeless begging, some even got angry when we would not buy their fares and followed and harassed us. Some very cool art though. Very glad I didn't have my kids with me",Lauren M
30,Venice Beach,"A nice place for a walk, you will enjoy it. This place is full of unique persons, a lot of cafés and restaurants.",aruiz7003
50,People Watching at its Best,Go get a sit and just watch all the people walk by and the mini shows they are putting on. You will see it all here and a lot of places to grab little souvenirs,Dale C
30,"Doesn't remind you of Venice, but is different.","The Venice Beach Boardwalk has many street vendors and small shops, no way connected to Venice. The beach itself is breezy with lots of palm trees. There are skateboard ramps where you see many youngsters practicing their dare devilry, worth the watch, because it keeps you on the edge. Do not forget to see the Muscle Beach, where Arnold Schwarzenegger worked out (the gym still exists). You will see many body builders working out. A lot of murals dot LA, 'Touch of Venice' mural in a parking lot is beautiful.We were told that Venice (Los Angeles), was built by a millionaire who loved Venice (Italy), and it was modeled after Venice, Italy. We glimpsed a couple of the canals too.",anitha g
50,Just pure fun.,"Everything you could imagine. The best people watching anywhere, including a Freak Show. A beautiful beach, and of all of the beaches in the LA area (we visited most) this one was the most eclectic. They are all beautiful in some way. But this one is definitely worth a visit!!",cynthiabH654FV
30,Not what we expected,"Walked here from Santa Monica pier. Not very clean and lots of homeless people, we did not feel very safe to be honest although there were plenty of police on horseback riding around. We saw a guy getting arrested for drugs by the local sheriff and then along the beach we saw the coroner with a trolley going into an apartment to collect a body we assumed as the police were on the balcony. A very interesting walk!!",Val&Ian
50,Never a dull moment on the Boardwalk!,"If you like to people-watch, this is Nirvana! Skaters, jugglers, artists, comedians and musicians...all right there! I love the beach for it's free-spirit vibe, and could spend all day wandering up and down the Boardwalk.",colochick
50,But of course,"No visit would be complete without walking the boardwalk, scene from so many TV shows, movies and commercials.",M23rdPWR
50,I go here every time I visit LA,"I love Santa Monica pier and I love visiting the boardwalk. There is lots of cheap shopping and lots of people. I love the cool breezes from the ocean, but don't eat there. The food is terrible and expensive. Also there is lots of drugs and crime so beware!",KenJean2014
50,Interesting freak show,"Dogs wearing sunglasses, bearded hippie elctric guitar-playing skateboarder. This place has it all. The price of admission is free. Visited in 2000.",chris19531955
50,Great walk,What could be nicer on a beautiful California day. It's about 3 miles round trip from Venice beach to Santa Monica pier. Stroll along and enjoy the view. Wear sun screen,Oliviab@optonline.net
30,Not what I expected,Recently visited Venice beach. Not that impressed smelled like weed everywhere which was complete turnoff to me. Some cool shops. I must say this Boardwalk is very over rated and hyped up. One really cool thing were the street performers wow they are super talented ! We saw some pretty dope shows:) I mean this place is a must while in Cali so experience it for yourself and see what you think.,A. Rivera
20,Visiting southern California,We toured the area during a recent visit. We have always heard about Venice Beach and were disappointed with the housekeeping and the trashy Boardwalk.,VerbBatonRouge
30,A bit like going to the circus,"There is no shortage of people seeking attention.It is sad to see so many homeless, the impression I take with me along the long boardwalk.If you wanna shop imported cheap beach products,it,s a gigantic selection. All this mixed with street performers and a skate park etc.Venice is hardly famous for its great restaurants or cafes",Phayao13
50,Relaxed vibe,"Great vibe, feels like you're going back to the 60's. The people are interesting and if you like street art, this is the place to go. There is a lot to see. Note: be aware of the selfmade musicians who try to sneakily sell their burned c.d.'s to you. They can be annoying.",Romy R
30,Fun slice of life--good and bad,"It had been over 12 years since we last walked the boardwalk in Venice, and when we returned with our tween daughter, much of what we remembered from our previous trip was the same: fun shops and interesting merchants, buskers plying their trades, and a never-ending stream of interesting folks to people-watch.What was different about this visit was a marked increase in homelessness, drug culture, and open drug use (mostly marijuana). While we are sympathetic to the plight of the homeless, and supported pot legalization in our state, these things nevertheless detracted from our visit. We walked down from Santa Monica on the boardwalk, but walked back north via the beach--and enjoyed the latter more.",dunadan
30,Alright....,"Took a quick stroll one evening before dinner at nearby James Beach (which was very good) and really wasn't impressed. Good people watching, but a different vibe and not some place I would really recommend hanging out. Definitely not a great place to take younger kids, in my opinion. (Nothing wrong with whats going on there, just not a family oriented vibe--and no, I didn't have my kids with me.)",weathermankc
50,You can't beat this for interesting,"We stopped at the Venice boardwalk to see what it was like. I must say, you can't beat this for interesting people. There was a lot to see you. Some of it may not be appropriate for younger children. But I had my 13-year-old there and he didn't seem to be phased by any of it. We had a good time. I would definitely recommend this as an interesting place to stop if you're in the area.",Tim H
50,Relax time!,I went there with my family and friends. It is a best place for relaxation but it was kidda rainy day. Apart of that it's best place to relax and reliefs your tension. Worth a visit.,Arthur Naing Win Aung
50,Venice Beach broadwalk - great Sunday entertainment,Great place for a Sunday morning stroll. always entertaining and walk thru to the Santa Monica pier for lunch. Fantastic beach - wide sand and blue skies.,Alan G
50,Awesome,"This place is surreal. You get to meet a lot of outstanding people, there's so much more to do there than Santa Monica or Zuma beach. A lot of shows to see, right at the beach, great bars and restaurants , the party never stops in Venice.",Candycaiiine
40,Interesting!!,"There is a lot to see!! Massive beach, interesting people, street art...we went back twice ..just saying :)",Jillz990

50,interesting,"have been here many times over the last 40+ years. always a delight. lots of local color plus nice weather. plus you are at the beach. food is adequate . parking is not cheap, but worth it",dulovi
50,Nice beach,"Very nice beach and boardwalk, lots of great restaurants and bars along the boardwalk you just have to look for them.",Apes44
50,Not high culture ... so what?,"As others note, this is excellent for people watching. If you're not hung up about skateboarders or other non-opera crowd types, you get a lot of eye candy here. Wouldn't count on getting great food.",amesman96
30,A decent walk on a sunny day,"It's all there... the Gym, the flashy characters and that forboding feeling of the modern day big city. During the daytime it's right off of the beach and worth a visit. I wouldn't do it at night!",Mullendoktor
40,Touristy but nice,Took a stroll on the boardwalk and did some people watching here while on a tour of LA. All kinds of people were passing through and we even saw a few photo shoots. Was interesting to see all of the people working out. Overall a decent place to visit.,NYC2VA13
30,Leisure,You should go and take a look at this beach. It's quite touristy but I enjoyed walking around the area. There are a lot of shops on Abbot Kinney definitely check it out.,pinkandsunshine
30,Hawkers and homeless vie for attention,"Overall experience was feeling uncomfortable and wanting to leave. The stalls were over priced and service was poor. There were a lot of people, not just tourists but locals on skateboards or selling CDs out of their trunks. And a lot of homeless people in varying degrees of attention seeking. Most seemed content to just sit amongst themselves but it was sad to see so many grouped together in one area (especially after coming down the beach from Santa Monica). It is certainly a place to visit, and I would highly recommend moving just off the boardwalk to look at all the graffiti art, but just set your expectations.",HuzKa
50,Venice Beach,One of the best places to enjoy people watching. Good little shops to walk through and plenty of eating establishments,Richard V
20,Boardwalk totally lacking in charm but nice beaches,"The shops and food outlets along the Boardwalk are pretty tawdry comprising mainly cheap clothing, vape and weed paraphernalia, tattoo parlours. Not much that was charming, aesthetically pleasing or nicely quirky. Our 18 year old daughter quite liked it but it was hardly worth the journey from Hollywood which took over an hour by car on a Thurs afternoon",JudyOxford_England
40,Entertaining,"We cycled here from Santa Monica pier where we hired bikes, a very entertaining area, you can just sit and watch the wire and wacky world go by.",ZoeSparks
30,Crowded,"The beach is not as good as Australia, it is very touristy , homeless people at the beach and facilities not well kept. the part to see is the skate park which is well designed and popular with skaters.",rykony

40,Venice Beach,"It was a cool take and bit of a throwback feel.. It has a few shops, Skateboard park, Famous Muscle beach and beautiful beach",Elisa T
40,An Interesting area.,"We are travelling with our young kids, we liked this area, it was quite diverse. We met and saw some really characters. But there are so many homeless people laying around and walking about everywhere, it is very sad. We found this all over LA, but Venice was by far the worst area, LA really needs to help these people! The kids loved watching the skate boarders at the sea front park, there wasn't a lot of muscle on muscle beach! The whole area felt very seedy, we wouldn't take the kids back unless it gets cleaned up.",sonia E
50,A Tourist Must See To Believe!,"Venice Beach is a place that you hear about. In order to get a real grasp of the flavor of Venice Beach you must go there. It is not a freak show, it is just another slice of LA life. The atmosphere is electric and there is non-stop action by beach entertainers. There are legendary food booths. Check your tourist books or Trip Advisor or Yelp. Be sure and look down the side streets for litle restaurants. The pier is a must walk. It can be scary but fun on a high surf day. Souvenirs are cheap because there are so many shops. There is a huge roller skating structure where you will see kids and really old men doing their thing. Watch out for Marijuana sellers trying to grab you and lure you into their shops. Tandem Bikes are great for couples. Be sure and walk in the walk lanes!! You do not want to get mowed down by skaters or bikes!",malibumaven
20,Windy walk,"The weather wasn't the best but the sights were okay. Not too much beach activity, the wind picked up and temp was in the low 60's. Didn't feel the need to spend much time on the boardwalk, walked around and was done within an hour.",Ashley S
30,Not impressed.,"If you expect to see what they show on TV, you will be disappointed. Many run-down shops trying to sell just about anything you could want.

No need to return.",Henry H

40,Popular beach so can get very crowded.,We always go early morning like 7am or even 8am to beat the crowd especially during weekends. This is a great place to go if your kids love the beach and you're in Southern California,Draxxzo
40,A great place to people watch,"I enjoyed our walk through the Venice beach board walk, but my wife said it gave her the willies. There were plenty of characters around for you to watch. Street hustlers were aplenty. There were two police cars that I saw drive through the boardwalk making sure everything was fine. Go visit and have a good time, the scenery is fun to observe.",kansas_traveler38815

20,Wouldn't waste time here,"I always wanted to see the famed Venice Beach because there is really nothing like seeing places in person that you have grown up reading about and seeing in movies so I am glad I can say I did, but really nothing worth seeing. I did go early in morning when things were just gearing up so it likely gets pretty lively later on. Kind of run down and depressing. Lots of beach and boardwalk dwellers which makes me sad. Lots of shops to visit if you are so inclined.",Rochelle L
50,Great place to visit,"This place is a must see if in Los Angeles. Eat, shop, drink, smoke, and get a piercing! Interesting live entertainment.",Nar1982
30,People watching!,"A fun place in to take a stroll and get some free entertainment watching the quirky street performers, marijuana peddlers and other visitors. Shops and eateries line the boardwalk, and the ocean is a nice backdrop. Worth a 60-minute stop.",writrsblck
40,First time in LA? You must visit Venice Beach.,Come early so you can find parking. There are a few lots right on the beachside. Keep your valuables safe in front of you. Beautiful beach views and a lot of small vendors selling their crafts. Plenty of quick foods to grab along the way. This place changes drastically when the sun goes down. So enjoy it early!,Angela A

50,Fun part of Venice beach,"I have reviewed Venice Beach, which includes this boardwalk. The photo makes the boardwalk look calm, but it is far from it! There are people and vendors everywhere!!!Dogs galore too. There are innumerable small shops which sell food to be eaten on the go, and there are a few sit-down restaurants. You can rent bicycles and other wheeled vehicles, including roller skates. It is great fun for the entire family, couples, young and old.",OCD2
50,Very impressive for the variety of activity that takes place here!,We did a Segway tour from Santa Monica Pier all along the bike path to the Venice Pier and then the Venice Beach Boardwalk. It was outstanding...good way to be a part of the culture during your visit!,Margaret Q
20,Skip it,"Crowded, smelly, dirty...just some of the epithets coming to mind. Nothing to see. Skip it all together. The stores along side are a joke. Especially with small kids there is no point trying to get into a cafe or bar. The beach however is beautiful.",Me74126500
40,For the iconoclast in us all.,"A bit of everything that is the West / LeftLooney Coast. Open air swap meet, protestors, aliens and body builders. Eateries galore cheap to avant guarde abound too.

10,RIP OFF!!!!,"I had to write terrible to catch people's attention. Overall it is a nice place. I recommend people going. It is sad the quantity of homeless people there. Please do yourself a favor and do not go into the customizing shirt stores!!!! They are a rip off...Imagine paying 75$ for a tank top and a baby shirt, after he said he was doing a ""special price"" .It is all a big robbery!! Plus they make you feel unsafe that you do not have another than to pay. Go to Venice Beach, but watch out for those crooks!!",annjo309
50,Venice Boardwalk,"The Venice Beach boardwalk is one of L.A's hidden gems. There is always something to do, something to see, and you can just about find any piece of artwork from t-shirts to arts and crafts, jewelry, food, and intimate cafe's to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. The boardwalk has been transformed over the years with the help of the city, vendors,owners, new restaurants, and the help of the local LAPD substation directly on the boardwalk has now turned it into a relaxing place to enjoy the sun and the best California weather.",Adrian D
30,Mixed feelings,"I'm not sure what to say about Venice Beach boardwalk. First of all, it's probably not for children as the weed smoke permeates the air and is inescapable. Homelessness in LA is simply out of control. It is unacceptable that in a country with so much wealth and opportunity that there should be homelessness, although we know that there will always be some level of it no matter the economic wealth or advanced state of health care BUT in Venice Beach, it appears that there is not hopelessness in homelessness but rather a gathering place where those who are hard on their luck can find 'family' but I'm not sure that it's healthy to be around so much weed and as visitors it seems like there is some spectacle made from others misfortune. The studies of the impacts to the brain of weed use and my experience with friends who have had serious mental health issues from using weed are undeniable so it stands to reason that it could hinder someone finding their way out of their situation. I think weed is almost idolised there and it's an amusement to others but I think for those that live there and call it home, I think as visitors we shouldn't encourage it but rather look at the amazing things happening there - the talent of the street performers, musicians, singers, bands, pianist, photographers etc. Praise the way of life that brings life.",Ozgals2010
30,Not like you would think,Not in great shape and feels uncomfortable.Pot shops and bogus medical facilities abound.Some decent shops and some restaurants but many other spots near LA are better.,TAMAN1951
10,Disturbing,"I was horrified on my most recent walk the entire length of the Venice Beach Boardwalk, which should be renamed Skid Row by the Sea. To think this used to have a charming eccentricity. On the Sunday morning I visited there was an uncomfortably high quotient of stoned, strung-out, sleazy characters. The shops are mostly tawdry t-shirt emporiums, plus several medical marijuana dispensaries. For some reason, the boardwalk was crowded, and the beautiful beach was mostly empty. While not dangerous or threatening, the Venice Beach Boardwalk has become a disturbing and unsettling place--and no longer at all amusing.",Alan B
20,Venice Beach is overrated,"I've been to this beach 3 times. It is good for people watching, but that's about it. Also, if you are into fitness, this is a good place to come to see some serious bodybuilders at work. Everything is overpriced (of course, it's a tourist destination). Avoid weekends at all cost!",prettykey

30,Not what I expected.,We came here to spend the day. What we ended up doing was driving around looking for a parking spot for an hour. We never did find one. We ended up going to Islands for dinner and they allowed us to keep our car there.We got to the pier right at sunset. It was a spectacular one. Then we turned around and had a beautiful view of the beach with the moon out.,michelewelker

40,Good to check out in passing,"Venice Boardwalk is a little underwhelming compared to what you see in the movies, but it's a cool area and definitely worth checking out if you're in the area or passing by.",WoozyBanker
40,Always unique,Always a unique time here from the bizarre to the beautiful. Good places to eat and to watch sunsets. Be sure to visit gingerbread court a little way down the boardwalk. This was Charlie Chaplins home. The cute shops here are the former guest houses of the star. His house sits in the back. Great to remember old time stars.,sunfollower

50,One of my favortie places to unwind,"I go to the Venice Boardwalk often because its never the same! Love being close to the ocean in a laid back environment where you see all kinds of characters. I sometimes walk to the Santa Monica Pier from Venice, great exercise. Plenty of restaurants, my favorite is Poke Poke where they serve amazing Poke bowls. Plenty of restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Tons of vendors and of course there's Muscle Beach and Gold's Gym. You can often see body builders doing their thing, or play paddle tennis, basketball. skateboard or just lay out on the beach. This is a destination where tourists love to go just for the experience of Venice Beach. This is place is tons of fun 7 days a week.",sworrels

40,Lovely walk and nice beach,"Street vendors, musicians, body builders, roller skaters, shops, food and more all along a beach walk so when you get tired you can sit on the beach and enjoy the ocean. Good fun, colorfull characters to watch and usually great weather you'll like it",ronb753

50,A bucket list,"Visited LA with some friends a few yrs ago and a visit to this boardwalk was on our list. and we were not disappointed. Of course it was crowded, but manageable.

40,Crowded and different,"We spent an afternoon walking the boardwalk. I was with 3 teenagers and we all liked the time spent there. It's interesting to see the variety of people hanging there. It's noisy, a lot of people, a lot of things to see. When you are tired of this, you just hit the beach!",R B
20,disappointed,"We arrived here at around 10am and the area was quiet (as far as tourists go). Unfortunately there were ALOT of homeless people sleeping , or just waking up from what looked like a little camp. It was quite intimidating actually so we didn't feel comfortable walking along the beach. all in all we were disappointed as it didn't look the way it does on tv however at least we can say we've been. Just don't plan to spend a whole day there. We were told that the place gets packed at around lunch time. I'm not sure whether that would have been better for us or not.",sharon G
50,Great place to visit,"We enjoyed walking along the boardwalk. There are many different things to see, with art and street performers. Would definitely recommend.",Rebecca R
40,You kind of have to go!,"It might be a tourist trap, but it's really the best type of one if you're a tourist. People watching is incredible and the sand is very soft if you go down into the beach. There is also a fun skateboard ramp area where you can watch the skaters. Granted I spent more time on the beach itself as the shops get a little Jersey Shore at times and hilariously L.A. at other times. It was still worth the trip.",CambridgeGem
50,amazing street performances and great place for people watching,"Were delighted by the dance and acrobatic street performances. Orion Griffiths was definitely a favorite. No shortage of beautiful bodies on the beach.

20,You could do better in California,"I spent some time in LA recently, and I would have to say that Venice Beach in general is one of the much less desirable places in LA. There were dozens of bums, and I almost never say or think this, but I would go as far as to recommend that you do not walk around on the boardwalk at night, as there are homeless people and gangs. I actually felt threatened for the first time in my life,on the boardwalk here in Venice at night. Overall, I would recommend this place on the bottom of my Los Angeles list.",Jake B
20,Disappointing,"We missed seeing the boardwalk on our last trip to the US but in reality we did not miss much other than a very pleasant bike ride down from Santa Monice.

Hire a bike, take a ride along the beach, watch the most beautiful sunset you'll ever see, check out the local shops, watch the street performers, talk to the locals (if you dare) and I guarantee you, you'll have a fabulous time. Venice Beach isn't everyone's cup of tea but if you're looking for somewhere different with a little flair and flavor, you'll find it here for sure!

30,The GREEN DOCTORS on Venice Beach are a scam!!,"Okay, you all have read the other reviews about Venice Beach... Some love it, some hate it. It's an experience you will never forget. No one really mentions actually going into the medical marijuana shops... They have signs that you can get a legal card for $40. Wrong. What you get is a waste of your time. You need your drivers license and a California address. (Your license can be from any state). You are escorted to a small room to fill out paperwork. Once that is completed, you take your paperwork and then move on to the back hallway while you wait your turn to see a ""Doctor"" to see if you can get approved for a card. The doctor is quite old, dressed in a flannel shirt and wearing a baseball cap. You are asked questions about why you need marijuana (which he notes on the papers you handed him) and then he listens to your heart, signs the paperwork and then you go to another waiting room. When it's your turn, you go into another small dirty office where the sales pitch begins! The $40 was for a doctors evaluation only. It you want a 3 month card, it's and additional $100 and the 12 month was $200. Now, they still have your license and conveniently there is ATM machine in the small room you are being given this sales pitch. They keep everyone separated so you have no idea about what is coming!!! I was upset that I wasted an hour of my day for nothing! Got my license back and left!",Denise B
50,Great place to hang out,"This was or first stop on ""A Day in LA"" tour and we had about 30mins to explore the area. If we had any spare days in our itnerary we would have come back and hired a bike and just cruised around. It has a relaxed hippy vibe.",Chloe P
50,Like a movie!,"The weather was perfect, sunny but not too hot! I was really waiting to feel the atmosphere of Venice and Santa Monica and it really is as good as I have imagined. It feels like you are inside a movie! All the people walking around on sidewalks, the skates, tattoos, palm trees and shops... Everything you have already seen before, but just on TV is actually true and it is real! The craziest thing I’ve seen there were the several “green clinics” in which people can buy marijuana legally… You just walk in, tell the doctor you have a headache, sleep problems or anything you want and they you subscribe you joint for medical purposes!From there, I’ve headed back to the Ocean Front Walk and spend some time seeing the crazy guys playing tricks on the skate park and saw very typical Streetball (the variation of the basketball in which 2 players play against each other in just one basket) challenges going on!",Roberto K

30,Worth a visit.,"Parking a bit of a nightmare but there are plenty of parking areas. I was not wowed by the place, but it is worth a visit. There are lots of vendors, street performers and a skaters park. Its one of those places that you should visit but probably would not go out of my way to go back.",ALISTER2
50,must see,It has been a while since I visited here but it is a must see on the weekend. Get there early to find good parking. Lots of food available along the beach so that is not a problem. There are plenty of sideshows to keep you entertained for hours here. Not to mention just the general weirdo population that seems to gather here. Yes this was once known as Muscle Beach too. Only bad part is the parking and at times the place can be too crowded and dirty but for people watching it cannot be beat!,mikefred
50,Experience Beach Life in LA,"Wow, so many different things to see. A guy walking his pet pig. A guy running with astroboy type springs as shoes. A busker performing amazing guitar solo of Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing. Every step you took along the broadwalk you would see something different. Then there are so many souvenir stores everything from American Indian art, to local t-shirts to even Egyptian Magic lanterns where one would expect a genie to pop out. To experience LA, you definitely need to walk along the broadwalk. I also jogged along the beach and out onto the wharf. It was great to see the waves rolling in whilst the views up and down the coast were great. Some amazing beach homes further up the broadwalk with stunning architecture sit almost right on the sand.",Ministuart
40,"An ""interesting"" place",This is a good place to people watch some of the more interesting people you can see just about anywhere. Lots of little vendors to check out.,johndwilliams

50,See it all,"First of all I went to Santa Monica and walked from there, it was quite a walk, and hot not much shade, however, there are foods places along the way you can sit inside and have a drink. Watching the people go past is interesting, there are many different types of people here. If you do the full length, it will take you around an hour.",mistic09

10,Not nice,I last visited 10 years ago and my recollection is that it was a nicer area back then.There were loads of homeless people about. It felt very grubby and not the buzzing hipPlace you expect to visit.Give it a miss Santa Barbara is nicer a few hours north. I'm never planning a return visit. So pleased we didn't opt to get a hotel in the area.,sharon3001
50,I went some time ago.,"If you are a tourist here for more than a few days, go. I like the seagulls, so walk near the waters edge. Walk until you go under the pier by the waters edge, and end up in Santa Monica Beach, for a locals non tourist trap overtly trendy experience.",mermaidsylvia
40,Worthy of a Visit at Least Once,After driving around for a while to find a parking spot we walked to the boardwalk and beach area before sunset to get some photos. It is definitely a people watching place with people of all ages doing all kinds of things from skateboarding in their park to spay painting over existing graffiti. There were lots of people everywhere including the restaurants and shops. We found the drive by the canals with the beautiful homes a nice adventure to see how the richer people in Venice Beach live. The main street has a VENICE sign lit up at night and the place has a bit of a hippie era feel to it.,kpatters

There are many homeless people here now...and that is kinda sad...but when the boardwalk gets busy...everyone just blends in!! Have always loved this place.",afleetingmoment
50,Perfect for a people-watching stroll,"If your teens enjoy people watching, or browsing artist stands, admiring architecture or taking photographs, they will likely enjoy wandering along the boardwalk. You can pick up mini-maps at some establishments that indicate some of the highlights-- but strolling aimlessly is equally fun.We walked down side streets several times, and found little to hold our attention, so we returned to the boardwalk for our return walk and discovered spots we had missed on the walk down.",visitall50
30,You have to do it.,It's hyped but it's still worth a look just for people watching. The kids in the skate bowl were very talented and worth watching. Lots of characters and vibe but you only need to do it once. Nothing wrong with talking the beach path every day though. I would do that bit again for sure.,EggChen
50,A Must in L.A.!,"The world famous Venice Beach Boardwalk is not to be missed. It is a very busy area with many souvenir shops, restaurants, tattoo and piercing shops. Also great for sports (i.e. surfing, swimming, bodybuilding...) and a perfect place for people watching.",CarlaColumna123
40,Venice Beach Boardwalk,"Great place visited not only by tourist but mainly by locals. You will find street artists here every day - some Hollywood stars started their career on this boardwalk - but be careful, you may become part of their act. You also find many stands with souvenirs - low quality but cheap, and also many restaurants with reasonable prices. You can hire a bike or rolling skates, enjoy the famous outdoor gym, skate park or walk on the sandy beach know for the Baywatch series. The boardwalk will lead you all the way to Santa Monica. I highly recommend you to enjoy a half day or a day int his place full of life.",GuideSabina

50,The Best Place to Bring Your Out of Town Visitors,"I lived in Venice from 1969 - 1984. Walking on the Oceanfront is like a non-stop circus. There are street performers, weight lifters, basketball games, restaurants, a $5 Freak Show, beautiful ocean, great people watching, vendors everywhere, skateboarders and much, much more. Parking is a bit of an issue on weekends.",GaryFleishman
10,Venice Beach was a complete disappointment,"I guess you could call it grungy, I would perhaps say more grubby and smelly, it really was not what I expected.",OnTravelsAgain
40,Wow! Back to the 60s!,"Fun people watching for sure! Be prepared for lots of new age 'hippies', the smell of 'grass', slick vendors who want to 'give' you a cd (don't fall for it). Watching the body builders, basketball, racketball and handball courts are fun! And while there, we were able to see a skateboard competition. Always something going on! The shops are very touristy, souvenir stores, without quality for the most part!Beware! The Public Restrooms are AWFUL! Smelly, dirty, no toilet paper...gross!! We deliberately found a restaurant with clean restrooms!Yet oh so fun!",HRCinder
50,Must see in the LA area,"This is the place you see in movies, commercials and on TV. If you go early in the morning, the park is still quiet with some homeless likely sleeping in the deep end of the pool of the skatepark. Early in the morning you will also catch some surfers. However to get the full Venice experience, it is worth coming back in the late morning/ afternoon when the shops, skatepark, paddle tennis courts, and muscle beach are buzzing. Be prepared to see some things you have never seen before, but you won't regret this trip.",drakeab

40,Thank heavens this place doesn't change.,"Dropped in recently after a 9 year break and pleased to see the life and soul of the Boardwalk hasn't changed a bit.

40,Take it all in,Walk the boardwalk and try to enjoy the atmosphere. You have to just smile and keep walking past the vendors trying to sell you stuff. They will try to trap you to buy their cds/dvds by offering to sign it. Walk away before they do or you'll feel pressured to buy it. Make sure ask heaps of questions because things will often cost more than what they are saying they cost.You definitely get that laid back surfer feel. It smells like sex wax and Marijuana. Loved it. Walk up to muscle beach to do some pull ups it's about a km away.,Jordan F

There are many shops and restaurants and some corners may seem sketchy, but keep your camera handy for snapshots. It's my second time here. The first was years ago during the day, but I am still fascinated by this place. Maybe not a safe place for seminarians, but fun to be there as a tourist or a photographer.",travelsafer

30,"Dirty, didn't live up to hype",We went to the boardwalk expecting something else. I think based off movies I've seen and things I've heard from people I was expecting it to look like it did 20 years ago. It was very dirty and smelled of marijuana. The stores were all full of little trinkets and there were some food places where you can eat. I wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend this for any family outing.,Jamie G
50,Gotta check out a west coast boardwalk,"Lots of good food, fun shops, and people on this boardwalk. Its been the same for the past 25 years. Wouldn't bring the kids here if you are concerned with exposing them to tattoos and pot early on. Lots of pot shops and teenagers/artists/locals hanging and smoking. Not bothering anyone at all, just hanging out. Theres lots nearby to park at but be prepared for traffic on weekends during the summer and any nice weathered day. .",Linh T

50,Interesting area,This is a must see. Be careful with parking as the rates are high. When you see a sign for public parking it means a private parking lot at high rates. We parked a couple of blocks away on a side street and fed the meter. Literally hundreds of shops on a mile walk (both directions) on the boardwalk. Strange people to view as well. Nice views,marci477
10,Easily worst beach boardwalk I've been on,...and I've been to RhylFull of homeless and clearly spaced out folk. Looked completely run down and the eccentric street entertainers where nowhere to be found.The beach looked clean but there was really no need to walk from Santa Monica to visit this place. It is just not meant for anyone wanting a stroll without constantly being harassed or feeling uneasy at the blatant drug abuse. Each to their own but I will never be back.,LeWidniiCritique
50,Fun scene and next to the beach,"This wasn't my first trip here but it had been years agogreat to spend a few hours here walking by the shops and vendors and then also time to hang out at the beachWe timed out visit to be there during sunset and that was a big plus..We paid for parking in the lot at Rose Street ($9) instead of wasting time looking for cheaper lots, since our time was limitedA trip - the musicians and others can be quite aggressive in stopping to speak with you and hitting you up for money, and many people also have signs that they expect some money if you take their picture.Also be careful when you are walking around - you are sharing the space with skateboarders and bicyclists!",bluesmama11

40,Sleazy but entertaining,"You’ve seen it in the movies, now see it for real. (Although it looks better in the movies.) T-shirt shops, tattoo parlors, body builders, and marijuana “doctors” added to the sidewalk vendors with their personal CDs, lots of skulls and other cheap, ugly kitsch. It is a one of a kind experience. Great spot for people watching. For an abrupt change, walk a couple blocks east to the canals lined with million dollar architectural wonders. Skip the junk food on the beach and go to one of the restaurants on Washington for some decent food. I like Simmzys.",chl0e48

10,YUCK.,"Love the beach, hate the boardwalk. Smells bad. And the stores like to rip people off. Beware of a store called Custom Shirts 3 - went in to the store, my daughter found a shirt she liked, asked the price, guy said $20.00 (no price on shirt) and if you want iron on- it's additional cost, ok, we will be back. Shopped a few stores and seemed that shirt was the best price. So we went back to the store, asked same guy again, how much for shirt, replied $20.00 plus iron on additional. Okay - great, daughter picks out shirt and iron on, another guy says, I will throw in another tshirt for free - you pay for iron on. Okay- pick out tshirt ($14.99 price on shirt says). Another guy comes in to take my payment - says it's total is $49.98 - hand guy the card and hands me back receipt to sign and it says $87.57. WHAT!?!?! I questioned the guy that took the payment. Said that is what he said, I said no you just said $49.98 and my daughter said, yes, that is what you said, guy said I made a mistake,. I said well adjust it. He said he can't. I said I want a refund, guy said, I can't. I ask for manager/owner - guy comes up I explain what happened and he said too bad. I said, then make it right and throw in a couple more shirts to make it add up to 87.00 - he said he can't. I said, you first told me the shirt was $20.00 + iron on $14.99 - and the additional thsirt is free plus iron on - $14.99 - that total would be $49.98. He said, I never said $20.00. OMG! Yes, I flipped out. They just ripped me off. I said, get the owner on the phone - they guy picked up the phone and pretended to call someone and after a minute said no refund get out of the store, because I was yelling. After a few minutes they agreed to refund me $25.00 -took my card, swiped it and had me sign a refund receipt for $25.00 which I did, but guess what, the $25.00 was cancelled and never went back into my bank!!!

An experience not to be missed. Be sure and watch some of the unique talent perform. Not your apple pie adventure.,Al W

There were other stalls with people selling homemade crafts, but many of the stalls were deserted.We decided to walk back to Santa Monica for lunch.

30,"THE BEACH IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT----","Venice is a naturally beatifully area--the weather is great year 'round, it has wide clean beaches, beautiful mountain views, a great bike path, nice paddle ball courts, a few nice restaurants--all is good, UNTIL you walk along the ""boardwalk"" --a paved pathway running the length of Venice. Here is where you find a creepy flea market-type atmosphere, with vendors hawking all types of wierd ""art"", ""bum signs"" on cardboard, temporary tattoos, over-sized posters (some R rated), & so-called spray paint artists bent on seeing how much paint spray (and toxic fumes) they can spray around (& beyond) their vendor spots (giving you a headache!). In addion, there lots of not-so cheap trinkets for sale that appear to be mass produced. Occasionally you might find original art or hear some good music, but for the most part I would skip the board walk and opt for the beautiful canals, or the colorful neighborhoods with every kind of architecture you can imagine. Except for the depressinig boardwalk, Venice is worth visiting. Oh, the city needs to do something about the homeless population who tend to camp (or loiter) along the grassy areas next to the bike path. Also DO NOT USE the public bathrooms if you can possibly help it!! (e.g. not good!).",Taratree
40,A Feast for the Eyes,"There is so much to see at Venice Beach -- for free! There are the many shops and restaurants/bars, the boardwalk musicians and entertainers, the Muscle Beach gym, and the basketball courts where ""White Men Can't Jump"" was filmed. You can walk on the vast white sands, or watch the skateboarders show off at the skate park.And then the people-watching! We saw 3 individuals with boa constrictors, and one was an albino boa. There were people of all persuasions and all manners of dress, young and old, fit and fat, those wanting to be seen and those doing the looking.We watched the sun set from an outdoor cafe that had a live band on the beach side of the walkway. The sunset was okay, but the moving scene on the boardwalk was spectacular!",novacamp
20,I still dont understand the draw of this place,"There are so many nice places to walk along the ocean in Southern California-- it boggles my mind that people go out of their way to come here and get hassled by pan handlers.The novelty of wears off almost instantly-- Santa Monica or Manhattan Beach boardwalks are so much nicer, cleaner and visitor friendly",mgreene40
30,Simply not what it used to be,"I've visited Venice Beach many, many times over the past 30 years and I have to finally say that it's become boring. The constant battle between residents/shop keepers and the street artists and their ilk have been won by the shop keepers. Good for them, BAD for everyone else. The ""good"" old Venice Beach area always had an eclectic mix of people from ALL walks of life and that made it interesting. Yes it had an edge and a few times was more dangerous than it should have been but the boardwalk had a SOUL! Nowadays? Not so much. It's a safe and boring kind of place but for me I'm no longer going to waste my time there. So sad in a way.",Mark J

There is even a medical marijuana store with salespeople outside trying to get you in so they can set you up...not my thing but interesting, I guess.

There is some nice 'wall art' to admire as well as the palm trees and sandy beaches that were very clean. Bars and diners like Larry's and Venice ale house are there to quench your thirst. A nice gentle stroll for 30-40 mins and you will be on Santa Monica Pier. All this in a very laid back atmosphere. Free parking is limited but there are city and private parking lots.",gomms13

50,Brilliant..!,Now this is the place to be. This too was on my HOHO route and that isnt a good decision as I would suggest to spend one full day. Due to dearth of time though you can (as I did) spend some 60-90 minutes here and get a real feel of the place.

20,"Just like Coney Island NY, another 'character area' of the city that has seen better times","We are not inexperienced travelers - we were told repeatedly how unsafe Naples in Italy was ""oh you'll get robbed, you'll get pick pocketed, its dangerous, the mafia are so bad there"" etc and so on - well I felt more comfortable there than I did here. It feels seedy. The boardwalk is awful, full of people trying to sell tat and their CDs. There was a guy selling some good vinyl records in amongst the trash and stuff that you have to sort through but largely it felt dirty and seedy. I concur with a previous reviewer - there is no way known I'd use the toilets along here or eat at one of the boardwalk cafes. I'm not saying the cafes themselves were unclean, they were all very full of people who looked pleased to be there.They looked a bit 'samey' to me, unlike the unique options on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. I preferred Abbot Kinney Boulevard - so different to the boardwalk area. The beach is also very good and there is some good street murals and street art in the streets running along the boardwalk, but if you want good beach and good area, go to Santa Monica. I came to see the boardwalk because its mentioned so often as part of the LA character, just like Coney Island is mentioned in the New York history and character references. But both places are areas I couldn't wait to leave. It isn't a relaxing walk along here. There is 'plenty' to see though and watch out for the bikes and skateboarders.",Belgo96

10,Not what it used to be......,"On my first trip here, about 15 years ago, it was really interesting in a funky sort of way. Back then, there were lots of amateur artists and street performers, tourists with children, etc. Recently though, I took the wife here during vacation so she could see some of the eclectic folks and sights. Now, it's just smelly and dirty. Yeah, the beach is good. It's got plenty of room for everyone, the waves are great, and the weather nearly always fantastic. The boardwalk however is just getting gross. I wouldn't touch a public restroom or drinking fountain with a ten foot pole.Overbearing ""music artists"" (easily confused for a small group of gang members) try to force their demo CD into your hand acting like they are handing them out for free. But if you take it, they demand you pay for it. I already knew this, but had to stop the wife from taking one.Bikes are not allowed on the boardwalk, only on the designated bike path. Yeah, right. Watch that you don't get ran down.Yes, California has laws that allow medical marijuana. And along the boardwalk you can find ""doctors offices"" that will help you get some. It must be easy, because there is one of these offices on every block. Whatever your views on the subject are, so be it, I'm not here to judge. But let's just say these places don't always attract polite, clean and honest people. Keep your wits about you and your belongings.I'm not a teenager anymore, but not an old fuddy duddy either. I just honestly believe the boardwalk has lost its appeal.",JT66

My husband, being a big Arnie fan, was looking forward to seeing 'muscle beach' , which turned out to be just a dated outdoor gym with not much going on, but you could imagine what it may have been like in its heyday.As for the rest of Venice Beach, it had a similar feel to Camden Town, colourful people, eccentric, hippy types and street artists. As with any place it has it's good and bad, and yes as someone else pointed out, sadly there were a few homeless people sleeping under the palm trees and going through bins, but that's by no means unique to this area.",Athenablue

There is a very large homeless population and it just doesn't seem like a safe place to be. There have been several homicides there this summer. Only an hour after I arrived I saw man literally get his head bashed in right in front of my hotel while a dozen people looked on and tried to get the attacker to stop.

30,Interesting.,This is a very interesting place to walk and view the eclectic/eccentric groups and individuals walking/sitting around. The most impressive part of the walk is we were not bothered by any of the shop/individuals selling there wares. This leaves ample time to just plain people watch. Our visit was on a Sunday I can only imagine a visit on a Saturday night be a bit more exciting.,Geoffrey J
20,Meh,Went here today to see what the hype was about and it was nothing to hype about. There were skateboarders doing there thing but somehow a bunch of evangelical people who are trying to preach by means of the radio talking the hole time makes visiting here annoying.,jordansbulls

30,Fun but there are better places to watch people,"The scene at the boardwalk is mostly hippy and lets-dress-like-a-rebel. There are plenty of shops and little restaurants and bars. There are also lots of people trying to sell little things, home made art or anything else their personal skills can create that can be sold. Parking is difficult and expensive. The Garmin does not send you to parking lots but to dead end streets so it is best to prepare a little so that you can correct the Garmin just before the end. Be careful with bikes and people walking because the chaos that is created between cars combined with not to careful biking/walking create plenty of chance for dangerous traffic situations, The boardwalk is not bad but I would go the Santa Monica Pier instead which is located 4 miles north of the Venice Boardwalk. The beaches at the Venice Boardwalk are really nice, if that is what you are after and you like the little shops this might well be the perfect beach for you.",DdeKerf
30,Interesting to say the least,"We decided to walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica - and the first thing I would say is dont.. its a lot further than it looks. On the upside though, you get to walk along the boardwalk which is such an experience (once you get past the smell of the medical marijuana shops that are there). You will meet such an eclectic array of people along it.While we probably wouldnt walk the full distance again if we were in LA we would definitely go back",luckstrike13
40,Such a Diverse Interesting Place,"This was a very interesting place (and I""m from New Orleans) If you like to people watch this is the place to be. There is certainly a mix of everything out here local artist/vendors and great food for really cheap (at the right spots). We rented bikes and rode to Santa Monica of course the weather was perfect and it was a great day. Loved how they had all kind of activities going on from tight ropes and gymnastic rings to paddle tennis to beach volleyball. Definately something for everyone.",angboudreaux13
50,Definitely a place to people watch!,"If you are into people watching, by all means go to the Venice Beach Boardwalk! There are some fantastic street performers there: break dancers, skateboarders, etc., all of whom were fun to watch, but there are two ""ordinary people"" whom I'll never forget! One was an extremely tall, rather thin guy wearing a turban which made him look even taller as he rollerbladed down the pavement. The other was a guy whose ""huge doughnut"" overlapped his shorts he wore below his Superman T-shirt. Of course, he was wearing his very long, red cape. He was walking what I thought must be his dog, so my eyes followed the leash he was dragging behind himself only to discover that he was actually walking his rags! I kid you not! There was no animal at the end of his leash, merely several dirty rags. This scene is rather hard to discover. I wish I'd had my camera with me that day! lol",traveltoforeignlands
50,Easy and nice ob bike,"You must rent a bike (or take yours) and sped few hours on this bike road. Even if its nice weather its definitely worth of it.

From bike road is very good overview on Venice Beach itself and all the shops behind the street including all artists there.",Slavomir H
30,Everyone Should Go Once,"You see Venice Beach depicted in the movies so you must go once to see what it's all about and say you've ""been there."" I made it there, glad I saw it, but it's not really a repeat destination.I love boardwalks. Santa Cruz, Monterey Bay, Fisherman's Wharf in San Fran, Pacific Beach...all repeatable, family-friendly boardwalks. I can't say that about Venice Beach. Yes, there really is gym equipment on an elevated platform on the beach where we saw 3 guys ""working out."" Truthfully, the guys skateboarding in the elaborate concrete bowls was far more impressive. We stood and watched them a long time. A couple of them were really good so it was entertaining to see them up close.The beach is wider from boardwalk to water than any other beach town I've been to. Sun and sand everywhere so if you simply want to lay on the beach, there is plenty more room in Venice Beach than Pacific Beach.We bought a fresh fruit cup for $6. It was oranges, strawberries and kiwi. It was fresh and cold and I'd be willing to pay $6 again. Tons of chotchkie shops to browse. But the boardwalk seemed more run down or ""sketchy"" in some sections than other places I've been. I'm never afraid at night in Pacific Beach. I'd be looking over my shoulder at night in Venice Beach.People set up temporary ""shops"" in the sand selling everything from wood carvings to metal art to neck rubs. It's much more fun to browse that stuff and there's more of it in Venice Beach.We ate lunch at an outdoor cafe called Figtree's Cafe. Many healthy options on the menu. Good prices. The water tastes a little funny so ask for lemon/lime.So like I said, you gotta see it once, it's worth at least a half-day investment.",Staci O

I've been there January after January, and August after August - which I have to say is DAMN hot! I love Venice's laid back attitude, it's superb boardwalk, a few half decent restaurant's and bars, and it's only a stone's throw away from ""The Rooster Fish"", which is Venice Beach's only acknowledged Gay Bar. It's raw and untidy, but always welcoming. The other bars along the boardwalk, are pretty similar. I guess Venice Beach stands for an era that combines the Beach Boys with Lou Reid, with a twist of Rick Astley. Easy to get to from the Big City, and people watching is why you are there!",George H

40,A must stop when in LA,"You need to visit when in LA and enjoy the people watching, the roller skaters and skate boarders. There are plenty of average placed to stop while walking for a snack or cocktail. Typical bar food, nothing stood out as a must have. Both my sons got tattoos on our first trip and now every time we go someone gets a tattoo.",Catherine G
40,A Must-See Beach and Show!,"This is not the nicest beach, but it is definitely a must-see. From pan-handlers to street performers to body-builders and more, this beach has it all. There are tons of restaurants and stores. You may even see a celebrity or two. They should just put a bubble over the whole thing and charge admission to see the show!",Johnny D
50,Very interesting place. Lots of people to see.,"Great place to people watch and see some things you don't get to see every day. My favorite thing was true beach bum ""Venice Bum Signs"" selling cardboard signs that had sayings written in crayon and marker. What an inventive way to make some money without begging on the streets. Some of them were not for kids eyes but he had quite a variety. Ours said, ""Bums just wanna have fun"" for $1 and he signed it for another $1. Too funny. People set up areas along the walk to sell, perform, or whatever. You never know what your going to see. There were some little girls dancing and some older kids playing instruments for money. There were even some pretty good acrobat performers. Lots of stores and the kids loved watching the skateboarders at the park. The bathrooms are the most disgusting I've ever seen in my life so maybe try to use the bathroom before you come and don't drink anything! We actually came here twice on our trip because it was so interesting. Bought some souvenirs here also.",Metz5family
40,Nostalgia,I love Venice beach and have been going there for the past 40 years. This is woodstock revisited and it almost feels like some of the guys I saw 40 years ago are still there. Not the flashiness of other beaches but the nostalgia of the past.,maweb31
20,dirty,Venice Beach used to be a fun destination but now it sees seedier and dirty. The people seem a little creepy as well.,Chris M
40,VENICE BEACH: Choose north or south areas for different experiences,"We enjoy the vibe at the north end of Venice Beach near the section Muscle Beach but only for a little while - lots of outdoor vendors, basketball, racket ball, volley ball, etc but when that is enough, we leave the 18th Ave area and head for the area around 27th Place or toward the south end (Speedway and 27th Place thereabouts) FANTASTIC BIKE PATHS that are separate from the WALKING paths. No collisions or conflict between walker and bikers. Great places to rent bikes/inline skates/etc. Wonderful access to wide sandy beaches.",Lynn Williams P
30,Don't get fooled by TV,"Seeing shows such as Californication, I had high expectations when it came to L.A. and especially Venice Beach. 200m of 'hippie-whatever' people that pretentiously hang out at Venice boardwalk. Good to see, in and out, max if you want to buy a Venice Beach t-shirt or a longboard and that's it.",Tomasawyer

30,Doesn't live up to the hype,"We were interested in seeing what the boardwalk was like but was kinda disappointed that it did not live up to the hype. We just saw lots of shops, boardwalk vendors and a tent for worshiping Satan.",Philip L
40,Some celebrity sightings at a fundraiser on the pier.,It's just like what you see on TV. One of those places you have to visit while in California. Take the time to walk the entire length and stick your head into some of the shops. Beautiful.,The-Walking-e_D
50,Amazing,Venice Beach in California is an amazing and fun place. You can enjoy in a really nice place with your friends and family.,Nathallies B
40,Interesting,"We visited here as a family group of 6. It was certainly an eye opener with many stalls (all very similar) selling there wares. Some great characters but an awful lot of poverty and homelessness. Muscle beach was very small, and the men were right posers!!! Interesting enough though for a day. Beautiful beaches and lots of people. We are in a cafe along the front and they added $18 tip before we even had eaten the food, so just watch out for that if you are in a group of 6 and more!",Liz649
50,Such Character!,"Venice beach has a life and personality of its own. There isn't a dull moment! People are real chilled out, flea shops everywhere, everyones busy doing their own thing, its easy to absorb the character this place holds and feel like you belong. Keep in mind though, some of the hottest software companies started off here!",SeemalKarthik
40,"Great to visit this Iconic place, but don't expect perfection","Hired a couple of bikes at Santa Monica and cycled down to Venice, really enjoyed the ride between and once there I got a kick out of recognising so many sights from TV shows and films but have others have said felt a little bit more on my guard and wary than at Santa Monica where I felt totally relaxed.Was going to go with an average rating but in the end decided that it was my unrealistic expectation of the place through films and Tv programmes. It is fun, colourful, a bit edgy and totally lacking in pretense.Do and visit with that in mind and enjoy it.",Darren H

40,Quirky craft fronted promenade,"Walk 2 miles from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and see lots of craft stalls including some excellent art work.

The children enjoyed the walk and the stalls too.",Family10000
30,not really our type of place,"We came here on our last day in LA after having just been to santa monica and to say the least we wished we had stayed in santa monica not a pleasant place at all to visit, maybe if you are into the whole punk thing, but we are in our late 20s and really didnt like the tacky vibe.",Pingu_the_penguin_84
40,Fun day at Venice Beach,"It's a must visit at least once. The beach is beautiful and clean. The boardwalk was a blast. People watching at its best. We met some very interesting people. There are some truly talented artists hidden among the crazy sea of people. Be prepared to pay for parking. I think it was 18 dollars right on beach, but that was cheaper then anywhere else. Food was inexpensive. Good time was had by all!",Leslie D
40,Dirty and not family freindly,"If you like weird, go to Venice Beach. Lots of pot smokers, pot sellers (green doctors), street people, homeless and just plain attention seekers. Not a place for kids, some very aggressive homeless people here and not many police. Every year it gets dirtier and odder. It's a shame because amongst the junky, over priced tshirt shops, there's a number of very good artists.",Aussie1fan
50,Californian Classic,"Is there anything more iconic than Venice Beach? California and it's history, pop culture and the dark and the light all combine here at some point. So many people have walked, roller bladed, skated, cycled, run and made their way along this ocean-side promenade.",JnTaz
40,Very nice LA beach & boardwalk,"Venice beach is probably the most famous LA beach, and for a reason. Both the beach and boardwalk are very nice, although the water is very cold. There are many shops and restaurants right next to the beach.",avipiti
40,The passing parade,If you're into people watching this is the place for you. It always seems to be busy with an endless parade of people of all ages and nationalities slowly moving along. The buskers are something else and there seems to be a never ending array of food outlets. Just don't try finding somewhere to park.,Colin J
40,A truly unique beach experience,"Our family day at Venice beach was a trip...so much to see! Grew up in Southern California and there's nothing else quite like it. There's so much to see and do...and on our recent visit, I saw six different things I'd never seen before in my life. Not sure if that's all good, but it was interesting. Go for the entertainment, not for the typical beach experience. For that, there are plenty of other options!",Sarah B
40,always a favorite,"lots of life lessons can be learned on the boardwalk. enjoy it.perfect for young children, those who don't like lashing their dogs, pedos, prostitutes and the homeless who have beachfront property.fun place, but there are a few crazys to watch out for",kath1031

30,"Kind of Odd, Kind of Interesting","We went here because people say it is the place to see... but we weren't sure why. The beach, as a beach, is average. There are nicer, not too far, for sure. The boardwalk seemed sketchy with sketchy touristy shops. It was interesting for people watching, but not necessarily for very long. Glad we went and did it, but no need to return.",chrsms

30,Don't pay for the Venice Beach freak show when the freak show on the boardwalk is free,"We've been to some places that offer world-class people watching, but nothing compares to Venice Beach. Eclectic, funky, freaky, colorful, off-color, free-spirited. You name it and you can find it at Venice Beach. It's actually a very wide, beautiful beach. However the Boardwalk itself consists largely of very tacky, touristy vendors selling cheap wares. There is one establishment that charges a $5 admission to witness its self-proclaimed freak show. The free viewing on the boardwalk was enough entertainment for me.",AkrontravelerAkron
10,RUN don't WALK!!,"As a Californian who grew up in the beach communities of Orange County, I never had the ""opportunity"" to visit Venice Beach. If you want to walk amongst filth and freaks, this is your place. It smells, the ""boardwalk"" is as dirty as you can imagine and trash litters all the streets around it.We ate at the ""Sidewalk Cafe"", which is the only place to eat, and it was adequate. But by 10:00 AM, we had already witnessed 4 arrests for drugs, insane conduct, etc. It's a carnival of the worst type. Don't bring your kids and family. It will leave you with a sense of disgust. The tolerance and ""social justice"" types embrace and make excuses for the ""homeless"". The result is Venice Beach. ICK!!",Michael M

40,Something Different,"Like nothing else! The beach is beautiful, lots of T-shirt places, the further down the boardwalk the cheaper they are .The sites are interesting, someone dressed in a bear suit on roller blades, and it's a hot day. Another completely tatooed. Skimpy bathing suits and beautiful bodies. Also places to eat and stroll.",Sandi468
50,A lot of interesting characters to been seen here.,"We walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica along the boardwalk, there were an interesting array of people and stores to entertain along the way. From muscle beach, the basketballers, skateboarders, acrobats, Rhumba to the Dr weed stores and all the arts and crafts stalls there is is plenty to see along the way. It probably took a casual hour to do it.",keenastraveller
40,"Bronzed bodies, fearless skateboarders & the tourists who gawk at all of them","The 4th of July is either the worst day to come to Venice Beach or the best. Days later and I still haven't made up my mind. However, if anything screams LA to me, it's this congregation place with all the bronzed, sculpted bodies; all the fearless skateboarders with no safety gear; and all the cholesterol you could possibly eat on a stick. It's people-watching extremus if you can figure out where to park. My partner and I decided to come here after a more highbrow morning at the LA County Museum of Art. Unlike Santa Monica where there are garages galore because of the Third Street Promenade, there aren't such structures here, so we ended up parking way east on Venice Blvd.The sidewalk hike gave us a good excuse to stroll the man-made canals lined with party-hearty bungalows on the 4th. It's just a quick walk to the beach where the boardwalk beckons. Street vendors line one side while tattoo and T-shirt shops line the other with the occasional fish taco stand thrown in for good measure. You can count on getting stuck in a crowd of gawkers whether they're looking at street performers you can't see or the weightlifting pit at Muscle Beach where intimidating-looking female bodybuilders await their turn on stage. Don't worry though for every body beautiful on the beach, there are at least a dozen tourists who have let their gym memberships lapse. Oh wait, that would be me.",Ed_Uyeshima
40,Fun and Historic is you like weight trianing,"Its the home of muscle beach. Its a bot run down and rusting its still a great place to visit for anyone into weight training since this is one of the birth places of the fitness movement. The strip in between Venice and Santa Monica is a great place to ride a bike. The shops are really low rent which add to the charm, but dont frget get you mace at home ladies!",Mattthew P
40,Keep an Open Mind,I recently took my Sister to visit Venice Beach for her first time. Being extremely shy and conservative it was a bit of a shock to her. But it is VENICE BEACH. Be aware that it is not for young kids because of the Marijuana being smoked everywhere and the medical marijuana licenses being sold at numerous places but it is VENICE BEACH. The street vendors will remind you of almost every place you visit. It is an experience.,thibbs1955

You don't have to be a skater to enjoy it theres lots to see and if your up for it, lots to do.

Muscle beach was empty with no muscled people to see anywhere. The beach was okay and the skateboarders were very entertaining, but other than that, it wasn't good. It may have had something to do with when we visited, there were a large group of anti abortionists displaying confronting pictures which wasn't nice to see - particularly for children.There were homeless all around but they weren't a problem and didn't try to harass anyone. We did visit during the day and it could become a different place after dark perhaps. There are much better places to visit in LA than Venice Beach.",michellecurtis

I found little of any value in visiting this location when you can easily enjoy Manhattan Beach or Hermosa Beach with less crowds, Mary Jane shops, and crowds of homeless folks running around trying to scam you. I was literally afraid I would get sick by walking down the boardwalk it was so nasty and disgusting. Easy to not visit unless you want to see tons of homeless folks and scammers packed into one spot. Frankly I regret having visited with my family.Parking is difficult and I was worried my vehicle would be stolen when I left it parked. When I returned to my vehicle two LAPD cops were standing next to it as they had some issues with folks right next to my vehicle. Great.",Chapingrande

30,Distant disappointmen,"We drove to Venice Beach Boardwalk through bumper to bumper traffic in the town. We parked in the public lot at the end of the pier. It was reasonable in price and a good location for walking. ""June gloom"" prevailed so the views weren't the best, but we enjoyed the walk to the end of the pier. A few brave souls were trying to surf and swim, but the beach wasn't very busy. We were there on an early Friday afternoon. We walked the nice sidewalks to the boardwalk area and Muscle Beach. There were many ""Doctors"" encouraging us to be examined for any medical conditions which might require Medicinal Marijuana. The rest of the boardwalk was the usual stuff, junk food, cheap souvenirs, etc. Muscle Beach had one guy working out. We walked up to the skatepark, but it was not as challenging as some we have around our home, although the setting was way better! Looked at the graffiti artwork and headed back. The condos along the beach are being renovated and some look beautiful. As we left, more people seemed to be coming into the area. I think we arrived a little early for the sights you usually hear about at Venice Beach. The mural artwork on the buildings in Venice Beach are BEAUTIFUL and varied.",Lou P

40,Definately a one of a kind experience!,"Venice beaches features on our TVs more times than one could count therefore it is something that must be crossed off ones to-do list. However, it is not for the faint-hearted - crowded, crazy, over-the-top, filled with peculiar characters, market stalls selling everything and anything, street performers performing everything from the mundane juggling tricks to truly talented artworks and more marijuana clinics than I have ever come across. It is picturesque, the palm trees really do perfectly line the board walk as you see on TV but the atmosphere and culture of Venice Beach is truly eclectic and unique. I would definitely not recommend that anyone, in particular a female go alone, it can be quite seedy (my husband did not ever leave my side), but it is truly a place that needs to be experienced. We hired bicycles and rode from Venice Beach along the board walk all the way down to Santa Monica and that was truly a fun and enjoyable experience.",Penny K

20,Disappointed but had to say I've been there,"I see Venice Beach all the time on TV and had to see it first hand. I was sadly disappointed. We started on the south end that looked very nice with some appealing beach front restaurants, and then as we walked north it turned into a rather seedy place -- a lot of homeless people (so unfortunate), street performers who were more out to get $ than really give you a show, cheap t-shirt shops, and my favorite the $40 medical marijuana evaluation clinics everyone few hundred yards (complete with people in green scrubs).

40,Best bit is the FREAKSHOW love it,"Venice Beach Boardwalk is miles long and you could spend days just soaking up the atmosphere.We started at Muscle Beach which is the famous outdoor gym. We saw some people working out but no one that looks like Arnie.Then you get to the basketball courts which are great fun to watch for a while. When we went their was a tournament going on which was free and very entertaining.Carry on a bit and you come to the skate park. This was awesome. They guys and girls who were skate boarding were top class. Loved it.When you go a bit further you come to the Venice Beach Freakshow. You may have seen these guys on Fox in their own TV show but even if you haven't it is still worth a visit. Todd Ray, the founder, can be found outside touting for your business. He is very approachable and a great showman. Go inside to see their museum of oddities. It is full of historical freakshow stuff and obscurities such as 2 headed animals, some alive like the terrapins and some diseased (natural causes don't worry). Its very fascinating and great to see someone celebrating the variety of life. The show itself is short but sweet. We saw Morgue and Sunshine. Their performance was brilliant and were happy to talk to the crowd afterwards. Being on the TV has obviously not gone to their heads. We had a lovely chat with Danielle (Todd's wife). She was so friendly and loved the fact that their Freakshow was the main reason we were in Venice. Really this is the best thing about Venice.Back to my review of the boardwalk, one side is full of your expected tat (cheap souvenir) shops but on the other side you will find independent artists, crafts and performers. Some were just trying to get enough money to feed themselves that day but others were very very talented.Venice Beach is very bohemian, full of characters and very unique. As you can't drink on the streets it is very laid back and very chilled. Love it and can't wait to get back.",Amy D

50,Freakin love it,"Venice is kind of like the 'Real LA'. It's a gritty, pirate town and resembles the crunchy side bit of fried egg, or perhaps the last bite of a wrap where all the sauce pool up and you get all the flavors. It's a combination of all the colors of the wild west, It's a beach version of a dive bar. This strip of coast is one of the coolest places in the world and I love it with more than my eVape.",MarcMenz
40,Love Venice Beach,"I love walking the boardwalk on Venice. There is all kinds of stuff happening. People biking, skateboard riding, working out... Great people watching. Vendors selling all kinds of stuff. People doing tricks and showing talents for tips.",sallysP7784RS
50,Beautiful area,My family had just one overnight stay at Venice Beach. Unfortunately we had to leave the next day but vowed to come back and spend more time as it has a beautiful view and a cool atmosphere!,v0yageur10
30,iconic,"Rode bikes on the boardwalk, great exercise and people watching. Sad to see that the city lets the homeless trash the beachside park.",cmrhodes64
40,Venice Beach...,"just like you see in the movies, lots of skaters, roller bladers, people riding their bicycles and or walking their dogs, nice to get away from LA city and experience the coast",Natees
40,An LA Constant,"Always when I fly into LA I go straight to Venice Beach to assimilate and breathe in the Ocean Air.. The place has a timeless quality.. plenty to see and the colourful characters who inhabit the area just add to the atmosphere.. Always good food available and a cleansing ale to accompany it, while also drinking in the view and the passing parade.. A Must for any traveller",TonyDryden
40,A City with Character(s),"I like Venice and would give it 5 stars but it's very transient and sometimes a bit sketch. Sure the street vendors and hippies add to the appeal of the city but then there are those that just come across as dirty and dangerous. Other then that it's a very hipster and accepting part of LA. I you want personality then this is the place for you but if you're looking for luxury then stick to Beverly Hills. Venice is boardwalks, street vendors, hippies, skaters, and street performers. Lots of great bars and restaurants to eat or grab a drink and you can rent a bike if you don't have one. Good luck with parking, if you get frustrated on a weekend then just park up near Marina Del Rey and Uber down, it will be cheaper than parking.",justinsena
50,Groovy Place cool shops,"Neat shops and interesting people line the boardwalk of Venice Beach. We walked from Santa Monica down the walkway to Venice and loved the shops, people watched and watched the skaters at the skate park. They were even filming a movie we were able to watch some clips of while we were there. Don't want to miss this area!",Shan B
50,Unique Place!,I think Venice Beach is a must see! Very quirky and unique there is also something to see in Venice Beach,AlexHeppner
30,Venice Beach has a lot of tar that needs to be cleaned up,I was surprised to see and step in all the tar along the shoreline. I also found parking quite challenging..,EGRap
30,Fun place to people watch and ride bikes,"Friend and I had fun walking the boardwalk and talking recently. I am visiting California from the East Coast and found the boardwalk pretty average for what I am used to at the Delaware beaches. The boardwalk has a fun, touristy vibe like most big beaches. The highlight for me was lunch at the Whaler restaurant.",SMLove226
30,"DISAPPOINTING, AND FAR FROM WHAT ITS MADE OUT TO BE","This was one place I really wanted to visit, my expectations of venice beach were where you could take in the terrific views and witness excentric wealthy people parading around and in general a happy place to be and experience.I know now that all that is glamorised on tv shows and the true extent of the reality of venice beach was FAR from all that.At the time of my visit I was staying in LA with my boyfriend at the time, who lived in the le brea vicinity.It was my first trip there, so thankfully he knew all the places and knew what to expect.The first thing I noticed whilst walking along venice beach, were total down and outs, people intoxicated, or under the influence of drugs, selling drawings, hand made items or basically whatever they COULD SELL TO YOU, shouting as you walk past to try and get you to give them money or buy something from them.There was a couple fighting ""LITERALLY"" in a drunken stew. There are souvenier kiosks there but all so very tacky, the problem was if you stopped to look at anything you were constantly being accosted by so many different people all after one thing from you MONEY.The next thing was the constant medical cannabis guys with there green doctors style coats approaching you with leaflets trying to get you into their little centers, which there are so many of as you walk along venice beach, you can politely refuse and let them know you aren't interested but they will still continue to shout you back as your walking!!!!To be honest it was a stressful experience and in the end all I wanted to do was get away from the place, as I was actually fearful for my safety.Away from all the madness was a skater park which was very impressive to sit and watch these talented people from adults to children perform there skills on there boards.",jojo7292
40,Great,"Great experience coming here and seeing everything and there is a lot of everything to see and do, manly people watching. You can easy spend a few hours here.",Mario Fiona G

10,Looks like Cracktown.....,"I can't review the actual 'beach' or 'boardwalk' itself, well....because we never made it there. We stayed in Venice at a Airbnb studio rental that was horrible compared to the 'raving' reviews it got....and the town of Venice...well just dirty. We were walking distance to the big CVS store....I've been to numerous vacation destinations and ALWAYS the local drugstore has a good, inexpensive variety of souvenirs....not one in the CVS store. It too was cold, dirty and just plain gross inside. The hubby and I thought we'd drive the 15 min down to the Venice boardwalk but after driving around and around in circles down the crowded 'alley' looking dirty streets, with people honking constantly and flipping you off we basically were like 'f--k this'. The area was so run down, dirty, unattractive looking it was not worth any more of our time. I was told the boardwalk was freaky but was willing to give it a go....but dealing with the people, traffic and 'cracktown' appearance just a block away from the beach/boardwalk....no thanks!",kitteakat
40,Weird,Again another neat place to see just because you hear so much about it and see it on TV and in the movies. If you're close minded don't go. there lots of funky weird neat interesting things to see and do. but you really should check it out just be open minded.,~Michelle My Belle~
30,More Fun if You're in your 20's,"I'm in my 40's, the appeal of a beach walk is nowhere what it used to be 20 years ago. So in that perspective, this was pretty boring. Stores with crap I don't want to buy, restaurants with food I don't want to eat, and crowds of people that I don't really enjoy either. It's pretty safe here; you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a police officer. It's ok for a romantic stroll but, you might be better served by just walking on the beach. Walked passed a couple having sex in a hammock was probably the highlight.",Craig K
20,Watch your valuables.,"I found this to be a mostly boring visit filled with hippies and ""salesmen"" trying to sell me things off a card table on the sidewalk. If you want beaches go to Hawaii.",Melissa M
50,Venice Beach Do Not Miss It!,"This is not to be missed. I really cannot imagine having gone to California without making my way here. The culture, arts and vibe puts you in a new place with inspiring moments at every turn. The buskers, the street art and the kitschy things to buy make it lots of fun. It truly is a place where absolutely anyone is welcome and accepted...all making for a memorable experience outside your comfort zone.",cmelanie
40,"Didn't swim, only walked","The walking was great. We didnt swim because it was a pittle cold and windy. We let the kids run on the beach. The walking area has so many stores that sell souvenirs (t-shirts, etc).The area was clean except that for some reason we got sticky black stuff on the bottom of our feet (also was on our slippers)!ATM machines: plenty all over the place ($2.50 transaction fee).",younis
50,Cool LA life,A really quirky place where everyone is really laid back and hippyish. There are lots of people who set up stalls selling paintings and crafty things as well as jewellery and more abstract things too. The atmosphere is great and the beach itself is really pretty. There are really good street artists and entertainers as well as friendly locals and their dogs. A great place to go in LA.,Lwhittaker1
20,Very grubby compared to Santa Monica beaches,Wasn't overly impressed with the beaches along this part of the coast which were the poor relative of Santa Monica. The area was grubby and needed cleaning up!,Al-Shumba
50,A Fun Adventure,"Plan to be there at least 4-5 hrs and plan on wading in ocean to get wet. It was the highlight to our week. You have to see the people on boardwalk to appreciate. It is beautiful, ugly, exciting, and adventurous all wrapped up. Heart goes out got the homeless. Also, be sure to eat a fresh fruit cup. It was beyond yummy.",PastorJeff
40,interesting,"We enjoyed our time here had a great lunch at one of the many restaurants.There are loads of shops to buy clothes and souvenirs and there are lots of talented street vendors selling all sorts of different things they have made.Its good people watching here as there are so many interesting, strange and wonderful characters here. We also went for a walk along the housing community canals this was also enjoyable",Alison f
40,Gotta check it out at least once!,"We walked here from Santa Monica, it's quite a lovely walk in the day but make sure you wear comfy shoes :)Hubby wanted to check out Muscle Beach at Venice, so we did that, if we go again we might even do a workout in there!There were many interesting people at Venice, street performers, artists and stores. It's definitely work checking out if you're in LA, but I would only go during the day.",8081louise
30,Beach is nice but that's about it,"Did not feel safe here at all. So many homeless people around, it was ridiculous. Beautiful beach but lots of alcoholics spoiling the area. Would not walk around after dark there",Donna M
10,"Horrible,horrible horrible","We live here in cali....so wesdecided to find new place to go to....venice beach is the most horrible place to go...sandy beaches are all great but not when majority of the whole park in front are homeless,drug addicts, I have never felt so insecure in my life, i had to watch my six.....so many homeless people everytime they walked behind me i had to hold on tight to my bag.....on top of that the environment not so great for children under 5 to be around well at least not mine......we ate burgers they were the worst burgers ever and the fries were even freshly made tasted as if they were frozen from a bag......we will never go back..... drive a mile up north and better visit santa monica pier and boardwalk alot more cleaner and less homeless people...much better for kids",marikruzm
50,Must visit!,I thoroughly enjoyed the 30 mins i spent here - would love to go back again for a longer time. This is a vibrant place with all kinds of entertainment. Lots of shopping too!,Rajesh K
20,Like walking the midway at the state fair,"My suggestion...if you are in LA for vacation and you only have a week, don't waste your time at the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Go to the Getty or spend another day at Disneyland. The Venice Beach Boardwalk was a happening place in the 70's and 80's, now it is just seedy and dirty. There are two types of people at the boardwalk - legitably crazy people who are scary, and the people that are acting weird just to get a handout from you or to get you to look at what they are selling. None of the shops have anything original - just the same old stuff you see at any tourist place. This is just a tired, has been tourist attraction. Not a place to take young children. It is a depressing place.",NMTraveler1
20,Passing through,"Amsterdam meets St Kilda. Run down, grubby, the jetsam and flotsam mingling with the muscled and the curious. I didn't fancy a tattoo, an oily slice of pizza or a cheap tatty T shirt.",Ladum
40,FUNKY with good people watching,"Walk along the boardwalk from Washington north. There is ample parking at the end of Washington or Venice Blvd. Stop to watch the body builders, the skateboarders, and the tourists from all over the world. Eat at the Sidewalk Cafe with views of the passing scene. Stop in Small World Books at the Cafe, one of the last independent bookstores.",MargieLA

20,What a dissapointment,"Bad food, Lots of homeless and unseedy characters walking around. Very few of the shops/stores had anything interesting. It was the same ole crap you see at all of the tourist traps. But, I can say I've been there. I won't be going back.",Hans B
30,1 time is enough,"I guess it's worth it to go once so you can say you have, but the beach is dirty & nothing new here to see. I guess the only fun thing is seeing the outdoor gym?I'd rather spend my time on a nice beach with great views all around.",Stacy
50,Awsome for wierdo watching,"Awesome for wierdo watching. so many people, many just watching, totally worth a trip. I lived in LA and this is where i took people who visited.",Abaconianst
50,Nothing Else Like It!,A stroll on the boardwalk is a very unique experience. Weekends get really crowded and parking is difficult even though there are numerous parking lots available. If you want to avoid the crowds go early or go on a Thursday or Friday when there are still people...just not as many. This is the place to come if you want local entertainment. Many of the street artists have been there for years. Some are there only on weekends but many of them are there every day. There are several eating places and benches along the way if you want to watch the crowd go by.Lots of souvenirs are available at less than what you would pay anywhere else. Go with the thought of not taking anything too seriously and you will have a great time. And it is free!!,beacherlosangeles
40,Definitely worth a visit,"First visit for my teen kids who were exposed to a bustling boardwalk on a hot beautiful sunny day. A place where anything happens and everything is happening. Walking, biking, rollerblading, sunbathing, surfing, basketball, handball, volleyball, famed Gold's gym, fishing on the pier, tourist shopping, restaurants and snack shops, 420 opportunities....you get the picture. Great spot to people watch and enjoy the west coast atmosphere all at once. However, it is recommended to be careful and aware after dark due to the number of less fortunate in the area. The pier is a great place to capture a view of the coastline and spot some marine life in the ocean. Definitely worth a visit.",Hakimom
40,Fun in the sun,"A potpourri of people, ranging from body builders to roller blades to all types of performers to tourists and a cornucopia of shops, ranging from nick nacks to artsy stuff to souvenirs, interspersed with various communities buildings and food/drink stands all crowded onto a long walkway along the beach that fronts the Pacific. Stroll, gaze, gawk, snack, enjoy.",Robert H
30,Anything Goes in VB,"Visiting Venice Beach Boardwalk once is enough for me! The people watching is unparalleled. Weekends are crowded and smelly. It is a tourist trap,that every adult should do at least once. The crowds and vendors can be overwhelming to your senses. We enjoyed sitting at the Venice Ale House, having a beer, and watching the people walk by us instead of the jostle of being in the fray.The Boardwalk is not a place for kids, especially small impressionable ones! The beach on the other hand is wide, very clean and suitable for the family.Parking is an issue in Venice. Try the city beach parking lots. Expect to pay upwards of $30 in a private lot! We found street parking, but had to walk a half mile.",jayhawkinva
50,Absolutely loved this place!!,"Venice Boardwalk has been my highlight of Los Angeles over the past week. There is so much going on. You can listen to music, watch street performers, check out the street art, or stroll over and watch people playing volleyball, basketball, handball, or working out at Muscle Beach. There's plenty of souvenir shops but also a lot of unique shops and barely any peddlers out front trying to sell things.This is THE place for people-watching and photography and you could sit here all day and no get hassled. Despite the amount of people, there's plenty of shade, and places to sit, or find some food/drink.",MikeStrachan
50,Visit to the Venice Beach Boardwalk,"I love all the activity here at the Venice Boardwalk, there is lots to see and do, buy and eat. We always came home exhausted and felt like we'd had a fabulous time.",SueTjelland
40,a nice long walk following the beach,"The boardwalk is several kilometers long. It goes from Venice Beach all the way to the end of Santa Monica beach. People walk, run, ride skateboards and watch other people on the beach. I have even walked on the boardwalk at 3 am, followed in the distance for a few minutes buy a police car.It is a very casual walk. The difficult is to find a parking space when you want to leave your car outside the parking lots.",sipivu
50,Great tourist place,"We had a couple of hours here and it is a lot of fun to watch people doing so many diverse things. You have the outdoor gym where Arnie was discovered,basketball courts, lots of food places to have lunch and the beach is beautiful. This is also a fantastic place for tourist stuff, Tshirts, gifts for purchase etc. Really wish we could have had longer to explore more.",petti120
30,People-watching heaven,"It's a beautiful place that attracts people from all walks of life: musicians, artists, performers, people with a weird crazy (or awesome?) sense of style, and everything else. If you're into people-watching, I'd highly recommend visiting: you won't find a stranger mix anywhere.",Dan L
40,Great way to spend an afternoon,"Spent the afternoon here on a Saturday with my husband. We enjoyed walking along the beach, pier and stopping by the shops. This place is very 420 friendly & there's an office to get your card at every corner, so if that bothers you that might be a turn off. We enjoyed watching the street performers & just hanging out in a layed back atmosphere.",ELIZABETH A
30,Cheesy but worth a visit,Had a walk along here one afternoon. Busy place with all kinds of people going about. Worth a look around to say you have been.Parking is shocking though.,Tracy-Scott83
50,Fun and entertaining,When we where here we walked from one end of the board walk to the other end lots of artists selling stuff lits of entertainment and people performing to love it here a place where one can be them selves,Tomas A
40,So many different characters,"I loved the walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier. The people watching is so much fun, so many different walks of life, as is all the different stalls and shops along the way. We took our 2 young kids with us and didn't feel concerned for our safety at all. It is a vast contrast to Santa Monica, but very entertaining and worth the stroll.",arnieTsv
30,Worth A Look Around,We visited today nice to park the rental right on the beach front.A good range of gifts shops for adults & kids at OK prices. I enjoyed seeing Muscle Beach and the old photographs of Arnie working out back in the day👍,SixtyOne
10,Absolute Filth!!!,"There is no way that I can possibly sugar-coat what this place is. It’s a crap hole of the highest proportions.We ventured out to VB to see muscle beach.The shop prices are super expensive for the rubbish that is on offer.The boardwalk is filthy and smells like homeless peoples urine. I witnessed two muggings, had an individual pickpocket my bag, and watched various police arrests.I was offered “weed” almost every 50 meters and witnessed people snorting what I can only perceive to be “crack” off of a car bonnet when returning back to our car only to have the Valet turn a blind eye.Not a place to take the kids",Snookota11
50,It's all fun and games until some one brings their kids,"This is a lot different from the regular board walks you visit. It's crazy and cool and if you aren't open minded, stay away, you will have a tough time. The board walk is considerable enough, and there are lot's of cool shops to check out. But the real pleasure is the crowd which shows up here. If you're lucky, you'll find all kinds of whack, which is vastly different from the highly sanitized boardwalks found every where else. Pleae do not bring children and be offended. There's a lot more places to enjoy with kids, this is almost adult only",Mohana K
40,Great place to visit,I was hesitant to go here because of the negative reviews i read at yelp but I don't have anything bad to say except their parking sucks. Anyway here are my inputs:1. The boardwalk is Sooo long I suggest you wear walking shoes.2. Some walk with their dogs- big and small so watch your kids3. There are medical marijuana stores (green stores) so you can sometimes smell the weed4. There are a lot of performers you can watch and they only ask for donations5.very few sit down restaurants - majority of them are on Washington Blvd6. Restrooms are on the beach and there is always a line.7. Get there early because there is so much to seeOverall. It's a good place to visit .,Jomama_Fosho
40,The freaky funky sights of Venice Beach,"You'll either love or hate strolling along Venice Beach. I personally loved it as it was a feast of people-watching, from the street performers to the fitness fanatics, the stall holders, the tourists from all over. I could spend hours down there. In fact next time I reckon I'd hire a Segway and wander from Santa Monica, down n back, if that's possible.",bubs69
30,The Venice beach mix,Venice beach boardwalk still attracts an eclectic mix of characters. You have bodybuilders to ageing hippies and many in between. Its also rather a tourist trap to me but the name Venice Beach still has a funky vibe to entice visitors.,PrestonGuild
50,Good fun,I'd say there is something for everyone here.... Get a bike easy enough to cycle... The music is pretty good and all kinds of stuff to see...,James
50,What You Think of When You Think of California,"Fun people watching place. Sidewalk preachers, Napping and wandering homeless people, Great performers - dancers, magician, muscleheads, gymnasts, skaters. Many artists with original art along the boardwalk at great prices. Typical boardwalk shops and snack shops. Several dispensaries. Smelled pot everywhere!",Angie M
50,An Eclectic view of L.A.,Eclectic says it best. You never know what you will see or hear here. There are many shops and some great boardwalk restaurants as well. A fun place we take all of our out-of-town guests to.,Hal R
30,Definitely Colorful and Not for Everyone,"We went in the evening when the sun was setting. Even my teens did not feel comfortable with all of the large groups of kids walking around and the blatant pot smoking. We wanted to walk down to the Santa Monica Pier but they did not want to walk back down the Venice Boardwalk at night, so we left. We did try to go to Santa Monica but even though it is less than 5-10 minutes away; it took us 30 minutes and we gave up. I hate LA traffic and I hate parking. I don't think LA is on our family vacation list any longer.",Elaine
50,California Pearl.,"You can't miss Venice Beach.What a fantastic place to be.I'm used to the vibe we have in the beaches in Israel.

50,Love it!,We strolled down the boardwalk early in the morning after just landing in L.A. it was clean and already busy with friendly locals. We stopped at one of the many cafes to face the boardwalk for breakfast and watched as the vendors set up and the boardwalk came to life. It is colourful and full of many interesting people and products.The painted walls and building that Venice beach is famous for are breathtakingly beautiful.You can't visit L.A. and not visit Venice Beach Boardwalk!,Livinthedreamlife
40,Eclectic mix of characters and culture,"Only a few kilometres down the road from the opulence of Santa Monica, the Venice Beach boardwalk encapsulates the essence of independence and alternative lifestyles that makes this area so intriguing. Some sights that I'll never forget were plenty of 'doctor's surgeries' selling 'medicinal marijuana'; muscle bound and shredded guys young and old working out on the public gym facilities on the beach; a plethora of friendly bums who have set up mini slums around the skate park; a store selling giant Transformer characters made out of metal and of course the iconic palm trees lining the boardwalk itself. I really enjoyed this area, there are myriad cafes and eateries, trinket and gift stores, incredibly interesting people and I never once felt my safety was compromised. It's a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the wealthy areas of Los Angeles, and for that reason I believe it's a must do to add balance to your trip.",Benjamin C
40,Home,"I'm a California native who grew up going to Venice Beach, regularly, so I knew what to expect. Not much has changed in the way of venders selling their wares, little shops offering touristy things, people (the strange, the beautiful, the ugly, and the entertaining). There were quite a few vendors/shops offering medicinal marijuana, which could be smelled every few years down the boardwalk. There was a huge circle of people participating in and bongo/conga jam fest on the beach, just off the Muscle Beach area. I visited on a Sunday, which used to be the most popular day, but it wasn't overly crowded, and parking wasn't bad. ( I spent $9 on parking in one of the beach's lot, but I'm sure there was parking on a city or residential street to be found. You would just have to do some trekking. I have great memories of VB, and will continue to visit, whenever I can.",Zahiry

Go on a Saturday of Sunday, when all of LA comes out to play.",PeckishAdventures
50,Wow Mysterious trip..,"Venice is one of the most alluring cities in the world—the type of place where, as a visitor, you'll welcome getting lost No matter where you go, you'll find history, beauty and romantic.You haven't seen anything if you haven't been to Venice Beach at least once.The Boardwalk is a virtual sidewalk circus, a walk 'n' rolling skin show. There are lots of funky shops, too, if you want to eat there are a lots of restaurants on the board walk to enjoy food and drinks. There are courts for basketball, handball, shuffleboard and paddle tennis.During the summer season and on weekends, there is street entertainment at every intersection along Ocean Front Walk. Street performers include instrumental musicians, singers, mimes, comics, magicians, prophets, fortune tellers, and other assorted entertainers. You will see people with tricolor hairdos, painted faces, weird tattoos, and outlandish clothing--or lack of it. Totally it is really amazing.. Evening visit will be the best.",SalwanazTouseefkhan
40,Good attraction,You have to come see the board walk at least once so you can say you have. The views of the beach and the ocean are amazing and there are a lot of restaurants on the board walk to enjoy food and drinks. There are also a variety of touristy shops and weed shops. We enjoyed coming here and would come back again.,Byron Dwyer

Rent a bike to enjoy the beach path, peruse the shops, stop for a drink at a patio bar, buy some local art, there's always an adventure to be had!",CreativeRed
50,"Wow, Huh? Also, Really?!?","I live on the other side of the pier from the Venice Beach boardwalk and generally avoid it like the plague, but if I have new visitors to the city it’s one of the first places I take them as it is so unlike anything else. You can’t help but gaze in wonder at the oddities that are regulars on Venice Beach, each of whom is trying to outdo the other with their level of wackiness. It’s a train wreck but you can’t look away. And the tourists themselves attempt to dress or undress the part, often unadvisedly and it the wrong size for their body types. Then there are the mesmerizing drum circles, the crazy talented kids at the skate park, the art, the music generated from nowhere, commercials being shot for distribution around the globe. It’s a love/hate relationship which must be experienced at least once.",Doug W
50,Wonderful!,I love Venice. The boardwalk is very touristy and a little bit sketchy but you just brush it off. Beach is beautiful. Rented bikes and drove from Venice to Santa Monica - highly recommended. I wish I could live in Venice!,elizabetha615

40,Weirdest Place on Earth,"After seeing much of LA and its many quirky, sometimes weird street vendors, I did not believe my cousin when he said "" Venice Beach tops them all"". He was right. Walked up and down the boardwalk many times looking at the various souvenir shops and art stalls. The amount of strange things for sale, coupled with the even stranger people made it a fun and eventful experience. Was not a fan of all the music on offer but was worth all the walking. Would love to go back in summer.",Jonathan Y
30,Very busy...,"Keep your kids close to you...lol! Reminded me of the French Quarter in New Orleans. Lots of characters to look at, entertainment and small souvenir shops. Nothing that I necessarily need to visit again.",jetsetter369

We had already been to venice on a sunday (the time to go to see all the weird and wonderfull sights), so we biked up and down in the week instead. its a great experience and you stop off on the way to watch the ppl on the orginal muscle beach and the new one (more well known), also the skate park is fantastic. its a great place to spend a couple of hours",Karluk29
50,A freaky Experience,"If you want to see ALL types from today's society, take a walk on this boardwalk. You can see people down on their luck, older people trapped in hippiedom, people with all kinds of tattoos and wardrobes, sober people, stoned people, entertainers with eclectic talents and just plain folks strolling along enjoying the weird ambience. All this with a backdrop of a wide, clean beach and surfers catching waves.",caml77
50,Very colourful!!,"We kept going back to the boardwalk because it was so ""weird"" ""eclectic"" all these are true! Very surprising to see the medical marijuana.... Tee shirts are a great bargain. Strange looking musicians, but very good music. A definite must! And very wheelchair accessible too!",pippa56
50,"Weird, full of life and definitely worth a visit","We spent a few days in the area, and while visiting Santa Monica we decided to hire bikes, and jump straight on the cycle path, and head towards Venice, to the beach, the boardwalk, and the canals.The bikes were dead easy to ride, and riding along with the vast beach and the pacific on our right hand side was a total pleasure. We inched ever closer to Venice, looking out for the characters we were expecting to see, and we weren’t disappointed. The first was was a 60ish year old woman, in cycling shorts and a vest top, plugged into her iPod, more dancing along then jogging!! She seemed happy enough. And who wouldn’t be on a Californian beach!We stayed on the cycle path until we were at the furthest point south of the Venice, as we decided to walk back up the boardwalk. One of the furthest points south we wanted to see were the Venice canals. An intricate little maze of waterways, with a 2 foot wide path for us to walk around. On one side was the water, the other, smallish but beautiful little houses, each with its own gate onto the canal, most having a small rowing boat of some kind tethered to the gate.When we had walked around here we headed back to the beach, for the walk up the Boardwalk. Then the character spotting started. The bodybuilders on surprisingly small muscle beach, the musician trying to hand you CDs of their work, the artists selling what has to be said, in most cases very good pieces.We continued. The “medical” shops offering marijuana, the endless tshirt shops, the local drunks shouting from the benches, the loin cloth wearing snake charmer, brandishing rubber snakes standing on a step ladder, the unfortunate homeless people looking for handouts, a single table with a kind soul handing out soups for these same homeless people, a group of 4 carrying signs shouting and preaching The Lord handing out cards……I am certain I have missed something, but you get the idea.It may have had a bad press, and admittedly we only visited in the daytime, but would highly recommend it. There is something to see everywhere, you look. A true experience, and one not to be missed, in my opinion.",RichardChubb
50,Very eclectic,"It's beautiful and wild looking. One side is loaded with vendors selling their wares from medical marijuana to tee shirts, there are people playing music and its all so relaxed at the same time. On the other side is the beach, the Pacific ocean and a beautiful mountain view. It's breathtaking. I love so many things about it. I'm told not to go there at night, which we were there in the day time. It's a very cool place for open minded people who don't have a stick up their butt. I liked it, because you feel so free. Lots of walking, so pack light, your liable to buy all kinds of things and of course, your not in Kansas anymore, so make sure you don't flash your valuables. But its just a fun day for a younger crowd. I'm older, but I still enjoy that feeling of youth its brings out.",Island_Girl_Films
40,Cold but still nice,We made a visit in jan and even though it was sunny it was windy and cold. We walked out on the pier and the beach is beautiful.,JKeeler
50,Beautiful Coastline,"We rented bikes in Venice and took the bike path down the coast toward the Santa Monica Pier. What a beautiful day! The pace was leisurely, the views were great, the weather was perfect for us, and we had a great time. Totally recommend it!",Kate
50,Great people watching,"This is a real eye opener......as you walk this board walk you will see everything!!!! Hugh homeless issue in this area, and it is all there for you to see! The skate board park is a must see.....those kids are amazing! The artists selling their wares are interesting....some talented and some NOT!",mexicanbound5
20,Sorry not my bag,I found this place a let down. From what I could tell on a quiet Monday morning it was full of pot heads selling things in order to buy weed. Really not my bag at all.,nickic310
50,love this place,"I have been here a couple of times and absolutely love the atmosphere, the locals are very friendly and only to happy to stop and have a chat. what was planned to be a 2 hour stop saw us there for the full day.",robbie1961
30,ecclectic,this is an understatement. Its a collection of weird and amazing people. We walked from Venice to Santa Monica and the view improved considerably as we walked. It was a fun experience.,Griswalds11
40,What a cool place,This walk is full of energy and interesting stuff to look at. Street shows cool shops interesting people feels safe through the day but haven't been at night so can't comment on that. Only stayed one day as was just passing through but will certainly have a longer visit next time.,paul b
50,Loved it,"The boardwalk is bustling and full of very interesting shops and things to look at. There were break-dancers putting on a lively and entertaining show right in the middle of the street, which I thoroughly enjoyed (probably more for the comedy than the dancing!) If the people/sights become overwhelming it is just a short walk to the actual beach, which was beautiful, serene and almost empty.",ShevaLew
40,As advertised,"Few places live up to what you see on TV, not the case here. The colorful people, performers and shops are just like everything Ive heard of. Entertaining and interesting, Venice Beach boardwalk is definately worth visiting if in the area.",Rusty D
30,Just to say I have seen it,"Venice Beach is worth a look, if nothing else to say you have been there. A place which shows the variety of the human experience.",Terri K
40,Never A Boring Day On The Boardwalk,"Take the time to walk the entire Venice Beach Boardwalk to Santa Monica Pier. There is never a dull moment. Take the time to watch some of the entertainers, the skateboarders or look in one of the shops. Only downside is the large number of homeless or smell of something green in the air. I would however not suggest to walk too late after dark.",GK_10_1972
40,Worth a visit.,"I was hesitant bringing my 17 year old daughter here based on some of the past reviews. She absoulutety loved it. We saw some street performers that were very good, one group even performs at Lakers half time shows!. Reminds me of the Jersey shore somewhat without the rides. If you ignore the pot shops it makes for a fun afternoon.",JDfromPA
30,It's fun,"I've read some of the reviews and realize a lot of people really take this too seriously lol...it's Venice Beach for crying out loud, how can you take it serious! It has weird characters, quirky vendors and patrons, animals, homeless people, etc. It's a great place to take in the scenery, people watch and crack jokes about it all. Not to mention the crappy carnival-like food we all love to eat. Reminds me of hippy version of Coney Island without the rides lol",BrooklynChef23
30,"Fun, but watch out at night","The boardwalk has lots of colourful shops and cafes - we had a great lunch at the Venice Ale House (ordered a coconut water which came in a real coconut, lovely surprise!)We stayed in Marina del Rey and walked through Venice to get to Santa Monica - it was a fairly long walk (around 4 miles) but we really enjoyed taking in the scenery on foot.However, after the sun set we didn't feel safe and witnessed quite a few fights and confrontations going on. Beware!",Jasmine B
30,Mixed feelings,"I was saying at a hotel close to venice beach. The boardwalk has some nice shops and eateries , along with many street vendors. It can has performers, tattoo artists, street artists vying for your attention and that can be fun.Although there are druggies and beggars too so need to a bit careful with your belonging. its a colorful place :).",Riddhisha
10,Watch out for Cali Shore Store!!,"My son purchased a sweatshirt at Cali Shore Store on Venice Boardwalk and the ""California"" was applied right over top the pockets. We told him to go exchange it and when he came back he was very upset because the guy told him to ""get out of his store"". My husband and I went there to try and straighten it out but were met with the same thing! We refused to leave until he fixed the faulty merchandise he sold my son So right in front of me told another guy ""go get the homies to deal with these people"".Sounded like a threat or intimidation tactic so we got the Venice Beach police. Although the police tried to help us, not much they could do. NEVER SHOP THERE! We are Canadian but pretty sure those shop owners were not American!",bbw2015
50,Loads of fun,"We visited Venice Beach Boardwalk as many times as we could while in LA (ended up visiting 3 times.) As a family with young children, we all thoroughly enjoyed meeting local people, playing basketball on the beach and my youngest loved the playground down there. I have heard and read mixed reviews but felt really safe here.",SnlBmb
30,Good people watching,"Another of those places where fame and reputation demands you see it, but really it's pretty average. There are some interesting people to watch there. And lots of rubbish you can buy if you like.",Ian_from_Canberra
40,Relax location,"I really enjoyed the boardwalk and the sites, the board way shopping was fun. You need a day and a bike or states to make it fun. The locals were interesting",SHARON R
30,Not Impressed,Pretty much a tourist trap and very gritty. As I walked the esplanade we witnessed several drug deals and passed multiple people and groups smoking drugs. Not very family friendly.Lots of touristy shops and nice looking cafes. Very mixed crowd from trendy looking café to homeless and also lots of skater teens smoking drugs.Would not hurry to visit here again.,dja_mr
30,Not much to do,"Paid $6 to park but nothing on the pier but men fishing. So I walked the beach which was awesome. First time dipping my feet in the Pacific ocean, cold compared to the Atlantic ocean. Nice walk.",sammied3000
40,Interesting Day Area with Its Cafes,"Venice Beach is an interesting ""city beach"" to go visit. The Pacific Ocean beckons, but what we usually find most interesting is the diversity of the people who visit. There are walkers, bikers, skaters, power builders, and those trying to deal with life in general, and more. The cafes are fun to go to for lunch and we have gone by ourselves and with a larger family group.Venice Beach is NOT the place to go if you want a relaxing family beach day with visions of hot dog roasts, etc. Its a place to go see how the ""city"" and the ""ocean"" meet each other with its ""good"" and its ""bad"" points.",mini
10,Dump tourist trap! Avoid this place and spend your time and $ somewhere else.,Los Angeles still tries to promote Venice but the place is an embarrassment. They try to pull off the Portland Weird vibe along with mini San Francisco but the place is a dump and most locals no to stay away. I dare you to hang out in Venice after dark. Hopefully enough tourist will avoid this place and LA will catch on to clean it up. You will be asked for $ constantly by the aggressive homeless. Street performers will aggressively try to get $ out of anyone who stops to watch. The beaches in Los Angeles are depressing...they really are. If you want a better beach experience that involves the pure spirit of surfing and peace try Huntington Beach in Orange County. Bolsa Chica State Beach is attached with excellent bird watching. Or go to Balboa Island Boardwalk/Newport Beach...beautiful peaceful vibe.Places I recommend going over Venice in LA.La Brea Tar Pits-Page MuseumEvent at Staples Center-LA LIveSpend more time at the GettyGriffith Observatoryor an extra 3 hours at your hotel pool:),Lumerian
40,Awesome Boardwalk,"So much to do - I would recommend a good 2 hours in the area taking in all the sites and activities.TIP: If you don't want to pay the high price for parking, park in Dock 52 (free) in Marina Del Rey, walk down to Fisherman's Village and rent a pedal cycle ($7 hr) and ride over to Venice Beach Santa Monica Pier. Easiest way to get around and fun.",Nattysimps
20,Wow! The Tiajuana of California beaches!!,"And with that title I would have to give the nod to TJ.Went on a Saturday afternoon and walk the length of the boardwalk freak show. My wife and I's consensus was ""don't want our kids around here!"" And our kids are 21-29. From the homeless, to the pot smokers and ""carny"" types this place literally stinks.The weather was great, so I can't imagine coming here in the summer when it's hot and more people are there.....the smell would really be awesome.California has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and this area is a 'scab' on that beauty. We thought we would see some interesting artist and vendors but it was more along the lines of the worst carnival carnies and bums you can imagine! I counted 4 Pot prescription booths, head shops(which I thought where illegal?). There where no real artist there.......just some whit guy trying to rap and another group trying to get old whit guys to walk like pimps.Kind of felt dirty when we left.I guess it takes all kinds and if you want to see a bunch of dregs and freaks then this is the place for you.I would not recommend going and keep your kids away!Just a short drive up the coast to Santa Monica Pier or south to Manhattan beach is where you can enjoy California beaches not ruined by this blight.",Muykido
50,Don't be there as the suns starts to set but be there before that.,"I've been here a few time but wanted to take my wife and little boy to see the famous boardwalk. We took the bus from our Airport hotel and the bus ride was inexpensive and interesting. We arrived a bit late in the afternoon and settled in for a great meal at one of the any cafe's and then walked along the boardwalk passing the man on the Blades, a guy laying on broke glass, young me playing 4 on 4 basketball and of course Muscle Beach where a few muscled up boys were trying to charge for a photo. I told them to get out of my shot as they were spoiling the equipment.It still has pzazz but getting on dark it begins to take on that sinister side. It is an area known for drugs and that is their time. Easy. Get the early, enjoy the atmosphere and get going.",philandcathy
20,Checked off bucket list & wouldn't go back,"Prior to our California trip, we watched shows, read books, and listened to advice of the places we absolutely shouldn't miss seeing. So on day 1, we headed to the Venice Beach Boardwalk. WOW. Eye opening is an understatement.We had a bad/scary adventure with parking but that's probably our fault for not researching ahead of time and obviously having a big tourist stamp on our heads! Luckily our rental car wasn't destroyed and none of our belongings were stolen. Just beware of leaving your keys with someone who will park/squeeze your car into a little lot. I'm still amazed that none of the homeless people have figured out that the guys who park the cars leave the driver's windows down and the keys over the visor. That's really safe! Yikes!The boardwalk is filled with souvenir shops, restaurants, artists, and street performers. It is a very busy atmosphere with all different types of people.Warning: the locals set up stands and sell homemade crafts but they do NOT want you to take pictures. They will become confrontational if you do and they have signs saying how much they charge to take pictures. So be careful!Another warning: I knew the boardwalk would be filled with street performers and I knew they'd probably have buckets for tips. But what I didn't know is this....if you stand there and watch a performance, they will throw out a specific dollar amount that you owe when the show is finished ($20 PER PERSON). One show we watched even went as far as to say that having no cash isn't an excuse cause you can use your credit card and get cash out of the ATM right behind them. Also, there wasn't a tip bucket. Instead, they literally walked from one person to the next collection money. Not a good or safe atmosphere!There was a freak show on the boardwalk that you could go into for an admission fee. No joke. They had midgets and a bearded lady sitting outside trying to attract tourists to pay to come inside. We didn't take the bait.We looked at several of the little boardwalk food places and even the biggest restaurants, but none really grabbed our attention (at least not both of us were craving the same type of food).Overall, we spent several hours here walking the boardwalk and while I'm glad we can mark it off the bucket list, it will NOT be on the list of places I'd like to ever visit again.",TNHarleyChick
30,It's getting better..but the star attractions are behind Venice Boardwalk,"The hawkers (well most) have finally gone - unfortunately they're harassing people at the Chinese Theatre. The boardwalk has the same old stuff, cheap touristy bric a brac, so so restaurants and interesting entertainment along the beach. The best thing to do on Venice Boardwalk is to hire bikes and ride from Venice to Santa Monica Beach (and/or beyond to Rogers Hill). Don't hire a bike in Santa Monica, Venice Beach is cheaper.If you walk two or three blocks up from Venice Beach you're in the MUCH BETTER part of Venice. Rose Avenue and Main St have some awesome cafes and restaurants with exceptional food and wine. Venice Beach Wines is a great place to go to rather than choosing a place to chill out on Venice Beach.",Joy R
30,Getting dirty,"I come to Venice since 40 years and it was never so dirty and full with apparently happy homeless people. They might have found the plant to make all horror disappear, otherwise it is incomprehensive why they stay in droves. If you want to see the sea go to Santa Monica instead.",Thomas K
40,Full of character,This place no doubt has been the background of a whole lot of movies and yes walking through here gives you the vibe. The place has lot to offer and there is so much to see and experience from the street arts to the shops and various activities going around it definitely has something to look forward too.,Angels_weeping
30,Interesting but depressing,I would certainly not want to take children here. It felt very dirty no maybe where you are on the broadwalk. I was depressed when leaving just to know so many people are in dire straights even if it is by choice or illness. Knew things were a little different when there were police ever few steps along the broadwalk.,Dora D
50,The set of so many cool movies,"Ok so it's a bit old gat to visit and Sheryl crow sang about it but it's still a cool place . Take in the sun , sea and beautiful people . Chicken in a basket served on a red and white napkin . Drink a cool beer and lay back . But watch out for skaters and skateboarders !",Mr B
50,The weird and wacky,"What a great walk from Santa Monica pier down to Venice,great selection of shops and restaurants,soooo many weird and wonderful people,it's a must do when in L.A.Loved the street entertainment and the pop up stalls selling lots of different souvenirs.Put it on your list of must dos.",den-rick71
50,"Must-do, great people watching","I had so much fun walking the boardwalk! Lots of things going on; plenty of vendors and places to eat. There is something for everyone here, not to mention a gorgeous beach! The freak show is worth the money - so much fun!",Lediamedia
10,Still a hippie boardwalk,"Doesn't look like much gas changes over the past 40-50 years. Still looks like something from the 1960-70's. I would not want to go there after dark - scary enough during the day. I would NOT recommend, unless you like that sort of life. Definitely better beach boardwalks.",shmay10263
50,Always an interesting place to visit.,"We had a great day at Venice Beach. The beach was nice, not super crowded as it was October. And walking the boardwalk was interesting as usual. Some people don't prefer to take kids there. But it is real life there and a great place to have conversations with your kids about a lot of things they don't see everyday. We had a great lunch there and found some fun items that you don't see in the mall, things made in Mexico and Costa Rica. Kids loved it and I was happy to take them there.",Lanamamaomaha
50,Must see.,"Someone wrote on a review that this place is a tourist trap, and let me tell you that it is not. I had tons of fun here. You can find anything there, plus, the beach is clean and beautiful. You can take great pics in the area.",LuvToTravel095
40,"the sights, the sounds and the smells---","10.30.2014 -- seedy, shabby but fascinating if you can stomach the smell of marijuana whafting out of the numerous Marijuana clinics.But the most major troubling social aspect is the sheer number of homeless people about, amongst their possessions -- some even with multiple pet dogs in tow. Many of the street artists seemed to be living in squalor too on the streets. So sad and so humbling to see.But bless ""Food for Life Global"" for providing meals for the homeless. They were dishing out vegetarian food from half- a-dozen 5 gallon buckets. It looked like wholesome, hearty squashes, beans, rice and vegetables. I talked to Punya of DrumDancePray.org to learn more about what they were doing. Apparently, they feed people worldwide. If so, please support his organization.",3Kells
30,Lots of Homeless People,"It was a beautiful beach, lots of rentals, great restaurants, very congested and lots of homeless people though. Although they do not bother much, there are a significant amoutn all over the place from on the beach, all along the boardwalk, in the gazebos, etc. It's very sad even though it almost seems as if they enjoy it as vain as that may sound.",fernwehcmb
30,Not a good place for Kids,"Lots of little stores but nothing special. Homeless laying everywhere, you could smell the marijuana. Just a dirty place and very disappointing.",Sharon4554
50,A must see / visit when in LA,"The overall vibe there is very artistic and bohemian, and it is a must see in my books... Don't arrive to early as the sea mist hangs around until gone 09:30 - 10:00...Yes it can seem a little bit seedy... Yes there is probably more scenic places to visit, but this is Venice beach boardwalk for gods sake, it's iconic status is well worth a visit.It's got everything from from 7 year old kids on skate boards pulling off world class stunts - street dancers from Compton, muscle beach (the home of Arnold Schwarzenegger's body building career) along with street artists, painters and some great little shops...We will most definitely be visiting again next time we are in LA. Give it a go its free.",Thebates22
50,What You See is What You Get,"The boardwalk has a life of its own; and I like it. Amidst palm trees, sun, sand, and surf, it is what it is. On one side of the boardwalk, there are ARTISTS, MUSICIANS and ENTERTAINERS of every ilk, all trying to EARN a buck. On the opposite side of the boardwalk, there are mainly tourist stores, shops, and fast food eateries all trying to EARN a buck. Although I am not a tourist, I like to visit there, mainly to walk. I enjoy the merriment of the music and the festive atmosphere. The excitement of all of the fun and, often quirky, activities all around me just seems to make my exercise so much easier; and yes, ""what you see is what you get.""",Ms T B
40,Interesting place for people watching,"Yes, the area is a bit shady but it was interesting to walk down and see all the buzz and crazy people. We went during sunset and there were less people. Shops were nearly closing around 6. Although we did feel like this was bit of a shady area. So watch your bags.",angieng
50,Venice Beach Boardwalk Is An Experience,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk is a must-see attraction.You will either love it or hate it, but will never forget it and you will be glad you had the experience of it.You will see people from all walks of life, literally.The shops offer the usual food and souvenirs you find in L.A.However, be prepared for street performers who want tips, people selling various items, the smell of pot in the air and a few crazy looking people.Also, there are a lot of homeless people around.The place can be loud, but hey, it's Venice Beach.It is where the Doors were founded.Where Jim Morrison wrote poetry and many lyrics.Picture the Doors and you have a picture of Venice Beach and the boardwalk.Not really for kids because of the language you will hear and the pot.I recommend the Venice Beach Boardwalk because you won't find the likes of it anywhere else.It is crazy, wild, weird and has a beat all its own.Come see it for yourself.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
50,Iconic spot for sun & fun,"This is one of the spots everyone has to spot by. Loaded of tourists specially on weekends and too many bargain stores, it's one of the iconic places along LA beaches.Bring you swimsuit and make sure you walk along the sidewalk. Stop by the stores to buy some magnets, and cool t-shirts.You should take a day to be there and a camera to enjoy the greatest graffiti on the walls.",Jaqueline S
30,Very dirty not someplace I would visit again,I was excited to visit Venice Beach boardwalk but once I got there I couldn't wait to leave. It's so filthy.Yup there us the skateboard park and muscle beach but who cares? It's not that exciting Absolutely not returning here,Jill H
40,Just had to stop!,We are so glad we stopped to see the infamous boardwalk. We stopped to watch the rollerbladers for a while and then we had to out our toes in the water. So cold!,Karen P
30,Interesting,"Interesting to visit quickly and leave. We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach along the boardwalk. What a difference between the two. Venice Beach is dirty, and seems to have a massive gathering of people living along the beach and path ways.",Net M
40,A Long hot walk,"This is another must see spot however be prepaired to be hassled by everyone wanting Money the entire time you are here.We did this walk on a 100 degree day, did wonders for the tanGreat shopping and food along the way.",suier1
30,Good People Watching,"You can probably entertain yourself by watching the crazy people on the boardwalk, but that generally seemed the extent of it. Perhaps its more laidback on weekdays. I didn't see a single store or restaurant that seemed to transcend low-class kitsch, but there are several medical marijuana outposts. There can be some decent entertainment between the skate park, basketball courts and muscle beach, although when I was there, muscle beach was deserted and the basketball game was surprisingly poor. Either way, you're on the beach, so it's hard to complain too much.",Jeff B
50,Hipster Beach Must do! Bring Cash! Expect Parking Difficulty,"We went on a Sunday and it was great. Had a monster of a time finding parking (1 hour meters are a dollar and never available, only other option are expensive ($15+) lots.Walk the strip, interact with the vendors. Bring cash and lots of small bills! Most businesses are cash only. Lots of different shops, and the strip goes on for a long time. You will find ""Scary"" looking people with tattoos and piercings, some perhaps smoking the ""Marijuana"". But guess what! They are all nice and very pleasant! (Perhaps not a place for people with ""Damned Street Youth"" as part of their common vocabulary)If you have to pay for full day parking, I'd suggest doing some window shopping, eating a meal (or two!) and spending a couple hours on the beach! The beach was rather empty compared to the board walk.",Aleksander Trzebski
50,Spend time with the locals,"Upon returning to Ca. I have returned to a few beaches. Non can compare with Venice!My first stop was the boardwalk, such a vibrant place! Vendors love to talk, some of the tourist enjoy a chat. You can find lots of fun/funky stuff, they even have a great bookstore tucked behind a fun family eatery!!I caught a bus, dropped me at the beach. They run every 15 minutes.After completing my walk among the artists I went down to the pier and talked the the fisherman.Then down to the water. The beach is very clean, lovely for a quiet stroll.I found a local Starbuck's, I had a gift card, everyone there was friendly and fast.If you need a snack or meal you can find every kind of food, the best are the simple places that have been there forever.Your pet is welcome, on a leash!!!I went by my self, never felt alone. Great fun!!!",Berta Ann F
20,Tourist trap and homeless haven,"There's a number of shops along the area, which all cater to the tourist. Once you've been in one shop, you've pretty much been in them all. Few places for food along the area, and most of them looked questionable. The area was filled with homeless people panhandling, some rude street vendors who would stand in your way, and gang members strolling around the area. I was in a group in the middle of the day, so I felt safe, but I wouldn't come back here after dark and/or alone. There was nothing really special about it, and not worth the hype it was given.",Dave M
20,"Done it, wouldn't go back","Venice beach it one of those place you need to go, just to say you have done it. Now Ive done it, I dont have any urge to rush back. I was quite disappointed by the selection of shops and food and was expecting something far more upmarket than what was available. It really does seem full of tat stalls, with lots of homeless people sleeping along the sidewalk.If you move toward the beach away from the boardwalk, it's much prettier but if you want a safe and less touristy area to walk along, I would head to Santa Monica beachfront instead",Travellover6128
30,Worth the sites but not with kids!,"The sites and sounds of the boardwalk are hilarious but I would ever bring my kids. Marijuana dispensaries, Jamaican music videos being filmed etc etc. Heck, I went to see the bodybuilders work out and all I saw was a guy working out in his underwear. And I don't mean boxers, I mean Michael Jordan endorsed tight whites. Also, due to the amount of people the actual beach area was horrendous. I actually found a used condom twenty yards in from the shore.",shawn w
40,Not what I expected,"Very much a case of been there and done that. To be honest it was a bit of a let down. Cheep clothes shops, down and outs and small fenced of gym that is not what you expect to be Muscle Beach. Best said is been there done that won't be back!",Lorraine M
30,"Been there, done that!","We were on our first vacation from South Africa, to the States, and Venice Beach/Boardwalk was one the the sights that we had on our list of places to ""Must"" visit. Especially since we see it in american music videos and movies.We were staying in Hollywood and had to take two buses to reach Venice Beach. On the second bus, we felt very uneasy and unsafe, and being from South Africa, that is saying much, but it turns out that there is a lot of weird people in this area.Venice Boardwalk for us did't live up to the expectation. It was average at best, looked untidy and dirty at places. The vibe and atmosphere, though was good. It very quickly became packed and it felt as if we were walking in the streets of New York.While it did not live up to our expectations, it is really a must visit, to tick off the bucket list, even if it is purely to see so many weirdo's in one place.The beaches on the other hand were stunning. We took the liberty to dip our feet and it felt good.We were impressed with the variety of food that could be bought from the food stalls. Our favourite was Jody Maroni's. Even had a Corn Dog for the first time. Not so great but worth the experience.",Ravesh
20,A let down,"After so many years of hearing about this area my wife and I wanted to make it a stop on our California trip. Well....we can say we saw it. We didn't feel unsafe but with the smell of weed in the air, many street craft/art venders who appear to live on the beach and the occasional strong smell of urine......lets just say the area has seen better days. You will see lots of strange charactors if you like to people watch but not our scene!",David C
40,Quirky,"If you're a people watcher like me, then Venice Beach Boardwalk is the mecca that you must travel to. This free-spirited area is a mosh pit of interesting characters and unique wares. Of course you can find the requisite beach trinket shops, but mixed in you will find local artist creations, breezy handmade dresses and weird metal sculptures of The Predator and Minions.At one end you have Muscle Beach, where jacked dudes perform unimaginable feats of strength on the outdoor gym equipment. There is also a sand pit with obstacle race style challenges like rope climbing and monkey bars. Walk along the boardwalk for a bit towards Santa Monica and you will soon be greeted by Venice's colorful urban camper population.This is definitely one beach that I will return to time and time again, not only for the clean beach, but also the vivid portrait of real life in Southern California.",412ginad
30,Prefer Santa Monica,We rented bikes and went on the bike path To Venice ! Went past Muscle beach and on to the pier ! Soooo many homeless people sleeping in groups on the Grass and on the beach ! Feeling sad in My heart ! We just went out on the pier and rode our bikes back to SM,nillenille .
50,We loved our day here!,"We loved walking around Venice Beach and checking out the Freakshow, not the actual Venice Beach Freakshow (which we also enjoyed) but the ENTIRE Venice Beach Freakshow. The people watching was fantastic. Going in and out of the stores was a good time and the street performers were fun to watch. We rented bikes and rode up to the Santa Monica Pier, also a very good time. We were able to make it there and back in an hour, just sort of cruising along, not rushing at all. May not be the best place to bring small children but teenagers will love it.",Matthew A
40,great place for people watching,"Being winter, it was quiet but it is a great beach - no surf. Just blue sea and miles and miles of white sand. Some very strange people about and that adds to the atmosphere!",australia4169
30,"Nothing spectacular, one of a kind experience","We drove there before lunch and the traffic from LA to this destination is very very bad. We wasted a lot of time on the road. When we arrived, another problem, there's no parking space available. I didn't see anything really good, expecting, maybe better than what we have in Sydney Beaches. Just white sand, and nothing else.we decided to just walk a little bit in the boardwalk, and what i saw, majority are the weird people.It's not really my cup of tea. . But at least, i can add up to my bucket list, that i've been to ""Venice Beach in California.",maganda0411
50,Road trip,I had a blast seeing the freaks had some good food watched some great entertainment burned are feet on the sand all in all a great experience,Damien G
40,Nice freak show,We had a great time in Venice. This was our first visit to L.A. and we absolutly loved venice beach. It was fun to watch the weird people on the boardwalk. What a freak show! we'll come again. (from Europe),Kevin G
10,The worst place I've ever been too!,"Venice Beach - what can I say. The Boardwalk is home to the lost & the bewildered. The air is sweet with the smell of Weed which is freely available to all at a small price. 10 mins after I arrive myself & my daughters had the pleasure of seeing the seedy side of the USA. Men & Women walking around in a total stupor high as kites, while others offered us Weed as if it were a 'Diet Coke'. There is nothing to see here. Seedy gift shops, tattoo parlours & just pure ugly. Maybe this is some1s kinda dream place but if you want class, nice restaurants & beautiful people travel a mile or two down the coast to Santa Monica. Venice Beach is a hell hole. Not even it's beach redeems it.",SteppingOutWithMaggie
50,Perfect afternoon,"Was visiting for 4 days, and each day was full of a variety of activities. On this day, my adult daughter and I went to the beach. We spent a couple hours just soaking up the sun before we walked the boardwalk. There was a live band, a bikini contest, a muscle contest, skateboarders plus all kinds of interesting characters along the boardwalk. It was ideal weather and so much great people watching after sand and sun. Perfect.",Randerson2014
50,Quintessential SoCal Beach,"No trip to Southern California is complete for us without a visit to Venice Beach. We never buy anything, but just the walk from one end to the other is enough to mellow us out and put us on an even keel. No worries, mahn! People watching of course is the biggest attraction for us; you never know the interesting characters you'll meet and get to talk to. Make sure if you take pictures someone isn't demanding a donation first, unless you don't mind paying for pictures. Venice Beach captures for us the microcosm of the SoCal beach community.",aeroeng22
40,Cool,It was cool to see but I was surprised how dirty it was. I guess I just always thought it was going to be a little nicer. But we still had a good time walking around.,Joe C
50,"Buzzing vibe, loved it!","We walked from Santa Monica beach to Venice Beach and Boardwalk - was fantastic. The boardwalk is lined with market like stalls and fun souvenir stores. Some cute restaurants along the boardwalk as well and of course the beach and part of the famous Muscle Beach. I think Venice Beach is a must see when staying in LA, such a great atmosphere and definitely worth dedicating a day to!",Melissa M
40,Worth looking,"We went here our first day in LA. You had to pay $15 to park at the beach. We just bit the bullet rather than try to find street parking because it was busy. It was an interesting experience. they do have a bike path on the beach itself; if you are walking people get upset with you taking up that space. The boardwalk itself has a lot of interesting people selling various items; some of them get pushy but you just keep walking and you're fine. I enjoyed talking to people to find out where they were from originally as most travelled to California from some other place in the country. We saw Muscle Beach as well. They have marijuana stores where 'doctors' can prescribe you some. I did see a guy on the beach trying to sell it, which I thought was brazen. But then one of the locals said the police really didn't care as long as you're not disturbing anyone. Wow!",Amber K
10,Not for Families,"After spending a few hours at Santa Monica Beach, my daughter wanted to check out Venice Beach which was about 4 miles south of Santa Monica. So, we drove down and parked at one of the lots a block from the beach and walked in.I have to say that Venice Beach is the exact opposite of Santa Monica Beach. Venice has a rougher crowd of people, with strange looking people wandering around, shops promoting cannabis, and a lot of swearing in general. Definitely not a place you should take your family.There's a big fascination for Muscle Beach where big body builders lift weights outside so passbyers can gawk at them, and a skateboard park for 20 year olds to impress the crowds with their skills. In my opinion, these people are just showing off and like the attention, especially the weight lifters. Nothing that I'm interested in.So if you've got a family and don't want to hear the swearing or see obscene merchandise, avoid Venice Beach and head up to Santa Monica Beach instead.",cohoman
50,Looking for cheap sunglasses? Take a walk on the Venice Beach Boardwalk,I have always wanted to take my boys to Venice Beach. Finally had the time and they LOVED IT! they couldn't believe that there were so many sunglasses and t-shirts in one place.,Patricia M
30,The Weird and the Wonderful,"We had parked the car in Venice Beach and walked to Santa Monica along the beach, so we walked back along the Venice Beach Boardwalk. How do you sum up Venice Beach? I guess my heading says it all. There are pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders, rollerskaters, beautiful people, bizarre people, and so-called musicians flogging dodgy CDs. There are places to eat, drink and build up your muscles. Yes, it's a bit of a freakshow but it's interesting, I suppose. It wasn't as good as expected, but it depends what you're looking for. I was looking for my car.",Malcolm H
50,Loved the fresh air,Great place to visit the boardwalk is amusing and fun loved it great to sit and watch people loved the outdoors,Lairoo
40,Great time on boardwalk.,Just came back from Venice Beach and it was a very enjoyable time with family and friend. We saw several street performers. Then had lunch at Big Daddy's Pizza. We used the public transportation to get us back to Santa Monica.,fool4travelin
40,Quintessential LA beach experience,"A stroll along the VB Boardwalk will definitely bring you into contact with a wide variety of humanity from the muscle beach types to the skateboarders to the rasta and hipsters to the homeless who live along the boardwalk. Likely to see the iconic rasta dude on roller skates with an electric guitar and pig amp on his belt. It certainly has a seedy feeling (the smell of marijuana smoke is almost constant) but I visited with my family and we never felt unsafe nor were we accosted by panhandlers. It's great to stroll and see the various artists and street performers. Stop by the skateboarding park to see some awesome skate boarding stunts and the outdoor gym to see the bodybuilders pumping iron.There are lots of little food shops selling 'boardwalk food' such as pizzz by the slice, pretzels, kettle corn, etc. A few sit down restaurants as well. Better to see in the afternoon than the evening. There are public restrooms all along the walk. Be careful of the parking hawkers who look official and will guide you to overpriced parking lots (learned from experience). There is public parking right on the beach for $5-10.",steveprez
40,love the scenery,"Coming from the Midwest, any day at the beach is amazing. However, the walk down the boardwalk was our favorite here. A must see!",Teresa S
10,Not for me!,"First I have to say that I have a very open mind, and I firmly believe that there is nothing wrong with seeing any place at least once. I stand by that with the VB Boardwalk.However, this place is just not for me. Although I appreciate the uniqueness and diversity, the entire experience just left me feeling sad. Within 5 minutes, my husband and I stopped for a quick hot dog at one of the boardwalk stands. I noticed a little boy crying nearby - probably about 4 years old. Luckily, a LA fireman on a bike was at the same hot dog stand. We went to get him to help the little boy. Turns out, this little boy was lost. The fireman put the boy on his shoulders to see if he could find his dad. We watched this for about 15 minutes, to no avail, the boy didn't find who he was looking for and was still crying. We walked around for about an hour. On our way out, on the south side of the boardwalk area, the same boy was now with 2 female officers, who were trying to keep him happy. He had a balloon sword he was playing with at this time. Still, no parent anywhere around, and an hour had gone by. I felt so, so, so sorry for him. I wish I knew the resolution of his situation.Also, I was also deeply saddened by the sight of grown adults bringing their young kids to wait with them into the ""medical"" places.I am aware that these situations can happen anywhere, but having too much of this in such a short amount of time, all in the same place, gave me the feeling that I needed to get out of there, quick.The only thing I enjoyed about Venice at all was the neighborhood with the canals (separate review). And that, I loved.I know a lot of people will think VB is really cool, it just isn't for me. I would never bring my kids there either.",BaseballFan5
50,Great place to people watch and spend the day!,"I personally think that Venice Beach is ONE of THE best places to visit in L.A! It has such a strange mix of locals and tourists from all over the world that it is really one of the funnest places to people Watch.... From the big muscle men pumping up at Muscle Beach gym to the various people selling their wares and products on the boardwalk....Years ago, one of those strange street performers included me in his act by putting me up on his shoulders and carrying while he walked across a pile of broken glass strewed along the pavement!!! Out of this world!!! You will see ALL types and all walks of life out on the boardwalk.Stop for a henna tattoo (but not the black ink, it isn't good for you), grab a bite to eat, have an ice cream, buy some cheap sunglasses, or have your picture taken with an alien. You'll find it all there.... And it's safe! Biking riding, rollerblading, skake boarding, jogging... can all be done on the bike path that goes farrrrrr up the coast.If you want something a little more tame, try Main Street, just a few blocks up from the beach and you can have lunch, browse the shops and boutiques or even rent a bike for the day.Have fun!",Leesa G
30,Average,"We stopped by at Venice Beach Boardwalk on our LA City tour. We spent about 30 minutes there and it wasn't that good as advertised. Different weird people walking around not good tasting food but nice view of the beach. Make sure don't stop to give money for people who are trying to sell their CDs. Otherwise, others will surround you to make you give contributions for their CDs too.",raifusal
30,Just to say you've been.,"It's all that's been said. It's great for people watching, the shops sell tatt. Every other shop is a tattooist. Didn't feel threatened but it was during the day. I'm open minded so nothing to shock me seen more and worse at festivals, bike shows and in Amsterdam. Still had a great day a reasonable lunch and chatted to some loonies. So I'd say if in LA tick it off you list of places to visit.",Gary S
40,The Hordes of Humanity,"From one end to the other, the Venice Beach Boardwalk offers up quite a show. It's a fun place for people gazing, rollerblading, unhealthy snacking, muscle gawking, street performing and just plain strolling. You will probably have to work real hard to stand out in this crowd - if that's what you want to do.",Mindy H

30,Wierdsville USA,"Take a walk from Santa Monica and enjoy the broad walk .. after a couple of miles you end up in Venice beach .. Official Home of Skateboarding and Golds Gym and the wacky people who inhabit the beach area ... its fruity and controversial , weed and tobacco scent the air it was different but i preferred the less fruity Santa Monica Beach .. its a matter of taste I guess..",Didgery1
30,"Pretty gross really, but if you have time...","We came here after visiting Santa Monica Pier - jeez, what a difference! At first, when you're walking up from the main street it seems pretty cool and lively, lots of people and lots happening. But then you realise it is just quite dodgy. Heaps of homeless, sketchy-looking people, obvious drug use. It's nothing special, but at least we can say we've been there. Not really a place to spend too much time. The open air gym is pretty funny to watch all the muscly guys showing off! Avoid the public toilets at ALL costs, they are absolutely foul.",KelsterSA
50,Love it! Not for everyone.,"This is a place for open minded happy people.If you are uptight or a snob and think you are better than everyone else you will not like it here.Personally I love this place.I enjoy seeing people of all colors,religions,beliefs and personal choices enjoying each others company.I stop to talk to All kinds of people.Opens up your mind.Try it.Might do some good things for you.",Sonny B
40,My husbands never been,"Venice beach is popular because of the movies & TV commercials they film there. I love La so nothing ever disappoints my husband on the other hand is more of Northern California man he wasn't really impressed by the whole Venice beach hoopla he wanted to see the basketball courts ok no big deal, we went to the outdoor gym nobody really working out & now that it's all cemented in it really didn't look interesting. The one thing we did want to see was the freak show when we passed by it looked all boarded up ugh hello are they just there when they are filming? Which is sad. If I didn't go back to Venice beach it wouldn't be that bad.",Esther C
50,Great Experience,"We were there on June 27th, 2014 early afternoon. We read some of the reviews but we were not concerned at all about our safety. We loved the eclectic mix along the boardwalk and actually stopped for a cold one and a small meal on the boardwalk. We walked across the smoking hot sand and dipped our feet in the cool ocean. Lots of people were set up on beach with umbrellas and children enjoying the ocean. Maybe I am naive but I didn't notice anyone selling drugs.",RMFOX222
40,A visual spectacular,"Anyone who has been to an open air concert, Brighton or Glastonbury in the uk will be aware of the eclectic mix of 'entertainment' on the boardwalk. For those who haven't yet then it's easiest for me to sum it up as (in a South Park Mr Mackey voice). Mmmmm drugs are good mmkay. Almost every shop is selling some thing to do with weed, even if it's just a t shirt about drugs. Kinda sad really. There's other entertainment in the form do street performers some of which are really good and some are truly awful. There's muscle beach too if that's your thing or you can just enjoy a long walk by the beach.",EmAitchKay
20,Not great,"We stopped on the way back to our hotel in Santa Monica. There were people from all walks of life, to say the least. Lots of souvenir shops. Didn't feel safe. Maybe it's better during the day. The beach itself looks nice though.",Caro1008
30,Exactly like on TV but not my thing,"There are lots of little shops selling shirts, bags and other odds and ends, there are people skateboarding, theres the famous gym.. Exactly like i have seen on TV but there are also lots of potheads trying to sell you art, mixtapes and medicinal marijuana.As someone from Australia, the beach was disappointing. My husband who is American also agreed (Just so you not I am not biased).Its worth a trip to say you have been, but now that i have seen it, i probably wouldn't go again.",Ma R
50,Too hot to walk without an umbrella,"Wah, what blazing heat were we exposed to as we completed the stretch of walk ,with only a cap.atop the head. We came across artists, hustlers, freaks, exhibitionists and Mr. Muscles.Many people were also seen jogging, cycling or walking their dogs.",GAN L
40,Ok to visit for 10 minutes. That's it!,"Yes- it's a place to visit so you can say you visited it. Having grown up near Hollywood Florida beach my whole life, I can tell you that Venice Beach is not that attractive. It's eccentric in nature....make no mistake. I've read some reviews where people are saying they saw no drug use, nor strange people. You obviously walked through Venice Beach in 5 minutes!! We were invited into hemp shops, smelled hemp, was stopped by people selling their rap CD's and watched some moron curse at himself profusely. We found it amusing, but I would not recommend this for families with children.This is a good place to stop and see, but I wouldn't spend a beach day there.",Philip Turturro
30,Have to see at least once,"Nice long beach, good views. Interesting to see the pics you always see on TV in real life. Cheap prices on souvenirs, shoes, and other items. Very interesting for people watching. I enjoyed it here, I wasn't the least bit nervous or scared, don't know what others are referring to. And if anyone is going to be nervous about surroundings it's me. I recommend stopping by at least briefly.",R S
30,Not as bad as you think,"I was borderline frightened to go to the Venice beach boardwalk because of some of the reviews here. It was myself, my husband, my parents and our two teens ages 13 and 15. My son wanted to see the skatepark they have there. As others have said, avoid the guys selling rap CDs and just be aware of your surroundings. This place has a lot of ""flavor"". It doesn't smell that great and I'm not sure that I would've eaten anything from the food places there. But, nobody was getting mugged...there was no open drug use (although I'm sure some had engaged in that kind of activity prior to coming to the beach) and there were lots of families walking around. We went on a Tuesday afternoon. The skatepark is cool and it was really busy. Didn't go down to the beach area so I'm not sure how that was but it looked nice from a distance.It's definitely an eclectic kind of place but nothing here made us feel unsafe or uneasy. I'm not sure if after dark, that would be my same story!Parking in the lot is around $10",dockfam
20,UGH!,We really looked forward to visiting this area as we had heard so much about it being a truly unique place. We quickly learned that once was more then enough!. The cast of characters is definitely unique but the place itself was dirty as were many of the characters. A walk out on the pier was nauseating as the smell of urine was overpowering-totally gross.,Ecampb
50,Never a Dull Moment,"Venice Beach is by far the most unique place on the West Coast. You can spend hours people watching, checking out vendors selling an array of things from paintings, trinkets, custom skateboards and more.You can rent bikes and ride the entire boardwalk on a bike trail or just walk the boardwalk.Lots of culture here, skaters, old school pot heads, musicians, dancers, and artists.There's also a skate park to watch local skaters practice their tricks. They will do their best tricks if they know you are filming. Very nice kids.There are alot of gift shops, skateboard shops, tattoo parlors, clothing stores, and legal Medical Marijuana spots that do your evaluation.I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the area and is even worth the drive. (I drove from Pasadena to check it out)",irene c
30,People watching is great here,"My family and I spent two weeks traveling through California. This was one of our stops. I can honestly say I'm glad I saw it, but it's not a place I will plan to go back to again. The beach was pretty and the people watching was very entertaining. The boardwalk was a little overwhelming and not as friendly and beautiful as I had hoped. There are SO MANY fabulous places in California, this was possibly last on the list for me.",AJ101114
50,SIGHTS to see!!!,"If you want to see the spectrum of lifestyles along the west coast beach life, this is the place to see it!!! PLENTY of souvenir shops that are the most decent priced seen in the area.",Tony B
50,Great place to people watch,If you are into people watching this is the place to be. The skaters the jogger sand the muscle people. These are the most attractive of the normal folks in LA. There are rental booths for skates and bikes so give it a try.,ET-retired
30,great walk on Venice - overall it's ok - feels like I am at Carribean citiy,"Well, it's a nice walk on the Venice Walk all the way to the Pier. However, if you start out from the flea market, you would feel it is kind of sad to see a lot of people who is trying to sell some stuff to make a living. You can tell there are a dozen a LAPD there , but I see no LAPD on the Pier side at all. The neighborhood is kind of a poverty area but walking to the beach in day time is fine.With family, I suggest park at the beach and do not save $5 dollar parking 2 blocks away.At the Pier, family with young kids would love to have a few rides.Food and beverages prices are fair I would say.Tips - if you are tired, you can pay $5 per person to have a bike ride (max 3 people) on the Venice Walk. Or you can rent a bike, or a battery power tri-cycles depending on your need.Tips - restroom is public and it is quite disgusting if you are not get use to it.",SekBoy
40,Crazy in a good way!,"One of the most overwhelming places I have ever been too! Was desperate to visit Venice as a huge Jim Morrison and Arnold Schwarzenegger fan it held my interest for a variety of reasons. As other reviewers have said it is never boring on the boardwalk and we found it to be a hilarious experience, ""stripper dog"" in particular was my comedic highlight of the visit. I will concur with what others have said about being prepared though. It is a hectic and at sometimes almost threatening vibe to the walk due to the sheer number of people and in particular those seeking your attention. It is the closest thing I've experience when visiting California to the strips of places like Ibiza and Ayia Napa. I can certainly understand why someone looking at me may I think I am need of marijuana but being incessantly asked can be daunting. A must see for those visiting LA and in particular those interested in bodybuilding or music culture but maybe not one for the kids!",Chris B
40,Do it once not perhaps again!,"Crazy people, mostly fun, people watch, some pretty rubbish restaurants and loony shops. A must see but probably only once!",graham044
40,Fun!,"Awesome boardwalk. There's always something interesting going on. Great for people watching, seeing mini performances, and enjoying the different colors on the buildings. ""Interesting"" is the best description for the Venice Beach Boardwalk.",Tunaidi
30,Boardwalk is the must see,"The beach is nice and all but if you want to go to the beach, you'd rather go north a couple of minutes to Santa Monica.The boardwalk is what everyone goes to Venice for. There's a ton of shops: souvenirs, ice cream, fruit, clothing, and mirujuana ""clinics"".We didn't get to bike but would definitely look into it if we returned. There are bike paths all over.The skate park is a nice attraction as are the street performers. There's a lot of homeless people but they don't really bother passerby.It 9th the safest place especially after dark so be sure to keep valuables in the car are in your front pockets.",Alihaider M
40,Definitely a must-see,"I agree with other reviewers who have cautioned, in good nature, that you should be prepared before you go.My wife and I enjoyed the boardwalk. Be sure to stay in the pedestrian lanes, and do not walk in the bike lanes.Must see attractions: outdoor weight lifters (be warned: if your significant other likes muscle guys, you might have a hard time getting your significant other to leave!); skate park; and the beach itself (it's huge!).The original ""Pumping Iron"" documentary (technically, a ""docu-drama"") with Arnold inspired me to get fit, so seeing Venice Beach and Muscle Beach was a ""bucket list"" item for sure.There are lots of hippies and homeless people in Venice Beach, but they never bothered us. Outdoor medical marijuana use is common, so the smell of marijuana is ubiquitous in Venice Beach. Just be aware of that.There are several medical marijuana ""clinics"" in Venice Beach, and one of their ""doctors"" approached me and assured me that he could ""get me legal"" quickly. I don't have any problems with marijuana use, whether recreationally or medicinally, but I don't smoke, so I politely declined.Lots of shops, local artists, t-shirt shops, etc.There are also several street performers. Do not photograph them without tipping them. That's a fast way to start an argument or a scene.A police officer warned me not to carry my camera equipment to Venice after dark. He used the phrase, ""sitting duck"" about 5 times. Definitely keep your ""Street Smarts"" while on the boardwalk, especially at night. Violent crime is extremely rare, but with all of the street performers and other activities, pickpockets and other thefts could occur. Carry your wallet in your front pocket, put your cell phone in your pocket, etc.",Blake R
30,Lots of shops & many different artists,"Lots of shops on one side and lots of handmade items & artists on the other. It was definitely an interesting area. Drums, singers, artists, etc. Lots of police - I felt very safe. I didn't see any homeless sleeping in the area. Lots of people asking for money for various reasons.",Heather F
30,Nice beach,"This is part of our city tour, so many shops to see and many skate boarders. The only downfall is too many homeless people at the walk areas, using tents and police roaming around too often, otherwise nice place to walk",Michica
50,Trip down the boardwalk,"Love to walk down the boardwalk looking at all the vendors and shops. The entertainment is great. The only downfall is all the homeless sleeping right there on the walk and the grass areas. I was sitting near the drum circle. I noticed that the police came up to the drummers and told them that they had to move to the sand. This is not good for disabled that can not get to the sand. I am one of the disabled and my scooter can not go to the sand. Why are the police making the drum circle move yet they do not say anything to the homeless sleeping right on the boardwalk. The visitors to the boardwalk have to walk around the sleeping, but the police never say anything to them, the drummers are entertaining the public and are asked to move. WHY?????",Diana C
40,Freak beach...,"Well, it is interesting to look at and visit, but on the other hand, it is not the end of the world, if you dont. You can see lots of crazy people but also a lot of homeless and beggars. The street artists are fine though and watching the guys play basketball also!",Vinzent K
30,Must See but Maybe Only Once,Venice is something that should be seen for first timers to LA.That being said I doubt many would want more than one visit.Its so grubby and carnival like.And man have those Venicians got the no free photo thing down.Signs everywhere.Food looks nasty and junk shops are expensive.,Rkelly2014
40,Fun Day in Venice!!!,"If you live in Calfornia, then you have heard of Venice. A fun way to spend a day. I think its funny when I read reviews from people who are so appalled at what they see in Venice. Then they write reviews about how it was so horrible and not kid friendly. Its Venice Beach!!! Its famous for having some of the most eccentric people on the planet there!!!My husband and I live in Southern California, and decided to spend a Sunday afternoon in Venice. The one thing I will say, right up front: Parking Sucks. If you wanna make it easy on yourself, prepare to pay for parking. We paid $20,,,,,which is a fortune!!! But it was worth it because we were steps from the sand and it was just easier overall. Accept that the parking sucks,,,,then move on so you can have fun!!!!All along Venice there are restaurants, shops and booths selling all kinds of trinkets. Yes, there are ""medical marijuana recommendation"" offices along the way (GET OVER IT PEOPLE!!),,,,and there are lots of shops that sell ""smoking accessories"" that some people may not approve of (again,,,,don't go in those shops if they bother you.) The people are what make Venice cool. Lots of street performances and they also have a Freak Show that is pretty cool. Muscle Beach is cool as well. Lots of yummy restaurants to sit outside and enjoy some lunch while observing the sights!I feel like Venice is a place you gotta visit at least one time. Its all about people watching!!! So much fun!!! You can absolutely take your children. Just keep them close,,,,,,just like you would any other place!!!I've never been to Venice at night. I imagine its probably a lot more ""wild"" than during the day,,,but I can't really say.........Overall, if you are visiting California. Check out Venice Beach. If you live in California, you probably already have been to Venice, but if not, check it out!!! Fun day!!",AprilmlcPeck
40,Venice Beach Boardwalk is our type of place,"This is the place we love and it's easy to explore the coast line and still get back to a rental or B&B and enjoy all the activity on the Boardwalk. The people are very friendly and you can find some unique items right on the Boardwalk. We enjoy people watching and street performances from several places along this walk. Music fills the air and the vibe is always upbeat. There are places that sell medicinal marijuana and, yes the bums are many; however we've never felt intimidated by either and joke that there are 2 smells of the Venice Beach Boardwalk - reefer or suntan lotion :-) If you go, enjoy it to the fullest; there are not many places like it. We've visited many times over the years and keep coming back. This was our 2nd week-long stay off Rose Ave. in 3 years.",Vinnie1973

30,An Interesting Place,"Coming from the conservative south, it was hard to keep my lower jaw in place. There were some fun ""street performances"" and the view once you walked down to the beach was pretty, but this is not a place for families with small children at all, and I saw plenty there. Tattoo shops, medicinal marijuana evaluations, piercing shops, scantily clad ""muscle men"", homeless sleeping all around - I've been there, done it, don't care to go back.",amymc001
50,A little bit of everything for everybody!,"This is my favorite place! One of my favorite things is the bike trail. It is the most beautiful ride at sunset. It is very close to the beach but separate from the boardwalk so you don't have to worry about the pedestrians. The boardwalk is one of the best people watching places you will ever find. The resident artists who line up each day to sell their goods are some of the most interesting people. There are many great restaurants and coffee shops all along the boardwalk. If you can't find something to entertain you on this boardwalk, you are in trouble. I would highly recommend the shops that do the massages. They are really great. Some people think that there are too many ""homeless"" people but for the most part they really don't bother people by begging - most of them are selling their goods and you can really find some very talented people there. The beach is so big and just a few steps from the boardwalk. Just a fabulous place to hang out.",Shelly M
40,In love with Venice Beach!,"I moved to LA not too long ago and very quickly discovered that Venice is the place to be. Street performers, body builders, bicycling, tanning, walking, eating, drinking, sight seeing and shopping can all be done here. People here are very laid back (compared to other more pretentious areas in LA) and friendly. The beach is super sandy with tons one room to lay down your towel and tan. My only complaint! Gets too crowded during the weekends.",Daniela V
30,Didn't feel safe at night,During the day I felt ok walking the boardwalk. There are a bunch of people selling their work and some was cool. But once it became dark you soon realized how many people actually live on the boardwalk or beach. I have never seen so many homeless people. It was so depressing. Many were drunk or smoking weed I didn't feel safe. Cops would stay in their vehicles and watch the drama that took place.,MichelleWyatt2010
40,Much fun on a lovely beach!,"Don't take it too seriously, but do make an effort to go to the Venice Beach boardwalk at least once. The weird and quirky are there in full force, but more importantly, the beach itself is the thing to see: As pristine a beach as you could hope for in an urban setting. Plenty of vendors abound, but save your appetite for the better restaurants on Main Street.",Lucy H
40,Weird and Wondeful,"This place is a site to see. There are people of all types here and it is a site to see them. If you like to people watch, beautiful beaches, vendor shopping, this is the place to go. I highly recommend going there.",Brent J
30,Good fun - expect the weird and wonderful,"We visited here on the way to Santa Monica pier. Definitely worth a visit. Muscle Beach was unusually quiet and I was a bit disappointed if I'm honest! We visited around 4pm on a weekend, so maybe a weekend would be better to spot rippling muscles?!Make sure you have a fruit smoothie - they are amazing. Avoid the public toilets and bring your own tissue if you do need to go. Not pleasant.You really will see everything and anything here. But I preferred Santa Monica Beach where the original muscle beach was and there are now slack lines and rings where some beautifully supple and talented people traverse the rings as if they were floating through the air!!",travel_junkie05
50,Some of Everything!,"My wife and I took a stroll along the Venice Beach boardwalk after visiting the Santa Monica pier. The boardwalk is amazing .. you see everything! People doing all sorts of tricks, in all sorts of get ups, using props .. so much fun. There are shops for getting souvenirs and food. You can take your time, stroll eat .. even go to the beach if you'd like. The best was a guy letting you take pictures with the laziest dog in the world. Basically a dog with a hat on .. just laying there!! And people were paying just to take a picture with him .. so funny! If you're in the area and have never been here, I'd highly recommend it .. lots of fun!! Just stay away from the bathrooms .. unless you can hold your breath a really, really long time!",Ronald M
40,Venice Boardwalk from a local,"I've lived in Venice off and on since 1969. The Boardwalk today is not what it used to be. As the second most popular LA attractive after Disneyland...it's kind of like Disneyland. But that's not to say that you should miss it if you come to LA for a visit. It's a carnival atmosphere right on the beach, with artists, performers and lots of cheap T-shirts and sunglasses. To mix it up, you might want to walk from the Venice Pier to the Santa Monica Pier (3 miles) - only part of it will be Venice Boardwalk, and the rest will be more beach-like - you'll also pass the original muscle beach in Santa Monica. Or just walk down to the water to dip your toes. The water is cold - usually only warm enough to swim by July/August - and swim by a lifeguard station because the waves are not ""pacific"" and there can be riptides. German/Nordic tourists: PLEASE wear sunscreen. The sun is more tropical than you're used to and you'll end up in the hospital from sunstroke without it. Watch your valuables and watch out for uncontrolled bicyclists and/or skateboarders. OK, now you have all the warnings: just go and have fun!",Debra K
40,Unique experience,"Great for walkabout at this interesting place, if you have extra time to spare, esp when you're on your way to Santa Monica!",summer_non
50,"If you're anywhere close, It's a must See!","Love Venice Beach and all the character that comes with it! Every time I come to LA I have to find time to stop here. Put my feet in the ocean, see the boardwalk artists and all their creations. Look for the guy on roller blades that plays the guitar. I also like getting my palm read my a woman on the boardwalk. She is very good! Haven't eaten here really..but did buy a lot of shirts and hoodies, and pants..great place to pick up gifts for people.",tif316
30,This place has fallen apart!,"I visited Venice Beach several years ago, and it was a vivid, active place to visit. I stopped by to check it out once again, and was sad to see it is falling apart, and several homeless people have taken-over the boardwalk. Tourists will not like seeing that. The prices of t-shirts have gone up, and this place used to be a reasonably priced place to find t-shirts, but not any more! The ocean is the only thing that is a positive experience of Venice Beach. The rest of it is dirty, and disappointing. I am not sure I will be returning. I did visit a restaurant that was very impressive and reasonable, I just wish I could remember the name. It reminded me of a malt shop, and the owner was very nice and professional. I would definitely eat there again.",A C
50,Awesome,"Planning on moving toSoCal next year. The boardwalk at Venice Beach is the Best. Boyfriend and I traveled to Cali. for a vacation and I fell in love, Boyfriend/fiancee has been in love with this state for 5 years. Was good to get to Cali. Compared to California MI. is Draconian.",Molly R
50,A great place to spend a few hours.,"If you're ambitious you can walk all the way to the Santa Monica pier. We didn't, but will next time for sure. There are a few ""ghoulish"" side shows along the boardwalk with everything from marijuana ""medical"" kiosks to displays of colourful painted ceramic skulls. Lots of conversation material.",JeanYHZ
50,eclectic for sure,"You have to take in the sights & sounds of the boardwalk on Venice. Iconic for a reason, its down right nuts. Some crazy folk hang out here, talented musicians & even film sets all going on as you wander about. Some people call it tacky, yes it is but its fun & very much lots to look at",lasqueezee
30,Alot of very interesting people,"As we wandered along the walk, we were approached by many panhandlers, and opportunities to observe unique people taking $ for their imaginative shows (ie. dog lying it's back, wearing sunglasses, while her owner rubbed her tummy).",JP7844
50,Had a relaxed and fun day,"I´ve visited Venice on a day trip to LA and it was worth it! Relaxing at the beach, people watching and just walking around. There are a lot of crazy people there for sure, but I had absolutely no Problems or trouble (I was on my own).The mixture of people is really interesting: tourists (couples, families - all ages), locals and some crazy guys.The shops are all pretty the same: shirts and sunglasses. But you also have a lot of street performers (even a guy playing his piano) and street art.An american friend told me not to stay there after sunset, so I left during a nice sunset.If you´re on your own and want to have a pic of you, just ask another tourist to take it(you will recognize them for sure) to be on the safe side. But there is a police station at the beach. I felt pretty safe there.",Nic-on-adventure
20,Dirty as hell,"I was actually looking forward to going there, but I guess my expectations were a little too high.The place is plain dirty. and not just because there's homeless people laying around everywhere, but also trash on the boardwalk. also you're constantly forced to dodge people on skateboards and bikes who seem not to care if they hit you or not. it smells of weed pretty much everywhere, which is also sort of annoying.The good side: there's a different group of street perfomers every 10 ft and a lot of them are really good. there's a skate park right next to it, so if you wanna see some good skateboard action you can go there. we actually saw ""the illusion"" (youtube-guy who was on Tosh.0) skate around a little.And the restaurants have decent prices and long happy hours.But overall it's a place that you go to once and then you're done with it.",Norm T
20,Disappointing,"I had heard this was a wild scene with lots of characters, fun shops, Muscle Beach, etc. We've travelled a lot and don't mind the offbeat character. However, this was not what I expected. The only ""characters"" were the homeless who were mostly sleeping everywhere. The shops were cheap t-shirt shops, cheap souvenir shops and marijuana dispensaries with ""the doc is in"" signs -- on repeat over and over along the street. The stores had aggressive street hawkers trying to lure you in. Even Muscle Beach was just a run down set of weights with some older guys working out. Maybe it picks up during the summer, but this was a beautiful day in April--perfect workout weather. Anyway, I was sad that this former fun boardwalk has declined into this.",travelhappyseattle
20,Scary,"When I heard of the boardwalk, I thought it would be awesome people watching. I'm not scared of homeless or strange looking people. I prepared my 10 year old what to expect when we got there. We rode our bikes from our hotel about 10 minutes to the boardwalk, but was not prepared for how bad it was. There were homeless people laying in the streets, people screaming and talking to them selves, it was if we had walked into a psychiatric ward gone bad. I told my husband I didn't feel comfortable with my daughter seeing what was going on. Do not take your children here!",CAROL L
10,Disappointing,"Apparently this used to be a really nice boardwalk at one time, but it's not anymore. Glad we came during the day. Not for families.",jgrmusa
50,Family Outing,"This is a beautiful beach with all kinds of things to do you can lift weights, play tennis, play basketball, etc. There are many to kinds of restaurants and many types of great food. There is something to do for the entire family.",1ibrahim
50,I wish I could add an even higher rating,"Love this place. But we may have come too late because we couldn't find decent parking. I'm not really into staring at people minding their own business, but this place has great people watching and characters that want your attention. Always something to turn around and see. Also some food trucks there. Hope to be back soon!!",Negrilgurl
40,Beautiful but homeless,Beach is beautiful but lots of homeless people. Definitely will go back! My fiance and I loved the little shops,eholewinski
30,"Not completely my cup of tea, but an interesting walk.","If you like to people watch and see some ""interesting"" people selling strange things, this is the place to go. You can purchase good aura, get your vibrational plane adjusted, etc etc. I guess once in your lifetime is a good thing. Great parking lots. Lots of skateboarding to watch.",Cheryl T
30,Be aware..very aware!!,"This place is unsurprisingly full of hobos, that means in broad daylight seeing people going to the toilet in public, sleeping around the palm trees and on the beach, intimidating people etc.Most worryingly, today I cycled past a guy without shoes who out of nowhere started threatening these guys on their bikes at the top of his voice, with kids and women about ""i'm going to f****** cut your head off!!"" - after he asked for a ride and they cycled on.Please be aware this place is dangerous.Take away the hobos, and you have an excellent beach, excellent bike paths and skate parks and not a bad vibe, also great for people watching. However the stalls and shops are all the same cheap tatt, and again with all the tramps and hobos you won't believe you are in supposedly a civilised, developed country.No wonder there are no 4/5* hotels here on the beachfront.",in_arsene_we_trust
50,Worth the trip,"It's a huge beach. Lots of history; not my kind of shopping, mostly touristy things ( I would prefer unique to the area things); but I had a stroke of good luck there. A lady kept insisting that I take her seat at her coffee table and it turned out to be in a café across the street from the Morrison Hotel, and I had gone a couple of times because of this history. Funny; but I think this is the real love street; not his other residence in Laurel Canyon; the streets around here look like Love Street feels. Main Street downtown is also very large; but at a glance they don't seem to get what people are looking to buy either. Farmers market gives you a free parking pass which helps; it's not cheap to park but there is a discount during winter. Requires a lot of exercise; bike paths, and surprisingly, on the beach there there is very fancy living. Not too much weird art on the boardwalk like reputation goes. This beach is so large I have a hard time believing that Jim Morrison accidently bumped into Ray Manzarek; way too large for that.",HolidayReview216
30,Wasn't what I expected,"It's great for people watching and also for looking at the lovely beachfront houses, however, you are harrassed a lot and there's nothing really there for me.",josienpaul
40,Freak Show A Must,"Walked down the boardwalk. Lots to see. Vendors selling things, people dressed up in strange outfits. Lots of food/ice cream places to get a bite to eat or a snack. The Freak Show was for sure ""freaky."" Very cheap and a must see.",290TerriB
40,People watching,Lots of shops and people selling their crafts and music. Great place to go and just watch people go by. Plenty places to eat and drink along the way.,Justin K
40,Fun in the Sun,"What did this board walk not have...hmmm...SO getting there, you get an awesome view of the graffiti all over the area, i thought it was really cool. Its bargain galore if you're looking for cheap sunglasses and t shirts. I don't think the quality of the clothing is very good though, but if you're planning to use it for a few times then toss it, its not a bad buy. There's lots of food and frozen drinks for you to buy as you walk around. My favourite was the freshly made lemonade freezos. There's a short zip line on the board walk, a muscle gym, and lots of hot bodies walking about. It was my first sight of the ""green doctors"". Then when you get off the board walk, you walk towards a scene from Baywatch, with the lifeguard house and the ocean. I dipped my feet in the ocean and it was COLD! It is a nice trip if youve got an hour or two to spare and just want to chill and mingle with some cool people.",Riona A
30,Kinda Weird,"Venice Beach is ok for a short visit. It's full of lots of 'interesting' characters, loads of shops selling tourist stuff, and live street music, which is pretty good. Not much else really. Take a wander through the back streets and there all sorts of beach homes, full of character, with attractive gardens. Santa Monica is better if you want the California beach scene, and the pier is iconic.",Andrew A
40,Take in the Local Color,Fun to troll down the boardwalk and take in the local color. Interesting performance artists that are very entertaining. Have to do it once.,Bill K
40,Fun...,Not sure what else you would do while in Venice. Support the local artists. Go buy some cheap shirts while you are there.,SMorovich
30,"Interesting, weird, scary",I didn't particularly like Venice Beach boardwalk. Glad I went to experience it first hand but it was a little too crazy for me. Wish I'd gone to Santa Monica instead.,Esme99
30,Walk the boardwalk for free entertainment,A tourist attraction. Things to see and buy (and people asking for money and trying to sell you things). Definitely more grungy than the Santa Monica Pier. But walking the Boardwalk is free entertainment and there is lots of food to buy.,EmmyMPLS
50,Venice Canals,"I began a walk from Santa Monica and ended up at Venice Beach which was not the congested with unique characters everyone implies. We have many more ""characters"" in Ct. and NY. I did thoroughly enjoy walking among and about the canals in Venice. Beautiful plantings and cottage type homes adorning the canal walkways.",carole c
40,A Reminder of the 1960s,"The sites along the tacky boardwalk are reminders of the 60s---tattoo parlors, T-shirt shops, torn jeans, pot everywhere, homeless folks wondering around. Yet, it is fun to experience for a couple of hours. You need to walk a bit inland to stroll around the canals, a very residential and quiet area.",Schanke
40,"Nothing New, but Always Fun","If you have never been to Venice Beach and walked the shops - it's a must unless you are into high end retail therapy. Open air store front after storefront, there are t-shirts, jewlery, toys, massage and food stands. Along the wide walk and on the beach side, performers of all kinds await your camera. From a roller-skating guitar player, full piano and guitar show, broken glass walkers and even a guy with a sign asking you to pay a dollar to kick him in his rear end. A little sad at times, but it does prove that ANYONE with an idea can make a buck in America. PS the sunsets are phenomenal! Be prepared to pay for parking.",TuckerSue
40,Great shopping,"Venice boardwalk is best visited on the weekends for optimal shopping experience. For those of you with teenage boys, they can watch the many sports going on while you shop. I loved all the jewelry and art work! Enjoy!",Joni B
50,FUN!,"This is a great place to people-watch and have a nice lazy day at the beach. We always park down at the end of the boardwalk, lots are generally less full but make sure to go before 10:30-11 or it will be full. I suggest that you walk the boardwalk and buy boogie boards for a fraction of renting them at the stands, you can always give them away if you cannot take them with you. I have been visiting Venice Beach for 20+ years every few years and its one of my favorite places.",Hayley L
50,Fun Place To Visit !,Sunshine and sand--Walking the boardwalk is very colorful and entertaining. Street performers abound. Muscle beach usually has at least a couple or more hotties to check out. The street food is awesome and affordable>>especially the fish tacos. If you love to people watch- this is definitely a great place.. Public restrooms are available and in decent shape. Outdoor foot showers to rinse off the salt and sand. lots of fun places to buy a gift or keepsake. I love this place-- I will go back.Great place for all ages.,Lisa B
20,get ready for craziness all over,"bring your camera! you will see it all here. lots of people, marijuana doctors, huge amounts of homeless people, shady characters, tattoo shops, the smell of drugs........and everyone else trying to make a dollar from you.lots of shops and food spots around. check out muscle beach and the skate park if you can. parking isnt too expensive. bathrooms are not the best. watch out for the bikers and skaters zooming by.see my pictures with this post",tonystewart14
50,I LOVE VENICE!,"I love Venice boardwalk! .. there are so many things to do.. sunbathe, swim, surf, skate, bike, hike, shop, get a tattoo or piercing eat etc! yes there are homeless people but they will not bother you, they just want to be left alone. PLEASE VISIT THE NEARBY VENIS CANALS.. WHAT A AMAZING , TRANQUIL PLACE.",Bedazzelle P
40,A lot of activities going on here,"I had a good day when I visited Venice Beach. There happens a lot of activities to watch at while walking around such at people who skateboarding, street artists and surfing.It was nice to see this place especially all the cool graffiti at the walls and palms.",Mads
20,Not Somewhere I would hangout!,The shoreline and water and both stunning and beautiful .... But that is all that is stunning and beautiful!We drove Hwy 1 from LA area South to San Diego and this beach was by far the most interesting in looks but not the nicest by far.Great place if you are a people watcher (wouldnt go there after dark) and if you are in need of a medicinal use licence for Pot smoking....Lots of crazy looking and strange people and not what I excepeted for sure!,Slamedcivic17
20,Overcrowded and a bit dirty,"We always go down the bike path thru Venice Beach. This year it seemed a bit dirtier and like anyone can just put a table up with anything on it for sale. Watch out for people shoving cd's at you saying they are free but then asking for a doation to their cause. Weekends are impossible to walk freely down the walkway by the shops. A lot of performers, different types that caused congestion and stopped the entire flow of the foot traffic. Though bathrooms are plenty make sure you have some tissue in your purse or backpack as none of the stalls had any when we visited. Save yourself time looking for parking and just go all the way to the beach for parking it's cheaper and less hassle. Fun for a short visit to see all the different things but keep your eyes open. The shops have some cute clothes but a lot you could find in the bigger stores for less. The freak show people walk up and down to solicit people to come to the shows. Watch out for the tree trunk that may stand up off a nearby stoop as it will freak you out. Week day visit will be a better experience.",Bankerchic77
30,Once in a lifetime maybe,Were from the midwest maybe that was the problem a little to extreme and over the top for us. It is one of those things you might want to do in your life but don't plan on spending a lot of time here.,Amy S
20,Filthy,"Why travel overseas to a third world, when you can visit Venice Beach?. For such a well known location I was dissapointed and concerned with the local people who seemed to live by the beach in boxes etc. I guess this is just the social divide of USA.With people hanging around the public toilets and signs saying ""no public toilets available"" inside restaurants I would make sure you are prepared if you want to make a visit.Vagarants abound in this area, maybe I'm just a concerned parent",talk2me33
10,Very Sketchy and Creepy,"First of all, people were smoking pot right out in the open. I'm not cool with that, sorry. I was too nervous holding on to my purse to really do much people-watching. The only enjoyment we had was watching the skateboarders. They are pretty talented!If you are going to Los Angeles to get the whole ""LA"" experience, I guess this is a good place to go, but it was not for us.",Paula M
40,Just as amusing as everyone says it is,"Husband and I had to wait until our hosts got home where we were staying, so we drove out from the L.A. airport to spend a couple of hours sightseeing in the meantime. We drove out Venice Boulevard, parked at the first, open-air, lot we saw, for a $5 flat fee. The next block we saw another parking lot, covered, with a $7 rate. We walked a long way northward, mixing in with the crowds shopping, strolling, hawking wares, etc - what a swarm of different people: students, seniors, kids, babies, drifters, well-heeled, yuppie, hippie, skaters, Segway riders, cops on horseback on a slow patrol. You can sunbathe on the beach itself and surf or swim under the watch of lifeguards, rent a Segway, watch skateboarders do all kinds of tricks and cheering each other - girls look sexy doing this for some reason - eat all kinds of junk food (I forget what it was called, but the veggie burrito with basil and a pasilla chile at Big Daddy was really tasty with a nice mix of crunch and gooeyness, followed by a hot churro). You can also get yourself qualified for medical marijuana at several places. Lots of tantalizing pictures to take. Besides the people, there's one store where the owner is a mechanical/welding whiz and made his own ""Transformers"", and he only charges $1 for your photo privilege. We watched the sun set, a Chinese (?) calligrapher at work brushing out your favorite word, a huge wall of graffiti art (with a note to like them on Facebook), and all kinds of dogs camping out with their human friends with not much else place to go. Bring a good sweater for when the sun goes down and the breeze picks up.",Magdalena H
40,Fun!,"Venice Beach is a fun spot to see at least once. There is a bike path and walking path, and you can rent bikes and bike from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. There are lots of tourist shops and tattoo shops. We visited in the daylight but I wouldn't really want to be there in the evening. We visited here twice. First time it was early Sunday morning and there weren't a lot of people around but there were a lot of homeless people and people sleeping everywhere. The next time we went, it was in the afternoon and it was better with more people, and the atmosphere seemed better. We felt safer. There is a new skate park which was fun to watch the skateboarders. We found a cute Mexican restaurant on one of the main streets out of Venice Beach and had margaritas and nachos! The Venice Canals are a good quiet spot in the middle of a busy area. We enjoyed a walk there too.",PaulaCanada4
30,"At night: SKATERS, HOMELESS AND ""MEDICINAL HERBS""","I'm chilled out but I'll tell it like it is. At night after 6, Venice beach transforms into the night version. Like Jekyll andHyde. I've gone from one far end to the other. It's mainly tattoo places,convenience stores, skate shops, bong shoos and shady doctor places that will prescribe you what Colorado can now give you said this year and a load of homeless clans. To further illuminate the streets, police helicopters patrol up top and shine lights on you to make sure you are not up to any shady business. It's great fun if you all disperse in different directions because the police on ground will want to get a closer look and ask you lots of ""getting to know you questions"" without being offered dinner.It's a cool experience. The odd bar and restaurant is open and it's cool seeing the guys attempt tricks. A talkative 4 year old approached us too but he didn't know any tricks on the skateboard yet. Only how to go forwards. One store has the worlds most petted Husky outside the mobile phone accessory store along with 4 other small dogs. This is about half way from skaters paradise to the muscle beach section.There are some crews that dance and have break offs who are skilled too.It's not glitzy or glamour but more like the beach version of Camden Town in England but not as many people into metal. The homeless guys won't bother people though. This is the house at night. Not where they work.",Carlos_Yabrudy
50,Nice Attraction,"Great place jog, walk, ride a bike or skate. Best time to get out is about 10:30 when the fog burns off. Bring a light jacket for the morning and evening. Reminds me of Bourbon St. without the alcohol.",ThomNOLA
20,Huge potential but needs a clean up,"I live in Venice and have spent countless hours on the boardwalk area.The Venice boardwalk is not a true boardwalk in the wood-on-piers way. It's a large pedestrian walk that runs from Santa Monica to the Venice Pier along the beach. In it's history, it was part side-show, part outdoor market, carnival, fair -- like a Coney Island. Nowadays, there is still a sampling of this vibe but the bigger cross section is cheap sunglass stands, ""artists"" selling wares, tattoo shops, lots of cheap food stands. There are some nicer restaurant options which is a nice addition and makes for popular places for people watching on a nice day. This is definitely not a retail destination. But if you forgot your hat or sunglasses or flip flops, you'll find them here.My biggest complaint are the homeless. There is a lot of crime and drug use, mostly after dark, but even during the day, it's very apparent that groups of people are literally living on the beach with piles of stuff and sometimes even tents. I am all for supporting these people with city services but I have seen time and time again, the homeless littering or urinating in public. This is prime ocean front property and as a resident I want to feel that I can use it. I want it to be clean and inviting when a visitor comes to see it. Overall it just comes across a little seedy and like you need to keep a close eye on your wallet.Venice has a definite eclectic charm but this beach front stretch is sadly not it's best side. See the beach, yes, but for a better experience of Venice, visit Abbott Kinney.",lwturner
40,Colourful character,"Worth a visit for the people-watching! Some very colourful characters around. Have to say that I have never encountered so much marijuana smoke at the one place in my life, though (not being a smoker myself, so maybe that doesn't say much). Plenty of people were smoking down there.",painted_duchess
50,For Those Who Love The Odd and Tacky,"I have been to Venice Beach many times over the years. I just returned after 10 years and found Venice Beach to be just as odd, tacky and unique as it has always been. It is, however, more commercialized with vendors everywhere; less artsy than in years past, and probably not for a family outing. The ocean here is beautiful but the parking is tough, especially on a weekend. As others have said, not advisable to visit at night and probably not a good place to use an ATM card. All of this said, however, it is fascinating if you like this kind of thing, and I do. BTW so does my 20 year old daughter who is a photography student!",Paula D
10,Not worth your time,"If you are seeking a quiet, relaxing vacation, this is not the place to be. We rented bikes then got out of there quickly. The beach and boardwalk are very crowded. There are a lot of homeless people and strange characters. It is much nicer in Santa Monica, which is just a short bike ride away.",barnet38
30,The Venice Boardwalk Experience,This is a Very long Boardwalk that is filled with a lot of different Shops and restaurants. There are a lot of vendors here and one has to be very careful what they do around here at night. It is worth going to see as the beach is awesome. There are a lot of homeless tents and belongings every where Drug paraphanalia is readily available in a lot of stores and shops. Still worth the visit if you can find a parking spot. Best advice is to leave before it gets dark.,Tonia Louis H
30,Interesting...,"I must saying. What I thought Venice Beach Boardwalk would be, is not what it ended up being lol.The beach was beautiful no doubt about it. The actual boardwalk was iffy. there were fights happening , weirdos all around, but its definitely an experience you should do no doubt about it. My biggest reason for going there was checking out muscle beach and it was cool to soak up the atmosphere there. However, We didn't spend a lot of time there and my wife was ready to boogie quick. Go here though, check it out.",cksteeve
40,Enjoy Venice Beach,"If you'd like a more family oriented visit to Venice Beach, park in the lot at the end of Washington Blvd. There is a pier and lots of beach area for enjoying the waves.If you are like me, I enjoy meeting peeps and people-watching, you might want to park in the lot at the end of Venice Blvd. From here you can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the various shops and ""fair-type"" food. There are basketball courts, weightlifting equipment, paddle tennis courts, a skate park etc. You can be a spectator or join in the fun.One piece of advice I'd like to share, if you want to take pics with the various beach/street performers, please tip them.",Simply0305
50,Wonderful Beach,"I was expecting a tourist area that have a lot of local souvenirs available on this boardwalk, but seems all of the stores are selling the same paintings, same art works which is not as good as i thought. However, they have a lot of different kind of performance along the boardwalk, full band musics, local singers, local artist etc that make the walk very enjoyable. The food selection is not too many along the boardwalk. It was a very pleasant walk.",Arun
50,Stroll on by,"The boardwalk itself is a spectacle! It's insane! Full of people, booths, stores, music, bootleggers, Muscle Beach, tattoo artists, interesting people and food. When strolling the path by the beach, it's much more quiet than the other side at the boardwalk. There's also more room to bike or skate.Parking isn't so bad, it's $5 or street parking for free. (if you're lucky). I suggest to save your money and parking a few blocks away and talk a walk and enjoy venice.I'd like to head back here and try the tandem bikes for an hour and see how that's like.",kisssmee
30,Strange Area,"While walking down to the Venice Pier from Santa Monica, I noticed a complete difference in my surroundings. It may have just been me or the time of day/year I visited (just this past Monday) but the amount of weed in this area is INSANE. I get that it's legalized for specific purposes however I was just fascinated by the Weed Doctor shops throughout the boardwalk area and also by how freely everyone uses it. Now, I could care less if someone takes part in that, however I was starting to feel sick from the weed aroma. There was so sight of fresh air whatsoever.With that being said, I would recommend another beach area/boardwalk area for families, especially with young children.",Kate W
40,Very open,"This beach was very different from what I'm use to on the East Coast. But I like the vibe of the area. Some odd shops - especially the ""Weed Doctor"", but other than that I would go here again with a good audio book in tow... Maybe even work out on the equipment out there.",JDT82
50,""" a place to chill and hang out ""","I stayed just down the road at Marina del Ray , 20 min walk or so . This place is as exactly how you would imagine , wonderfull stalls with some wonderful people to see and meet . You can hire a bike to see the whole stretch of beach ,which is recommended and reasonably cheap.You could easily spend a whole day just walking and taking in the sights of street entertainers , dancers, to the more athletic skate park , where you can stand right at the edge and watch closely as the boarders do their tricks , it really is great to watch , there always seems to be some sporting activity on the go as you walk north, from Washington Ave which leads onto the beach ,up towards Santa Monica pier . You can buy almost anything as long as your careful . Also, as evening falls , i noticed that there seems to be a lot of folks sleeping rough on the grass just next to the boardwalk, but it's a very happy and relaxed atmosphere all the way along , with some great cafes and some decent and some not so decent food . The toilets are a bit messy sometimes but i never planned my holiday around visiting and judging public toilet facilities .Venice Beach is one of those places you can always say "" hey , i've been there and saw the sunset "" . I,m planning on going back in 2014 and looking forward to it , as its such a chilled place .",matt d
40,Venice Beach,"If you are a people watcher and just want to relax being surrounded by people, Venice and Santa Monica Beach is a nice way to spend your day. There are a few places to do some shopping. You can even rent and ride bikes. The food stands are not so bad. There is so much to see with the people dancing, vendors, etc that I would strongly suggest that if you have children (small of all ages) please watch them at all times. There are sometimes perverts and much more so be careful and enjoy your day. The bathrooms are not all the time clean so please be careful. Overall, the beach is a good place to people watch, swim,get some sun,shop, exercise, and eat. There is alot to see. Watch out for animals as well. To get a good parking space on the beach you may have to pay a fee to park the car.",pachambers
40,Very bohemic and fun,"Lots of different characters to see here, from skaters to 'weed doctors'. You will end up here anyway if you want to get to the beach and it's great seeing all the different people. Check out the outdoor gym, not something you would see in Europe!",Marijke J
40,A wierd experience worth checking out...,"Venice Beach has a little something to offer everyone. Highly recommend renting a bike for the trip. There are some good restaurants, musicians, and interesting art. Keep an open mind, as this place can get a little freaky...",El-Guapo-de-La-Noche
40,Quirky & Eclectic - Healthy Walk to Santa Monica Pier,"4 of us adults had our luggage stored for the day at LAX & taxied over here to spend a lengthy layover. Lunched at The Sidewalk Cafe as the local population began to show up. Many outstretched hands did not get filled, but watching the film crew was interesting. Walked the beach up to Santa Monica Pier for a couple of margaritas and walked the bike path back. Enough time for an early supper at Santino's (awesome) & taxied back to the airport to gather our luggage & catch our red-eye. Great way to spend the layover - interesting sights & sounds - couldn't believe how deep the beach is.",WaukeshaWalkAbouts
40,Exactly what you would expect,"Even if you only have a few hours to spare its still worth a visit. It's exactly what you expect. The board walk is quite long and you can easily take 4 hours to walk up and down while soaking it all up. Sat and had a submarine sandwich at Cafe Venicia which was pretty good, fresh ingredients, good service.",Cheekywena
40,Always interesting,"This is always an interesting place to go visit. Unfortunately there are a lot of homeless people in this area and you never quite know who or what you are going to run into. Not somewhere I would go alone. But, I always enjoy the interesting shops and artists so that is why I go down there.",4LIFE_TRAVELER
50,People watching overload,"Once you get past the souvenir shops, this is one of the best people watching spots in the world. You need to stop and talk the street vendors. They have unique products and unique stories.",Mike H
40,Interesting walk,"I was expecting a tourist area that have a lot of local souvenirs available on this boardwalk, but seems all of the stores are selling the same paintings, same art works which is not as good as i thought. However, they have a lot of different kind of performance along the boardwalk, full band musics, local singers, local artist etc that make the walk very enjoyable. The food selection is not too many along the boardwalk. It was a very pleasant walk.",JoeyKi
50,how fab was that!!,What a great day we had. There were fire eaters body builders an absolute hive of activity and fun.we just spent ages there I didn't want to leave . I would certainly say go there when you visit l..A. loved it,sniknej187437
30,Scary but interesting,"Enjoyed our walk from Santa Monica beach along the boardwalk to Venice beach at sunset, but I would not go it alone!There are some crazy people hanging out there.Lots of beggars, people hassling you for money or wanting you to buy from their stalls or little shops.We saw men urinating in the area and we felt quite unsafe. Lots of dope smoking and drunk crowds.Definitely worth a visit, but go in a crowd and don't take any valuables with you",Lyndylou18
50,Very interesting,"Parking was easy . It's like enjoying two different worlds in one place. Nice peaceful walk on the beach and then local flavor on the boardwalk with a variety of shops and people. Loved it !!!! Did not like the employees of the medical marijuana RX shops trying to get people to come in, but that is just a personal preference . Great little shops with cheap T-Shirts !! Don't forget sunscreen",Sherri1991
50,Worth a stroll,"It was wonderful to stroll around Venice beach on a sunday morning, that`s what California is... You can feel California there! The only bad thing is parking... it takes long time to find a place to park, be patient",Mariana Neme
40,Great people watching,The weather was perfect for strolling down the boardwalk. There was such a variety of shops and vendors (even marijuana doctors) and entertainment along the way. After having a nice lunch at one of the many restaurants we went to lay on the beach; and even though there were plenty of people there - it was really quiet and relaxing in your own little space.,Meema53
40,Step back in time!,"I think if you take Venice Beach for what it is then you will have a great time. We stayed in a small condo minutes from the beach which was very quiet at night. There were homeless people on the beach but not too much of a worry during the day. Great location to visit nearby Hollywood and the Getty Villa and museum. Hired bicycles one day and cycled the cycle lane on the beach. Take a walk along the front and appreciate some of the art work of R. Klonk, bit of the old flower power magic on the beach.",Maureen H
30,Past its best - a bit of a disappointment.,Was looking forward to going there but was quite disappointed. It is quite tacky to say the least and if I had not been pressed for time I would hv e gone back to Santa Monica and walked the pedestrian zone. The beach was nice but the shops were full of tat.,Honisoiquimalypense
40,Different,The most interesting thing about Venice Beach is the cast of characters that inhabit this area. It was also fun to see where many television shows are filmed.,Chessie22
30,Entertaining,If you want to see a melting pot of characters spend a few hours walking down the Boardwalk. There is never a dull moment. Many vendors selling anything you can imagine. It is a tourist attractions with many people performing various acts .On weekends there are a lot of people.,yellowhummingbird
30,Eclectic mix of people and events,Great to visit. Eclectic mix from all walks of life. We watched skateboarders whilst listening to reggae band. Pretty cool,SonS1975
40,One of a kind,One of a kind boardwalk from Santa Monica to Marina del Rey.... You might like or unlike it but for sure it has own remarkable face!,Innochek
30,Busy and unusual,The boardwalk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach is busy and takes about 20 mins to get to the Venice Beach end. There you will find lots of stalls selling local art and many t-shirt shops and some cafes .I was expecting to see many unusual people but on the day we were there I only saw the guy who rollerblades and plays his electric guitar and a guy who raps. Was nothing spectacular to see but it is part of being a tourist and enjoying the ride!!,Vicki J
40,You can literally smell the free spirit!,"Marijuana that is! Wow, quite a place. It feels pretty safe though. As a woman, I felt safe walking there. The place is full of weird people. Lots of artists and it's a good place to buy some original and different gifts. There was a free concert when we went there too. Pretty relaxed atmosphere.",FlorenceK4
40,Not your typical boardwalk but worth seeing.,"Wow. When they say weirdos hang out here they weren't kidding. They try to pedal medical marijuana but they don't harass you or anything. It's grittier than the other beaches but then again, it was cool to watch the surfers too.",CAnn9
30,A unique experience,Great spot for people watching as you will see people of all walks of life! An interesting place to visit for a few hours but I would not stay there. I think they want to shock a bit as part of the attraction. The beach is nice and the long history makes a place you have too see once but I doubt I will return.,Tim S
30,Not quite what I'd expected.,"If I was 20 years younger I would probably think this place is cool.We came here because my son wanted to see the gym. We walked the 2.2 miles from Santa Monica and if I'm honest, it was a nice walk until we reach Venice Beach.I love to see street performers and artists, but to my husband & I, it seemed a place where the homeless accumulated. The homeless don't bother you, the area just had a completely different feel. Anyhow, we ventured on only to find the gym completely empty. Watching the skaters at the skate park was cool...some very talented people...along with the artists & performers etc along the boardwalk too (not actually a boardwalk).However, after a while, I really couldn't stand the smell of weed...I was starting to feel physically sick. I know it is legal there, but it was too much this particular early evening, I'm afraid!Our teenage boys found the area more appealing than us...but I don't think I would be happy for them to walk around here by themselves, especially in the evening / night!",Blue30
30,Not what I expected,"This was my second time to Los Angeles. The first time I missed Venice Beach Board walk and I was a bit disappointed not to see it. Well, you are not missing much.....It looks runned down, fast food restos, a whole different kind of crowd. Not very classy or chic!! That portion of the boardwalk is dirty and far from being chic like Santa Monica!! Muscle Beach was an outdoor old gym....cool but less than expected. What I really like was the basketball courts and watch those players with a lot of good talent. I walked the whole boardwalk from the St. Monica Pier....it was long but once in a lifetime is more than enough!! It's a famous boardwalk and definately overrated! The beach is nice that whole coast, large sandy beaches and clean but the boardwalk on the Venice Beach side and Muscle Beach side needs some renovations and clean up the crowds cause the type of people hanging out on the boardwalk was not so hot!!!",Traveller & Foodie
50,A place to see,"It is something different from the norm and that is what is just great about it. All sorts of people, all sorts of things to find. Went there with my uncle who is from California and he told me before we went that it is the place where the ""wierdos"" go.. hehe, and yeah it was loads of fun. All sorts of interesting and colorful people. And lots of great souvenirs to buy at low prices. Also, the beach is beautiful where you can see the vastness of the pacific ocean. That was what struck me, because home was across that ocean.Now, the bathrooms are not really nice. And the people are whacky and may make you a bit uncomfortable if your not used to it. But, it was a fun place to step out of the comfort zone so to speak.Bottom line, it was whacky, it was interesting, it was fun. Stop by if you can find the parking.",dmitrikylev
40,Venice Beach - what an experience!,We loved walking along the boardwalk at Venice Beach. The oddities of the people and the items that they think of to try and sell are amazing. There is something for everyone. Lots of inexpensive vendors with their wares and many food stalls to choose from.Bathrooms along the beach are kind of scary though!,Berginator
50,Brilliant Array of Colour,"this was a fantastic walk of street artists, sellers, weed doctors !! musicians restaurants beach etc,My favourite part of our road tripcolourful buildings and art on buildings quirky houses and fab people and foodSanta Monica is ace",L66PY
30,A little disappointed,"We went to Venice beach after walking along Santa Monica pier and beach, and in comparison to Santa Monica pier we enjoyed that a lot more. Parking is terrible and expensive. There was heaps and heaps of people there and we watched a cool street performance and the guys where saying really great messages to kids which was super refreshing. We where a bit disappointed with muscle beach but it was still cool. There's all types of people around and the general area is kind of dirty. The shops are cool and the people that work in them are really nice! We are glad we went because it is such a land mark but we where a bit let down.",Julia M
40,"One word ""Interesting"".","Worth a look see, you will see people and things here like no other. Artist selling there goods a very inexpensive prices, just trying to pay their rent. Strange people but harmless. Vendors with good prices and will discount the price if you ask. All the food we ate on the boardway was good. Beach not the best, homeless and so weirdos, but again harmless. Felt safe, lots of people. Makes for an interesting day!",ginawoo6
40,People watching paradise!,"Saw a little of everything at VB. Saw someone steal someone's bag at the basketball courts. Saw all manner of awesome people and some sketchy ones too. Just a fun p,ace to walk and soak in humanity. Parking is tough but if you are willing to walk you can find some spots up from the beach area. I suggest walking from Venice to Santa Monica Pier. Good times!",RenoNVUS
50,Lots of fun!,"Great shopping experience, there are plenty of vendors, talented artists and musicians. Never ending places to eat and drink. The beach is beautiful. There are all kinds of rentals, we enjoyed ourselves there..picked up plenty of gifts for family and friends.",injunchild
50,There's no place like home,"I live 3 blocks from Venice Beach boardwalk. I'm laughing out loud at the HARSH judgemental comments from some people here... and this is exactly why California is so amazing. We have open minded people and we let you be whoever you want to be. It gives the beach character and rawness... Show me an other place where you have beachbums, locals, gang members, tourist, freaks and every other type of human being all enjoy them selves and co-existing.. ONLY at the Venice Beach Boardwalk. There's something for everybody.. There will be things that are not appealing to you so just ignore it and appreciate the beautfui sunny sky, Pacific Ocean and Palm Trees. There's a lot of hardworking and talented local artist there too.. Appreciate their works! Don't be such a prude.California Love!and put a little more effort to find FREE parking. Look around.. It's there..",Aux_1981
40,"Nice to walk through, but only stay for 20mins","This is nice to visit briefly to experience it, but as others have mentioned it is mostly just people trying to sell you stuff and the same shops selling the same tat. There are lots of 'artists' selling paintings which are literally awful, they are just trying to make a fast buck. I recommend a visit if you're in the area, just keep it short and sweet.",ABristol82
50,People are strange.....,"This place was exactly what I wanted it to be. Local artist, shops, craziness.... What a truly tremendous experience.....PS....if you do not like or want to be around POT smoking....maybe this is not the place for you",Michael A
30,Famous but not fancy,"I expected something more like South Beach in Miami but this beach and boardwalk is decidedly average. The boardwalk is lined with trashy (sunglass, t-shirt, medical mariuana) storefronts and the restaurants offer standard hot dogs, fries, and such. Muscle Beach is entertaining but nothing special (it's an outdoor gym after all!). Lots of people with dogs, skating and strollers so people-watching was interesting. The beach itself is expansive with volleyball and other activities. I actually enjoyed walking along the town canals inland a few blocks to see the lovely homes lining the waterways more than the boardwalk. Park on the street a few blocks away to avoid the $5 - 25 fees charged on surface lots if you can.",CleopatraBunny
40,Unlike anywhere else,"My husband and I decided to check out Venice Beach after being a little underwhelmed by Santa Monica Beach. Parking was a little hard to find but it wasn't the worst. We ended up finding a parking lot a block away that was 12$. The Boardwalk was really worth checking out, the vibe was really unique. It almost felt like Bourbon street in New Orleans minus all the drunks. It really gave a taste for the eclectic, artsy energy that I was hoping to find in LA. The stores and stalls had typical cheesy touristy stuff, but that just added to the carnival-like atmosphere.I really think that this is a tourist attraction worth checking out when in LA, walking down this boardwalk is a unique experience.",Missfree_asabird
50,Tons of people,"A great day I had here I love to people watc, I love the beach, I love people who street dance and you can watch people dancing and you can go to muscle beach and watch people work-out, they have tons of shops and food places. Its a must I cant wait to go back.",Tasha M
20,Panhandling freak beach,Not kid friendly and not worth the $15 to park. Wanted to do it since our first trip to so cal. Muscle beach is not all that impressive a few guys working out on the beach. Dirty and sleazy walkway. Lots of homeless and panhandling. Shops are dated and dirty would not advise taking kids there. People smoking pot and medical marriajuna shops. Some food out there but I wouldn't eat out there. Beach up the road ok. Save your money and time and go to laguana beach to see a beach right out of a postcard. This place might have been nice in the 1950's but its has went way downhill now. Didn't see any public restrooms except for beach restrooms that horrible and disgusting.,sandmandallas
20,Awful,"Hated it, so crowded for no reason. Not a pretty beach, lots of bums and panhandling. Muscle beach is not great, have to pay to actually work out there. I would never go back.",Michael H
30,Interesting once but dirty - $15 to park,"It's nice to have been there and see the weird people on the sidewalk (no 'board' walk), sometimes shows but overall it is very dirty and not much choice to eat well on the main part.We saw a sign to park for $15, upon entering they said $20 so we got out and went next door for $15. The minute we parked the guy changed his sign for $20!!! He charged us only $15 and it was until 4pm (we arrived at 1pm). So be careful if you come by car, it looks like they all have different/changing rules.",TravelingCat22
50,"The ""other"" Los Angeles","The Venice Beach Boardwalk is not a boardwalk but a concrete path/walkway that separates the sand from the land. The walkway is always crowded and lined with a variety of shops and restaurants that cater to locals and visitors alike. Stop and watch one of the street performers or street artists...walk by the basketball courts and watch some non-NBA talent...or gawk at the biceps, triceps, abs etc. of the bodybuilders at ""Muscle Beach"". Most seaside communities have their local attractions, but no city in the country has as unique a place as the Venice Beach Boardwalk!",Travelwherever
40,An eclectic mix,"Spent an enjoyable morning down here. if you are not open minded or you are very judgmental then this is not the place for you. We actually enjoyed our time here more than time spent in Santa Monica itself. Lots of interesting people hanging around, street entertainment and items for sale. We did not feel threatened or unsafe in any way but it was in the morning. Great backdrop of the beach and palm trees. Parking lot at Santa Monica end (off Ocean Park) £10 for the day. Loads of places to hire bikes/roller blades - great bike path which goes for miles.",Jan179
20,Yuk...didn't live up to the hype,"We cruised in to Venice beach from Santa Monica, found a paying park with some 'custodians' that looked pretty 'dodgy' however others were parking there and it was cheap ($10) so we parked and paid. After all of the hype and years of TV programming showing Venice Beach/Muscle Beach etc as the 'in' place to hang out I was looking forward to seeing it for myself. OMG - what a shock to the system...We walked down to the boardwalk and were immediately assailed by the smell of dope in the air and by the presence of literally hundreds of homeless people still sleeping on their cardboard and sleeping bags on the lawn between boardwalk and beach from the night before... I hope they were homeless and not DEAD because a few of them looked deceased, they were out of it!I felt a bit sorry for the few legit stall holders trying to make a tourist buck around the place - at least they were awake and co-existing with the environment.The sidewalk shops were cheap and nasty, I think the 'legal' marijuana shops were probably the most prolific of stalls and boardwalk shops we saw. It is probably still a novelty to some people to have it legalised and readily available(and if it's medicinal and helping who am I to judge? >>> and I'm not) but all I saw were dregs hanging around stoned looking like they needed a good scrubbing wash or a waterblast!We strolled the boardwalk down towards Muscle Beach and I had to laugh at the 'gym' There were none of the toned bronzed gods that you see on the TV shows working out on the day I was there. There was one old guy who was quite amazing for his age but he'd been out in the sun so long he had turned to leather and when he put his arms up you could see the 'real' color of his skin... it was scary to watch!!!! He looked like he was enjoying himself though, so good on him!The street artists were varied...some were very good however the majority were tacky and try-hards, and if someone paid them for some of the stuff they were peddling then they needed their heads read.Make sure you go to the bathroom before you visit as well because I needed to go and when I found the restrooms suddenly the urge left me.... bleeeeuuuuuch is all I can say!There was a high police presence in the vicinity and they were stopping locals and interacting with people on a regular basis.Maybe I visited on the wrong day? Maybe it rocks on the weekend? I missed the thrill I had been expecting and unfortunately because of my experience I won't be going back. I was pleased to leave and even happier when I got back to the car to find it sitting all by itself in the parking lot... but it was complete and for that I felt very grateful!",Kerry C
40,Get Ready!,"This is one of the most popular attractions in Southern California. Part of that is because it is free (although parking can be quite expensive - like $25). But you will see a pretty good selection of characters here. If you are lucky you will see The World's Greatest Wino (no I'm not making this up) or the guy with the turban who plays the guitar while on his rollerblades (as seen is in the movie White Men Can't Jump). Or have your picture taken with some aliens (not sure if the alien guy is still there). But you are sure too see something interesting which will make you smile.There is also a variety of inexpensive food here like pizza or sausage (Jody Maroni's) There are also plenty of coffee places here. The Sidewalk Cafe is one of the more popular eating spots here.Everyone should come here at least once. After that, if you are looking for a nicer (or safer) beach try Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica or Malibu for a more upscale experience",JohnB00007
30,"""Different""","This is a place like no other. If you live a quiet life in suburbia or the country, it will definitely be something you most likely have never experienced. Went twice...both times, immediately upon arrival, we saw someone being arrested. No arguing, just willing walking along with the police. There is a huge homeless presence-and a huge police presence, but no begging or bugging you going on at all. Here's the thing...if you are ok with your kids being exposed to a very different cultural experience, you should go. We didn't meet one rude person. Lots of stores, Medical Marijuana Dispensaries (it's legal there, folks), many homeless artists with amazing talent who sell their crafts at very low cost--we had a charcoal drawing done of our kids and the guy charged us $3.00! It was amazing-looked just like them. Of course we gave him extra. People building mermaids and sea creatures out of sand-henna artists, a guy that paints on broken skate boards brought to him by the kids at the beachfront skate park a few steps away ( he gives them a few bucks for the boards and everyone is happy)--one homeless fellow quietly walked with head down to a grand piano and played the most beautiful piece of music I've heard. There is usually a bucket with a sign that says something to the effect of if you take a picture give us a couple of bucks, please. Be warned, bathrooms are scarce, and really nasty. Don't bring your baby and expect a place to change them. Felt it got a little dicey down by Muscle Beach and the basketball courts. Didn't feel as secure there as I did further up the boardwalk. I'm definitely going back next time I'm in LA. I love the unique things you can find there--and the vibe is very chill and friendly. Word of warning--if someone tries to hand you a CD say no thanks and keep walking. You take it and you are in for the hard sell. There will be many people sleeping in the sand or on the sidewalks etc...talk to the kids before going.",nina0912
40,"A bit dingy, but fantastic people watching and something always happens","They have cleaned up the boardwalk quite a bit in the past few months and have higher level of police presence, but its a great place to find something to eat next to the beach and the street artists peddle their art that ranges from amazing to pathetic.If you find yourself in Venice, take a walk and you'll always find something you didn't expect, see someone interesting or even become part of a street performance with gymnasts that can leap over 6 feet high while doing back flips.Always different and always oddly charming, another facet of kitsch fun in LA.",The_Roaming_Raven

50,Like No Other,"This boardwalk is always an amazing and unique place. Every trip here we notice something we haven't seen before. You will see everything from people selling art of all kinds, medical marijuana places, street performers and freak shows. The key here is coming with an open mind. You will see people that are different from any other place you might be from. Piercings, tattoos, muscles...it's all here. If you like people watching, this is literally the most prime spot for it. It's a great walk from Santa Monica to venice along the boardwalk. Another cool thing about the boardwalk is looking at all of the interesting houses and apartments along the boardwalk. Often times you will see people hanging out on their balconies or roof doing some people watching themselves. Make sure to bring your camera for pictures and some cash to buy some unique art. Love this place.",HanKelly
30,"Freaks, shops, beach, homeless people, blaggers","We were staying in San Monica just up the road so thought we might as well visit this place as we’re here. I love to people watch so I was in my element watching the world go by and seeing what Venice beach is and that’s interesting! There are loads of places to eat down there and drink and watch the skate boarders go by. The place is full of interesting people, so many artists down there selling their goods, some bad, some good, take your pick. Homeless people are around but tend not to bother you. Plenty of stalls to buy clothes, basket ball courts/tennis courts nearby as well as the famous muscle beach! The beach itself is huge just like you see on the Baywatch programme. Worth a visit with parking nearby for $10 a day.",Fonseca-Denning
30,"Interesting, but maybe you have to be younger","I've heard a lot about Venice Beach and the boardwalk, so we came to spend a part of a day here. Parked right at the beach parking lot for $15. There are some freaky and weird people, skateboarders, many homeless. Some interesting things for sale, and some people playing music. But all in all, maybe this appeals to you if you are 20, but I thought it was kind of a yawn..next time we'll ride bikes on the path or just spend it on the beach (the beach looks nice and wide here). There are signs on the boardwalk that say no dogs on weekends..Of course, people don't listen to the signs and it was very crowded (it was july 6)",Sue T

30,A bit different,"While we were visiting Santa Monica, we decided to continue down the boardwalk to Venice. While the beach itself is beautiful, the boardwalk is much less desirable. It is lined with solicitors and ""street artists"". There are also medical marijauna shops scattered throughout the boardwalk, which leads to a strong smell of marijuana on the boardwalk. It's one of those places to check off the list as having been there, but have no desire to ever return.",KentuckyOnthego

30,"Grubby, but a must do when in LA","Lots of activity always on Venice Beach from DJ's, music, basketball, gym, roller-blading, shopping or skating, there's always something happening.The overall feel is pretty seedy and you don't need to spend to long to soak up the vibe, buy a T-shirt and move on.The homelessness is very 'in your face' if you aren't used to this and the pan handlers will try and sell you anything. Shop around!",Amanda C
30,Freaky Deaky!,"Had to go and see the famous ""Venice Beach"" Started having Flashbacks to the 60's. Lot of ""Characters"". Definitely out of the ordinary. Lots of homeless trying to sell stuff, basically harmless. Had a ""Green Dr."" on every corner offering Cannabis Prescriptions. Tatto Parlors, T-shirts etc, Not a lot of interesting curio shops which I was expecting. Fun to see once. Still were playing the Grateful Dead at one shop.",dinerdon
30,Life is a beach.,"The beach in this case Venice Beach encompasses the good, the bad, and occasionally the ugly things in life. Street performers most were very good, some were not. Sidewalk vendors, do some shopping because prices do vary. Street people, looking through garbage cans for their next meal, really sad. I was not directly asked for money, but don't be surprised if you are approached. Pot is legal in California and there were several places where you could get a ""prescription"". I had two 15 year old boys with me and they loved the place. It was really an eye opener for them both. Food was good, we sat in the outdoor patio area of a café and were entertained through the meal by the street performers. Loved watching the world pass by.",RonaldF716
30,It is what it is,"Mixed bag, ton of homeless people and beggars, but also a fair amount of street performers and odds and ends vendors. Would I say it is a must see? No not as much as it use to be but I love playing basketball here on the once famous courts. The skatepark is nice, but if you arent looking for an honest side of LA and you want the ""beautiful people"" as said in other reviews, go too Santa Monica.Ps. i also feel bad that people refer to all the people here as not beautiful people, they are still people.",Ryan F
10,Cesspit Of Filth,"Venice Beach Boardwalk is promoted as an attraction where you can go to see the ""alternative and counter culture vibe of Los Angeles"".Well unfortunately the ""vibe"" did not impress me at all because all I found was a motley collection of losers, bludgers, drug addicts, beggars, freaks and all the other scum society turns up.The whole area is dirty and run down and don't even bother going to the public toilets or try to use a public seat as they have been effectively taken over by the tramps and other filth which live here.The best thing for this area would be a tsunami to clean it out so the decent people of Los Angeles can create something to be proud instead of the disgusting pile of filth they currently have.",Mozzroom
20,Did Not Feel Comfortable,"Came here to see the sunset, Paid four dollars to park. Lots of seedy people here doing very strange things. Lots of homeless and beggars, more than back home. Being from New York City,we did not feel unsafe, just uncomfortable. We saw the sunset and watched the many surfers hit the waves and left. Save the stress, go to another beautiful beach in Cali to see the sunset.",WeLoveTraveling23
50,Everything you expect and more,"I had never been to the West coast of the USA before but went on a trip to Santa Monica. It was an amazing day so walked all the way down Venice beach and it's amazing. There are so many talented and incredible artists that you an buy one of works from for extremely cheap without them being pushy and annoying like in other markets. Defiantly worth going to see, you could spend hors there.",Sambo20389
20,Disgusting,"We'd heard for a long time that the VBB was the place to go for ""people-watching"". Sure, if the people you want to watch are drug addicts, homeless, and various other types of beggars. Very dirty area with almost none of the charm it was supposed to have. Unless you would enjoy seeing a piece of street trash put an emergency warming blanket over her head and run blindly down the boardwalk, screaming and laughing, while her girlfriend spent several minutes trying to kick a pigeon. Don't waste your time here, California has so much more beautiful coast to see.",CharlieGoose
50,Walk and See Everything and Everyone,"One can stroll from Venice Beach to all the other beach areas, like Malibu. Do head inland to see the cute wee Venice Beach roads with small but pricey beach houses. Good prices along the boardwalk, and great wierd displays by fringe groups",JaneSpotting
50,One of the strangest places you will ever see,"I didn't know what to expect from the famous Venice beach Boardwalk. It's a really strange place with lots of strange people doing various shows, selling the strangest things you will ever see.A good chance to buy great souvenirs.Most of the boardwalk is fun but you will see lots of homeless people here. You will see the famous muscle beach gym where Arnie used to train, a skateboard area with lots of cool skateboarders showing off and the beach is which is massive and beautiful.Despite the lots of homeless people we felt safe on this beach. There are lots of places to eat for quite reasonable prices. Lots of parking spaces. (costs $6-10 per day)I definitely recommend visiting Venice Beach when in LA.",cestovatel25
20,"Where are the ""Beautiful People"" ?","Ok it was a holiday weekend so perhaps its different at other times but the boardwalk was a tacky ""alternative"" beach resort. For the Europeans reading this its more like Benidrom than Ibiza.Apart from the skate park everything else seemed like a pastiche of the alternative california lifestyle and clearly the place is living off its past reputation. Having walked past the famous Muscle Beach we were so underwhelmed we asked a passing cop if that was it. His quote summed up the place perfectly ""Disappointing isnt it, Thats Venice Beach for ya"". I have also never seen so much crap art and crafts for sale in one location in my life.",foleytrip
50,Venice Beach !!!,I come to Venice Beach to enjoy the scenery. And to buy some of the coolest stuff they sell there. I love the Shea butter and bath salts they smell so good.And don't forget the kettle corn. That's one if my favorites and the $5.00 henna tattoos. And there's always something happening at Venice Beach !!,nivz27
40,The great divide,"Fascinating but very sad. I can't believe that one of the most developed countries in the world has so many homeless people - right alongside the very wealthy. Visited there after visiting many much poorer countries in South and Central America where you don't see homeless, metally ill and drug addictied people everywhere. People who live outside the US, be prepared for a shock lesson in how this country looks after its own citizens - then calls the consequencess of their economic system ""lifestyle choices"".",debraanne87
50,must go,"this beach is the place to go, its strange but beautiful, lots to see, ppl watching is the best part, and the water, the waves are soo clean. Will not be bored. Skateboarding park to see or even join, beautiful people, mellow, and happy. I had never gone there and it turned out to be the best beach in california that i have been to. oh ...parking at the main site is 6 dollars but other paid parking withing the blocks around is only 5 dollars...you may also find street parking if willing to walk 5-6 blocks.",MEXICANRICHBOY

40,"Venice Beach - A little strange, a lot of fun","A definite must do for a visitor to LA. It was our first trip and we found the array of street performers, old hippies, and small shops along the walk to be unique. We particularly enjoyed our lunch and craft beer at the Venice Ale House where Rose Ave. meets the beach. Spend a few minutes watching the body builders work out at Muscle Beach. Nearby you’ll find the graffiti wall. Try to give yourself enough time to wonder away from the Beach and stroll through the eclectic Abbot Kinney Blvd. Business District and the charming Venice Canals neighborhood.",davecm329

50,"The World Epicenter of all things weird, wild and wacky.","I can't overemphasize the attraction of this almost magical place. It is like a miles-long carnival midway for adults. There is so much to do and see that it is easy to forget you are at a beach and the beach is absolutely beautiful! You will have flashbacks of almost every tv show that was ever filmed in California. The beach body-builders and bikini-clad ladies on rollerblades? Yup, all of those scenes were filmed here. When you get a bit tired or hot, there are a myriad of places to grab a great snack and a cold beer. From the juggler on the ten foot high unicycle riding up and down, and the guy walking on broken glass to the geek shows and even a 'Medicinal Marijuana' clinic with a sign out front that says ""The Doctor is IN."" I can only say, if you travel all the way to L.A. for a holiday and don't visit Venice Beach, I promise you will either regret it or you are the type that should just stay home ala the one-star review on here from the person who thinks everyone and everything is dirty....stay home and have a hot tub, the world is not for you!",Ken H
40,good place to people watch,"We walked up and down the Venice Beach Boardwalk. There are several shops (most contain exact merchandise). Some shop workers were more pushy than others, but none were just terrible. We paid $6 to park right next to the boardwalk which was well worth it. There are a lot of street vendors and they were not pushy at all. We talked with a few of them and they were very kind. There were a couple of men trying to hand out their music cds. They were a bit pushy even after being told no thank you. We saw many people from many walks of life which made for an interesting day. The beach looked to be nice, however we didn't actually go onto it.",jesslynn064
30,Family vacation,"If you want to see the hazy and crazy, then visit Venice Beach. It's about 15 mins by Big Blue Bus (BBB) from Santa Monica Pier. Here you'll see different characters and hear plenty of music. Dog wearing sunglasses, roller blading/guitar playing hippies etc. It's great during the day - a real eye opening but I'd probably stay away during the night though? Worth a look.",quinnd69
50,See whats LA all about,"Off the somewhat trashy (yet loads of fun) boardwalk, lies one of the most beautiful beaches in Southern California.

40,Loved Venice Beach!,I got my first tatoo from Venice Tatoos. Very professional and knowledgeable. I loved shopping in the stores and the outdoor entertainment was fun as well. The beach party was fantastic complete with people playing congos and dancing away. Magical time.,MizScorpio
30,An interesting show of Freaks and grungy shops,"If for no other reason, you have ot walk the Venice Beach Boardwalk to people watch. I wouldn't really eat anything there or buy anything of great value but an awesome place to people watch. I think everyone should do Venice Beach Boardwalk.",kpattison
40,spring treat,"After visiting the cold grey beaches in Connecticut, beaches in California are spring treat.The visit to Venice beach and beach board walk this weekend was a soulful experience. The place has little something for everyone.After a good swim in the crystal clear water and some sunbathing in the soft blond beach, a leisurely walk at the Venice beach board walk is recommended. I am not sure if the beach is this active during the weekdays, but be sure to be awed by the diversity of shops, displays, food and culture. I love to visit places which reflect some part of the culture and this place really did give a sense of the variety of people and their energy. Young bands playing and selling their homemade CDs, counters set for jokes for a dollar, answer to any question for a dollar, handwriting analysis booth, henna parlors, glass walkers and tarot card readers and psychics are some of the highlights.Street vendors are definitely one of the charms but the sight of visitors lazing in bars, sipping on their beers, gossiping while catching the sun is equally charming.And if that is not enough done in a day, you can walk into Venice's own Freak Show for five dollars or hire bikes for a speed tour. For the variety you get to see, I wouldn't mind going to this place again.",anupama a
50,Unique Experience (like being in Berkeley in the 60's!),"We try to spend a day at the beach every visit to Southern California and this year we chose to visit the Boardwalk at Venice Beach...when the weather is nice this beach has everything you could ask for; great little restaurants, lots of shops, street vendors with EVERY kind of art for sale imagineable (and then some!).The highlight of this location though has to be the people themselves! I can't imagine a more eclectic group anywhere in the world, from the impromptu bands playing for travel money to get back home to Boston (young but good!) to the stilt walkers and glass walkers this place is a must for people watching! Have lunch on the patios of one of several really good eateries and then just stroll the strand!",karpurkia
40,Organized Chaos,After visiting Manhattan Beach I wanted to check out Venice. Hippies and meatheads alike were running rampant. This place has some very fun shops and little tokens of every type of culture but it is definitely not for the faint of mind. People will try to sell you something at every corner but it is definitely a place you need to check out before leaving California.,Lauren K
10,Skip the Venice Beach Boardwalk,"I'm normally open minded, love a good flea market and bargain, love street vendors... But wow.... I'm speechless... This place was so dirty! I guess if you are wearing a full haz mat suit you may enjoy the strange characters you would encounter. I was just very impressed and not in a good way. In one block we smelled pot, vomit, diarrhea, and a hodgepodge of b.o. There was seagull and pigeon poop on everything. It was actually impressive. I think putting your gum on the sidewalk was a right of passage. And there were tattoo parlors per block than there are letters in Hepatitis C. Go to the Santa Monica Pier instead! Trust me!! You'll thank me later!",Tiffany F
20,Very interesting.,Not the greatest impression of Southern California.... it was a little overwhelming but the ocean was beautiful. Probably wouldn't bring the kids but it was an interesting adventure down the boardwalk.,Casey S
50,"Quirky, stimulating and crazy!","A visit to LA is not complete without a stroll down Venice beach boardwalk. Full of characters from the guys selling ""herbal remedies"" with plenty of banter or the ripped dudes posing on muscle beach.

Go with an open mind and enjoy!",beachbabe75

50,Great people watching,Love this 1 mile boardwalk. Different than any other beach in the world. The street performers and small handicrafts sales people are one of a kind. Amazing pictures from this day. Loads of famous movies filmed here which was cool for a tourist like me.,Mrvernon
50,Authentic Southern California,"Come here for an Authentic Southern California experience.

50,See it all....,"I loved walking around Venice Beach. It is a colourful and quirky place that kept us on our toes! It was the first thing we did when we got to LA as we were staying near by.... we went twice during our visit and each time we enjoyed soaking it all in. It is definitely worth taking a stroll (or renting roller blades and roller blading down from Santa Monica Pier). There are many places to stop (shops, cafes, market stalls) and have a look around and take in the unique atmosphere.",Simone S
50,Words can't describe this beach/boardwalk,"It's a trip! It's not like any other boardwalk I've seen. You see so many different ""options""Great people watching!",wmuser
30,Don't mind the freaks and hobos,"There are plenty of freaks, hobos and vendors around here. Some of them might seem annoying from the start but don't mind about them. The boardwalk has good selection of cafe's, restaurants and shops. On the other hand this is nice but they are expensive due they are targeted towards tourists. The genuine venice beach from 70's has turned into tourist trap where hobo vendors compete their living space with tourists.",SirRahikkala
30,interesting skate park otherwise overrated,"We visited Venice Beach and Boardwalk on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't that crowded for a ""famous attraction."" Guys hawking their homemade CD's were a nuisance if not somewhat disturbing. The shops weren't all that different and there were plenty of ""bob marley-looking, tie-dye, hippie-cliche' clothes"" available. Medical centers for pot prescriptions were close by but I did not see anyone smoking it. The skate park was really interesting as there were some talented and fearless skaters in there doing their thing. Plenty of homeless laying around to add to the scene.",reeel-deezinuh
40,"Freaks, tats, suds and cotton candy","A must-see for out-of-towners and a place to return with friends. It is a unique scene with the muscle boys, young people that are spiked, tatted, pierced, dyed, torn and bleached. Very good bars. Come for brunch and stay to watch the green flash at sunset.",Blake48
50,There is something for everyone,"I enjoyed walking along the boardwalk on a sunny December afternoon.There is so much going over here.You can literally find anything and everything over here.I witnessed the filming of a freak show,which was rather interesting.I also got a henna tattoo,bought a painting and walked by the beach.There is so much color,life,art,activity going on over here.I enjoyed Venice Beach and hope to go back some day.",Travel_LuvBug138

10,Not a family place!!!,"It's become such a sad and ugly display of humanity. I just can't handle seeing drugged out parents who have kids out there with them. Wow. If this kind of thing doesn't phase you, then you won't be bothered as much as I was today. I regret taking my 9 yr old.",Whamgirl
10,Stay Away!,My daughter and I went to Venice beach to watch the sunset while we're were staying in Beverly Hills. Someone told us that we have to go just to sit and watch the strange people. There was no way i was sitting down on anything at this beach. This has to be the most disgusting place I have ever been and I live near DC and there are some pretty nasty places near there. We parked near the boardwalk. The boardwalk is full of gross vendors trying to get you to buy something. One guy kept trying to put headphones on us so we could hear his music. We walked down to the water and that was the cleanest thing around. It was actually beautiful. My daughter went to the restroom on the boardwalk and said she has never seen anything so dirty. We were very disappointed and left way before the sunset. Went back to our hotels and took showers! We did drive the coast of Malibu and it seemed much nicer.,lorims
40,A must see if you come to LA,"Venice Boardwalk is quite a place to see, you find everything there, but is a lot of fun. Cool things to buy, enjoy all kinds of different people or just have a beer at one of the places next to the beach. Don't miss it if you come to LA.",Dimar94
20,Take a Quick Peak and Move North to Santa Monica,"I'm not sure why this place is rated as high as it is. It is overcrowded and filled with the bizarre. Maybe it's like passing that car wreck and slowing down to see just how bad it was. Consider this the car wreck. If you want to avoid it just head north to beautiful Santa Monica, but if you're thinking I'm in the traffic already I might as well get a glimpse of the wreck then make a quick stop here. I guess there is value to people watching but if you're with kids you may want to shield their eyes and ears. They have numerous street performers on the boardwalk. I saw two. Both basically did one trick and still performed for 15-20 minutes, much of it making sure you give them money. I'm thinking they must get permits from Venice to perform. If they seem freaky and crude with a weird talent they go to Venice Boardwalk, if they seem affable with a standard talent they go to Santa Monica Pier. What I didn't like about the street performers were the constant dropping of ""F"" bombs and crude direct sexual references with so many kids and parents in the viewing area. One even went so far as to ridicule the looks of a 7 year old girl, then had the audacity at the end of the show to apologize but say it is all for humor. Yes, when your show is all adults. If you see the idiot that juggles while standing on a ladder just keep walking- preferably back to your car.",AtomicReviewer
10,You really don't want to do this...,"If you like freaks, watching the homeless, crowds, a circus atmosphere, people who want to make a buck doing anything and the city allowing them to, then this might be the place for you. I would never bring children here even in the daytime. I don't understand why people think this is so great. It reminded me of a cheap carnival where there was a stand with a guy yelling ""come in and see the 3 legged lady"". (Actually they have that there). But, the crowds were amazing and it worries me that so many people flock there to see this stuff. I'd rather sit on the beach somewhere else and watch the surfers or sip a glass of wine and watch the sunset. But... I guess... some people like this stuff...I'd hang on to my wallet, my kids, and wash real good when I get home.! P.S. As I was bicycling through the boardwalk on my way to Santa Monica I heard a guy tell his wife (who had their kids in tow)... Honey don't worry... keep peddling it'll just be a little longer and we'll be out of here. There you go!",Fussyeater2010
40,Freaky but Fun,You probably won't walk many places in the world with as much pizazz and eye catching people to watch. A lot of carryovers from the 60-70's who never grew up and conformed to society. From the man who jumps on broken glass to the Jimi Hendrix wannabe on roller blades to the dudes who jump over four members of the audience prepare to get an eyefull,caml77
50,Out of the ordinary for me,"The boardwalk and the Venice Beach area were an unusual treat. I live sort of a quiet retired life in Clearwater, FL. I knew that Venice Beach was an eclectic area and so I was ready for it. I was with a friend who used to live in LA, but it was my first trip. I wandered through a lot of the ""t-shirt"" and ""junk"" stores, which I actually enjoy. I very seldom buy anything, but I find it to be a pleasant way to pass some time.A lot of very interesting people-watching also. And, I got to see my first medical marijuana store there. People exercising on the beach. Just a really nice half-day. If I were back in LA I'd probably go again. It was one of many unique experiences for me in the LA area.",paradiseguy
50,People watchers paradise,"The never-ending parade of strange, interesting, fun people and their activities and crafts, never fails to entertain. The restaurant at the center of the Boardwalk is one of the best of its kind for food, ambiance and service. Parking, well...",Artsy12

20,Not impressed,This was on my bucket list if you can have one at my age :-) I'm in the 25-35 range. I did it. Walked the boardwalk. Saw one store I would have purchased clothing from but the pant sizes were too big for me hey not complaining about that I like being at a healthy fit weight. I digress. Lets just say wasn't impressed no desire to return.Whether or not there is a fee depends on if you pay for parking. There is pay to park at the location.,Warrior44
40,"Safe enough mid-day, but sketchier starting in the late afternoon","Carnival atmosphere, street lined with tat shops, cheap sunglasses, head shops, medical pot doctor's storefronts. Most unusual was the graffiti walls which are painted clean for the creative taggers to do their thang with crowds passing by. Nice skate park. Head for taverns either by Rose St. or Washington rather than sub-par, overcrowded ones in between. By 5 pm Sunday, the parking lot was full, and the crowd was less and less family/tourist friendly. FYI, BYO TP when using public outhouses, actually some flushed, but many did not. Regardless, lines abounded due to crowds, not unlike a Jimmy Buffett concert.",wavefanz
30,Great people watching!,"We love to take our midwest relatives - especially the teenagers and young adults. It never fails for great enjoyment and people watching. Our relatives always enjoy it. The beauty is if you're tired of the ""crowd"", just go down to the wonderful beach.",Tammyk63
10,Disgusting,Not a good place to take your family. Very dirty and full of bums and gang bangers. I wanted to see the history behing Arnold and pumping iron but i am truely disappointed. If you want to part and buy weed your in. If your site seeing with your family pass this one up. Not a good place.,JeremyGerres
50,Great fun!,Wife and I had fun watching the people and the vendors. Went on Sunday to see the drum circle.. Now I know where all the hippies are. There were 20+ drummers and a few wild dancers.. It was all great fun. Parking can be high$10 to $15 dollars depending on the time. This is a must see event.,chute_mike
50,Fantastic people watching,"Venice Beach is the ultimate people watching location. There are all types, shapes and colors of people doing a variety of things. You'll see body builders, volleyball and basketball players, singers, dog walkers, bicyclists, and many other things. Take time to look at the various vendors and pet the world's laziest dog. There's lots of places to buy a bite to eat or something to drink. And when you get tired, just sit on the gorgeous beach and watch the ocean. Be sure to take cash for parking, which will run from $5 to $10 depending on the day of the week (more expensive on the weekends). Be prepared to be approached by people selling various things (mostly CD's). Just say ""no"" if you're not interested. Take you camera and your sense of humor and have a ton of fun!",Chris M
50,A must see to belive,"Make sure you park your car in a safe place. Two blocks inland is a jungle. This board walk and lots of arts and crafts and freaks, yes the people are the show. if you are not from Ca. this will knock your socks off. don't be afraid the security is top notch. have a great time and I promise you wil go back again and again.",Stephen K

10,Horrible. Felt very unsafe,"My partner and I visited the boardwalk on a rainy day as we were on a tour bus with a designated stop there. Cannot comment on what it is like on a sunny day with more tourists around, but I WILL NOT be going back to give it a second chance. There was nothing of value to look at (unless you enjoy cheap T-shirts and drug paraphernalia) and it was riddled with homeless people and degenerates who kept offering to sell us drugs! Definitely not worth the visit and I'd encourage people to stay away.",Danielle P

10,Trash!,"I'm telling you... this is a horrible place. I'm not just advising families to stay away but everyone, unless that is.. you're a ""pot head"" covered in tattoos, piercings or just plain want to be one of those people that give you that ""shock"" value when you see them (you know the ones starved for attention). I have been here more than once in my life each time with someone who had not experienced it & wanted to see the famous Venice Beach Boardwalk. They as well as I have sworn not to return to such a filthy nasty place. Just trust me don't go!",richy_roo75
30,stay away at night,"I visited at sunset because I wanted to get some pictures from the beach. Almost everything was already closed, with the exception of places with signs including the word physician and pot leaves. One of them actually had a solicitor out front trying to talk people into getting a medical license. Extremely tacky, I would say. The area was not well lit, and I felt uncomfortable being there. If I'd had the time, though, I would have given it another shot during the day.Some of the closed shops did look nteresting.",A C

It's like a live circus and is visited by people from all over the globe. You'll find street artists, skateboarders, gypsy tellers, cheap beach wares, carni food, and maybe even the Jimi Hendrick's like guy on roller skates playing an electric guitar! mixed in with a gangster or two!",loisloves
30,Fun for people watching,"The boardwalk at Venice Beach is nice to stroll along. There are little shops along the east side of it, and of course, the ocean is on the west side. People will whiz by you on roller blades and bikes, and you may see a few people working out in the iconic Muscle Beach area. Quirky and interesting, this part of Venice is laid back and fun to visit. You may even see some street performers along the boardwalk trying to earn some tips for their talents. Bring your camera!",CleverCat
30,Hard to beat for people watching but little else,"If you love watching the strange, the crazy and the attention grabbers there are few better than the Venice Beach sidewalk. But there's little else to see or experience. The entire area has seen much better times as most of the storefronts look dilapidated and house only the very worse of tacky souvenir shops, hole-in-the wall snack shops and a surprisingly large number of outlets offering medical marijuana certificates for just $40. L.A. has much more to offer in it's other neighbourhoods. Come for a quick stroll but then move on.",John B
50,Wow! that's a beach!,"If you want to know what a real beach is, come here and enjoy with the beautiful boradwalk. The sea is very far away from the boardwalk, so, if you chose to swimming, think twice before!",Angelina W
40,nice view!,"I enjoyed very much watching the diverse street artists and performers, we ate some fresh fruit and took a long and relaxed walk. A good plan for a relaxing afternoon.",Camila M
40,Fun way to spend an afternoon,Enjoyed watching the street performers. Great music. Good vibe. Fun souvenirs for sale. I think it could be even more fun with a group a people to play on the volleyball courts. Muscle beach is cool too.,mewolfe
50,Living up to its reputation,"Just loved it.... such a diverse collection of street artists, booths with new age remedies, ethnic prctices and divination of all descriptions, musicians etc in a completely non-threatening environment (just like my home town, but with a long golden beach and sunshine.) Muscle beach was fun. Tacky ""art"" and Good humour, very interesting and well-groomed dogs, less interesting and well-groomed habituees. Amazing views, low flying pelicans.Avoid the shops and ignore skateboarders..I didn't hire a tricycle this time, but it looked like a great way to get up to Santa Monica pier and back. It's also a great walk.",Clayton37

20,Hubby soooooo disappointed!!,My first visit to Venice Beach was 15 years ago and it was good fun so I took my husband on a return trip last October. Thank goodness we didn't stay there - he would not have been impressed. It was quite seedy and the best part was watching four blokes (two old and two younger) playing paddle tennis! It was only when driving back from Marina del Rey to Santa Monica that we saw how nice the main street appeared - should have spent our time there instead!,condenastbabe
30,great for people watching but a bit seedy,"I had to see what all the hype was about. While it was great forPeople watching, it is dirty, many homeless people, pushy musicians in your face constantly. Saw eight people waiting or a doctor to give them a medical marijuana certificate. From the smell, I don't think the majority of people there care if they have a certificate or not.So close to the Santa Monica peer but worlds apart.Go once just to look around",eddie s
10,Not for kids,"It's being a long time since my last visit, now I remember why. This place is getting worse and I ask parents to be smarter and DO NOT COME WITH YOUR KIDS! ""Clinical marijuana"" is everywhere there so unless you want to explain your kids what this is all about, stay away. There are so many things to say and nothing good about it so I'll leave it at that.",TheFoodTraveler
20,Grotty and dodgy.,"We have two young kids so are not interested in medicinal marijuana, bikinis, henna tattoos or weird portraits. That seems to be the only stuff for sale. The toilets were absolutely foul and the sinks to wash your hands was a joke. We got out of there as quick as we could. Wouldn't bother going again.",ilovefrance12
20,PASS UP,"This is truly one of the most disgusting places, and it is a shame. I was here visiting back in 98 and I don't remember it being so trashy. Then the pot movement came, so expect the be annoyed by ""green doctors"" waving you in every few feet to get a script. Homeless hippies who look like they walked back from the first Woodstock like the strip and attempt to sell you absolute garbage. Be prepared to also get a contact high. Go one if you must, but don't return.",HFactorLA

40,Check it out!,"Lots of people work very hard to be weird on Venice Beach! An unreal number of exhibitionists and odd characters lend plenty of charm to the walk. There are plenty of shops to pop into and area restaurants to eat at. Muscle Beach is also here along with a couple of good basketball courts. Really, it's worthwhile to visit.Suggestion: Not the best place for young, impressionable children.",LikethetripFantastic
10,Never again,"See my review of Venice beach - quite opposite of what I expected. Very dirty beach, was shady and unimpressive. Not recommended for tourists, I will never go back.",CalGirl84
50,Fun summer attraction.,"I visit once a year. The eclectic street performers, unique variety of shops and vendors and overall energy from the tourists make it a fun place to spend a day. There are the basketball courts and muscle beach as well, when busy either can be quite an attraction. Basketball tournaments can be as exciting as any other sporting event. The beaches there are nice, nothing special. This should be a must do on all SoCaler's lists as well as tourists.",Erik4Travel
50,The place to find Southern California Culture,"When you think of Southern California, you think of Venice Beach. It is full of every kind of people and can find almost anything you want. I went almost every week as a kid for nearly 5-6 years and I still love going back as an adult.There were nearly one or two medical marijuana stories on every block it seemed when I was there the last few times, but that never made me worried or stopped me from enjoying myself (I have never taken drugs before).",Carissa R
40,"Great sightseeing, fun restaurants",Spend some time at the boardwalk and the beach. Lots of places to relax and get food and do some tacky souvenir shopping. Use caution/good judgement if you're taking small kids along here if you don't want to explain the smell of pot and alternative lifestyles.,Saranger
40,Great walking fun and sun,"Good food and shops (a little junky) and a wonderful long walk (you can rent bikes or blades) Huge beach area and leads to Santa Monica Pier (fun, junky, rides, secure).",Benjamin S
10,Definitely an eyeopener,"Definitely overrated.This is a place you do not want to visit. It was part of our LA tour & we had to stop there for lunch for 45 mins. It was the worst 45mins ever! After seeing the filth there I couldn't eat lunch. The whole place was dirty, the public toilets were dirty. A lot of street people trying to sell you something & were constantly in your face. Definitely not a place for little kids. Even though my kids were adults we didn't want to be there.If you like this type of place than go & see it but to me it was a waste of money as part of our tour I would have preferred to stop at Santa Monica pier for lunch then this place. I would not be rushing back to see it at all.",Paulette A
20,Not what I Expected,"I haven't been here for about 23 years. Needless to say things have changed. If you are an adult, and don't have kids, and don't mind crazy people screaming at you about being raped by the LAPD... then it should be fine. IF any of those things are a problem for you, it's probably not your bag. My kids were oblivious, but I was scared we would either be attacked by the homeless people sleeping on the beach, hustled by the shady teens following us around, or get a needle stick while walking at the beach. And that was in December. I would hate to see it during peak season. Next time I'll stick with more family friendly beaches.",Jessica H
20,Be prepared,"I lived in southern CA 12 years ago & my husband and I have great memories here. Well going back now with my 9 yr old he has heard the best stories and we planned so much time here and seeing what we did was awful. The boardwalk is not what it was, the shops too and you have a feeling that if you look at the people that sell in the street their cd's and say no you feel that you will get hurt. I was uncomfortable and so was my kid he just wanted to leave. I also have to mention the odour of urine is disgusting and ganja everywhere whatever.",Mostic
50,"great shops, easy to get around","I was out here for a wedding earlier this year. Some friends and I rented bikes and biked down Venice beach. The boardwalk had an inordinate amount of original shops and restaurants. A lot of places to get cute summer clothing. I did a lot of shopping here. I would definitely come back. My only complaint is the bathrooms are really dirty, they are unlit and made of concrete. Other than that the beach and boardwalk itself was great.",LeslieLorraine
40,What an eye opener,We recently visited Venice beach omg it was amazing the people there are certainly in a class of their own if you do the Hollywood tour while in Los Angeles you must go to Venice beach,karen m
50,A local stand-by,"There's really no reason for me to add another review to the boardwalk. If your coming in from out of town, its a must visit. Saturday's and Sunday's are especially busy and great for people watching.",Gregory G
20,poor!,"We stopped here on our tour of the city & it was disappointing!!!!!It was a good place to take a stroll but that's all there was to it: the place was nothing but t-shirt shops & street people.I have nothing really against street people(we even saw them in Oahu,Hawaii) but I came to California to see the sights: I'm afraid there's enough of them in Texas.",john p
30,Overrated.,"Definitely worth seeing, but it will take about 20 min to walk up and down the boardwalk. The novelty of the marijuana shops wears off very quickly. Too many bums. and I use the word bums on purpose - because most seem like they are voluntarily homeless.",Stuart T
40,Know What You're In For,"I had always heard of Venice Beach and so Venice Beach made it on my family's ""To Do"" list during our vacation to LA. We rented bikes in Santa Monica and rode the path down to Venice Beach--an easy ride. I wasn't disappointed by the experience, but my wife was nervous because of the hippies and other interesting people hanging out along the boardwalk. I wanted to stop in some of the shops, but thought it wasn't the best atmosphere for my 10-year-old. He's traveled a lot, but there were sexually-suggestive displays as well as a lot of drug references that we felt better to avoid, so we kept riding. If I had been by myself, I wouldn't have hesitated. All this to say, just know what you're in for. It's definitely an interesting place. The 1960s are alive and well!",jsctraveler
40,Very interesting!,"Being a tourist this was on my to-do list.  I really wanted to see Muscle Beach. Well, the people-watching did not disappoint.  The boardwalk is filled with shops selling cheap beach dresses, street performers doing anything for a buck, artists selling their wares, and medical marijuana ""offices"" that have characters outside letting you know the doctor is in if you want some ""product.""This place is a must-see just for the people-watching and because its legendary.",Dana J
40,Go during the day!,"Lots of interesting things to see at Venice Beach Boardwalk! Roller skaters dancing, skate boarders doing flips in the skate park and the VIEW!! Water with the hills...Gorgeous. There are a lot of cheap shops set up and Dr's offering medicinal marijuana cards. A drum circle on the beach brought out the hippies, very easy going people.The homeless are very apparent here, don't go after dark its not safe",Degram01
20,"Was, Is and Likely Always Will be a Collection of Freaks & Tourists","Not necessarily a bad thing. Definitely the best concentration of people watching on the planet earth. Somewhere, buried deep in the sand in the center of venice is a giant freak magnate. A definite must visit for adult tourists looking to see this part of LA culture and history. Tons of street performers, pot shops, self appointed profits, hippies, etc. All of it is in your face and immersive. Again, really cool if you are OK with this or looking for it. If you show up with your 10 and 12 year old, it can get pretty offensive and depressing pretty quickly. My advice is to keep the kids away/",David K
50,Many things to see along your walk,"I love this beach for its canals, beaches, the 2.5 miles pedestrian only promenade that fills with performers, fortune-tellers, artists, vendors. For the past years, they built a skate board ring which is quite neat after a long walk you can stop by and relax on the beach while watching enthusiast boarders doing their tricks with the sunset in the background (I think it must be one of the coolest things you can find there).",Hanley L

50,If you want strange,"This boardwalk is really a lot of fun to be on. Its filled with people from every walk of life. From strange to crazy. Thats what makes it so fun. There are many shops to go into and places you can eat, but what makes it fun is just people watching. And you see it all.",buddyone1
40,Must do at least once in your life,"Given some of the reviews, I had big reservations about walking the boardwalk here, but as it turned out, there was nothing to be worried about (even with our young teens). The few merchants we dealt with (buying things like water & ice cream) were very friendly/courteous.This is a great education event for the kids if you do it right and/or know your kids. We all laughed at times but also had serious discussions about things we saw as well. Neither my kids nor my wife were overly appalled at anything in particular (and the wife is very conservative). Yeah, she could do without ever going back, but I enjoyed doing it with the family. Local friend that was with us said it was a fairly uncrowded/tame day by older Venice Beach standards so maybe that played a part in my experience. Still say doing this is a must, at least once in a person's life.",Rich807
40,Nice place with loads of things to watch,"The beach is great and we walked in the Pacific also everybody was saying the water is too cold there. It was in october but the temperature was really good for us. On the promenade there are loads of things to see like people dancing, musicians, people showing strange animals and you will be proposed to meet the famous ""doctor green"" if you've got insomnia, headache or pain. Be caredul people putting CD in you hand and asking for money (i heard the CD were empty). I recognize immediatly the place where the famous bulldog was skating (can see him,on youtube). I remove a star because i'm not sure the place is completly safe in the evening. But you have to see this beach.",SandrineRamdane
40,"silly, a lot of fun","It's a fun way to spend a day people watching--cats on leashes, weed ""doctors,"" crazy people, etc.! Plus the skateboard park, and all those palm trees. It was too cold to swim, but i'm sure that would be nice too!",bwfol
50,My Favorite Place to Visit!!,"We go almost weekly just to see the sights!! It is so cool to see the crazy atmosphere and people and their ""talents"" to sell!! Wether it is music, the art, the roller blader dude... I love it all!!! The most awesome is to rent or take a bike from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier on the windy bike path! We also love the Sidewalk Cafe... Margaritas, Andy Warhol salad, Fish & Chips, and the piano player and other musicians right there playing for us all! Never get tire of this place!",Jana4Travel
30,Freak show for sure. Some people would like. Some would hate it.,"IWould say it is a tourist attraction, but no glamorous Baywatch. Famous muscle beach. full of weird characters, street vendors, homeless, stake boarders, Really nice beautiful beach, to walk around, but look scary to stay and enjoy the sun and water.You wil have blocks of merchants selling street art items, street vendors, tattoo parlors, hole-in-the-wall pizzerias, burger joints, medical marihuana places sand, and beach. You get to see the weirder side of LA, I guess this is what the state would be like if the anarchists took over, and if liberals keep pushing those propositions. Whole lot of MarihuanaIt is mostly a freak show, but could be fun to see. Overrated tourist spot, it could go either way, some would say a great place, others would say embarrassing to have a place like this in California to show tourist. The public restrooms are frequently not working or not available because of the long lines of people and they are horrible. Better make a stop before you get to Venice BeachPark in the public parking of the boardwalk. Have cash handy. If you park on the side streets, it may get scary. Stay on the boardwalk.",ericucho n
40,Enjoyed the walk in the sun,"A very enjoyable walk from the far end of Venice Beach to the Santa Monica Pier. Lots ot see and plenty of sovenior buying opportunities. Just watch your valuables, we didn't have any problems, but locals told us when it is crowded watch for bag snatchers and others. Saw plenty of homeless but were not bothered once. The many prescription cannibas outlets and botox on the beach gave us a chuckle. Mum and I got a hena ""tattoo"" on the boardwalk, a spider for her and an alien for me.",18Beverly18
40,OMG,"If you want to experience the weird and wonderful then you mustn't miss an opportunity to visit Venice Beach Los Angeles, you will see the beautiful to the bizare along this 3 mile stretch, if you want some Marijuana medication pop into one of the ""clinics"" the street entertainers are brilliant, as are the knick knack stalls, get tattooed get pierced they've got the lot.",scildos
50,Fun and funky!!,"Venice Beach is awesome in that you can enjoy the sand and water or... you can walk along the boardwalk and see a wide variety of shops. Then there is the entertainment. from performances, to live music, to spoken word, to psychic readings, to roller bladders, skaters, and people on bikes, you have it all. A virtual melting pot of humanity where just about everyone is represented. Shop, eat, drink, watch, or let out your inner beach bum, it's all welcome here. :)",TeemareeDotCom
40,great for people watching,I used to live right on the boardwalk and I always enjoyed the daily freak show of street performers. There used to be an old lady with green fishnet stockings and a guitar. Awesome. Always lots of people walking around. Good skateboarding park too.,L2Connelly
50,Entertaining!,Oh there's always something to see while walking along the boardwalk at Venice Beach. I always start at Muscle Beach and walk north. There are dozens of different street entertainers along the way and lots of weird to look at. You'll see just about anything at Venice Beach. I always bring out-of-town guests there -- it's a hoot.,Karen M
30,Hey... You Gotta See It While in LA,"Seedy, gritty, dirty...

40,it's changed but still kinda neat,"it's been decades since i was last here. the area around the beach has become gentrified. but the beach is still huge and wonderful. there are oases of grass, a nice walkway, a skateboard park, basketball areas and of course the ""muscle beach"" workout area. the boardwalk is still kinda tacky but hey! it's venice beach. still fighting not to change. lots of weird and odd people but that adds to it's tackiness and atmosphere. a must see and experience!!",boxsterbenz
50,Big fun,"It's busy place, with weird shops, stands selling all things you don't need, but the atmosphere is great. I loved it! We biked from Marina del rey to Venice, we walked along the Venice Boardwalk and we spent a few hours on the beach. Can only recommend it. Los Angeles was a big disappointment but we loved the area of Santa Monica-Venice and Marina del rey.",Vaca2
10,What a dive!!,"OMG, the Venice ""boardwalk"" is a concrete path riddled with shacks selling sunglasses and T-shirts, greasy food, and marijuana shops! And the visitors are either hard-core urban -- the kinds of folks you cross the street when you see them approaching -- or wayward tourists. Meanwhile, the traffic to the beach can take an hour off the highway ramp. And forget about parking -- once you manage to reach a nearby lot, it's a rip-off $15 ... Luckily, the beach is wide and fairly clean. And there's no dissing the view of the Pacific Ocean (though I do prefer the Atlantic, since it's warmer and calmer and you can swim in it).... If you go to Venice, go instead to the downtown area with the fun shops, or find the canals and drive up and down them to see the McMansions and some cool architecture.",mcgreek

Interesting boardwalk area - lots of food, touristy shops, locals selling all sorts of items (some nice, some rather bizarre). We enjoyed watching people at Muscle Beach, the handball courts and basketball courts. Always something going on at the Boardwalk!",otcarla28
30,Bit of a let down,"On this trip to California we thought we'd go see Venice Beach - we'd seen it so many times in films and on tv while growing up.We went by public transport from LA via Santa Monica and then on the $1 bus to the broadwalk. That was quite an eye opener - but safe and easy.Venice was quite run down when compared to Santa Monica and there were a lot of 'characters' hawking and begging- which was a bit draining.The muscle beach area was an outdoor gym - sadly no muscle - and was nothing like we imagined.We walked along the beach - which was wide and sandy - but quite breezy, great for surfers.There are some more upmarket apartment blocks and retail much further along but all in all we found Venice run down, a wee bit trashy, with too much 'interesting' street life and more focused for the 'Bill & Ted Excellent Adventure' type of visitor.We scurried back to Santa Monica - more our scene.",allancsn
40,Crazy kooky fun.,"Drum circles, roller skaters, skate boarders, vendors, psychics, lots of wonderful generalized madness. This is the part of LA that most feels like New York City to me. The people watching does not disappoint!",zeppo33

50,Loved it but wouldn't be everyone's 'cup of tea',"I really love people watching and interesting, unique sights. Having heard about Venice beach, I knew it would be my kinda place and it certainly was! But not a place for the faint hearted. It was full of people dressed in unusual outfits and doing unusual things, also lots of street acts (maybe not the best standard, but really fun). We went with young kids and they got quite bored, but I'd love to go back on a trip with friends, to spend the day hanging around and people watching.",UckfieldSue
10,it's an outdoor homeless shelter,"Skip it.Yes, it's historic.Yes, there are charactersYes, you need to watch your wallet.Yes, it's an outdoor homeless shelter.Seriously, the park is full of homeless people and high teenagers who are looking for medical marijuana. The only highlight was the skating park full of talented people. But not worth the drive. Stay home and youtube instead.TIPS:*park down the street for free*bring your own toilet paper if you MUST use the restroom.",sheilaandjon
50,What a Hoot,"Oh my....the characters you see here on the Boardwalk. Steet entertainers, scatboarders performing their stunts at skateboard park. Snake handlers, parrots to pose with (for a tip) Muscle Beach. But after a stroll you can stop to eat and drink at many establishments.

10,filthy place,I don't recommend this place for people with children it's a scary and filthy place a lot of hippies and homeless and thieves your should watch your self all the time.. a hippie gave me a finger sign because I was trying to read his sign (he wrote on it give me $1 for a beer) the parking smells really bad like people were urinate in the parking lane beside it was really expensive to park in such a place like that don't go there wearing pretty clothes or big handbags and don't go alone NEVER,Nora A
50,Our favorite stop on trip to LA,"Okay, I was warned that this place isn't for everyone by others on tripadvisor. We still went and loved it. There was lots of energy and some wierdness though I didn't pick up any of the scary vibe that others seem to have felt. You've got all the shops and vendors...musicians and street performers. There are all sorts of outdoor activities going on around including at the gym where Arnold worked out back in the day. Everyone seemed pretty happy to me - especially the guys dancing on roller skates, hilarious. Venice boardwalk along with the beach and everything around seemed like a cool spot and a must see. If it's not your cup of tea you can move on to Santa Monica or something. But I'd at least give it a try.",ICNiT

10,It's lost its soul,"The very first time we went to Venice beach a few years ago, it was a rather happy place with artists, tarot card readers, performers of all kinds.The boardwalk was not clean but o.k still. The populace was weird, fun, colorful, but not aggressive or dangerous.It really had good vibes with people walking, biking, chatting, shopping and all. A place worth visiting when you came around L.A.We came back there almost every year. But now it's a real let down.It's now packed with homeless and drug addicts. You'll find hords of homeless peeps from the Loew's (Santa monica) to the heart of Venice beach where things really get bad. The closer to Venice, the more the drug addicts.Not only do they stand on the boardwalk but they have an aggressive fence : insults, bad comments toward visitors are now common.It happened to us and believe me, we were just walking there, not looking at anyone in particular. However, dealers & addicts now run the place. I also noticed that some these narcs told some tourists that they should get back to their country. Somehow, it probably makes sense : there are better places around.The boardwalk is dirty and smells like a giant restroom.Also, police officers used to stand round every corner. Now, you're left on your own : no cops anymore.There is simply no way for you to feel safe when holding cash and credit cards.I've had the chance to see Venice Beach when it was a vibrant, colorful and safe place. We used in the different types of shops there.Apparently, the ""golden state"" cannot care anymore about an iconic place such as Venice beach.Don't even think about visiting the place by night.",FRTravellers

10,A human cesspool full of the dregs of society.,"I do not live a sheltered life and consider myself fairly open minded, however I found our walk down the Venice Beach Boardwalk to be a complete waste of time. I have been a police officer for almost 30 years and know the difference between a street performer, someone who has fallen on hard times or a drug addict. The majority of the people along the boardwalk appeared to be the latter. For every 10 shops along the boardwalk there is 1 legal marihuana distribution store. I use the word legal very loosely though. These stores have employees that stand out front telling all that walk by that the doctor is in and that he can prescribe the marihuana for a myriad of ailments. I'm pretty sure that every living person on this planet has at least 1 of the listed conditions, no matter how healthy they are. The smell of marihuana permeated the air outside of each of these stores.It was also obvious that the majority of the people on the boardwalk had no clue what soap is. I wouldn't consider eating or drinking anything from any of the establishments here. I couldn't wait to leave and being there made me want to have a shower.I would not recommend visiting the boardwalk. If you feel that you must though, I highly recommend not taking children here.",rcw198

I think I might feel differently in the evening as there were people using medicinal herbs and offering them to others as we walked by.The skate park, muscle beach and volleyball were interesting to watch and there were benches at certain parts in the shade. We visited 20 years ago and I would say it appears safer now.Parking varied in cost at the beach from 7 to 10 dollars on a Monday.",flowerpower_9
10,What you don't know about the Venice Beach Boardwalk,"I visited the Venice Beach Boardwalk this summer when we met my friend's cousin, who lives nearby in Santa Monica. 3 disclosures prior to my review:1) I hadn't done any research on Venice Beach prior to visiting (translation = I had zero expectations)2) I have lived in NYC my entire life and have a tolerance for ""grittiness""3) I go to NYC public beachesWhen we started walking the boardwalk, I got a little bit of a Coney Island, Brooklyn, vibe. Lots of t-shirt and trinket stores, cheap eats, and a gritty atmosphere. Ok, cool. After about 10 minutes of walking on the boardwalk nearing sunset, the reality of Venice Beach set in.The Venice Beach boardwalk does have it's local artists: painted Mexican skulls, airplanes made of old soda cans, etc. However, many of the artists are drug addicts who throw things together in the name of art, just to make a buck. We walked down the boardwalk for about 3/4 of a mile (down to James Beach restaurant, to be exact). I was utterly AMAZED -and sickened- by the number of very obvious drug addicts, homeless, drug dealers, and others on the boardwalk. Literally every few feet I saw this.Alongside the stores, there's the concrete ""boardwalk"", alongside that there is a strip of grass, and then the beach. It was clear that the grass is not a safe place to be. Everyone sitting on the grass was either strung out, smoking pot, or a thug. I was wearing flip flops and would not walk on the sand for fear of stepping on a needle. I realize this review sounds very dramatic, but this is the gospel truth.This was one of the very few times in my life that I felt unsafe in public. I cannot even imagine visiting at night. I did not see one police officer in my 3/4 mile + walk. I think the locals are left to fend for themselves.Also, I would not recommend staying in a hotel on the boardwalk. One property was called ""Venice Beach Suites & Hotel"". Sounds nice, right? The guests hanging out the windows and balconies were not much different from the locals on the boardwalk. The hotel has a website and has favorable reviews online; don't be fooled. It is the equivalent of a 1980s crack den.I'm told that many celebrities own homes in the town of Venice Beach. I realize that some people like the allure of the art-drug scene (a la NYC East Village pre-gentrification) and maybe that's the appeal of the Venice Beach boardwalk.Although that scene does not appeal to me, I'm writing this review so that you have complete picture of the area should you be an out-of-towner planning to visit. The name sounds glamorous, but the Venice Beach boardwalk is anything but.The one good thing they have is reasonably priced public parking lots. If you're going there just to say you've been there, fine. Don't expect much; watch your belongings; and be smart.",TillyT2012
40,Chilled,"My family did the Venice beach boardwalk and what a great way to spend a couple of hours for free. There are lots of side stalls so of you do want to spend money there is plenty of opoortunity to buy T shirts, get massages, henna tattoos etc. You can even see a doctor who will assess your need for marijuana!! So if with children you might want to take this into consideration. There are 2 paths, one got boarders, bikes etc and the other for walking. If your group has both bear this on mind and make arrangements to meet up at the end by the skate parks as the paths split and it does get busy.",Miss-sip
50,"joggers, skaters, surfers and nutters","Despite this having an air of Camden Market-on-sea, this is actually a wonderful place for families. Never once did we feel threatened or unsafe. In fact, this was the best beach we've ever been to, and we'll return again soon. I hope.",major_rawls
40,NICE,Nice place to walk or bike (rentals are available) and enjoy the ocean. Nice shops along the way. Parking is available for a fee or if your willing to walk a few blocks for free on the streets,TREK39
50,THE BEST,"If you go to LA you must go the the Venice boardwalk,the street performers are amazing,the stores are cool,got a good deal on some local art and jewelry and had some great food.One of my favorite places in this country",charles c
40,Spent some nice quality time...,"I regret I didn't bring any swimwear when I visited Venice Beach but nevertheless, it was quite an interesting park to stroll and wander around with friends and family. Have picnics, get tattoos, bring your bikes, skate boards and wear that roller blades (I know you've been wanting to) and enjoy the sunny weather and the artsy stuff being sold parallel to the boardwalk. Overall, this place is a feel good worthy for some R&R!",LeslieConti
30,crowded but always a crowd pleaser for out of towners,We go bike iding there frequently as an alternative to other bike paths. Always have to be on the look out for people crossing the path witout looking. Lots of shops. Great place to take out of towners but an get old if you live in the area.,Karen W
20,quite an interesting scene but not good for biking,"We took a beach and biking vacation to Southern California. It's a great way to see the beach scene and stop to enjoy the ocean and restaurants. We both have 24 speed road bikes but prefer flat rides. Huntington Beach bike path was great. We later rode along the bike trail from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica over two days. Our only bad experience was at Venice Beach. The sand had blown over the bike trail for most of its length. With lots of bike traffic, it was very slippery and dangerous. The City knows that too since we saw about a dozen community service workers out there with brooms but I only saw one sweeping and the others were vsiting with each other or were on their phones. We did try riding on the boardwalk but the crowds ruled that out.It's no longer the Venice Beach you saw in the movies and on TV but it is a sight to see!!!If you are biking, enjoy our earlier route and skip Venice. Continue up to Santa Barbara and you will find more scenic bikeways.",davisbikie
40,Art is all around you,To visit Venice beach you need to spend the whole afternoon. Its a spectacle. Every character is more bizarre than the next. Lots of fun...,WittyK
40,trippy scene,"Nice stroll beach side with places to stop, eat & to grab a brew. Many vendors selling their arts & crafts also. It's a GREAT place to people watch as there is a variety of eclectic people. I would recommend renting a bicycle at the Santa Monica pier and ride down to this area along side the sandy shore the whole way BUT lock your bike if you plan to leave it unattended at any point! I'm sure you could also rent a lock along with the bike.",heidisb
50,too cool,"best freakshow for free in america..only west hollywood at midnite can top this venue for people watching..whether its a pick up basketball game or working out on the weights or street performers abusing their crowd, there is no better way to spend a few hours than on a bench or cafe in venice..you name it and you will see it..from super hotbodies to decrepid barely-humans, the specialness of the wasteland known as venice will keep you entertained for a day.

50,A MUST SEE,"I adore Venice Beach - we try to visit at least twice a year - we live about an hour away. It is a must see for any visitor to California, the people are great - a bit nutty and different, but that is what makes this place soo much fun and a great place to see!! This is where my dad got his medical card (84 yrs old). If you are visiting California beaches, Venice is a MUST SEE!!",Annette H
10,Horrible place to take your family!,We decided to take a short drive from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach boardwalk..what a mistake that was! There were thugs drinking beer and smoking marajuana up and down the street. There needs to be more police patrol and not an empty squad car sitting there just for looks. I did not feel at ease one bit. I have nothing positive to say about this place. I would not recommend or refer anyone to go there.,5ski
20,for a minute,"arriving from somewhere else , it s fun but for few minutesif you walk there the second day, you can actually see how sad is the walkboard",maxanddan
50,A Wild Fun Place To See It All~,"I have walked many a beach, from Bonaire to San Salvador Island, Bahamas, in the Caribbean; to Fiji and Palau in the Pacific, and this place is my ultimate favorite. What does it have? Tons of ""Hot Chicks"" skating in thongs & bikinis, sidewalk street artists, street musicians, hot chicks playing in the sand, all manner of crazy dressed, something people, and even muscle beach. Bicycling with a great white sandy beach, super good Italian ice, and frozen yogurt, for a restful stop, and miles of sandy beaches to bicycle on a super nice bike path. Now the down side, parking sucks! Get there early, real early and expect to pay for a pay lot. If you are not there by 8AM, or 9AM, expect to drive around for an hour. My last trip on a Sunday at 3PM, I had to give up and call it a no go to the beach. Traffic~ Yuck! Its like every hot chicks driving slow. They're looking at guys, and the guys gawking, and ""OH"" the hot chicks in thongs! ""CRUZING FOR LOVE!"" That's what Venice Beach is all about! I have gone here more times than I wish to say in 30-years of heading to the beach, and I never tire of looking at a cute butt in a thong bikini! Bottom-line, you are never too old for Venice Beach! Rent a bike and cruise for hours looking for love in the best place on the west coast~Venice Beach!",airebornranger
50,One of my favorite people watching places on earth,"Look, everyone knows that crazy, interesting people wander around Venice Beach Boardwalk. Just go with it - let your walls down, and have fun. These people won't hurt you, and they will probably amuse you. One of the weirdest, funnest boardwalks there is - with nothing to compare.Would I ever buy pot from the pot docs? No - but I could care less that some people do. Would I put on roller blades and strap on my guitar and amp? No...but I would miss the guy if he stopped doing it. Would I sit in a trash can and hold a sign that says ""help me get trashed?"" Never - but who cares when some drunk homeless guy does. How does that hurt me? Freedom of expression at it's best.Try to have fun - there are great spots to eat, drink, and people watch. Besides the beach itself!But honestly - if you are offended easily, have strict religious/political views with no room for others to be different, drive just down the road to Santa Monica. Everyone will have more fun.",HBsleepsurveyor
50,Still weird,"Still weird, still unpredictable, still diverse, still so uniquely Southern California. AND still open every day.",MikeMc666
30,Lots of weird things to see,"You have to visit, just to say you did...but not really worth returning. Many odd characters around there. And doctors ready to sell you some marijuana as well. Just ignore and keep walking. The beaches are nice. And you can check out Muscle Beach as well.",terrieh
20,so sleazy!,"I'm an ex-pat from Blackpool, UK so consider myself a connoisseur of sleaze and tat. There's nothing quaint, fashionable or charming about this location, and if you're a visitor to LA I would suggest you don't give it high priority in your schedule. It's pretty dismal, unless you're after cheap souvenir teeshirts, a skateboard enthusiast, or want to experience the novelty of the 'medical' centers. The craft stalls sell mainly tatty rubbish and the 'street entertainment' is meh - plus very pushy for 'contributions'. If you're looking for the latter then Santa Monica is a much better bet. Compared with Venice Beach Boulevard, Blackpool Prom is definitely more classy and entertaining. PS Stay away from the public toilets of at all possible!",Trudy S
30,"Colorful, But Only If You Must","I only visit the boardwalk if visitors insist on it. It’s just kind of tacky and some of the characters lurking about leave something to be desired. If it’s of any interest, there’s the Muscle Beach gym where people work out in full view of the public.The shops are the typical T-Shirt joints, all selling the same thing. I cannot recommend any eateries there. It is colorful in that there are numerous Medical Marijuana clinics where the going price gets one a prescription for weed as long as one has some ailment to complain about. The clinic personnel who populate the sidewalk are all adorned in bright green scrubs with a “leaf” logo. There are the usual tattoo parlors, and quite a few henna tattoos for those taking the safer route to skin adornment.The boardwalk is probably worth a short visit for first time visitors because it is colorful. The street entertainers are usually very skilled and it’s fun to watch them. And lastly, as an area resident, my only reason to visit by myself is the beautiful and wide white sand beach (although I usually prefer the quieter beaches farther to the north and south of Venice Blvd.)",FrequentTraveller034
30,Interesting place,"So many things to do along the boardwalk, a little something for everyone. I would not take small kids there because of the homeless bums out there openly do drugs and there is a lot of drug promotion there. The crowd was interesting and people sell literally everything they find or make. There are several tshirt places and food stands or restaurants. Watch your belongings because we almost got robbed a few times there.The souvenirs were cheap and may unique paintings and starving artist types of things were sold. One old man held up a sign offering ""shi**y advice"" for $1. Even the bums won't let you take photos without donating to them.Stay away from the bathrooms at all costs. LAPD has a station there on the boardwalk next to the beach so they ride horses to patrol the area. Parking $20",FamousLisa
50,Loved it,Many different vendors and very talented too.The water was extremely cold and there was not that many people in it.,Yesenia S
50,Cool place to be,"Venice beach board walk is definitely a bustling lively place. I'm not sure whether it was just the day we went, or if it happens every day, but there was an awesome market along one part. Heaps of cool souvenirs to buy. But if your wanting a nice quiet view of the ocean it would be better to hire a bike. There's a biking track half way along the beach, so much better than the board walk if this is what you want. There's a good selection of places to get snacks or drinks from if you get thirsty.",Brian T
40,Nice,The trip overall was great! They have some good food choices along the boardwalk and the entry to the beach. We rented bikes from Jays and rode the bike path from Venice to Santa Monica. The trip was beautiful the only probably is pedestrians like to walk and jog on the bike path making it crowded at times. It's a must do on your trip.,Lilihurdler5
30,No Easy Stroll For Non-Shoppers,"My ideal would have been to walk along a paved path with a view of the ocean and beach activities, but cyclists have the best route, a winding path that stretches a few miles from Santa Monica to Marina del Rey. We walked along the wide boardwalk, full of shops selling sunglasses and floppy hats. Some boarded-up shops. Some street vendors that looked down on their luck. Not the liveliest atmosphere for a sunny weekend day. I think the folks on bikes got it right.",AnaCasanaSeattle
30,Bike better than walking,It was not so nice to walk would be better to bike looks cheap and dirty by Venice Beach much nicer towards Santa Monica end.,AbsoluteTours
30,"Fun place, but wouldn't take young kids","There is nothing about The Boardwalk that would be fun for children. We have two teenagers, so it was fine. There are a lot of people selling a lot of things....clothing, art, maijuana, food, jewelry, sunglasses, etc. Fun place to people watch, especailly the skateboarders. Be prepared to dish out money for everything....people even expect a donation if you take a picture of their products or themselves. There was even a guy standing in front of Muscle Beach decked out with an 80's style boom box and a tan, with his Speedo and gold chains on just waiting for an unexpecting tourist to take is his picture so he could ask for a donation. It really is a fun place to be though. Lots going on and plenty of entertainment. Wouldn't hang out after dark though.",purplesummer79
30,Also muscle beach. Sunday drum circle is fun,"Sunday at sundown, a drum circle forms...follow the sounds of the drums. all are welcome. Visit during the day, boardwalk closes at sundown. Great collection of freaks and tourists. Also has a skate park and a grafitti wall, where local artist can art up for a week at at time.",LifesaBeach006
30,Checked off my Bucket List,"My husband and I and our 17 yo son visited Venice Beach boardwalk. It wasnt pristine and sterile however it was definetly different and we saw things I will bet we will never see again. There were the touristy shops with tee shirts etc but there were also every walk of the life trying to get money out of you for just about anything. They danced, played instruments, created scultures or just begged. The smell of weed permeated the air just about everywhere. There were many homeless people camped out with grocery carts, tents, etc. We didnt have a bad experience there however I would not go there after 5:00 p.m. Also I would not bring children old enough not to understand and who would ask uncomfortable questions. It was definetly an experience different for sure!",blondie014
40,A great place to go to atleast once,"The boardwalk isn't the prettiest place in the world, but it offers a nice mix between shops selling touristy things (you'll be able to get your ""Venice Beach"" gear and other souvenirs here), and local art. Some of the artsy things for sale really opened your mind to creativity e.g. model aircraft made of soda cans, and some things would make for really nifty presents for those at home or for hanging up in your home. There is a skateboard park near the beach where it's fun to watch people whizzing by attempting jumps and stunts. The beach itself is a lovely place. It was a beautiful day when we went, yet there was still quite a lot of open space to lay out, which is very different than the crowded beaches that I am used to. Overall, a great place to go to get away from the hustle and bustle of life, and where the simple pleasures (like feeling the cool water on your feet) make you smile.",MyThoughts_10
40,One of a Kind Experience,"It lived up to the hype of being a crazy & exciting place to visit. Tourists, locals, nut jobs, performers, muscle men..this place has a eclectic mix of people. You'll love it.",Anne S
50,Very Eclectic,"I loved it. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. The performers on the boardwalk are great! Just remember to tip them if you take photos or interact with them. There are ""doctors"" every ten feet trying to get you to sign up for you ""license"" but they do take no for an answer. If you like funky or eclectic vibes this is the place to be. I wasn't impressed with muscle beach, not many weightlifters there when we passed by. I would however caution against using the public restrooms. I don't think they get cleaned too often and reek of urine and other body smells. The toilets are stainless steel and just nasty! If you like people watching, this is a great place to do that!",Kimberly L
30,Super touristy,"A bunch of booths selling touristy crap. Eh. Great to say you've been there, but nothing special.",justtojess
40,my favorite part of my 1st LA trip!,"A really eclectic place to see some local art, surfers, eat and just stroll. (However stuff only gets going at about 11 am and stops at sunset, time your trip accordingly!) Was a little intimidating early in the morning when the street people were being rounded up off the beach and the area, but you have an opportunity to contribute to a tent where some folks are providing healthy food for the disinfranchised. Great people watching. Also lots of people pushing 'medical marijuana' consults, just tell them you're a local and they leave you alone! (Also apparently the $40 fee they charge is for the consult only, not the 'prescription card' which costs hundreds just fyi...)",vikileigh

50,a bike ride alone the boardwalk,"rent bikes and take a ride from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach.... you won't regret it... it felt so nice, relaxing and enjoyable to do that.

40,Come to See the Strange and Unusual,"The Venice Beach Boardwalk is the center for seeing the strange and unusual. This is definitely not a place for children and if you are easily offended, sensitive to alternative lifestyles or not of a socially libertarian mentality, DON’T GO; you will not be comfortable nor enjoy your visit. However, if you are the type that can tolerate the strange and unusual (you will be surrounded by it) you will appreciate a visit to this iconic boardwalk which offers people watching that is unlike any other place on Earth. I really enjoy a visit to see the strange show. This is one of those places that reminds one of why CA is sometimes called the “Cereal State”. The walk has seemed to go downhill a bit over the years with increased homeless persons. I would not recommend a visit after dark.",Steve5863
40,Great for people-watching,"If you are into people-watching, this is the place to be! We really enjoyed walking up and down the boardwalk a couple of times. The boardwalk has a great atmosphere.",kiwibrent1968
40,Haight Ashbury By the Sea,"I am from the Bay Area and have spent a lot of time in San Francisco and the Haight, so I appreciated Venice's similar vibe. For people who not aware, it might be a bit overwhelming-my husband hated it and has vowed never to return. There is definite contrast between the beach and canal area. The people who live in the homes and bungalows around the canals are obviously living comfortably, it's quieter there, peaceful. On the beach there are number of homeless people, panhandler's and addicts. That aside, I like the funky vibe, the hippies, the outdoor gym, the artists, musicians and peddlers that line the beach and boardwalk. It's not for everyone and it's not a place to hang at night. We ate at a great cafe called The Fig Leaf, just before sunset. The food was very nice and the wait staff, so friendly. As we were leaving the waiter cautioned us that it was probably a good time to go back to our hotel. As we walked to the taxi station, we noticed all of the businesses were shuttering for the night-fairly early for a boardwalk. Still, there is definitely a police presence, so don't be scared off if you really want to go.",ohriorio
40,Walk On The Wild Side,"If you like unusual not boring beach experience this is the place to go. You can eat, rollerblade, bike, play Volleyball etc..or watch the muscle men working out. (the place was known as Muscle Beach). Watch the sidewalk attractions some which are unusual and you can buy lots of souvenirs. It's not the classiest beach so if you're looking for that you might want to keep up the coast.",Tacmystery
30,Not really my thing.,"Venice beach is.. interesting, to say the least. It will make good photos, especially when your friends and family go skimming through your vacation photos and land on the upclose and personal photo of the ridiculously bronze man wearing a too tight speedo while rollerblading. Definitely will ensure some great conversations. The beach is average, littered with beer cans, used condoms and food wrappers. The boardwalk is full of crazy drunkards, college kids, 420 ""medical shops"" where you can get a guaranteed medical marijuana card. My favorite thing about this place though, would have to be the food. There are plenty of fruit stands where you can get a mix of chopped up fruits sprinkled with chili powder, yum yum. Also - best fish tacos the boyfriend and I have ever had from some random stand. Better than we've had in SD and Rubios (yuck).Venice beach will make for great photos.",Sonya B
50,Go and take a look,"Venice Beach is great for a few hours to walk and watch. There are a few homeless, but there's also plenty of police about. Its great seeing the artists, the skate board area, the people on roller skates and generally people watching. The beach is not great - if you want a beach for the day go to Long Beach or Huntington. Hire a bike if you can and head to Santa Monica pier too. Parking is an issue, there's basically none, its $20 for a parking lot space. Also if you have small children don't use the public toilets - they are disgusting!",peter009
30,"Not on top of my must see beaches, but it is an adventure","It is hard not to love Venice Beach. Probably one of the best places to people watch around. There are a definate cast of characters here. We walked up and down the boardwalk for a while and had a good time looking at all the vendors. And there is definately some good food to had along the boardwalk. I suggest this if you aren't necessarily looking for the relaxing type of trip to the beach. This is an active crowd and there is A LOT going on. It is still a lot of fun though.Each time I come here the atmosphere is different and that is what makes it exciting. I love people watching and love to see all the people and attractions. Again this is my idea of a ""different"" beach experience!",lesliea277

Some rays of sunshine include surfing and some great looking beaches, but anything more inland than where the seaweed comes to shore is disgusting.Plenty of homeless people living off the tourists and not giving a hoot, smelly, dirty, and somehow that level of hygiene has slowly started to work its way into the common goes. It's becoming the new normal. Not the American image, not the human image, just a scary place to avoid if you're there on a vacation.Santa Monica is unbelievably better!",PhantomReg
30,a tourist attraction,"This is a place I bring friends who are visiting Los Angeles for the 1st time. It is funky, colorful, with a dark side as well. As an Angelino I find no good reason to visit this place on my own. It is a fun place to bring first timers! There are fortune tellers, tattoo artists, all sorts of other artists, muscle beach, roller skaters galore, one famously singing and playing guitar. The police patrol the neighborhood on bicycles wearing shorts. There has been a lot of effort to lessen the criminal element here, but it still exists...beware the pickpocket! If you're looking to buy some Knockoff sunglasses, this is probably the place to find them. Venice Beach should not be confused with the Santa Monica Pier...two separate destinations within walking distance, but there is a big difference. The pier is family fun friendly, Venice, not so good for children (my opinion).",Mayalavender
40,lots of shops and things to do,"Highly reccomend bringing your camera and doing a bay watch re-enactment ;). So much fun and so beautiful. Sand was soft and went on for miles.

Unless you're a stuffy old fuddy duddy, or you have young children, you should definitely visit Venice Beach. Lots of interesting things, people, and animals to see, and there are some pretty cool things to buy.Find the man that carves names into stone, they are crazy awesome! And at only $10, it makes a really awesome souvenir.Now yes, there are homeless people. Yes, there are people who look like they're strung out. Yes, there are some people that smell weird and the bathrooms are scary. Yes, the headphone dudes trying to sell their music are annoying, but none of them bugged us after we said no thanks. Yes, there are inappropriate signs, language, smells, and outifts everywhere.That is the beauty of it!!!I don't know WHY you would ever take your children to Venice Beach. It's not for children. If you're a tourist who likes the finer things in life, I don't know WHY you would go here either. It's for those with an open mind, a sense of spontaneity, and those who like things a little weird.Also, I'm a twenty something white female who walked around by myself and I was perfectly fine. I met some interesting folks, took some awesome pictures, and got some really awesome souvenirs and stories.",WendyLady03
20,Very sketchy!,"I did not enjoy our visits to Venice Beach Boardwalk. The shops were full of the same crappy touristy junk. There were very pushy sales people for the medical marijuana stores that were every few feet, there were tons of homeless, mentally ill people in the area setting up booths, begging, sleeping and fighting. Some had very offensive saying on their signs. I would not want to have to explain to my kids what the signs meant. The worst part were these very pushy guys trying to sell CDs. They would actually attempt to put their headphones on your head as you walked by. Am a mid 30s white female and I would not have been comfortable in this area by myself. The BEACH is beautiful, just avoid the boardwalk. We were not bothered on the beach.",crsergeant
10,Don't go,"Having not been back for 8 years I was disgusted how terrible it was. Accosted every 100 metros by ex vietnam vets men selling music and downright not friendly people, I lasted 40 minutes. Crap shops and really nothing to offer a tourist. Stay away",Russell T
20,"Why do they call it a ""Boardwalk?""","There are no Boards on this Boardwalk... instead it is a wide cement sidewalk. For some reason, the Venice area became home to a lot of ""artistic"" types (ie: misfits, counter-culturists, alchoholics, and the occasional talented artist) and the boardwalk is brimming with them. And all sorts of unusual characters like to come here, either to see or be seen. Note: The cement sidewalk is excellent place to Roller Blade when it isn't too crowded.",Ralph K
10,Drug Hang Out - Not For Kids - Why Visit,"Beautiful location full of hippies selling junk art for their next bag of weed. Prescription Pot dispensers every 10, every 10 feet they approach you trying to convince you that you will qualify for medicinal pot. California legalized the use of pot and dispensing of pot, they just do not know it yet or turn their head.What has the world come to.

So many ""interesting"" people from street performers to the skaters to the muscle men and basketballers.We hired 2 tandem bikes for 2 hours and rode all the way past Santa Monica Peir.My children brought their skateboards all the way from Australia just so they could skate the Venice Beach Skatepark.Just remember, Venice Beach seems to attract all the weird and wonderful people from all over the world, but that's what makes it so attractive.",markandkim66
40,Worth Seeing,"This is a place that you need to visit at least once. Yes, most of the shops on the boardwalk are pretty cheesy, but you might want to pick up a souvenir. The people dressed up like doctors selling ""medical marijuana"" are pretty funny. People watching is at its best here. You never know what you might see. Lots of street performers. Nice long pier and the beach was clean, with few people on it.",hummergirlTempe_Az
40,A place with its own style,"A combination of trendy shops, hippy types, ""in"" types, etc. It's just fun to browse the shops, stroll along, and people watch. And the beach is okay, too.",KathyLongBeach
30,What does one make of this place?!,"This is one bizarre experience! I can't help but laugh at the memory of it. Part of me wants to give it a five star and the other half says zero to one star (hence the three stars). They have teenagers out hawking the ""medicinal marijuana"" shops if one wants to partake (we do not). They had the Ninja obstacle course going on for whoever has absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon but watch TV. The beach is beautiful if you don't mind the trash that litters it. What a waste this beach is! The part that entertained me the most is the parade of really strange people walking around. From the homeless (sleeping everywhere) to the old 1960's rejects to the weight lifters to the whatever. I think the term ""what a long strange trip its been"" (Grateful Dead) applies here. We traveled with out 17 year old son but if we had young kids we wouldn't have liked it at all. But otherwise it was an afternoon of just plain weirdness. No regrets.",michaelnmarsha
30,Not at the top of my list,"We went to Venice Beach for the later afternoon/sunset time of day. Maybe it was a bad time of day, but we were not impressed. It was pretty, and we enjoyed walking the beach, but the beach was littered with trash. We walked out to the pier where a lot of people were fishing, and we got some nice pictures of Santa Monica pier, and other things south of the pier. We walked back and walked the boardwalk, which reminded us of a 1980's movie, with the shops and the summer vacation get away. We walked for a bit and decided to turn back and go to dinner. Overall we felt it was more depressing walking along the board walk, seeing all the homeless people and their pets, a lot of the shops had a scuzzy feeling and we really didn't do any shopping. We saw several fights breakout with 1-homeless people 2-guys cat calling women who didn't appreciate it.We'd heard there would be performers and fun ""circus"" like things going on. We prefered the part we walked out to the pier and took in the view.",Travel4Fun31
20,A mixture of UK's Blackpool and Brooklyn by the sea!,"It such a shame about the place as its such a beautiful place with the beach, boardwalk and the sea and its panoramic views.Due to the type of shops, cafe's advertising medical drugs etc and the massive number of down and outs littering the boardwalk (litterally lying in the middle) and along the grassed areas we felt intimidated. We were also worried as we had heard that this was not a place to be after dark. If you decide to walk down to venice beach from Santa Monica dont leave it until late afternoon. Its a good 45 mins walk and you dont want to be found well into Venice at sundown having to either locate a taxi or face the 45 min walk back to the nicer end away from the intimidating atmostphere. Perhaps it was because I was dressed in a sports jacket and had my teenage kids with me who knows but this was not the place for me, we just felt unsafe",davidmlowe

50,Unique and well worth the walking!,"Everything you hear and see about Venice is here to enjoy! We thoroughy enjoyed taking in the sights and sounds and especially the people watching! Kids, at the skatepark, families, joggers, the downtrodden, hawkers, unique shops, etc. If you are from the 60's and 70's, you are home! Loved seeing some older shops offering clothes and stuff from the 80's such as Lightning Bolt Surf Shop along the main drag before you get to the beach. What the kids found very interesting was the many many Medicinal Marijuana Shops willing to evaluate your condition and make a prescription for you!",sasakidalem
50,A MUST SEE when visiting California!,"My teenage daughter and I LOVED our visit to the Venice Beach Boardwalk! We got there before the shops and artists set up for the day - it was around 11am on a Monday - so we got to enjoy the quite of the beach in virtual isolation until about noon. Then the artists set up their wares - which are all so awesome– it was a great place to find unique souvenirs for our friends and family! We each got our names created in sand stone by one of the artists - they are amazing! There is also an artist who sells snow globes with crystals and other stones - this is really unique, I had not seen this before and we got a couple for family members. All of the sights on the boulevard are not to be missed!",50StatesTravelor

50,The Best People Watching Anywhere,"My husband, myself and our two older teenaged daughter had a blast at Venice Beach. It has the best people watching in the world! The buskers are very talented and the outdoor reataurants, cafes and fortune tellers are fun too. I now know why they call part of it Muscle Beach, as we saw quite a few body builders there. The most ""unique"" ones were the 70 year olds in Speedos. We really enjoyed it.",IlsaSS
50,Who does't like Granola?,"This place is raw. Life is hanging out all over the place. Some happy, some sad. A great place to go with some sort of wheeled apparatus (especially the skatepark). But if you go to the skatepark, ya better have some game, unless your just goin to watch which is cool too. The boardwalk has a tributary that forms a gallery around the skatepark and its a non stop show. The boardwalk itself has its other shows. On the ocean side are local artist that may throw some paint on a piece of wood or break dance or belly dance while having a movie projected on their body. There are some really good blues musicians and if your a movie/TV buff you will recognize many of the regulars from the massive amounts of film shot in the area and mucsle beach. The shops are retro 60's meets china manufacturing but there are some cool stuff imported by some weird people lol and some decent fish and chips. Great place to surf too!",Thomas O

40,"For a look at a true mixture of humanities, lifestyles, and comestibles, you can't beat the Venice Boardwark!","If you're a normal American middle-class person, the Venice denizens that you meet will probably be a little different than your own neighbors, but may be a little more interesting, as well. My last impression of Venice was that it was a residential locale for many artists, musicians, authors, poets, with plenty of working folks like you and I mixed in... But some of the humanity seen there can be a little unusual for us workaday citizens!",amercorp
20,Dirty - horrid atmosphere,"I stopped off here after visiting Santa Monica and could not believe the difference with them being so close together. Venice boardwalk is seedy and grotty and I could not wait to leave. Lots of homeless and undesirables hanging around. I felt quite unsafe and could not recommend and cannot think of any positives. If you really have to go, run in buy a Tshirt and leave asap.",AarondQueensland

50,Absolutely loved Venice Beach,"When I got to Venice Beach, it was exactly like what I expected and more. There were many characters hanging out, the medical marijuana places and cool shops to go to. I went for a bike ride along the path all the way to Santa Monica Pier. It was a great bike ride. It was very peaceful and beautiful. I would recommend taking a bike ride. We went by Muscle Beach as well and that was cool to see too.",shayre21
40,OMG! what a freak show...but I'd go back...it was fun!,"Lots of craziness...and the medical marijuana & smoke shops were too much...but it was still fun (on a cloudy Sunday morning...heaven knows what it would be like during a more crowded time). Felt a little unsafe, but just need to be aware of your belongings. Whatever you do, don't go in the public toilets. Use the public parking right at the beach for $9.00 - you will see parking for $15.00 before you get to the beach, but the public parking is cheaper.",Karen R

50,Venice Beach-The coolest Place in L.A.,"I have been visiting the Venice Beach boardwalk over a period of many years. It is a mixture of beautiful beach with gorgeous views up the coast toward Malibu plus a carnival like feeling along the boardwalk. The main area of Venice Beach is at Windward Ave and Ocean Frontwalk. There is a large grass area with palm trees here where many events are held throughout the year. There is a new skateboard park here too. This is a great spot to both watch the skateboarders and see up the coastline. The beach itself is wide with nice sand. The view is a large sweeping bay looking north. The main walkway along the beach is approx. 2 miles long and goes almost to the Santa Monica City border. The walkway also called the boardwalk has small stores facing the beach and people selling all types of clothing, jewelery, Rasta stuff, incense, massage and all types of art and crafts. The walkway has the most interesting and colorful characters you will find in Los Angeles. There are singers, dancers, jugglers, freak shows, gypsy tarrot card readers, and actually a lot of very talented musicians. It gets more crowded in the afternoon and parking at the beach parking lots run $15-$20. On weekends or holidays parking can be $25. There is free parking about three blocks away from the beach along the street. This is one of the great areas of L.A., especially on a sunny day.",alanmhersh

40,Venice Beach Boardwalk,"Always a laugh to see what's going on down on the boardwalk. All the ""odd people"" come out to play, and seem to want money from you for every little thing. Grab some food, sit in a cafe or bar for a while and watch the people go by.....most entertaining! Maybe hire a bike and go for a ride all the way up to Santa Monica Pier. An easy, flat ride following the beach.",Travelbunny63
40,Great for people watching,"The Venice Beach boardwalk is a hoot. You'll see everything from starlets in tiny bikinis, tourists with tons of camera gear, entire families set up on the beach, homeless people asking for money, fitness enthusiasts rollerblading, street performers, and the average Joe, like me. The boardwalk goes all the way down to Manhattan Beach so it's great for getting exercise. In the Venice Beach area of the walk you will see several stalls where goods can be purchased, like jewelry and T-Shirts. There are also food stands. Venice Beach is also home to what used to be referred to as ""Muscle Beach"" because there is a small area dedicated to working out.The Boardwalk is a very busy area, especially on nice days. I could hang out here for hours just watching people go by. Be sure to catch the mural on the building near the boardwalk -- it is a huge painting Botticelli's ""Primavera"" on roller skates. It doesn't get any more ""So Cal"" than this!",Beau S
20,Meh. Maybe because we went on a day when it wasn't sunny?,"It's all lovely when you see the word 'Venice' hung across the street but walk a bit past it and it just feels skeevy. A lot of the shops were closed but we felt we got the drift from the ones that were open - rastafarian shops, cheap sunnies and cheap hippy clothes with a few shops selling hooch mixed in between. I won't write a huge review bagging out this place cos we feel the weather played a huge part - it was freezing cold and even rained a bit so the tourists were few and far between. We felt if there were plenty more tourists it would have a ,much different atmosphere but for us on that day it just wasn't our scene. It felt quite unsafe and to be honest, it was a relief once we got on the bus back to Santa Monica.",Carmania
40,"Sunny, funny, hippy, happy, waccy baccy Seaside!","Well worth the effort of the walk from Pacific PArk to Muscle beach - although it would be much easier by bike. For a brit escaping the February rain it was great to be able to stroll in the sun. Plenty of interesting sights including tight rope walkers near Pacific Park, a myriad of sports and exercisers, amazing beach and the sea is there somewhere. As one walks south the stalls and shops take on a very surreal character. Some of the worst art I have ever seen, plus 'specialist' medical advice of the sort seen in Amsterdam. Lots of fun. But where was the 'muscle'? No-one on the machines at muscle beach!",ltexile

50,Where Art meets Crime (and rich people),"Venice is different things to different people. The boardwalk is kind of the mask of the town and the only part that many people see. Sure its def worth walking the boardwalk, buy from local vendors, tip the hippies, homeless or musicians a dollar, watch some skaters or get pretzels and beer at Waterfont Cafe. It's also worth walking abbot kinney though, and through the canals.

40,Well worth the visit but take a bike,"Best way to visit Venice Beach is to rent a bike one mile north near the Santa Monica Pier and ride down to Venice Beach from there. Be sure to take the bike path nearest the beach if you are in a hurry but if you have time, ride very slowly with the crowd going past all the booths and businesses there. The advantage of being on a bike is being able to see a lot in a short amount of time plus the guys trying to sell you CDs and the pan-handlers don't bother you. Bike is only $7/hr and well worth it.",pilot12

40,Great for people watching,"We really didn't know what to expect on our visit since you always hear different things about this boardwalk. We were shocked at how many ""KUSH"" doctors were there and how willing they were to get you a ""prescription"" We watched a skateboarding competition and people wrapping their own ""prescriptions"" in the open. The smell of it was everywhere, which really surprised this person from Utah!The majority of people that were selling their goods were very friendly and the trinkets were priced great.There is a parking lot right at the beginning of the boardwalk and next to the beach that charges $9 but it is worth not having to drive around the small streets looking for parking.There is so much to do around here it was really great. You can rent bikes, play hand ball, basketball and use the skatepark.I suggest that everybody take a trip here at least once. It really is a laid back area, not scary at all.",myopinionz
40,Tacky but Amusing,"It took 43 years of living in CA to visit this place. It certainly is amusing, tacky, and a bit unbelievable, even out of season!",RDB27
40,Plan for a great outcome here and you'll find it!,"Venice Beach is a mixed blessing ... we visit 8-10 times a year. Yesterday, I got it. If you plan for this weekend afternoon, and know what to expect, it can be a great attraction. Unplanned, it can be a stressful, scary weird look at LA that gives you nightmares. First, know that the boardwalk is 1.5 miles long -- which makes it a good 3 mile hike ... great exercise walk if you do it right, with the right shoes. We parked at the Venice Blvd beach lot ($9), strolled the oddities and took in the sights on the way down, rested in the park at the Santa Monica end (nice grass, friendly normal people, fun dogs ... we played Scrabble) , then powerwalked the beach side at sunset, back to our car. It was fabulous! You can also park at the beach lot closest to Santa Monica if you're inclined to start stress-less, and do it in reverse. That end has a pay by the hour arrangement, so it can be cheaper. Here's the thing: the Boardwalk itself is very intense and congested, with lots of weird things to see. It's a freak show of sorts, and there is a Freak Show, too (see the two headed turtle out front for free). Best stuff is on the ocean side of the Boardwalk. You really don't need to buy, but you can find hippie souvenirs if that is your thing. The street people acts are fun, but watch your purse/wallet. The drum circle is very cool, but don't get too caught up in it unless you like that stoner thing. Speaking of the stoner thing, there are many medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics on the Boardwalk -- just blow past them quickly (and the head shops) and you'll find much more interesting things to see and do. Other than a Jody Maroni's sausage, we've yet to find food/beverage that makes it worth the $$ for us (we wait and eat later). Take care of your restroom needs before you go (Starbucks on Lincoln is OK) -- the Venice Beach restrooms are filthy, and those in the restaurants/bars can be gruesome on a busy weekend. Venice Boardwalk in general is filthy, so don't dress up -- and don't bother if it is raining out. If you're in need of souvenir T/shirts, buy them near Muscle Beach end of things. Don't miss these classics: the scary clown with the yellow hair. The muscle men if they are there. The pickup basketball games (fun to watch). The sunset (time this for departure following sunset). The drum circle (from a little distance). The rollerblading guitar player who has been there for decades. At least one palmreader/psychic. The sand sculpture guy. Don't bother: the head shops and medical marijuana dispensaries. The homeless begging kids. The free CD guys. The boys selling puppies, unless you go there with a plan to buy a baby pit bull. Most important advice of all: leave before it gets too dark -- it's fine in daylight, although edgy ... but this is not a safe place to linger more than 30-40 minutes beyond sunset. Take lots of pictures to laugh about later, over drinks in Santa Monica or elsewhere. Pace yourself -- and have fun!",lauranlauren
20,Don't go at night with wife & kids,"By parking at their lot next to the beach, it has easy access. Skate park is fun too watch. As soon as we stood at the rail, a 7 year old skater kid asks for a donation. I told him I hadn't seen him do any tricks...so he spun around the park a bit and came back for his $1. As soon as the sun went down, it quickly seemed really seedy. We were constantly on the look out with all the ""interesting"" folks around. Parking lot was really dark...we walked quickly to our car and locked the doors.",Kurt D
10,Is this a homeless refuge?,"I was not expecting mattresses on the beach and run down vans with the smell of [---] everywhere and run down buildings with homeless people milling about and pan handling. I guess I was picturing more of what I thought it must have probably been in the 80's with rollerblading bikini clad girls and typical board walk attractions you see at more well kept locations. Now it's a hippie/homeless wasteland masked in political signs and ""Occupy"" nonsense. Would never go back.Muscle beach was a joke. The equipment was rusty and looked unsafe. Only 1 person looked like they were actually working out, the rest looked homeless and looking to use the rest room or sleep on a weight bench.",jbel
50,A must visit while in LA,"If you are a tourist visiting the Los Angeles area then you have to go to Venice Beach and walk along the Boardwalk. It is the ultimate LA experience. But, you need to go on a weekend, or during the beach season so that you get the full experience. I've been a number of times and if the weather is not good, or if it is midweek in the off-season, the experience is not the same.It's best to park somewhere near the end of Venice Blvd. Parking prices vary. We paid $7, which I thought was pretty good. I've paid a lot more down there. And then walk the several mile stretch up and back. Along the way there is no telling what you might see. It is a feast for the eyes.There are a ton of places selling food and various souvenirs, much like you'd find at a county fair. And then there are the mobile vendors who set up along the sidewalk selling personalized artwork and incense and a variety of other things that you won't find in a regular store. On this particular visit it seemed as if there were a lot of places where you could get a prescription and have it filled on the spot at a marijuana dispensary. I hadn't seen this before, so this was a new addition to the Venice Boardwalk menagerie.Also, there are people playing paddle tennis, muscle men pumping iron and showing off their physiques, basketball players (sometimes VERY good), and the various street performers who perform for tips. They are always entertaining to various degrees. Some can be amazingly good, some just mildly amusing.In addition to all the crazy-looking vendors you have a variety of tourists from all over the world, the local beach crowd in various states of undress and a number of people who just look like they want to be as different as possible.Next to all of this craziness is a great beach and walkway where you can ride bikes (for rent everywhere) or rollerblade, and watch a beautiful, smog-induced sunset.This is the ultimate people-watching location and a must visit while in Los Angeles. Just go, and try not to be offended at the things you see. Have a funnel cake and just enjoy the craziness!",mauiwolf
50,Fun Place,Venice Beach is always a fun and entertaining place to visit! weather you have little of lots of time to spend this is a must go! you have a beautiful beach scenery on one side and shops on the other. Many artist and artisans come and display there items for sale. a lot of interesting things you can find and good deals as well. there is tons of places where to choose to eat and drink! it is a public place so watch out for the homeless people or the drug addicts that are hanging around that area. parking could be difficult to find if you are trying to use the meters or not pay at all. there are plenty of parking lots that have a fee of $5-$10.,SarahVonFurstenberg

10,Great place to get your marijuana,"I've lived in Southern California for 50 years and this was the first time I drove to Venice Beach. I'd guess 1/3 of the shops are ""medical"" marijuana related. Either a small drs office ready to prescribe pot for any ailment you can think of or the pot shop itself. And next door will be an accessory shop. The rest of the shops are t-shirt or tourist crap shops. Across from the brick and mortar shops are the small vendors selling there wares. The best part are the street performers, but they spend as more time hyping their act and collecting money, than the performance itself. As far as the ""muscle beach"" area, there were only a few guys working out on a Sunday afternoon. I guess it's just a place to go to say you were there, but I can't see ever wanting to go back.",SoCalTraveler06
30,Scary place,First visit to Venice beach and a bit of an eye opener.Lots of hippys and homeless.A bit scary so we did not stay to long we walked along the boardwalk back into Santa Monica.Found a lot to be spaced out selling things that they had made but to scared to go near some of them so not a lot of positve things to say about Venice beach but glad to see but dont think would go back.,surfsup2
30,Nice bike ride,"We rented bikes and rode towards the shops and then rode back in the other direction towards the houses. I didn't feel too safe by the shops and it felt dirty. The beach however was beautiful. It wasn't busy. The bike path was fun because it wasn't just straight, it twisted and turned to make for a fun ride.",missmattie
40,Weird and Worth It,"If you don't have kids, Venice Boardwalk is fun and entertaining. You'll encounter numerous vendors and street performers. The roller blade guitarist, Harry Perry is a must see.",Tho0505
40,You just have to experience it!,"You just can't go to LA without going to venice! with it's shops and body builders and all the things & people that simply make it venice! Sure there are a few people you might need to be ""weary"" of but you can walk right by and the won't give you a hassle! you can find great deals on souvenirs in a few shops! parking isn't bad there either! Alot of people set up there merchandise on the walk too and you can find good deals with them! don't be too afraid to ask for lower prices! most will deal with you, they want to make money too!Just go and have some fun and eat!!! Prices are great! there is a little pizza place on a corner there that has great pizza! Blue walls is what i can remember! you can't miss it! You order in front & pick up on the side!But for a ""unique"" experience...venice is the place!Got kids?...the $3million skate park on the beach is really cool to go watch or use!!!",hbsurfer1
40,An entertaining visit to Venice Beach boardwalk,"We were staying at Santa Monica and hired bikes, there were 3 families with teenagers. We rode along the boardwalk to Venice which was only about 15 minutes away. As it was a Sunday it was buzzing, there were skateboarders, a roller disco, basket ball games going on and it was great for people watching. The roller disco was my favourite; there were some great moves going on. One guy managed to do the splits whilst on roller boots. There are also many stalls along the boardwalk selling all sorts of things. I think a Sunday is the best day to go as there are all the locals are there. The only downside is there are a lot of homeless people there. They never bothered us though, although i wouldn't go down there after dark.",Karen G
50,Venice Beach never goes out of style,"I've lived in Los Angeles all my life and Venice Beach is one of my favorite places to spend an afternoon. For visitors, I'd recommend seeing the boardwalk on a Saturday or Sunday as there's plenty going on.My kids and I always enjoy the ""street shows"" being put on. For a few bucks, you can enjoy watching ""the glass walker"" or the acrobatic dancing team. Honestly, as many times as I've seen these shows, they still manage to amaze me and make me laugh.I'm quite fond of all the goods being sold on the boardwalk as you never know what you'll find. Many sidewalk vendors sell their own artwork as well as handmade jewelry. With so many items on display it's easy to spend a couple hours just shopping.If you like people watching, this is definitely the place to come. You will see all kinds!! I always like to watch the skateboarders in the skatepark as they do lots of aerial jumps. Sometimes they have people doing grafitti in a special grafitti zone.I guess I love Venice so much cause there is always something to see and do.",Caroline L
30,You have to say you went here.,"What a mix of people!. Kush Doctors, Hippies, freak shows. Muscles. Skate parks. Planned graffiti. Street Performers, Wide variety of Arts. Homeless. Weekends are busy and you get to see the most interesting. Go during the week and you really see how they live. So sad to see the young homeless people. Be ready for them to follow you to get you to give them money. I did not feel at risk the area had great police presence. Make sure you watch the Skate Boarders in the park they are good, and they come in all ages. Bring good walking shoes.",Compuacct
50,"Relaxed, funny, and a little bit crazy...","Coming all the way from Denmark, we were very exited about visiting the famous Venice Beach. And it was great! The beach was lovely, the climate was warm, and the ""Baywatch"" and the surfers were there. But the water was just as cold as in Denmark....!The long beach promenade is something speciel, filled with strange, little stores and funny people. Street artists and musicians practice their skills here, and you can spend hours just looking at people. Less fashionable and more freaky than expected.",Karen A

40,"Art, sun, & great, strange energy - right by the ocean!","Our family (with teens) LOVES going here. It is quintessential California, with people roller skating, walking, biking, walking, and being active right beside the beach - with palm trees, sunshine, and AAALLLL sorts of people around - everyone welcome. The vendors offer an interesting mix of arts and crafts, food, jewelry, etc. - and the energy is vibrant and high-energy. If you're looking for a quiet beach scene, this isn't it - but it is memorable.",rebelbelle14
10,dont take your kids and hide that you have money,cool place but alot of beggers and alot of drugs in the wide open.,casinobuster
50,A must see!,"A mix of everything is found on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Lots of shops, street vendors, food, interesting people, nice sandy beach! Parking lots available next to the boardwalk. Parking fee was $9. We did not get to swim because the water was very cold, as it has been in our past visits. (Many Californians own wet suits and I can see why!) The highlight of our trip was renting bicycles ($8/hr) that we rode (on designated bike path) from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier and back (approx 6 miles). Highly recommended!",OhLoveNYC

I found sitting in a solo seat with my mat spread before me for the second time , handmaking jewlery that kindness...Real Heart and soul thrives on that boardwalk. If Jesus was alive surely we would find him here spreading the Love to Derelicts and RichSmoking Buddah says... and AHH.. to look with fresh eyes at the lives before us...will warm the heart and create a new song for us to sing",smoking b
40,Loved it!,"Was a bit apprehensive to go here but after walking a little bit and getting used to the ""scenery"" my family of five had absolutely no problem with the boardwalk. Never felt unsafe. Lots of cool little stands selling stuff. Enjoyed watching the skateboarders and enjoyed people watching. Would definitely go back if ever in the area again!",girlcat
20,Didn't live up to the hype - didn't stay long!,"As we were staying in Marina del Rey we thought we would check out Venice Beach. Came away very disappointed, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Walked down the boardwalk - there's a lot of strange people there. The area has a feeling of being run down and very tatty. We didn't feel comfortable there and would not have taken kids there.Would not go back and don't recommend this attraction.",Somuchtosee01
50,"Pretty weird, but definitely an interesting time!","The boardwalk is filled with pot friendly ""license distributors"" and people trying to sell you fake medicinal marijuana cards, not sure how it works but I've heard that they do work. No beer on the boardwalk unfortunately but still fun to walk, see the weird fascinating people, enjoy the beach air and breeze, and overall have a good time.",GregStone
40,"Great mix of artists, travellers, normal people and a few weirdos (friendly though!).","You cannot visit LA without a trip to Venice beach and the boardwalk. Lots of market style stores and entertainers lining the wide walkway.You will see the occasional weird looking or sounding person but they'll still be friendly, everyone is...although it's not quite as welcoming very late at night (midnight).A must see place for anyone on vacation in LA.",spacey7
20,Interesting but would not go again,Interesting place to visit and I am pleased we went - but I don't plan on going back.Nice boardwalk to stroll and good place to people watch - but we felt like we had to watch for pick-pockets and drunks/stoners the entire time.I don't recommend taking children there.,signinsareapain
10,"Honestly, don't waste your time.","If you want to go just to say you have been there, then by all means go. If you want to go because you think it will be a nice place to visit...DON'T GO! It's dirty and the locals that live and thrive there are a little shakey. Vendors constantly approaching you with offers. I turned my head and a man approached my 16 year old to offer a free video...after he took it he asked for a donation. No big dealand the video wasn't bad but I guess just didn't feel comfortable there and frankly not much to see or do but people watch. Parking is expensive. A few days later we ended up taking a tour out of LA that stopped by for 15 minutes and that is plenty. Oh, btw we were warned by the tour bus driver abouth the restrooms and he was telling the truth...possibly the worst I have ever seen!",wachoman
40,Rent a bike.,"My 16 year old son and I spent an afternoon bicycling from Santa Monica Pier to Marina Del Rey and back. One can go further south if desired. The beach is beautiful and the riding is easy. Bike rental on the beach just south of the pier has good equipment, avoid the place at the amusement park. This is a must-see in LA! Skateboarders and bodybuiders at Venice beach, anachronistic hippies selling worthless trinkets, beautiful people on roller skates... plenty of places to stop for a rest or a beverage. Enjoy.",wtkorn
50,Its an experience you don't want to miss!,Its everything you hear and see on TV. Its a must see on your to do list. The beach is clean the boardwalk has great shopping at great prices and you get to see Muscle Beach too all in one stop. Parking is available everywhere within 2-3 blocks for $7 or at Venice beach for $9.,rowley848
10,You couldn't pay me to go back.,"The Venice Beach boardwalk made my heart hurt. People walking everywhere, in obvious stupors of one kind or another, screaming, talking to themselves, and audibly crying. One person, visibly high, was ""talking"" out loud to her ""father"" - apologizing for ""getting a bad grade"" and swearing that she tried hard. After saying that, she walked into a tree and fell down. Every 4 steps someone says ""the doctor is in"" - which gets old after a while. I didn't feel unsafe exactly, it was just too hard to watch these poor people. Sure the ocean is beautiful, but it is just too sad. There are other places to see the Pacific in LA.",jmasc1
10,Turning to the worse,"No gentrification here. Place is scruffier than ever. Drugdealers, crackheads, drunks dwindle about. Lousy art, lousy music. Nothing cool about this place. Depressing.",spbjerg
30,go to the Venice canals,"Wasn't thrilled with the boardwalk but LOVED the canals. Walk along the canals, bridges. just gorgeous, peaceful and safe.",lydia61358
40,A cultural experience,"The boardwalk was visually stimulating. Best place for people watching. It's a very bohemian place. On one side you have the beautiful beach. On the other side you have interesting shops. In the middle is a side show and freak exhibit.Along with the more legitimate T-shirt, gift, food vendors you will see many other vendors as well. You'll see artsy types selling crafty hand made items. You'll see musicians playing for money. You'll see people performing tricks and stunts for money. Some of them are likely homeless. Then you have the amatuer rap musicians that try their hardest to hand you a CD, you assume it's free and as you walk away they tell you how much you owe them. I've seen this trick everywhere else in the country so I knew better, but I saw many other people get irritated over it. No matter where you are, if a stranger tries to hand something to you just shake your head and say no thanks. If people wanted what they have the items would be on a table with a price sticker. Don't be a fool.As I have read you will want to come during the day. This neighborhood may not be as safe during the night. We came with our 1yr old in a stroller. We did not feel unsafe at any time. Although we walk big cities all the time and we are familiar with the usual characters and common schemes. Other than tourists and some locals, you will see artsy people, hippies, rap cd hawkers, and bums. Most bums don't want to hurt you, they just want your cash so they can buy cheap vodka.",Nicnatros
50,There is more than one VENICE to love....,"Venice beach is the type of place that makes one want to become a hippie or beach bum! The boardwalk is full of artisans selling their wares as well as a plethora of souvenir shops and places to eat. This is a ""people-watcher's"" paradise --- from muscle men pumping iron to phenoms of all ages skateboarding, there is always something entertaining to see. The weekend I visited there was an arts festival going on in conjunction with an all-day rock concert. There is cool graffiti art, talented street musicians, a cast of characters, and the beautiful ocean awaiting you at Venice Beach.",SZQINSINCITY
10,Avoid if you value your safety.,"I have never felt so uneasy in all my life as I did walking with my husband along Venice boardwalk. Vagrants, pick pockets, drug dealers and various sinister weirdos, what a place, talk about undertones! This place is not quirky, it is a tacky dangerous dump. I was so relieved not to have any children with me. If I never go here again it will be too soon. Such a shame, my husband remembers it being much nicer fifteen years ago.",likestotravel30
20,Rating depends on what you expect and what you want,"I gave the Venice Beach Boardwalk a ""poor"" rating.I can see where college kids mind find it interesting or visit foreign tourists mind find it really different and funky, but I just find it kind of grubby. it certainly isn't a place I'd take young kids.If you want to see street culture, schlocky street performers, cheesy tourist shops, have people trying to sell you something off the street and Muscle Beach then it might be an excellent attraction. Personally I think L.A. has 50 or 60 attractions that are better and more deserving of attention from tourists first. As a local, it can be a fun place to kill a couple of hours, but it just isn't a ""must do"" for most visitors.There are some decent restaurants in Venice, but nothing I would go out of my way for as a tourist.",scottca075
30,Interesting place but not for everyone,"Venice broadwalk isn’t what it was 4/5 years ago. Looks like the gentrification of Santa Monica has lead quite a few of the drifters to head down to Venice, took a walk a few times up the beach never had any problems but there are undertones and looks that isn't comfortable at times.Good place to go to see the ""other side"" of life, but would not take kids and would not stick around after sun down!",Mas_The_Traveler
10,Not a family attraction,"If you're young and have no kids, it's at least an interesting place to check out. But if you got kids (of any age), you should avoid this place. There's a tattoo parlor every 3 business and it feels like a knife fight could break out any minute.",Adam
50,Great place to spend the day,"We were staying on the Hollywood strip and got 2 buses here (25c per person). It is such a beautiful place to spend a day. The pier had rides and stuff for both adults and kids. You can people watch and relax along the beach and hop into the numerous bars and restaurants. Then there is the market selling allsorts of random stuff. There are some very interesting pieces but be wary of being talked into buying stuff (Although it is nothing compared to South Africa, Egypt and Morocco!!)But great day had and highly recommended.",Camacho87
40,Great Place to People Watch but Watch Out for Smooth Talkers,"Everyone wants your money here & some succeed in getting it so watch out! Lots of people trying to sell you a CD, sell you their art or get you to buy their ""stuff."" Just keepwalking if you are not interested. Don't worry about being ""nice"" because they know all the right things to say & before you know it, you are walking away something you don't want & they have your money.The street performers also expect tips which is fine if you enjoy their show but one group actually DISCOURAGED pocket change or one dollar bills & actually had the nerve to request fives & tens because ""there are 5 of us so if you give us a buck, that is only 20 cents each."" So instead of my son & I both giving a buck or two, they got zero from us.Parking is tough. During the week, you can sometimes find a spot on a side street. On the weekend, forget it. A parking lot is the way to go unless you want to park on a street far away and walk. If you want to park in a lot adjacent to the beach and boardwalk, you will have better luck finding a spot in the lot at the end of Rose Ave. The lot in the heart of Venice is usually full. I paid $16.00 on a Sunday in August but they only wanted $6.00 during the week in November.The Venice Beach Boardwalk is a great people watching place. Expect every kind of person from homeless & high to rich & snooty as well as singles, couples and families. If you don't want to see scantily clad people, people openly smoking a variety of substances, or seeing people who are passed out drunk, then don't go here. However, if you have an open mind, watch out for the scammers, and love to browse art booths and shops, then come here!I love the Venice Beach Boardwalk even though it is really an asphalt walk. And for a delicious cup of coffee and pastry, try the gem I found off to the side of a building near the tennis courts called Schultzies. The owner said she just opened a few days before I went on Nov. 10, 2010.",akidcagal
40,full of entertainment,This place is packed with a lot of street performers and you're guaranteed to see something strange and funny here. Plus there is a market along for those who like to get souvenirs and a great skate park where I watched a man in a suit skateboard around! There is also a section where artists are allowed to express their art on these concrete walls. The only thing I didn't like was the stumbling drunk people who got arrested before my eyes and this was a few times too. Just watch your purse and I don't know what it was like at night but my cousin ( a cali native) doesn't suggest it unless you're with more than 4 people. Daytime is best.,vancouverVioletBc
50,my favorite place in LA,"I take European students on tours of LA and Venice is most always the favorite attraction. With that being said, we visit LA on Saturdays in July & August, when the boardwalk is packed and street performers are performing their hearts out for your last dollar.The atmosphere and diversity of Venice is unparalleled: aspiring rappers, Rastafarians, drum circles on the beach, medical marijuana signs galore, kitschy tourist shops with cheap t-shirts and sunglasses, basketball games, men wearing thongs lifting weights at ""muscle beach""...Venice is a must-see on an LA sightseeing trip!",JessSanDiego
50,"Wow! A real breathtaking experience, a...","Wow! A real breathtaking experience, a bit like Glastonbury festival but with guaranteed sunshine!! Some fine artists and artisans selling there wares from the stalls many a bargain to be had if you look real close. Watch out for the busker who's forte is to dance inside a small cardboard box, really cool/weird! Got a bit seedy toward the end of the sidewalk. Got fed up with trying to dodge the rappers thrusting there home made CDs in your hand. Wouldn't fancy a visit after nightfall!!!",Zelak999
30,You are definitely not in Kansas,"I'm not going to get too judgmental here, it just depends on what you are looking for. I'm a middle-age mid-western guy who brought his wife and teen kids to LA for a summer vacation and we loved our trip. But Venice beach just isn't for me, too many crazies here and its kind of dirty and shlocky. But if I would have come here when I was in college with some of my buddies I think I would have really liked it here, hitting all the bars and then people watching. Back home a pan-handler asks you for money for food or shelter. In Venice a pan-handler asks you for money so he can go get drunk or high, he just spells it right out for you. Its funny really. So if that's what you are looking for then go for it.",Curt48187
40,"Very interesting,,,,And very Differant...A good experiance",This is a whole differant world to its self......the beach its self was great and clean...(you may want to bring your own TP though as they will run out).....it is when you step off of the beach you get to meet the unique individuals that make this area known....and the are intertaining...especially if you like to people watch,bluelava99
20,Everything we say no to - all in one spot!,"I wondered why I brought my teen and pre-teen kids here, when it showcases all the things I try to tell them are the exception rather than the rule. Call me old-fashioned, but there are many more enlightening and uplifting ways to spend time in LA - even just hanging out together at the hotel.",winwoid
50,"Venice boardwalk is not a place, it's an experience!","Having read about what Venice boardwalk is all about, I knew what to expect. Vendors selling all types of crafts, drawings, really cool stuff, street performers, dancers, drum circles, t-shrt shops, 420 dispenseries, food and fun. Many many tourists in the area, and a few homeless people asking for spare change, some were holding signs. If eccentric people, very liberal and carefree lifestyles are not your thing, I don't know if you are really going to enjoy Venice boardwalk very much. But if you want to experience life from a different perspective, and if new experiences are your thing, this is the place to be, come spend an afternoon, it's a pretty cool place.",frozencarly
50,an LA must - spend a morning/afternoon here,"Venice Beach is just so interesting. There are so many different types of characters here that, if nothing else, it's a great place for people watching. We love going here for a relaxing weekend morning or afternoon. I highly recommend eating at the Sidewalk Cafe - great omelettes, fun patio area to eat and people-watch. Venice is fun for random silly souvenirs and local crafts. There's a skate park on the beach for people who like to skateboard, there's yoga, there's muscle beach, it's just a fun place. But, beware, there are a lot of ""rasta"" types of people and people smoking and such, it's not a ""wholesome"" place. It's very liberal there, so if you are conservative, this may not be your scene.",tinytraveller87
50,Great Time and Laura @ NiceCream Gelato is honest Fabulous Person,"We had the best time enjoying the strange sights and people there. I had a massage at a lovely little chinese massage place that had 5 chairs in the back with lovely music and excellent massage therapists. My husband and friends waited several blocks away at Venice Bistro while I had my massage and after my massage I stopped at NiceCream for a gelato. I didn't realize until that evening (8 hours later) that my wallet was missing....I was soooo convinced someone had stolen my wallet and we retraced steps and searched everywhere looking for it and I had no other form of ID with me to board our plane for the return trip home. We phoned the sister store to the NiceCream (since the one where I bought mine was already closed) even though I was totally certain I had not left my wallet...haha...and the young lady said she would phone the girl who closed down the store on Venice Beach...well, needless to say...she phoned me back to let me know that Laura (part owner of NiceCream) had my wallet. I called her immediately and she was so apologetic that she had gone thru my wallet to try and identify a way to locate me and had even gone to the trouble to call my credit card company for me to let them know she had it. I was totally amazed that a complete stranger had taken the time and cared enough to be that thoughtful. EVERYONE should stop and buy gelato from this awesome store that has such honest and caring owners. Laura wouldn't even take a reward the next morning....we had gelato again for breakfast and it is FABULOUS AND ROCKS!!!!! They have two locations....one on Abbot Kinney Blvd and one right on Venice Beach Blvd....so if you want the best gelato in the world other than Italy and a dose of caring honesty stop in and buy a scoop from Laura or any of her great staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Athena.pond

It is not a cookie cutter, commercialized mall, if you are looking for that, I would say try the Grove. You can buy individual souvenirs, original artwork and fun/cheap gifts.
