40,Cool office building,"kind of hard to review, but as office buildings go, this is a very nice one and a good addition to the area. Katana restaurant is also located here.",JohnRyan724
50,Great place to grab a drink,"Walked past this place on a night out and it looked really fancy so we turned around and went in, such a good call.There's a few different rooms that you can go in and we sat down at the bar and ordered 3 rounds of cocktails, the staff were super friendly and there was a great vibe to the place.If you're in the area you should go in for at least a drink as you can get a great view of LA from the top of the stairs.",Hayden Q

The Sundance Sunset Cinema allows you to book seats and buy food and drinks to have while watching first run movies.We liked the experience but the prices for food and wine were quite high.,Don T
