50,Wonderful horse experience,"Monte Verde Ranch offers rich and rewarding horse experiences for families. We took our 6 grandchildren and their respective parents for a 2 hour trail ride that everyone just loved. The trail/riding guides were very knowledgeable and patient with the children (and the adults) insuring everyone had a great time with their horse. The stable staff are friendly and safety oriented in a kind and educational way. Monte Verde boards a variety of horses in clean, well-kept stables. For our Washington DC grandchildren, this experience offered a Los Angeles based western adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen0417
