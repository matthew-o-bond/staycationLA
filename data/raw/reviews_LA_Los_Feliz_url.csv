50,Saturday morning in the delightful neighbourhood,"We began our visit to this delightful neighbourhood at the grand Mulholland Memorial Fountain after taking Bus 96 from Downtown to Riverside / Los Feliz. The fountain commemorates William Mulholland who designed and oversaw the 233 mile long aqueduct that brought water to a dry city over a century ago.We continued our stroll along the lovely winding roads. We saw Walt Disney's First House in LA and then continued to the marvellous Lovell Health House, from where there are panoramic vistas over the city.Ennis House is an architectural marvel. Designed by the famous Frank Lloyd Wright, it is well worth seeing.Along the way we gazed at Griffith Observatory, and taking a pathway we ended our morning there, enjoying the tremendous edifice and the attractions within.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,"Los Feliz, where the New Yorkers move to, is literate, classic Los Angeles and loaded with stars and industry folks!","You could spend an entire and wonderful day in Los Feliz. Adjacent to Griffith Park, the options are seemingly endless. A good day might start with a hike in the park, up to the Griffith Observatory. Plan you travel accordingly and you could tour the iconic Richard Neutra Lovell Health House, grab an amazing lunch at the Alcove restaurant and go on a neighborhood tours of all the fabulous houses in the winding hills, like Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis-Brown house on Glendower. REALLY plan it right and book tickets for a live music show at the legendary Greek Theater close by!A two day trip could plant you in downtown LA to explore the rich city life under the high rises...MOMA, Disney Hall...If your coming to visit LA, Los Feliz is a MUST.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go_Josh2021

40,Beautiful homes on picturesque hills!,"I’ve read about this L.A. neighborhood and wanted to see what it looked like in person. My husband and I drove (carefully and slowly) up the very narrow, curving streets from Los Feliz Boulevard up to the magnificent Mayan-inspired Ennis-Brown House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Although we could only see it from the outside and couldn’t stop because another car was behind us, it was definitely worthwhile. The houses along the way are all different and of varied architectural styles, and many of them were built into the hillsides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieBlue09
