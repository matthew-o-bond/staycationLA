50,90 minutes of deep tissue bliss,"Went here on a Sunday thinking I could just walk-in, and while I could've gotten a Swedish massage later that day -I was after a deep tissue. So I booked a 90 minute massage with ""Zvi"" for a few days later. It was well worth the wait.I found the location clean and accessible. The room was a good temperature and the massage was amazing. I had hurt my knee in an airport/connection related event and Zvi was very good about not aggravating the knee further. I will definitely book again the next time I end up in LA -well worth the price, if you want an affordable well done massage, -GO!-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Windsor999
40,Great massage (except for two things),"I had a deep tissue massage, which was excellent and reasonably priced ($58 for one hour). The facilities were very nice looking, clean and comfortable.Two critiques: During my massage, the music was interrupted three times by ads. The ads were only a few seconds long, but still a bit distracting and not really appropriate during a massage. Also, there was a dog in the waiting area that barked at me as I entered. I couldn't tell if it was the receptionist's dog or if another customer had left the dog there, but it was roaming the waiting area for a few minutes unattended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_258741
50,Took too long for this review!!,This was the best massage ever!! Came in with a migraine and left dancing!! Will be back on next trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegasdiva1
50,Heaven within the hipsters!,"Great location, easy parking, and a massage that was just outstanding. The area has changed so much since I've lived here but it's still chill. Gigi was my therapist and the girl knows what she's doing. I have had massages in fancy spas before but this place is so low key and did I mention the price? 48.00 bucks for an hour! Check it out, you will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbysue
