50,Grand Canyon Sunset Tour,"My wife and I decided to take the Grand Canyon Sunset Tour to see a National Landmark we had never seen but always wanted to. Our tour guide Kristin was exceptional! Shewas very professional, courteous, funny, accommodating and knowledgeable about the Grand Canyon and beyond. Ginny & I experienced the tour of a lifetime. Thankyou Kristin and Happy Trails to You.
