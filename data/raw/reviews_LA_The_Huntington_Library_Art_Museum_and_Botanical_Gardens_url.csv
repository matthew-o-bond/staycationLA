30,Amazing Gardens - Avoid Staff / Employee Interactions,"We were members for years.The gardens and collections are spectacular.We had one too many unpleasant experiences with condescending and imperious staff.Not ALL of course, but some and enough to make the thought of going unpleasant.We cancelled our membership.Amazing place though!",Will
50,"Relaxing, wonderful time",My family and I made the mistake of putting aside only a few hours to visit Huntington Gardens. We could have easily spent a couple days there. The Gardens complex is huge and informative with many locations that allow for a meditative break from the stresses of the day. The museum was very interesting and provided significant learning opportunities. We used the electronic tour guides which provided a rich variety of details concerning the displays.If I lived in Pasadena this would definitely be worth a membership.,1CoolHiker
40,Several surpirses,"Visited on 14 March- the day the institution implemented a ""purchase tickets on line"" only policy, so we were taken aback by that info when we arrived. Not to fear, we used our smart phone to purchase them, although we required the help of an employee to get to the right page. (and it took her some time to finally find the right link for ticket purchase.) Unfortunately, because of Covid-19, both the library and museum were closed - which is understandable. Fortunately the gardens remain open. However, despite the fact that 2/3rds of the Huntington complex is closed, the ticket price for entrance remains the same. Although we absolutely loved the gardens, it still seems a bit of a rip off to continue charging as if everything was open and available to the paying public. Perhaps a 10 or 15% discount would be appropriate-not asking for 2/3rds off.",OREN R
50,Excellent gardens,"beautiful gardens, especially liked the dessert area since we don't have that at home, other highlights were Japanese and Chinese gardens, good for families with kids,",nctrailrunnermom
50,One of the best,"Amazing garden. Large, well kept and lots of different areas. Some of the gardens within this could stand on their own anywhere. Of particular note are the Japanese garden, large and beautiful, The Chinese garden probably larger and being extended, some serious money has been spent on this project. The desert garden was stunning when we visited in February and is about an acre site alone. We, unfortuneately only had tome to scratch the surface here as touring and passing through. We did deliberately include this in our itinerary, it is one of the '1001 gardens to see before you die'! The childrens garden is also worth a look even if you havent got any with you, it is well done and not 'just' a playground with climbing frames, a good sensory area.The entrance fee of $25/21 weekdays adults/seniors and $29/24 at weekends is well in keeping with other 'attractions' in California we found. Nothing is cheap and for potentially a days entertainment and this standard, thats ok. There is the art gallery and library included as well.It might be an idea if they did do a separate garden and gallery admissions and a combined offer for both.",Gardengel-IoW
50,Tea room,We dined at the tea room and had a nice lunch. The tea was fine and the sandwich platters was great. Lovely time was had by us three. You can also have a glass of wine or Prosecco.,Jeffrey W
50,Beautiful Gardens and Great Tea,"The Huntington is beautiful and I imagine it will get even better as the weather warms up. If you are able to plan in advance, I recommend doing that for the free day. On the first Thursday of the month, entry is free. To get free entry, you must reserve your entry on the 1st of the previous month. (So for free May entry, you should reserve a ticket on April 1st). We went and had tea on the March free day, which was lovely and the staff was very kind and professional and the tea, sandwiches, and pastries were all delicious. From there, we wandered through the herb garden, Japanese and Chinese gardens, and the library. There is even more to see and I recommend keeping your whole afternoon free to see everything you'd like. There were already many beautiful blossoming flowers and trees in early March and I'm sure there will be more through the spring and summer.",ReiyaB
40,Fantastic Botanical Gardens!,"I love this botanical gardens! So beautiful! I especially love the Japanese & Chinese Gardens. The museums/galleries are good also.My only complaint is the high ticket prices! Outrageous! Too high! So, I only go there once every couple years.",Backpacker
50,Always beautiful,"The grounds are always immaculate. The Rose's were just budding, camellias and cherry trees in full bloom. They have expanded the entrance area with more dining options. Recommend tickets ahead of time.",Ron C
40,Birthday tea,"This was our 1st visit to the Huntington library grounds and tea Room. We went to celebrate my birthday. It was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed the Tea and the service. Also enjoyed walking around the grounds of visiting the museums. Can't wait to go back again. You need reservation for tea on weekend, it was very busy. Lots of people waiting. Also there are stairs at entrance, I didn't see disabled entrance, double check before going w / anyone in wheelchair.",Barbara C

20,Huntington Policy of Killing Coyotes,"What a beautiful gem of a place; however, the following was brought to my attention:""Despite stating that it knows of no instances in which coyotes...have acted aggressively toward Huntington visitors or staff, The Huntington has for years maintained a ‘coyote abatement program,’ in which it pays a private trapper to snare and kill coyotes on its property.""When The HSUS, Project Coyote, and Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) offered to help develop and implement a more humane, non-lethal approach to addressing conflicts with coyotes, The Huntington refused.""Before I spend any more money at the Library, or further promote it on social media, please publicly state the Library’s policy regarding the destruction of coyotes.",TravelPhun.com
50,Wonderful old world mansion and gardens,"Back in the day a few people, probably out of smarts, and a lot of luck and hard work amassed some sizable fortunes. This is a wonderful example of what one fortune was used for. The gardens are particulairy nice and the library has some amazing historical items.",chriskrueger100
50,Very good garden tour. Worth it,We loved the gardens. It can take a while to walk the whole thing. The Chinese and japanese gardens were the hit of the tour.Plenty of bathrooms around is a plus.,Gary B
50,Beautiful Gardens and Outstanding Museums,"Great place to spend the day, the gardens change with the seasons and are always beautiful and well groomed. It has been a couple of years since we have been here so were pleased to see the growth of the Chinese Gardens. We were fortunate to attend during Chinese New Year so there were additional activities including Chinese Musicians and dancers. It is difficult to see everything in a day so plan to spend the whole day here.",csarchibald
50,A terrific day trip!,"We spent the day strolling through gorgeous gardens, the library with its historic displays, a couple art museums, a superb gift shop and enjoyed a delicious lunch at the 1919 Cafe when we needed a break.",Mr_Terbillion
50,LOVE THE HUNTINGTON GARDENS AND ART!,Love the Desert Garden- looks like a cactus garden taken out of a Dr. Suess Book. The Cafe on site was adorable with great expresso and great service. The gift shop is huge and beautiful,Yolette S
40,Enjoyable walk & scenery,"Wear comfortable walking shoes for an enjoyable trek through the grounds. My initial thought was how nice can a cacti garden be? We’ll to be sure the condition of the cacti & color throughout this section of the grounds is amazing! Something to see at least once. The Japanese garden was also something to see. When the roses are in full bloom. That must be something to behold. It was early January so some of the lawn areas were a bit stressed, but still nice to walk along all the well maintained walkways. I particularly enjoyed the mansion with all the paintings & artifacts. The library offered a lot of local historical materials to view. If in the area and you enjoy gardens and walking, you won’t be disappointed. All the staff members were pleasant and helpful.",JJP
50,A must-see,Came to this location as a child some fifty years ago. It has grown immensely - both in size and fauna. Beautiful gardens. Take a few hours and relax amongst some of the most beautiful plants nature has produced. The hummingbird exhibit in the Children's Garden is fun to sit and watch as they buzz by your head to fly from feeder to feeder.,CarinB
50,"Charming garden, must see when in LA","What a charming garden with varieties of ethnic theme gardens and architecture. We just love to stroke around this garden with endless garden themes and beautiful flowers. We came after church in February and the cherry blossoms are booming. It is so nice to enjoy nature without going out of the city or go out of the country for that matter.Here in Huntington library, we were able to experience Japan and China without going out of the country. The Japanese garden are full with cherry blossoms that made we feel like in Japan. This garden is a family scene in many Hollywood movies.In a few minutes of walk, we were already in the CHINESE garden. While part of the garden is still in construction, the lake with bridges and the pagodas created a Southern Chinese Garden theme park. We felt like we were in Suzhou, a water city not too far from SHANGHAI. Not just experiencing the garden, we were able to sample some Southern Chinese dumpling dishes here in the garden. They have a very authentic Suzhou style restaurant.The Chinese garden is expanding with new construction of the new court yard. We can’t wait to see the finished court yard garden where we will be able to truly immerse into the Chinese culture experience.",regis k
50,A great way to Spend a sunny day,This large complex is delightful to visit. The various botanical gardens are so beautiful. The Chinese garden and Japanese gardens are so picturesque. We enjoyed watching the hummingbirds on the feeders. The museums within the complex are also well worth a visit. The art works and the collection of period furniture is amazing. You need a whole day there to see everything.,mrsmon2016
50,A must do,"This place is just incredible worth overtly penny. Through the website you can book a free ticket every first Tuesday of the month. Even if you have to buy the ticket, it's worth every cent.From awesome paintings to incredible artifacts, to gorgeous and incredibly well maintained gardens. I spent there a whole day without even realising it.",Marianna Stefani
50,Take Time to Enjoy the Beautiful sights.,"They have different pricing from student to senior. An adult will pay $25 to enter, but it is worth the money. Plan on spending about 5 hours here if not more. We went in January and wished we had planned more than the 4 hours we spent there. There is so much to see. There are several museums which are all in doors, an art galley, and a library along with the beautiful gardens. In total it is said to be 207 acres. Make sure you get a map when entering to find your way around. Even in January, the gardens were beautiful. They are divided into different areas, such as the palm garden, rose garden, desert garden, Japanese, and Chinese garden, just to name a few. You will want to take pictures. We saw strollers and wheelchairs, so yes the paths are accessible. You will learn the history of how this all came to be, as the museums have FREE audio tours. There is a restaurant on the grounds, although we never stopped. We did see people with back packs, so we assumed it is OK to take them in. If you have a free day be sure to make it one of your stops while in the area.",boysma
50,Fantastic Place,It was a beautiful day and even though it was January the Huntington was beautiful! We visited the library and the art museums and several of the gardens. We had tea & lunch at the Rose Garden Tea Room. I hope to visit again in the spring when the trees a re blooming.,NBleds
50,So much to see,"The gardens have so much to see. If you go during the blooming season, March and April, it will be hard to find a place to park. It was crowded and not much was in bloom. The Library has some wonderful rare works that you just have to take your time there to see it all. Definitely will come back again.",CED5527
50,Amazing grounds,"Laid out on a beautiful tract of land near Pasadena, the gardens are amazing. We spent most of our time in the Japanese garden and Chinese garden. The bonsai tree section is amazing. The desert garden is also must see. After a long stroll thru the gardens, visit the library to see important historical books like the Guttenberg Bible. Take heed, it can get hot out there. Bring sunscreen, a hat and or a parasol.",jim590

50,"A superb day of gardens, art and antiquity documents, great for the whole family","Visiting the Huntington estate is among the most valuable and beautiful activities in the Los Angeles area. The gardens alone, containing an immense collection of beautifully installed plants from all over the world, are something special. The desert garden contains specimens which almost certainly inspired Dr. Seuss, and they bloom in winter, when much of the rest of the garden is dormant (but still beautiful). Of special interest in the gardens are the large Japanese garden and a newer Chinese garden. Each has its own character. Be sure to peek inside the Japanese garden house for a glimpse of formal Japanese traditional living. And in the Chinese garden, pay close attention to the ever-changing floor mosaics; the patterns are unique and beautiful. No one misses the large, formal rose garden.But the Huntington is much more than the gardens. Be sure to visit the mansion itself, and tour both levels, not just for the architecture, but for the incredible European art collections inside. There are thousands of artifacts, pieces of rare and unusual furniture, books and enormous wall-hanging tapestries, all tastefully displayed. Don't miss the stained-glass stairwell wall imported from England.There's also a contemporary and modern art museum on the grounds (between the Chinese garden and the mansion).And the Huntington Library contains an unusual display of very old works - many originals - from Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens and more contemporary authors, including their handwritten notes in some cases. Some of these date to the 1300s. On display also is a huge original Audubon illustrated bird book, and a very rare illuminated edition of the Gutenberg Bible. The curators have created engaging narratives for these works, which makes them accessible even to young readers.It's easy to spend an entire day at the Huntington. There's plenty of free parking, a large gift shop with intriguing items, and an overwhelmed cafeteria serving healthy options for lunch. There are also smaller (also crowded) cultural cafes in the Japanese and Chinese gardens.Admission is $25 for adults on weekdays, but weekends are a few dollars more. Admission includes entree to everything. It also includes very worthwhile, free volunteer-led walking tours of the gardens; highly recommended. Audio tours are available for an extra charge.The Huntington is a place to glimpse what life was like for the ultra-rich in the 20th century. But it's also a place where there's enough diversity to prompt return visits.",Projournalist
50,Awesome Gardens,It was our first trip to the Huntington and we weren't disappointed. Even though it was mid-January and many plants aren't blooming yet it was still beautiful. Our favorite areas were the desert and jungle gardens but the entire park is terrific. The feeling of serenity was everywhere. We will be back for the roses.,Michael O
50,"Do a Tour, especially if your first time to The Huntington","I am a member, but had never taken an official tour of The Huntington. With an out of town friend, we chose to do The Estate Tour. Well worth the time and money. You are escorted around the grounds mostly when the general public has not, yet, been allowed in. You get a great overview of the history and property.There are various tour opportunities, some more specialized than others and some are free. Either way, I would take one!",JR125
50,Beautiful gardens and excellent tour guide!,"I went to the gardens by myself to kill a few hours before meeting with a friend, and was lucky enough to get on a docent-led tour that was fantastic. We went through several of the gardens and they were beautiful!",Annika T

50,EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE,"Another amazing place to visit. We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the garden area including the Chinese Gardens, which were beautiful. We also enjoyed seeing the original Guttenberg Bible, the Canterbury Tales and the Audubon drawings. The exhibits were wonderful. However, be prepared to do some walking. Gift shop was nice and there were places to eat if you get hungry.",HARRY M
50,This was a hidden GEM!!!!,"Going here one member in the group wanted to uber back to the hotel and skip this part of our organized tour. We were ALL glad we did NOT! What an amazing place! The roses were in bloom and we enjoyed seeing many varieties (!) with names and heard many details from our docent. They are expanding and adding true traditional Chinese gardens! It's all going to be even better. The gardens are too large to enjoy them all in a day - we didn't even make it inside - outside was too grand. The gardens, streams, paths, roses, other flowers and so many GRAND vistas! We all enjoyed this so much! Don't miss out!",pebbleskip
50,Beautiful gardens and galleries!!,"It’s a MUST when visiting Pasadena. The ground is vast, with many beautiful gardens and galleries, you can only see few of them in a day. It’s smart to study the map, make plans and priorities.If you like art, Norton Simon Museum by downtown Pasadena has better collection. It’s small, but the paintings and sculptures are precious!",Frances Q
50,Wear your walking shoes!!!,"Loved the Garden area the most, especially the huge new Chinese area. The rose gardens were also awesome, with everything meticulously maintained. Put on your walking shoes to visit, because it's a huge venue. It feels like you're far from the city!! Our docent was extremely knowledgeable and made our visit more enjoyable.",paharlen
50,WOW!,"What a beautiful oasis in the middle of such a busy city. The grounds are lovely and so diverse. In addition, the Library and Museum are worth spending time here. Each garden was so different and the docents were very helpful.",golftaxi
50,Put this on your list of Places to visit,"I wish I had discovered this place sooner. I was blown away by the beauty of the garden and museum. I am debating which garden was my favorite: Japenese, Chinese, Rose, Desert. I think the Desert was my favorite. I would say bring walking shoes and be ready to get a few steps in, this place is big. If you have a great camera bring that as well along with water and snacks. I think this would be a great place for a picnic. Finding parking will be a challenge on busy days. Additionally, if you purchase tickets online be prepared you will still need to customer service and get a sticker.",Ricardo
50,Amazing Gardens,"This is a beautiful oasis in the north-east of Los Angeles. We just had 3 hours to visit, however you can easily spend a whole day here. My children were fascinated by the Library. Don't miss the Japanese Gardens. Parking is limited so be prepared to drive around for a spot.",Azhar M
50,See the world through gardens,"It was a hot day. The shade and ponds in the gardens made it enjoyable nonetheless. The Desert, Japanese and Chinsese gardens pleased us the most. In the former residence, modelled on a clasic English country house, is filled with top quality 18th-Century furniture and paintings. The only inconvenience is that you will have to go nearly back to the entrance to get lunch.",jarchcun
40,Very nice,I would say that the most impressive part here was the library but the art collections were certainly nice too as were the gardens. It was nice to breathe some fresh air after having spent 10 days straight in LA... Some of the gardens were in repair which was the only downside.,TPAT75

50,Huntington: unique and excellent,"This place is great in every respect. Amazing landscapes combined with excellent museums focusing on different things from science to history to art. It's worth repeat visits because there's more than can be appreciated at one time. If I lived in LA area, I'd go there weekly.",DDD
50,Stunning,The new additions to the Chinese garden area are fabulous. They are still expanding. The artisans work is astounding with each small pebble being placed by hand. Incredible.,AE077640
50,Beautiful place,This place was so beautiful. It would be a great place for people that are photographers as it seems the entire place is picture perfect! There is a lot of walking to get from one exhibit to the next but it was worth it. We only went through a couple of the museums and only the Chinese and Japanese botanical gardens but they were beautiful!! We went on a day that was around 98 degrees outside so I don't recommend that but I would definitely go back during a cooler time like maybe spring.,Rhianna B

50,Treasure trove of literature and science,"Fascinating lives are behind this brilliant institution of libraries, art galleries, gardens and scientific research.We were very taken with Huntington Senior and his nephew who continued his work. And married his uncle’s widow, with both then devoting themselves to philanthropically expanding the foundation.A wonderful collection of documents and manuscripts is in the exquisite Library. Rare publications are highlights, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.Marvellous art works are displayed in the home that, in its own right, provides a cogent window onto the comfortable lives of the wealthy.Seminal scientific research and preservation is undertaken. Many thousands of flora have seeds frozen at liquid nitrogen temperatures, to safeguard the plants for future generations.The multiple gardens exemplify beautifully a myriad of flora, including spectacularly a plethora of desert varieties.",permia

We like the 1919 Café too.",Rose H
50,Beautiful!,"We visited on a Sunday in November 2019. What a nice day! There's a variety of things to do on the site: gorgeous gardens, interesting museums, the library, etc. We spent about 3 hours. First, we explored one of the museums, with an emphasis on European Art; the building was gorgeous and the art quite good for a museum of this size. Docents were very helpful. Second, we explored several of the gardens--it was really interesting to see how a botanical garden in California features different plants than you find elsewhere. The Japanese garden was beautiful, and the rose garden was also pretty. Third, we visited the gift shop. It is the best museum gift shop I've visited! It was merchandised in a fun and clever manner and had a superb variety of home items, cards, jewelry, etc.; I was able to find several gifts for friends and family. A most enjoyable afternoon; I would definitely recommend.",brmusicman
50,Park and library,"The Huntington Library is a beautiful place. I went there one month ago. I saw art, a lot of books, the park and the museum. I would recommend this place to others. We can see the gallery, the flower garden, the pond, and a lot of cacti. You can enjoy it.",Austin C
50,take the entire day to see all of this beautiful location,"If you've never been here, do yourself a favor, grab some comfortable shoes and spend the entire day. Theres just so much to see. Every variety of garden you can imagine, japanese, tropical, desert, etc,....Grab some lunch (and rest) at one of several dinning areas, all of which have great food. I'd personally recommend 1919. The food is really good and very affordable. For the rest of the afternoon, take in the amazing art collections spread over multiple buildings. This is truely an amazing place. It's a must see for anyone visiting the area.",Don B
50,A Beautiful Part of California,"Amazing Place! To have that much space, gardens and huge buildings in the middle of L.A. is crazy. The furnishings and collections are a unique historical look at the financial giants of the late 1800's in California. We watched the information film at the entrance area which explained Huntington's life. The galleries are well organized.",lynndds
50,So many treasures; wonderful setting,"This was my favourite excursion during a five-day trip to Los Angeles.It gave me the experience that a Greek must have visiting the British Museum: what on earth are all our treasures doing here!But it does have a lot of treasures. I nearly skipped the library itself, but was so glad that I didn't. There are a couple of books on display that are pivotal documents of Henry VIIIth's creation of the Church of England in the 16th century.And I clearly wasn't the only person who didn't want to leave the room full of full-length portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds. It wasn't just the quantity or consistency of the collection; some of them were wonderful, characterful portraits.I love seeing portraits by John Singleton Copley when I'm in the US. I just don't see them anywhere else. There's a beauty here: the Western brothers.The gardens are stunning and put most other botanical gardens to shame. I don't know enough about plants to know whether there were rare varieties on display, but what was there was varied and beautifully presented. The Chinese, Japanese and desert gardens were especially enjoyable.It was an easy one-hour bus journey from the centre of LA and then a very pleasant walk past detached houses and manicured gardens.",PhilKennedy

Lots to keep kids interested and involved if not always dry... Some streams and ponds to attract them. But it was a sunny and warm day so their shoes and clothes dried out.Most attractive to me were the Chinese Garden and Desert Garden. But in our company others found different places equally pleasant.If we were in the area for longer perhaps a membership would be in order since the fees for a one-time visit were quite pricey for children as well as adults. However, we spent the better part of a day there, brought a picnic lunch that we enjoyed on benches in the shade and made the best of our time there.",bfindysz

50,270 acres of joy,"The Huntingdon is close to Pasadena. We booked tickets online in advance which saved valuable time once we arrived, as there seemed to be queues for everything at reception. I then asked a docent for advise about the best way to tackle such a large site which was time well spent.We walked through the impressive Cactus Garden, got slightly lost in the Subtropical Garden and made our way to the Japanese garden, followed by the Chinese Gardens. We stopped for an okay lunch there at the Dumpling and Noodle House. The Cactus Gardens were extensive, most of the plants were labeled, we took lots of pictures here. The highlight of the Japanese Garden is an aesthetically pleasing Japanese 'fort' with the most impressive collection of bonsai specimens.The American pavilion has to be one of the finest collections of American art and artefacts I have ever visited. We were a party of 5 which is hard to please and everyone enjoyed their time there. We spent at least an hour there and could have easily spent longer.We skipped the European Art and Library because we were tired and the gardens were delightful. There is an extensive shop with tasteful gifts. If you are thinking of going try to find accommodation near by, go early, wear a hat and bring some water with you. Prioritise what you would like to see, in relation to the seasons and can do.",Catherine M
50,"Huntington Library, Museum and Botanical Gardens is an amazing must see!","Living in the north county San Diego area for over 34 years now, I’ve always wanted to go to the Huntington Library, Museum and Gardens. I’ve also wanted to stroll through Pasadena stopping in as many antique shops and trying as many restaurants as possible.We finally got a chance for my birthday this September. We spent an entire day strolling through the gardens, even though I was in a wheelchair, and enjoyed every single minute of it. We took so many photos and so many videos because there was so much beauty around us we had to try to capture it! The only bad thing in the gardens unfortunately, was the Japanese garden area. It was not wheelchair accessible nor handicap accessible so we really didn’t get to see anything there. If you go plan on spending at least one full day doing the gardens, and the tea room and then possibly an additional half to full day to stroll through the library, museum and gift shop.We had lunch in the Rose Garden Tea Room. The variety of teas that we chose were wonderful. The food was great, and they even accommodated some changes we needed to make because of dietary restrictions and one of us being a vegetarian. The staff was warm and welcoming and even decorated a special cupcake with happy birthday on a chocolate disk with a candle too for my special day!After lunch since the day was getting on, we hurried back to the museum to see the restoration of the blue man painting. They’ve done an excellent job gathering the information needed for the public to understand what’s being done to restore the painting. They even show X-rays so you can see what was originally on the canvas before the blue man and some of the damages and what they’re doing to repair it. The other paintings in the museum itself or mine blowing. Again don’t miss the opportunity to visit the museum.Of course we had to make time to visit the gift shop on our way out, which is filled with wonderful items. My wonderful guy bought me a beautiful tea cup to remember the outing and celebrate my birthday.The day ended much too quickly and we wish we had had more time at the Huntington. We got there when the gardens opened and left as they were closing but wished we had another day to come back. We will definitely go back so that we can finish seeing the rest of the gardens as well as more of the museums.",J Weeks
30,Disappointing,"Some of the art in the art collection was well worth visiting. And the collection itself was nicely hung. But the gardens, what a disappointment. We were very surprised to find that many other gardens we had visited around the world were so much more attractively planned & well, just more beautiful. Plus signage while exploring, was basically nonexistent or rarely stumbled upon. We consistently had to examine our map & often that just barely helped us find our way. N.A. real disappointment.",310Andy018
50,Beautiful,This was a surprising treat. The gardens were amazing and the art was fantastic. I would highly recommend it!,swaffy
40,Big time commitment may be worth it.,"Be in decent shape; you’ll do plenty of walking. General flat or mild slopes. World class galleries. Some of the gardens are a photographer’s dream, others meh. Some great sculpture here and there. $20 at the door! Decent but expensive cafe, and perhaps the largest gift shop I’ve ever seen at a museum. Highest prices, too! This place is not for everyone. I was fine. Free parking!",Gregory R
50,You almost forget it is where Henry Huntington lived due to the awesome gardens.,I love coming here and of course i have a membership because i bring all my visitors here to come see these wonderful gardens along with Henry Huntingtons collections of art pieces and his own personal home.,Road14655454310
50,"Outstanding, not to be missed","The best place I visited in Los Angeles. Our party of 5 (2 in their 20's, 2 in the 50's and 1 well over 70) agreed this was the best day out in Los Angeles.Do plan to be there for the whole day, open from 10-5, every day except Tuesday. Do buy your tickets on line and in advance so as not to waste time when you arrive. Go early to make the most of the 270 acres. Do go to the American Art pavilion. Do not miss the Cactus Garden or the Bonsai Collection in the Japanese Garden the bonsai collection is breathtaking. Do allow time for getting lost and enjoying your time there.Do wear good shoes, and a hat, bring water. Plan your route so as not to miss anything, i spoke to a docent to plan our route taking into account the season, weather and group fitness.",Catherine M
50,A lovely place to spend the day!,"This garden offers not only art museums, places to eat, a number of different style of gardens; Japenese, Chinese, Australia, Desert, Rose and Herb and a great gift shop! It is not inexpensive, but it is a place where you can spend the day and an enjoyable at that!The property also houses Huntington's original home which currently houses the original art piece of Blue Boy.",Sherry L
50,Old world elegance in the new world,"If you ever have the yen for old world splendor and grandeur but want to skip the transatlantic flight, one option is to visit this stately gardens and library hidden in a residential neighborhood in San Marino. The garden is immaculately maintained, boasts statues and fountains and manicured lawns, and even serves afternoon tea in the Rose Room. There is a pretty decent children's garden for the little ones, and recreations of historic Japanese and Chinese gardens. Consider this the more upscale alternative to the Los Angeles County Arboretum.",MWTTC
50,Beautiful place,You really have to give yourself a lot of time to be here seeing your paying quite an expensive entrance fee. It is huge so wear comfortable shoes. There is a cute children’s area. The signs to get from one place to the other are poor and if you’re elderly or need a trolley ride there aren’t that many stops and they come around every half an hour. Chinese and Japanese gardens are beautiful.,Allegrastravels
50,Best place to visit in LA,"My husband became aware of this place before we travelled and it went to the top of our to-do list. On the flight from Australia I sat next to an LA local who was surprised we knew of it and said, ""It is the best place to visit in LA"". Our family ages from 10-50's and we all loved it. The gardens are magnificent, Japanese and Chinese a highlight. The volunteers in various spots tell you about the plants, we met a lovely chap in the herb garden. There are a variety of eating options. The buildings are beautiful, vistas glorious and art wonderful. We loved in particular the American art. It was fantastic, and iPods gave excellent commentary. We spent the rest of our trip trying to find more American art, but sadly most galleries are focussed on European.We're heading back to LA in 2020 and Huntington is top of our list for a repeat visit. We spent a full day last time and only did a few specific gardens, so another full day is planned.We'd taxied out there from La Brea. When leaving the information desk girl happily installed an Uber app for us and showed us how to use it. The Uber was less than half the price, and we used it for the rest of our stay. We found it way more convenient, cleaner and friendlier than traditional cabs.",GQHQ
50,Stunning!,"Wow, what a fantastic place!We visit botanical gardens all over the world and this one is simply stunning.About 30 minutes from L.A. In Pasadena, easy to get to and lots of parking.Food/drink outlets on site.Make sure you have enough time to see everything though because in August the gardens close at 5pm which is plain ridiculous! :-(",Andalucia02
30,"Pretty, pricey gardens","Several exhibits here including American art, European art, gardens, and a library with original documents on display. Wear comfortable shoes to explore it all as the gardens and buildings are spread out. Some interesting art, rooms, and gardens. Map could use more detail. Spent about 2 1/2 hours there before it closed. Beautiful garden with statues of the Gods but sadly lacked descriptions. Staff were nice. Interesting gift shop. A bit pricey but there are several exhibits. Free parking.",Donna D
50,"Spectacular garden, library and museum!","This visit was a highlight of my Los Angeles visit! The gardens are incredible and extremely varied, with 120 acres of botanical delights. There is an amazing collection of American and European art and an impressive research library. The gift shop is large and has a variety of items at all price points. There are many dining options, with sensitivity to taste and food sensitivities. A real treasure!",abs
50,Plan to spend a good chunk of time,"The Huntington property is vast, 100 acres of gardens, a European art museum, an American art museum, a gallery and the library. It officially opens at 10 am, but many people arrive at 8 am. At that time, the gardens do not have anyone checking for tickets, so people can roam the acreage at will. Clearly this is ok with the staff as the coffee shop opens at 8 am. Both museums were wonderful. This is the home of Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Pinkie as well as many other works of fine art. The Blue Boy display explains the efforts to conserve the painting...which needs it badly. The history of books exhibit in the library is fantastic, fascinating to read every display carefully. We loved it.",JimandCarla
50,Unbelievably awesome,"The Huntington is literally an awesome combination of unbelievable experiences. First, the Gardens: the desert garden is magical...from the impressive number of species to the sheer magnitude. Second, we were there shortly after the corpse flower bloomed. The flower is unbelievable and the conservatory is impressive with some very educational displays. Third, the artwork..An impressive variety of pieces displayed effectively. Being able to see the blue boy while still under restoration was unique. Last but not least the library. The manuscript and book collection was beyond impressive. The sheer number of important scientific documents that we saw on display cannot be duplicated anywhere. Plus Many great historical pieces.Truly a must visit... you will not be disappointed.",LSQRD1
50,So much to see.,"Tip 1. Park in the shade.Tip 2. Remember it's hot when walking so bring a bottle.Visited the exhibitions and was very impressed.References and exhibits to people from Birmingham UK (my home town) in the science part so added interest.Manuscripts from many hundreds of years ago to view.Loved the European art exhibits.Walked round the gardens. Although roses were in bloom, I imagine a visit in early June will show them at their peak.Lovely Chinese garden.Enjoyed the three hours spent on site. Kids then getting restless whereas adults could have stayed longer.Noted that the toilets were spotless.Admission.$25 adults x 4$21 student age 12$13 age 5$134 total.The tea room looked tempting but was quite expensive. I guess more for that special treat rather than the normal family snack so popped into the coffee shop at the entrance and kids had a cake and ice cream.Worth going. Recommended",Richard B
50,Huntington Visit,"Had a great time walking through out the gardens. The museum's and library was a nice break from hot sun. Get there as early as possible to enjoy as much as possible, the tickets aren't cheap.",Steve Vazquez
50,World Class Gardens and Art,"A local family member brought me here and I spent the day with my jaw dropped at all the beauty surrounding me. The Huntington is the perfect place for people who love art, culture, nature, and beauty. Can’t wait to return!!",Hayley B
50,Great exhibit of old manuscripts,I saw the Gutenberg bible as well as other very precious and historical printed book from Xv XVI century. Very nice and educational . Beautiful main room . Two entrances from theSouth side,Annaline
50,Can't miss in So Cal,You MUST visit the Huntington Library. Such a beautiful and history-filled place. So many people that live in So Cal have never even been here and they should! Tourists should include this location when visiting.,Napagirl7
50,Beautiful Grounds for Peace and Reflection,"Today, was my first visit to the beautiful Huntington Library. Idyllic grounds exceptionally maintained. The Chinese garden magically takes you away. It's hard to believe you're in Southern California. Be aware there is construction around the Chinese garden so the sound of loud machines drowned out any tranquility. Still, a must see! The project looks huge. I can't imagine it will be complete any time soon. Sadly, the Japanese garden was closed for maintenance, however as we walked the perimeter, we could see it was beautiful. The rose garden was breathtaking and that doesn't include how fragrant the area is. All you could smell was the wonderful aroma of every variety of rose and they were all in bloom. There is a large collection of artwork in the Huntington Art Gallery. With temperatures outside approaching 100, the gallery is the perfect place to take time out from walking the gardens and enjoy the European art while staying comfortably cool. Right behind the art gallery was a long grassy knoll planked by statues. You felt like you were walking the grounds of Pemberley.Eateries are throughout the garden. We ate at 1919 Cafe. The food was very good and surprisingly reasonable. Many options $10 or less. Plenty of choices to satisfy any appetite. I couldn't decide between the grilled peach salad or the watermelon salad. The woman behind the counter told me I could combine them. They were delicious and both with a light vinaigrette. Their Huntington Library special iced tea was delicious.You're sure to find the perfect gift in the store. They sell everything from Jane Austen and other literary greats' trinkets, to parasols, gardening decor, jewelry etc. I liked how the store appeared to be divided into sections mirroring the gardens.Last stop was the coffee shop. The Red Car. Perfect pitstop to pick up a snack and coffee (Illy) for the drive home.I'll be sure to visit again!",Carol S
50,Great day trip!,"We enjoyed all the museums and all the country exhibits from around the world. The care and thought creating and maintaining this place is amazing. Very friendly staff, interesting exhibits, good food. Just a great day out!",jwatt28
50,"Spectacular gardens, museum and library!","The Huntington is a rare gem and a spectacular place to visit! The gardens are varied and exquisite- Japanese, Chinese, rose and much more. The museum has incredible works of art and there is amazing outdoor sculpture throughout the gardens, including work by Calder and Bertoia.The dining options are varied and wonderful and the gift shop is superb!",abs
40,Lots to aee,"There is so much to see here. We spent 4 hours here and didn’t cover everything. The gardens are expansive and pretty, plenty of it is recognisable from movies. The art galleries and museum are impressive.There’s not much shade so bring plenty of sunscreen and water.$25 entrance fee.",Netster11
50,"Don’t miss this if you love art, history, gardens!","The Huntington Library in Pasadena is a must see if you enjoy history, art, botanical gardens, etc. The grounds are gorgeous and make the trek between the various venues delightful. This past year “The Blue Boy” famous painting by Gainsborough is being restored right there in the studio. It’s fascinating to understand how a painting completed in 1770 can be restored to almost the original look. You will not regret your visit.",CocoWashington
50,Excellent botanical garden,This botanical garden is amazing. So complete and beautiful with so many different types of gardens.,Natalia Morari
40,"Gorgeous, Vast, and Interesting","The collections were stunning, as were the gardens. We especially enjoyed the Science exhibits and the dessert garden. We visited an estimated two days before the anticipated blooming of the corpse flower—disappointing to miss it, but so cool to see it and learn about it.",cljcullen
40,"Beautiful gardens, but Blue Boy and Pinkie, too!","The gardens are varied and nicely kept, and a relaxing place to stroll or just sit to take them in. I also enjoyed the museum though where I saw the Blue Boy portrait by Thomas Gainsborough and Pinkie which was painted by Thomas Lawrence. I was mesmerized by these two portraits from the late 1700s. If you like art and gardens, it's worth a stop.",MartyW60
50,Weekend retreat,So much to see and do here at Huntington. Great history in all areas. Some people who enjoying all the Huntinfron had to offer while some where lying on the lawn reading books and taking in the tranquil space.,HKoreenRS37
50,Excellent history museum,This museum houses many old documents such as the Gutenberg Bible. The pieces are well displayed and easy to access even if there is a crowd. The grounds are lovely- 130 acres of manicured gardens.,Openstudio
50,A Disneyland of Culture,"I can't believe I have missed this LA attraction in the past. Since 'library' is in its name I think those looking for gardens and museums miss this site. At any rate there are three art museums and ten sub-gardens (Chinese, Japanese, desert, children's, rose, Austrian, tropical, semi-tropical, etc.) at Huntington. The upkeep of all is excellent. My favorite gardens were the Desert and Rose Gardens.The art collection is also exceptional. I thought it would be small but it is at least as large as the collection at Norton Simon. Much is made of the Blue Boy but they also have Turners.",Mark P
50,Simply Superb...10 stars!!!,"A wonderful combination of plants and culture. The cactus garden was the winner as the specimens are monstrous in size. That is not surprising since they are in their native habitat. There are also specimens of the world's largest flower in the greenhouse.The library was extremely impressive. Manuscripts from hundreds of years ago were well preserved. You need to spend an entire day or two, if possible, to see everything. Great value for the money! It is worth $50 or more per person.",Maureen M
50,Love this place!!!,"Hubby and I spent the entire day @ the Huntington. We loved it. We did the estate tour and our guide was very very knowledgeable. It didn’t seem like it was an hour and a half. The Euro art collection and the old books and manuscripts collections are extensive. We didn’t even get to see everything. The rose garden is to die for. We were looking for the oldest rose and found one that dates back to 1500 or prior. Also, we had tea at the Rise Garden Tea house which was superb. The Huntington Blend tea is so good.We really enjoyed the place. We’ll be goin back for sure.",SBGriffin090606
50,Gorgeous gardens and library,"Huntington gardens and library are one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring sites in the Pasadena area. The Library has art from everywhere and original science and literary works from Pasteur, Chaucer, Shakespeare - pretty much everyone you're studied in school! And a Gutenberg Bible! The gardens are magnificent - separated by 'type' of plants - like desert or Australian. All of the grounds are meticulously maintained. The Rose Garden is fantastic! However, if you go in the summer, it gets HOT. Be sure to wear a hat/sunscreen and try to go early in the day. The Rose Garden Tea Restaurant is a calm, quiet, welcome relaxing place to re-energize for more! Highly recommend!",catgetsdown
50,Gorgeous Place,"Expensive admission but worth every penny. This place is huge and beautiful, with so much variety - Chinese garden, Japanese garden, rose garden, cactus garden. . .we have been there twice so far and haven't even looked at the art galleries yet! The best gift shop of any museum I've ever been to, and I've been to a million of 'em. Excellent food in the main cafeteria.",manateelover2015
30,A good day on a tour of California,"Would have been a great day but extensive renovation work in the gardens marred the visit. We only found this when already inside. Went to the 1919 Cafe. Disorganised with the queuing system, no one around to assist. Unfortunately when we did get to a counter to be served the server was extremely unhelpful and only completed part of the order. The art collection was outstanding as were those gardens which were not being renovated.",jbphpsunnyholiday
50,One of the Best Tours in California,"We visited the Huntington Library, and found that there was no way to fully enjoy the entire 120 acre facility in one day. Everywhere we turned, we found something else to astound us.The Library offers a collection of books that you will never find anywhere else - everything from Galileo, to Copernicus, to Isaac Newton, to Albert Einstein. There are two Gutenberg Bibles, and one-of-a-kind books from virtually every discipline. The Library confronts you with science, literature, art, history, culture, to everything you could ever imagine.Moving on to the European art collection at the Manor House, you will find ""Blue Boy"" (under renovation), which itself is fascinating. Who knew that Blue Boy was painted with a shaggy mutt that added character and charm? The dog was painted over to focus more attention on the boy. The art collection includes portraits, landscapes, porcelain, silver, china, statuary, and fine furniture. The house itself is a work of art in process.Moving on to the American collection is a totally predictable assortment of art, coupled with totally unexpected surprises around every corner.There are acres and acres of gardens, including Japanese gardens, Chinese gardens, rose gardens, a desert, and many others. There is even an indoor sub-tropical display of plants. Note: count on getting damp from the humidity.I cannot say enough about the Huntington, except that I look forward to coming again on another trip.",GDL919
40,Great garden,Diversity is what counts.A nice walk through the gardens changed with some cooling down while watching art exhibits.Gardens are beautiful and well kept. Art wise I liked the presence of paintings by Dutch painters.Entrance fee was a bit pricy to my opinion compared to for example Simon Norton or The Getthy,Arno0571
40,"Beatiful gardens, with amazing art collection","July is probably not the time to visit this place, but for the limited amount of time we spent outside, the rose garden and Japanese garden were definitely worth enduring the heat. Beautiful gardens, so meticulously maintained. Unfortunately, couldn't endure the heat long enough to see the Chinese garden...But they have a great European art collection, in an amazing house that is a wonder in and of itself. And it has AC! Yay!Unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see the American art collection, due to time.Staff were absolutely helpful, friendly and considerate.The store and restaurant were free to access without buying a ticket. There is a check station further in, at the beginning of the garden area, where they check for your paid admission. The restaurant and store are before that.It's a stunning landscape, and a lot to take in. Some slight grade and slope changes; something to think about; can be tough in the summer heat for some people. The Japanese garden was almost in a ""valley,"" so to speak. Definitely more of an uphill walk to get back to the main rose garden area.Loved the grounds though. Would definitely go back, and hope to one day to take in the things I missed out on this last trip...",BrQ
50,A Must For Flora Lovers,"seriously, the gardens are so large that you really need a couple or more days to truly experience it all. Wow, so much to see and I would suggest going several times throughout the year to really see everytthing. Also, if you are looking for interesting Christmas gifts, I recommend the gift shop it is HUGE and has a very wide range of gits.",DonB_From_Calgary
50,Worth the price of admission!,"My brother brought us here and while getting the tickets, I thought that it was a bit steep. I did not know much about this place before. After spending hours enjoying the beautiful Desert, Japanese, Chinese Garden and its collection of art and rare manuscript, It was worth the price of admission. Chinese Garden has a cafe that served food and premium Chinese Tea. The collection of Bonsai tree at the Japanese Garden was amazing. Those who enjoy gardens, this is a must when you are in the area.",I_love_SF
50,Beauty and Grace,"I've had the pleasure of visiting the Huntington Library twice in my life, and both times I was left in awe of the amount of beauty that abounds in the place. You get a sense of peace and tranquility walking through the Rose Garden and the Japanese garden, and the Tea Room is fabulous.",Becky R
50,"One of best place to spend a day with garden and art, away from the jungle of Los Angeles guzzle and traffic jams.",It is one of the best art and garden in Southern California. Such spacious setting and nature provides an experience that is hard to find elsewhere. Highly recommended to spend a day here.,Victor H
50,Beautiful Gardens,We went there in June 2019 and it was a great place to spend a full day with the children. The grounds are beautiful with lots of fantastic photography spots.The children's garden is well worth a visit for young kids. My children had a lot of fun there!,Meiz
50,Beautiful Gardens,"Los Angeles is a big concrete city and going to Huntington Botanical Gardens is a breath of fresh air. The Chinese and Japanese Gardens are beautifu (although currently under construction), the Desert Garden and the entire complex. Good places to sit and eat and relax and other places throughout to just sit and enjoy the gardens. Worth a trip and great for families.",Kathy K
50,I've been here dozens of times and still haven't seem the whole place,"After visiting the second time I decided to get a yearly membership. This place is amazing to just stroll through on a quiet weekday. I love walking through the Japanese and cacti gardens. One day I will make reservations for the tea room, until then, I will be getting lost in the gardens. Parking is free and there are great coffee shops and restaurants not too far from the location.",Aaron
30,Too beautiful?,"This place is definitely beautiful from the Desert Garden to the Japanese and the Australian to the Rose Garden. Some places are so well kept, that it does not feel like nature any more. It is a wonderful place to relax (many benches!), see some art and get a drink, but it did not touch me. The richness made me a little itchy. You still have to pay $25 to get in.....",JohannesNL023
50,Great garden,"This was not on my due list while in Cali but I was told it is one that need be seen. I can tell you that unless your kids are into gardening stuff, flowers, art, a little educational science, then yes but otherwise it is more for grown ups or for a nice date with your significant other. I had a 4,6,14 year old with me and the moment my 6 year old stepped into the garden, he said “this is boring” and yes it is as they have nothing inside to entertain young children, unless I missed that part?But for grown ups, excellent place to get a good digital camera and get some memorable pictures, including the Chinese garden, Japanese garden (which I think was the best)I don’t have time to see the Australian or desert garden as I got there almost mid afternoon and this place closes at 5pm.I gave it 5 stars because of the set up, cleanliness and the serene atmosphere this place has, and like I said, an excellent place to take very great pictures no doubt!",mo75jo

50,Great Gardens,This library includes magnificent gardens meticulously kept. The Chinese garden is magnificent. The various buildings with priceless paintings and furniture are something to behold. The gift shop is also exceptional.,Bill K
50,Absolutely jaw dropping visit,"We had heard of this and were recommended to come. It's easy to spend two whole days here, such is the quality and quantity of exhibits.The galleries, of American art and European art, are world class. They do not try to cover every period or style of art, but are quite thorough in what they do. The descriptions of the paintings and objects are easy to read and well written and far from the usually pretentious. They show Gainsborough, Turner, Romney without fuss, they just appear round another corner.The layout is marvellous and easy to grasp.The library has a small (on display, at least) selection of staggeringly important volumes, from Gutenberg through Shakespeare to Aubudon.The gardens are fortunate to be situated in warm California, and are superb. The Japanese garden is absolutely authentic in feel ( I have visited gardens in Japan), and the 1200 varieties of roses leave you feeling almost overwhelmed.Allow a whole day to be absorbed, or more.",Donald G
50,Beautiful vibrant gardens!,"The Huntington encompasses an art collection, library with exhibits and over 100 acres of botanical gardens from around the world. We were there over 3 hours, and since it was a beautiful day outside, we did not see the art collections indoors. We strolled the beautiful grounds the entire time we were there! I am handicapped and use an electric scooter when traveling. Upon arriving and paying the entrance fee,we were given a detailed map of the grounds and were informed of things to see by one of the many volunteers that work there. We followed the map and the grounds were fully accessible. At one point we wouid have had to go a different way to avoid some steps but my family lifted my scooter up the 2 steps and we continued on our way! I believe there are parts of the Japanese gardens that were not accessible but the vast majority of the gardens were. Lots of places to stop and rest or just sit and enjoy the peacefulness and beauty. There are also a few restaurants and cafes to have lunch. I would highly recommend going here for anyone visiting the area!",SueAx57
50,I would move to San Marino just for The Huntington,"There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said before. I went on a day of lashing rain and still loved every second. The succulent garden, oh my. And, the new American Art wing, holy moly. And, the food in the restaurant is unreal. I wish I'd had 2-3 more days to spend here.",YankBritKiwi

50,The Rose Garden is Stunning in May,I have been to approximately 75 botanic gardens all over the world and the rose garden here is one of the best. I like the way they display the roses in mixtures rather than all one kind of rose in each bed.We had a toddler with us so also visited the children’s garden. Very well designed and quite playful.Look for the “spitting” fountains.The entire garden is huge so wear good walking shoes.,Mary Jo K

50,So much more than I imagined!,"Our timing was excellent: a beautiful day in springtime. Not too hot and not too cold. And everything was blooming! Wander this amazing place to see the gardens but also go into the various buildings ... an eclectic American art collection, European treasures, and of course quite the antiquarian collection. The gift shop is exceptional and worth a visit by itself. My daughter is a member and her membership got us both in free; if you think you'll visit more than one, be sure to look into a membership.",kleic

Home with art collection and library also fabulous. Much more expansive than expected. Plan to spend several hours to do it justice. Absolutely amazing!",Katie400
50,Be prepared to walk,Interesting but disappointed 😔 that Blue Boy is being restored and not on display. You can not see everything in a day. Research and plan what you want to see during the time you have available. 1919 is the best place to eat. There is an admission fee. Botanical gardens are impressive.,Debra B

You will see so many pieces of history from art to the written word.The fragrance of the roses and others flowers, the landscape of the Chinese and Japanese Gardens...just lovely. The Orbit Pavilion is a neat piece of architecture and so interesting as you hear the unusual sounds of satellites that are passing overhead, a symphony of noises! Our younger children enjoyed it just as much as we did. There is a Children's Garden, too. 1919 Cafe is good for family dining as there are many choices. A must see in Southern California.",Gerry D
50,Absolutely Beautiful,"Don't skip this. It's beautiful and so unique. The house is gorgeous. Well decorated. Good architecture. Lots of paintings and other artwork. The gardens are amazing. Don't skip the dessert garden. The Japanese Garden is the most beautiful and tranquil, but the dessert garden is also beautiful. The planning and creativity that went into creating all of this is exceptional. To see it all takes about four hours. That includes a stop for lunch. Lots of places to choose to eat. Also don't miss going to see the some of the rare books. There are so many things you won't see anywhere else all here in one place.",TW-44
50,Beautiful and relaxing visit,"We spent 5 hours wandering the gardens and museums plus spent an hour enjoying High Tea and could have stayed longer.From the roses in full bloom to the shady walkways, easy to walk paths and benches for relaxing, it was an enjoyable day spent during a reunion with old friends.",Carolyn W

Every time, we are stunned by the excellence of the event, display, demonstration itself, and also fully enjoy our ability to walk around the Chinese or Japanese or Jungle or Desert Gardens of The Huntington. This despite a 350 mile one way car travel. Nothing is really like it! The clubs that put so many of these are the Southern Breeze Tree & Stone and the California Aiseki Kai. 'Aiseki' means 'Lovable Stones'. Try it, you'll love it!",Linda B
50,Make a day of it!,"I recommend getting there early. Parking is free. See the library first. You can spend several hours in there, but I recommend you pace yourself and not spend more than an hour. The rose gardens are near the west side (exit) so stroll them before heading to the original Huntington estate home—now art gallery. Right now, the rose garden area is in bloom and phenomenal. Once again, the art collections on both floors can take hours to peruse. Afterwards, go get lunch. You’ve got a couple of options, but I recommend 1919 for fresh made choices like sushi bar, roasted chicken or salmon w/ sides or Mexican food or sandwiches & burgers. Eat outside on the patio to take in the edges of the succulent gardens and old growth trees. Work off lunch by strolling through the massive grounds. Highlights for me are the area with the turtle pond and grassy area for relaxing and the Japanese gardens with the little bridges and open pond & tea house. This can easily fill an entire afternoon. On your way out, stop in at the gift shop. Lots of unique and beautiful items. If you’re local, consider membership. It allows you unlimited entry, guest oases, discount at the gift shop and more depending on what level membership you get.",sacredmusic04
50,Spring at Huntington is fabulous!,"If you're anywhere near Pasadena (technically San Marino), you have to go see the cacti & roses (& lots of other stuff) in bloom. Just glorious!",Pat S
50,Absolutely beautiful,Take a tour if you can! Our docent was so knowledgeable and interesting. We took the Estate Tour which gives history of the Estate and an overview of the grounds. We enjoyed having a traditional tea as well!,Stephanie L
50,Outstanding!!!,"The two of us had visited in August last year when it was very hot and we did not do justice to the beautiful gardens (largely retreating to the air-conditioned galleries). Coming in April this year, we spent the morning focussed on the gardens, especially the Chinese and Japanese sections. The gardens and grounds were again exquisite and worth the admission alone ($21 each for us ""seniors"").We paused for a break at the excellently managed and staffed food court between visits to the respective art galleries. The collection of art by a couple was amazing. Also it should be stressed that the ambience was cordial with helpful staff/volunteers.Superb day out. Strongly recommended.",David A
50,Beatiful Art and More Beautiful Flowers,"We have been so many times, I can’t remember how many, but this was our first visit since the new entry plaza opened. There was a table to renew our membership, beyond was the membership and general admission windows. Also in the new entry is a store and education facilities. We headed west to the Conservatory and Children’s Garden. In the Conservancy are exhibits on the Plant Lab and rain forest. There were microscopes to look through and lots of informational signs. The Children’s Garden has exhibits for children and several unique fountains and water features. Behind is a construction site which I am guessing is for a new area.We continued to the Chinese Garden which we had seen before but always enjoy the tranquility. At opposite ends were buildings under construction so maybe there will be something new the next time we visit.Spring is a great time to visit the gardens. There were bright and beautiful flowers everywhere and we spent some time in the Rose Garden. There are over a thousand varieties of roses.We visited the American art galley and the Library, but I didn’t want to put my expensive camera case in a locker, so we skipped the European art gallery. Just south of the entry plaza is a temporary pipe and perforated metal structure (Orbit Pavilion) with relaxing music.",Kenneth L
50,Highlight of Our Trip to Los Angeles!,We were unaware that we were in for such a special treat! End of April is a wonderful time to visit Huntington Library--the cactii and roses were all in bloom and they were phenomenal. We spent 6 hours at the library (mostly in the gardens) and already look forward to a future trip. What a treasure! I only wish I lived nearby (instead of across the country) so that I could be a regular visitor!,Bedelmann
50,Impressive Botanical Gardens!,"Henry Huntington owned the Pacific Electric Railway, which was L.A.'s original ""mass transit"" system with streetcars all around L.A. He amassed a fortune and built the Huntington mansion and library on 207 acres in San Marino (Pasadena) with impressive gardens running throughout the property. One can easily spend an entire day at the Huntington and still not see everything. Parking lot is packed on weekends, so get there early (before noon). Food and souvenirs are on the pricey side.",Jerry Crawford
50,Breathtaking,We were in awe of this beautiful place. Lovingly created and maintained with surprises around every twist and turn. The bonsai trees in the Japanese garden were a treat.,conoreoinnolan
50,Relaxing Afternoon in the Gardens,"We started by walking the various gardens. The walks are easy for everyone and there are paths for those in wheelchairs, making accessible for all. The Japanese gardens are a favorite, with the tiered levels, waterfalls and ponds and of course the flowers/trees.Plenty of acres so it never felt crowded. We spent maybe 2 1/2 hours seeing almost all of it but missed some area, just because of time limitations on our schedule.Next visit, we'll start at the Library! The weather was too nice to start the afternoon inside this time. ;) Just wished they offered discount tickets in some way, at least seniors and children get a couple dollars off. I tried every way I knew but couldn't find any and they don't offer any reciprocal discount for members of other Botanical Gardens.",2016maryG
50,Rose garden was splendid,"We enjoyed the exhibits at the library as well as the many gardens. It was great to see one of the few copies of the original Gutenberg Bible. The roses were in bloom and looked fantastic. We also particularly enjoyed the Japanese gardens, although all of the gardens were beautiful. We’ve been to many other arboretums, and this was by far the largest and most extensive.",TB_Rays_fan_NJ

50,Beautiful,"The Huntington is just a beautiful place to spend the day in the different gardens and to see the art collections.The cacti has certainly grown and flourished since the last time I was here. The grounds of the Chinese, the Japanese and the children’s Gardens are beautiful! This place just has something for everyone to enjoy.It’s so serene spending the day here!",emlazo
40,Wonderful walk in the park,"Our family of 5 (3 teenagers) enjoyed a long morning walk around the great park. Truly an amazing collection of diverse plants arranged thematically so you really felt like being in that particular place. Being July and hot, we relaxed in the shade of the trees in the ticketing area. The Mansion is likewise well worth a visit. Spectacular art exhibits and a realistic look into the living of early 20th century riches. Even our kids were amazed :-)",MichaelBG
50,Wonderful day,"Beautiful grounds, plants, art! Wear good walking shoes! Plan on a full day of exploring the grounds and exhibits. Lunch at the 1919 Cafe was delicious and had many options. Get a Huntington Blend tea from Red Car, and browse the gift shop.",PJud80

Their Bonsaï collection was exquisite.On going Public restoration of the Gainsborough « Blue Boy «  master pièce.As well as a temporary Exhibition of an ItalianRenaissance work.",FPWhitePlains
50,Beautiful!!,"An amazing collection of art, including Gainsborough's Blue Boy and period furnishing and tapestries housed in a beautiful, turn of the century mansion. Not only are the house and art spectacular, but the gardens are wonderful. Be sure to allow enough time to wander through the paths and enjoy them. You probably need 3-4 hours to experience all the Huntington has to offer. There are various venues offering a variety of dining or snack options.",Travel92253
50,Take your walking shoes,We only had time for several of the gardens which were all spectacular. I wish that I had time for the galleries as well. Next time!,amasland
50,amazing place that rivals international botanical gardens!,"who needs to goto worldwide gardens, when there is one in the US that is amazing. Our family spent the whole day here touring the gardens and got a nice work out. In addition, the art collections and library was a bonus. We went in march ,spring break and there was a 10minute line. Weather was perfect and flowers were blooming. price of admission was reasonable, $25 for adult. and $21 for student (compared to other all day attractions but you got to love outdoors and nature and art history).also, ate at their food court which had reasonable prices for an attraction and lots of selections for the picky eater. love this place bc its not that crowded yet with tour groups.",charles n
50,Stunning place to get lost in,"Having visited on a weekday when it was intermittently raining, I basically had the place to myself. It was absolutely stunning. I particularly recommend the Japanese and Desert gardens. Though they really are lovely. It was a very peaceful experience, and I couldn't stop smiling to myself about how gorgeous they were. I only wished I had even more time to enjoy them. The art galleries were also really beautiful, and I discovered artists I hadn't been familiar with before but am anxious to see more of their work. The library's collection of historic manuscripts was interesting and could be visited relatively quickly. Yes it was pricey, but it was well worth it.",Chelsey G
50,Battle the crowds to enjoy this amazing place,"The down side of the Huntington is expensive and can get crowded, especially on weekends. The up side is that between the gardens, library and art, there is plenty to see, and it is so big, you are bound to be able to get away from the crowds at some point.",Nan D
50,I want to come back!,"We made a trip to the Huntington Library specifically to see the NASA Orbit Pavilion display (because I love satellites), but what I got was an experience far beyond my expectations.First, the Orbit display was breathtaking and because we got there early in the morning there was hardly anyone around.We were there about 3 hours and only saw a fraction of what this place had to offer. As you walk in, the greenery and olive trees create a safe haven for hummingbirds you can hear buzzing around. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking a moment to watch the video about how the Huntington Estate came to be. We watched it just before we left, and had we watched it first, I think it would have given another layer to the experience.The desert garden is beautiful, and where we spent most of our time. We passed the outskirts of the palm garden and enjoyed the serene ponds and creeks as we cut through the Australian garden to the Japanese garden. I loved the serenity of the Japanese garden and bonsai exhibit. I was saddened to see the lack of respect by others who carved on the bamboo despite the signage (and who needs a sign to know this isn't right?).We did not get to enjoy the library or the art museum but I have a feeling we'll be back again.Because we went on a Sunday morning, traffic wasn't as bad and it wasn't as crowded. We took a moment to stop at the gift shop before we left.One last tip - bring your hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.",Lori_C
40,Beautiful gardens,"Very Big. Though IT was warm and sunny when we visited, we still enjoyed Roaming the different gardens especially the Asian/japanese garden and the desert garden. The entrance fee was quite expensive ($25) but i think if given enough time (like the WHOLE DAY), I would have appreciated IT more. About 1 hour drive from LA Downtown.",DuchessDiaz
50,Always amazingly beautiful - no matter what season,"This institution is always such a pleasure to visit. The Orbit - what fun! The Chinese Garden is astonishing (the next phase is being constructed, and a lot of noise is somewhat disturbing, however); the Japanese Garden etc. We love to walk through the whole area and take tons of photos to show our friends at home.The ""Beautiful Science"" exhibit was exciting.",simivalley1699
50,wonderful place! perfect day,"I was expecting to visit a beautiful place, but I'm sure that huntington library and all the gardens are much more, look like paradise. desert garden is amazing, japanese and chinese gardens are gorgeous, camelias are poetic (roses weren't in season yet).It's true that's not very easy to reach the park, but you must try!",Heloisa B
50,The gardens were beautiful,"We arrived 2 hours before they close, so we only got the chance to see the gardens. The Chinese and Japanese Gardens were the most impressive.

50,What an amazing place!,"I loved this place, the gardens are absolutely gorgeous and huge! it was great just strolling and spending time enjoying the nature. The exhibitions are well curated and interesting, I liked that they are housed in different buildings so there is a clear definition of library/art.I did hate the ""restaurant"" though...the cafeteria-style is just too chaotic and all the peace achieved in the gardens dissipated.. it was so bad I just left without eating...",RGN_7228
50,A Must See Attraction !!!,"If you have time while you are visiting Pasadena, you really owe it to yourself to spend the day at this fabulous location. Great history.Great antiques everywhere!

Please go. you will be happy you did.",A3572SHrobertb
50,One day is not enough to see everything!!,"This was our first time so we took a docent tour to get a general idea of what we wanted to aim for for the rest of the day. Our Docent was so knowledgeable, so personable and gave us a ""big picture"" of everything to see along with the history of the Huntington family. The tour was only 90 minutes so that gave us the rest of the day to see the museums, library and almost all the different gardens which were amazing. The desert and palm gardens are beautiful and us having horticulture backgrounds we were in awe. We also loved the cafe for lunch. Beautiful seating outside and delicious pizza!!",SJCDUGANS
50,The perfect place!,"The library holds treasures that everyone can relate, heard about, or one is the original of what you read or are reading now. It is beautiful!The grounds are outstanding with many different gardens.",sherryelmo

50,"This is the ONE and best Museum, Library and Garden you must see in LA","We have visited many museums and gardens in the World: Paris, Rome, NY and many other cities. Huntington museums and gardens have exceeded all our exceptions. It is phenomenal. Each and every pieces of art have been chosen with exceptional taste, the home of Henry and Arabella Huntington is beautiful and all the gardens are gorgeous at all seasons of the year. The Library is unique with incredible authentic history documents. To top all this, there is a special exhibition of the 'Blue Boy Project' showing in details how conservation of paintings are done. The cafes and gift shops are images of the site, really awesome!",Multicolor
50,Must see,"You must go to The Huntington. This is worth visiting if you are young, old or in between, with or without children. Lots of different activities including walking in the different gardens (desert, Australian, Japanese, Chinese) which is outdoors and great for kids of all ages.The houses on the premises have furnishings and artwork and are most impressive. On a hot day, they offer respite from the sun.Adults pay $25 and students $21. I am not sure what the cost is for kids. This includes parking.We spent 2.5 hours walking around and could easily have spent more time.We were there on a weekday and it was not too crowded. I suspect it gets crowded on the weekend though.",MDXP
50,Remarkable Gardens & Museums,"This extraordinary complex has beautiful grounds with a series of special gardens—Japanese, Chinese, desert. The Library has stunning collections of first editions—Gutenberg’s Bible, Shakespeare’s First Folio, the Declaration of Independence, the Canterbury Tales—that visitors can view. The collections of early Americans art, crafts, and furniture is particularly well displayed and quite interesting. It is worth multiple visits.",Larry P
50,Huntington and the Estate Tour,"Awesome. Fantastic. The Gardens, the Library and everything about this place is pleasing to the eye (and stomach since the cafe is amazing).

50,Even more than I had hoped for!,"I had read that the camellias would be in bloom and that there is a nice collection here. That was all true but there is so much more! The gardens are fabulous, perfectly maintained, and so gorgeous. The library is amazing. I highly recommend visiting.",riverchaser11
50,"The gardens are fantastic, Recomended","We went to visit the gardens, and although in February there was still loads to see. We particularly wanted to see the flowering Camellias. Unfortunately they were already past their best because of the unusual heavy rain the previous week. We then went to the Japanese region which was superb, but for us the star was the desert area. There is so much to see we never got to see the art collections because we simply ran out of time. By the way the guide map they give you at the entrance is a guide and not particularly accurate, and more signage at path intersections would help",Alan R
40,Wonderful grounds and a thorough library,"I threw a dart at a map and found this place -- and I'm glad I did. The fragrant gardens are a delight to amble through, and if you're into strolling through galleries you can see Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy"" and a Gutenberg Bible. It's a nice diversion in the greater Pasadena area.",BillScurry
50,"For the book, art or plant enhousist","I had a few hours to spend before my flght back to Europe. A chef working at the Huntingdon Library, I met the evening before in the hotel bar, recommended me this place. I absolutely enjoyed my 2,5 hours visit, although this was way to short to see everything. So I had to limit myself to the library, the main house with the european art collection and dessert garden (in the rain). I would have liked to have more time ... The staff I met was very friendly and supplied a lot of interesting information about the place.

50,Feast for the senses - the legacy of a visionary,"The Huntington is a private non-profit founded in 1919 by Henry E Huntington, an astute businessman who built a commercial empire in Southern California.Born in 1850, Henry Huntington commenced his working life in 1872, working for his uncle Collis P Huntington, one of the four owners of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Henry represented his uncle’s business interests in San Francisco until 1902, when he relocated his headquarters to Los Angeles, two years after his uncle’s death.After moving to Los Angeles, with far-sighted investments in land, water, electricity and railroads, Henry began building his business empire. He grew the Pacific Electric Railway Co. (with its famous signature “Red Cars”) into the largest inter-city transport system of its time.In 1903 Henry purchased a huge swathe of land, the San Marino Ranch which he meticulously transformed into what today is The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens – an educational and cultural center set in the middle of 150 acres of beautiful gardens. He put together the core of one of the world’s finest research libraries, an astounding collection of art and gardens that have plants from across the world.In 1913 Henry Huntington married Arabella Huntington, his uncle’s widow. They were of the same age, and more importantly, she shared Henry Huntington’s passion for collecting – in fact, she became one of the foremost art collectors of her time.In 1919 the couple signed an indenture that transferred their San Marino estate with its collections of books and art to a non-profit educational trust. Arabella passed on in 1924 and her husband followed her in 1927 – thankfully, the Huntington collection has continued to grow.The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens was opened to the public in 1928, a year after Henry Huntington’s death.About half of The Huntington’s annual budget comes from a private endowment. It is further supported by sponsors – individuals, government agencies, foundations, business corporations.Every year some 1700 humanities research scholars use The Huntington’s resources. Apart from this, every year, school programmes see about 15,000 children take tours of The Huntington.The LIBRARY at The Huntington is a labour of love. It is one of the world’s largest independent research libraries with more than nine million items that span the eleventh century to the present. It comprises manuscripts, reference books, photographs and prints, plus a rare book collection.Here one can see the Gutenberg Bible circa 1455, early editions of Shakespeare, the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales circa 1410, original letters of Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Franklin.The Huntington’s ART COLLECTION is centered on European art of the 15th to the early 20th century and American art from late 17th to the mid-20th century. In line with Arabella Huntington’s special interest in European art, this collection is housed in The Huntington Art Gallery which was the erstwhile Huntington residence. The American art collection is in the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art.The highlights of the European art collection include:- Portrait of a Man by Domenico Ghirlandaio (circa 1490)- Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough (1770) – this is perhaps the most photographed picture of the European art collection- Sarah Barrett Moulton: Pinkie by Thomas Lawrence (1794) – the last painting purchased by Henry Huntington, he did not live to see it installed- Diana the Huntress by Jean-Antoine Houdon (1782) – a striking bronze over 6 feet tall, commands the viewer’s undivided attention- Virgin and Child by Rogier van der Weyden (circa 1460) – at once a devotional and tender image- Sevres Lidded Vases (circa 1762) – made in the form of fortified towers, an extremely rare pair of vasesSome of the most notable pieces from the American art collection:- Breakfast in Bed by Mary Cassatt (1897) – a lovely painting by Mary Cassatt, one of the first American women artists to attract international recognition for her work- The Long Leg by Edward Hopper (circa 1930) – an evocative painting by Hopper, who is recognized as one of the major realist painters- Chimborazo by Frederic E Church (1864) – a restful painting by Church, one of the leading American landscape painters of the 19th century- Zenobia in Chains by Harriet Hosmer (1859) – a beautiful sculpture by Hosmer, one of the leading female sculptors of the 19th centuryThe Huntington BOTANICAL GARDENS sprawl over 120 acres which reference sixteen different themes.- Liu Fang Yuan – the Garden of Flowing Fragrance (also known as the Chinese Garden) features a placid beautiful lake, pavilions, stone bridges and waterfalls- The Japanese Garden – a distinctive moon bridge, Zen garden, bonsai court and tea garden are all part of this landscape- The Desert Garden – is one of the world’s largest outdoor collections of cacti and succulents – over 5000 species of desert plants can be seen here!- Camellia Garden – best viewed during the winter months of January-February when they are in dazzling bloom, this camellia collection is considered one of the best in the world- The Frances and Sidney Brody California Gardens – home to nearly 50,000 dry-climate plants and plants native to California’s Mediterranean climate- The Herb Garden – showcases common and exotic herbs arranged according to their uses for cooking, medicines, teas, cosmetics, perfumes, dyes and so on- The Palm Garden – more than 200 species of palms are on view- The Rose Garden – a riot of colour spread over three acres with more than 3000 individual plants, at their best between March to November- Shakespeare Garden – located between the two major art galleries, features some of the plants mentioned in Shakespearean plays and sonnets and others grown in England during his time- The Conservatory for Botanical Science – a 16,000 square foot greenhouse with several interactive exhibits- The Australian Garden, Jungle Garden, Subtropical Garden are other botanical attractions on view - if you have the time!Henry Huntington also handpicked a large collection of garden statuary for the San Marino estate – most of these date back to the 17th and early 18th centuries. These sculptures were positioned exactly where he wanted and it is said that some of them were moved around many times before they had his approval! The end result is sculptures that look absolutely perfect in their garden setting.The most notable building on the estate is The Huntington Art Gallery which originally was Henry and Arabella’s home – reflecting Italian and Spanish Renaissance traditions, the 55,000 square feet mansion constructed between 1909-1911 follows the Mediterranean style of early 20th century Californian architecture.The Mausoleum of Henry and Arabella Huntington made of Colorado Yule marble is on a knoll in the middle of the orange groves, a spot that Henry Huntington loved.There are multiple dining options available at The Huntington. 1919 is the main café, while Red Car is the coffee shop. The Rose Garden Tea Room serves English tea. Chinese delicacies are on offer at Freshwater Pavilion Noodle House in the Chinese Garden. Patio Grill is one more option open on weekends.The Huntington Store carries a collection of gifts, souvenirs, books and other collectibles related to The Huntington’s collection. You can reserve non-motorized wheelchairs in advance – unreserved wheelchairs are available near the ticket kiosk on a first-come, first-served basis.Flash photography and photography with tripods is not permitted within The Huntington buildings.The Huntington is closed on Tuesdays – on all other days (excluding Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Independence Day) it is open 10am to 5pm.Tickets for adults (19-64 years) are priced at $25 on weekdays and $29 on weekends. Seniors (65+) get a discount - $21 weekdays | $24 weekends.Admission is free to all visitors on the first Thursday of every month with advance tickets – the Free Day tickets must be reserved online for print-at-home or mobile delivery. Free Day hours are the usual 10am-5pm. Regular admission tickets are NOT available on Free Day. Reservation is not needed to visit The Huntington except on Free Days.Parking at The Huntington is free – however, the parking lots are completely full up especially on weekends and so unless you’re there really early, you may have a long walk to the entrance.The Huntington is a feast for the senses - the legacy of a visionary who worshipped at the altar of beauty, education and research.",TMenon
40,Beautiful gardens,My college roommates and I went here for our 15 year reunion as part of our trip to California. It was very beautiful and alot to see. My favorite exhibit was the rose gardens.

Very well done and highly recommended",Travmama
50,Fantabulous!,Our first visit. We did the estate tour with Carl which I highly recommend for an interesting overview of the history and sheer breadth of what’s available.

Would love to go back when the roses are blooming. We all loved it!,matthewl

As a library — omg. This is the most gorgeous place to view wonderful collections and I am determined to go back to California just to revisit this place.

50,Peace and serenity,If you like plants and gardening this is must visit place in LA. I could spend whole day there wondering around garden. Some of the plants are really fascinating specimens.,Damir S
50,One Day is Not Enough,"Large estate with wonderful botanic gardens, art collections, and display and research library. My grandchild and I spent the better part of a day and only experienced part of the gardens and the library display room where we viewed an original Guttenberg Bible and other early print books dating back to the 1400s. A good place for any age. Really good food and drink options for visitors. We loved it and will no doubt return.",sharw2015
50,Don’t miss it!,"We were in town for the Parade of Roses and had an afternoon to experience the library and beautiful gardens! The exhibits and in the library were well displayed, interesting and very informative with sufficient variety to interest everyone. The gardens were meticulously maintained and stunning. It was impressive to see the variation (rose garden, herb garden, Japanese garden, Chinese Garden, etc). All were spectacular but the Japanese Garden was our personal favorite as it is uncommon (and authentic says one member in our party who has visited Japan)Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for a delightful day!",ITravl4Fun
50,Tranquil plus Educational,"This place is so much more than just a library. The property includes a fabulous History, Medicine and Science Museum inside the amazing working library, a Historic Home with world class paintings and furniture ranging from the classical to the modern, plus six botanical gardens with Statues and Fountains interspersed all over the place, not to mention a wonderful Gift and Souvenir Store.We went through the Library fairly quickly due to time constraints, then walked through the Huntington Home which was full of gorgeous Statues, remarkable Paintings, and fabulous Furniture. In the house, we saw the best collection of Gainsborough and Reynolds Paintings. The Blue Boy was amazing, and luckily we were able to snag a few sets of the Blue Boy and Pinky ornaments from the Gift Store. Flowers were in bloom everywhere making our walks through the gardens doubly enjoyable.There was so much to see and do here that we barely skimmed the surface in four hours. We were pleasantly surprised, and will certainly re-visit on our next trip. No trip to CA would be complete without a tour at this place.",TheExplorerFamily
50,"Most vibrant, diverse enjoyable year-round garden ever....","Hungry? good food here. Need exercise? you can walk for hours, on the flat or up and down gentle slopes. Want to learn more on your own about plants? Everything is marked with Latin and common names, for easy look-up. Rather listen to an informative tour guide? The garden subject matter experts are friendly, speak so that you can hear them and know more than seems possible about so many aspects of cultivation. Need a quiet place to study, think, write? The free internet in the lovely domed pavilion is a fine office away from home. No time to go on here about the museum exhibits, since we are about to leave to visit The Huntington again.....",Bert S C
50,Loved it,"I visited here this past spring and enjoyed every minute. To me, the rose garden, Chinese garden, and Japanese garden were the highlights, but there was something here for everyone. I didn’t have time to visit the museum, but the gardens were breathtaking. If you are a fan of Japanese or Chinese gardens, don’t miss this! I also had lunch at the cafe in the Chinese garden, overlooking the water. Highly recommend!",Peachdaquiri16
50,A Landmark you Must See!,"Spent a lovely afternoon strolling the grounds, checking out the library and enjoying a southern California landmark. It's a little expensive to get in, but once you're there, you'll forget about it quickly. The Japanese Garden and the Chinese Gardens are especially beautiful. Enjoy.",jtlerman
50,Great way to spend half day,"This place is immense.Loved the Japanese, Chinese, and the desert gardens. Just for those is well worth the price of admission.Tip: if you bought ticket online, don’t line up at the table for online ticket to check in because it’s the same table for memberships and takes a long time. Just get your sticker at the normal ticket buying windows.Great place for exercise and seeing cool plants!",Terry_in_Kirkland
50,Wonderful day out - needed longer!,"I had not heard of this wonderful place until watching a travelogue earlier this year by the Brit presenter (and ex-politician) Michael Portillo. He was filmed talking to the Head Gardener in the cactus garden, and I was intrigued and entranced, so when planning a trip to California this recent autumn, I decided to include a visit to the Huntington. I am so glad I did!!The gardens as expected are spectacular, and wonderful examples of the varied styles of planting and gardening around our planet - the cactus garden apart (which is the best collection I have ever seen), the Chinese Water Gardens were beautiful, where we were lucky enough to catch part of a musical performance by a Chinese lady on a stringed instrument a little like the European zither - so atmospheric with the water garden in the background whilst drinking specialist Chinese tea! I also loved the prairie style planting near the children's gardens.We made a point of visiting the American art collection in preference to the European - due to lack of time I hasten to add, as we were only there for a day - as it is so rare to find large exhibitions outside of the US (we can see European art any time being Brits!). Wonderful collection of not just paintings, but furniture, textiles, ceramics etc etc. We also went to the library to see a selection of some of the ancient texts and books on display - well worth taking the time to do this.In addition, the cafeteria and shop are great - I could have spent hours browsing the gifts, but simply ran out of time when they were getting ready to close. We had spent all day at the Huntington from 10.30 - 17.00, and left begging for more time!If you are a fan of gardens, books or art - or like me, all three - do not hesitate to spend a full day of your vacation time at this wonderful institution. And a final vote of thanks to Michael Portillo to bringing this great place to my attention!!",JJ Whippet
40,Do NOT miss going to this beautiful place,"The Huntington Library is not only located in an older, southern California historic house, it is surrounded by acres and acres of beautiful gardens. The museum is full of magnificent art, educational centers, eateries, and gift shops. It will take more than a day to see it all. Visiting there is like taking a day off, slow down your pace and just enjoy the peace and beauty.",Deborah R
50,a lovely place to spend an afternoon,"Huntington Gardens has been a go-to destination for decades. I remember going there as a child. Now, 60 years later (yeah, I'm dating myself), it's still a fabulous place to spend time. i was last there almost a year ago. There's a Japanese garden, a Chinese garden, areas for desert plants, tropical plants - you name it. Very very peaceful, and lovely places to have tea or lunch. Bring the family or come alone!",Debra K
50,Informative garden tour,I arrived on a sunny morning in time to go on a garden tour. Our guide was very informative and enthusiastic. Plant information was sprinkled with history. Unusual plants were pointed out that I would have missed. A very enjoyable time. The tour ended in the Chinese garden where a Chinese meal could be eaten while in enjoying the surrounding. Expansion is happening so it will be exacting to fit finished when I return again.The gallery and library are worth adding them to your visit. There are places to sit and enjoy the peacefulness and scents of the garden. Food is available.,littleoldlady2015
40,Really Enjoyed the Gardens,"The grounds we're very crowded which is highly irregular. We drove around the parking lot for half an hour. My guess is the gardens weren't expecting black Friday to bring g such a crowd. We got in, thankfully had reservations and were able to enjoy tea and the beautiful rose gardens. Very nice day, will do again.",417peggyw

50,Walking around so many differente type of vegetation under a beautifull blue sky in November,"We went with my husband to visit The Huntington Library and botanical garden and art collection and I was very plaisently surprise by the beauty of all the different garden. A very well manicure outdoor space with a great variety of plants, trees, flower and vegetation. The roseraie was beautifull and the roses actually had a very beautifull fragrance. Indoor the library building and the european museum wich was the residence was a dream place to walk trought. I could not help thinking of all the lavish parties that took place in those wall decorated with pricely painting and furnitures. the Americain museum was full of interesting art from Warhol to work from different Americain artists modern expressionist and others...we spent 4 hours strolling from place to place and enjoyed an afternoon of art and outdoor relaxing time in a beautifull setting. I got to talk to a very nice Docent on the restauration of the blue boy by Gainsborough a master piece being restaure infront of the piublic eyes. Infortunatlly we did not see the restauration in process because of the long thanksgiving weekend break. A must see....",Denise S
50,Must see Garden in Pasadena,I’ve been here a few times and it is sleds fabulous. The desert garden is enormous as well as the Asian gardens with buildings and the Rose Garden. It is a good idea to spend an entire day here because there is also wonderful art. This place is a treasure👍,travelingrm
50,Wonderful Experience,We loved this experience. It really takes more than one day to see everything properly. The gardens are lovely. We especially enjoyed the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The library and museums take one day to appreciate everything.,CyndyJoPo
50,WOW!,"Stumbled onto this place and went twice in one week. Beautiful gardens! Could just go and spend an entire day. be sure to catch the return of the parrots near sunset. But, that would ignore a library that is a world class destination in itself. Artwork has some nice stuff, but meh. If I lived in LA, would be a member.",RetiredNLuvinIt_11
50,Incredible gardens and beautiful landscapes; will be back again!,"What an amazing place, so beautiful and full of life. The gardens are gorgeous, well manicured and so colorful. I have never seen such amazing southwest gardens before, the cactus are so amazing. The parakeets flying around are entertaining too. The trails are wide and there are plenty of trails to discover. I can't wait to go back for more walking and discovery.",R84W
50,Allow plenty of time!,"Allow plenty of time to visit here. There are a dozen different gardens over 120 acres, as well as 3 galleries and library: we were there 5 + hours and had not even scraced the surface of all there is to see. I enjoy walking through nice gardens bit am no gardener, so I spent more time in the galleries - the quilts in the American Art were stunning; the Gainsboroughs and Van Dykes were numerous, and I enjoyed the fascinating conservation display of the Blue Boy. I also loved the books in the linrary- Chaucer, Tyndale, Milton, Newton and the Gutenburg Bible.We ate in the Patio Grill for lunch - nice burgers and able to cater for gluten free diners. There was quite a long wait for the food but we enjoyed chatting so it was not a problem. There were plenty of seats and helpful guides, as well as wheelchairs to borrow( best booked in advance although we did get one on the day). There were baby change facititlies and the paths were all suitable for pushchairs.",Beth H
40,Very pretty! Hard to get around,It is so pretty there! The Chinese and Japanese gardens are gorgeous with bridges and trees. There is also a rose garden with tons of beautiful flowers. Hard to get around and not the most helpful staff but nice place! And very pretty!!!!,Nate
50,A True Gem,An unbelievable year round diverse set of gardens. Extremely well manicured. Very easy to navigate. The Tea House is a delictable treat. Note reservations recommended.,Harvey C
50,Great outing but admission prices increased,The Huntington Library and the gardens have been upgraded since we last visited in 2007. It changed so much adding more gardens and complete renovations of some of their buildings. The scenery was breath taking and the various gardens as well. I would say it would take two days to the max to see the entire place. Its to to much to take in the first day. The food is overpriced as you would expect it to be. The admission price has skyrocked since 2007 and it comes with all the new additions I guess. About 20 dollars and above . This is nice place to escape to away from the L.A. madness.,FredHaskin
50,Great place to spend an afternoon,"The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens is a great place to visit. You can't do it all in an afternoon but you can spend a lovely time there. The gardens are gorgeous and peaceful. The exhibits in the building are nicely laid out. Great documents and history to view in the library. It was quite a worthwhile experience.",Gail G
50,A must visit destination in San Marino if you are in the vincinity ...,"Although only a couple of hours, but what a breath of fresh air, the gardens are simply mind boggling, a bit disappointed with ""The Blue Boy"" under restoration, a whole one year long process, be ready by September 2019.",Ana L
50,Great specialty tour,"We had fun and learned a lot during the specialty tour we took Nov. 9, 2018, with a docent named Carla. She not only shared a lot of history about the Huntingtons and the grounds, but she also gave us numerous ideas on what to see in more detail after the tour ended. We saw much, but will be going back to see more.",Jerry B
50,If you like plants and gardening . . .,then you will dig this place. The desert garden was unlike anything I’ve seen at a botanical garden. The Japanese Garden was very cool. The Rose Garden has more roses that I knew existed. When I saw the admission price I was a little concerned but I spent four hours at the place and never even went in any of the buildings with the art exhibits.,LetsGoCaribbean
50,Versatility of gardens to delight everyone,The Library and Botanical Gardens are exceptional. They are so diverse and capture many different garden styles. The tour of the gardens was very informative and we would have missed many highlights if we had not been education by the knowledgeable guide.,RozDe
50,World class gardens & art,"The Huntington is a delightful space to immerse oneself in spectacular gardens and take in some excellent artworks as well. The gardens are vastly diverse. The cactus garden has an immense number of species. Keep going through the Australian , Japanese and Chinese gardens. The Huntington is excellent for children too. The Children's garden has many hands-on activities many of which include water. The magnetism activity is quite effective. Take your time. It's easy to spend several hours.",Hewitty15
50,Plant People Paradise,If you are a plant person like me then there is no better place to visit. Your visit will take more than one day and I suggest you start early. They open at 10AM so get there early to get a close parking spot in the shade. Wear good walking shoes and cary water and snacks. Don't forget your camera.,Bob Z
40,A wonderful three hours,"The Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens in California’s Pasadena are truly amazing and we spent a terrific morning there. Especially wonderful are the collections of orchids housed in several huge greenhouses, each with differing temperatures to suit their inhabitants. Also interesting is The Blue Boy Project, which is restoring Gainsborough’s picture to its original state. A great way to spend a morning!!",Peter T
50,Guided tour of the Japanese Gardens,"Reserved in advance and on line for the 9:00 AM tour. Our tour guide was incredible and continued to guide us past the expected end time. Highly recommend these Gardens due to uniqueness of the collection, library, house, Gardens and overall quality of the exhibits and welcoming staff.",fas19010
50,"Incredible, Peaceful, Wonderful and Worthwhile","We spent about 5 hrs on a Wednesday afternoon and needed another day to see everything! The grounds are very peaceful and well maintained. Unfortunately, there were no volunteers that day to give us a guided tour, which was very disappointing.We Viewed the main house and site of Blue Boy restoration, but no one was working on it that day! The artwork on display was diverse and interesting, the Chinese music in the garden soothing, our own abbreviated Tai Chi practice in the Japanese Garden serene. We plan to return in the Spring when all is in bloom!Lunch in the large cafeteria was OK, but nothing exceptional for the prices. We didn't get to all the buildings and learned the next day during a tour of the Gamble Mansion of exhibits we'd have liked to see.It was an enjoyable trip and worth the 2 hr drive from North San Diego County with an overnight stay in the Pasadena to include a few other sights.",Bchgrl9
50,One stop gives something for everyone,"The Huntington Estate has something for everyone! The architecture of the buildings, the Fine European and American art and artifacts in the Museums, the rare books in the Library and the magnificent gardens make this place a crown of many jewels. If you want to research the Library, you can gain access through the professional staff. If you stroll the gardens with a docent, you will learn about the botanical plants. You have a choice of several places to eat during your visit. The pizza at the Cafe was quite good! As members we will be able to enter free and get a discount at the well stocked gift shop! I look forward to seeing the changes in the gardens each season!",862natalief
50,A Piece of Paradise,"This is the best of many worlds. It’s a conglomeration of art, history, nature, statuaries and superbly landscaped gardens. It’s worth a leisurely visit. Wandering and exploring is the best method to see this amazing place. The art , galleries,historic buildings and amazingly designed Japanese and Chinese gardens are world class. If you’re a tourist and tired of the theme park scene, this is an ideal antidote. It brings you calm and peace of mind in just one visit.",kewlbreezes51
50,My favorite place in LA area,"I have a membership to the Huntington and I've been 30+ times. I absolutely love it every time.Top highlights for me: bonsai court and desert garden. The bonsai collection is extensive and impressive. The desert garden looks like something from Dr. Suess. I've never seen another botanical garden with anywhere close to this great of a desert garden area. The rose garden is also incredible because there are so many different varieties.The grounds are large and you can loose yourself exploring. Even after I had been 20+ times, I was still discovering new things. Also, depending on what time of year you go, the gardens can look completely different, which is awesome.There are also special events going on all the time: bonsai shows, orchid shows, plant sales.I personally find the library and art boring. I'm only there for the plants. 🌵🌱🌻🌺",Kieran P
50,Spend a day here,"There is so much to see here that you can spend more than a day here. If you live in the area, get a membership as this is a great place to spend time throughout the year. Otherwise daily admission is $29/adult on weekends and holidays or $25 on weekdays. It is less for seniors, children and groups. The gardens are lovely: desert, Australian, Japanese and Chinese gardens. Free garden tours are available. There are several museums with both American and European art, a conservatory, children’s garden and two to three restaurants to sit and eat. The gift shop is large with beautiful but pricey things for sale. If you have a membership you get a discount. Expect to do a lot of walking, but we saw golf carts transporting elderly patrons or those with difficulty walking. Worth a visit.",pasherry
50,give yourself enough time!,"This is not a 2 or even 3 hour stop. The mansion (restored portion) can be an hour plus if you want to go through thoroughly - but bear in mind this is not a 'historic house' a la Stan Hywet Hall where you see everything soup to nuts, you are touring the formal rooms here and that's it; rest is the Euro art collection. The collections - there are 3 - can occupy another 2 hours - not just paintings, but sculpture and decorative arts. The grounds (!), can take another 2 depending on how quickly you stroll, how much you want to see and whether you take contemplative moments nibbling at the tea house or just lost in thought. Everything is very nicely presented and kept in good nick. For the price though, really, they should offer a second day - one for the art, one for the gardens -but I might still go again on a nice day just for the garden experience alone (I shortchanged myself a bit there - again, watch your time)",scott r
50,A great thing to do with Railroad wealth,"The gardens are a sumptuous respite in a pretty mundane urban sprawl - a really nice alternative to the city surrounding. The museum is less than stimulating, but the gardens are fab. Joe-bob sez: check it out",peter s
20,Unkind to coyotes,A beautiful and historic area marred by cruelty to coyotes. Huntington Library has a practice of trapping and killing coyotes on their grounds. It is such a shame that this is happening. These coyotes are native to this land. They were here before we were. I so hope this practice is stopped.,wendywaite1
50,Outstanding - Bettered my expectations,"When a friend suggested the Huntington Library, I thought why not? I was blown away by the whole estate, museums and library. There was so much to see!The library was a highlight. Seeing books and documents by Twain, Lincoln, Newton and an actual Gutenberg bible.There are two art museums - one featuring European art (including Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy"") and American art.The gardens and lawns on the estate are absolutely beautiful. This is a not-to-miss site.This is a full day experience and I regret to say I could only be there for 4 hours. I will be back!",tomahawk06
50,A tranquil retreat away from the bustle of LA,"The former Estate of Henry Huntington, the railroad magnate. Located in Pasadena, this is a gorgeous place to spend an afternoon. In the house they have an amazing Art and Porcelain collection of Henry and his wife. The grounds are beautiful- a Chinese garden, cactus garden, and you can have high tea in another part of the garden. Henry collected rare books and manuscripts which you can view as well. Lovely views of the surrounding mountains",T210HRkerrym
50,"It's got everything - location, history, art and botany!","The Huntington Estate covers a vast acreage. The original mansion contains the art collection. The Library is located in the separate library building close by, purpose built by the Huntington family over 100 years ago. A fabulous collection of original books and documents is on display - a 16th century Gutenberg Bible, maps by Ptolemy, Galileo and Mercator and a bound volume of Audobon's life size illustrations of American birds. And all that is in just one of the dozen rooms!The botanical gardens are a delight with a 'secret' children's garden, a tropical 'dome', extensive rose gardens and something delight the eye at every turn. Thoughtfully there are plenty of seats in the shade of the trees and shrubs.1919 Restaurant is the huge main restaurant. It serves sandwiches, salads, pizzas and cooked meals. To minimise waiting times there are separate lines for different types of meals. Dine in the aircon comfort of the main hall or outside on the shaded terraces.Service was quick and with genuine warm smiles. The pizzas had light crisp bases, our salad's were sensible portion sizes but the turkey sandwich was excessively over-filled. Prices were quite reasonable.You need several days to see absolutely everything! Decide on your targets and spend a couple of hours in the main house or the library or a half day or more wandering in the gardens.",Steve M
50,A Must of Beauty and Wilderness in L.A.,"What do the Huntington Library, the beach, and High Sierra (e.g. Mammoth) have in common? The incredible display of nature that make each one of them an irreplaceable ingredient for L.A. quality of life. No matter how full it is, there is always the inevitable peace to rebalance from the day-to-day stress. The richness of conjoined plants with their wilderness, beauty, danger, independence, and durability that spans decades and centuries but observes subtle human-made changes puts many things into perspective. And its beauty is simply relaxing…P.S. … never regretted the membership …(Originally posted by me on Yelp).",AMKaiser
50,Many things to see and discover,"The Huntington Library is a treasure trove.

50,April 2016,"This museum, garden and library has almost everything for someone looking for a nice afternoon activities. While it primarily is accessible by car, you can take public transportation and walk to get there. I took the Gold line to the Allen street stop and then walked south on that street. It is a little ways (around 20-30) minutes to get there. It was a very warm day. The walk is worth it. The admission price covers all of the gardens, library and art exhibit buildings. The gardens cover all types except rain forest varieties. I really enjoyed the library with all of the rare and historical volumes in it. Most of art is of the older types up to before twentieth century. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore it all, it is worth it.",Reed S

50,Lovely for a day visit,"While visiting friends in Palm Springs, we visited Huntington Gardens and library. It was interesting to look at pages from old English writers and maps of the new world. The library has amassed an amazing number of books. The buildings, housing artwork, showcaseed an eclectic selection of art. We then proceeded to the Tea Room for an amazing luncheon. There is an extensive selection of teas with an endless supply of hot water. The luncheon selection is on a three tiered serving dish. Our server, Kimberly, was lovely. She paid particular attention to my request for vegetarian items. The selection of items was incredible. Whether egg salad in a pastry cup or salmon on homemade bread, each was delicious. The pastries were unbelievable: macaroons, cheese cakes were my favorites! After lunch, it was delightful to walk around the gardens.",LabLover61

50,Needed more time to explore this amazing place,"I had been here a few years ago with my daughter and felt that it was a ""must see"" when traveling through with my wife.The different theme gardens are meticulous. We especially enjoyed the Chinese, Japanese, Rose and Herb gardens.I hadn't visited the European Art Museum (Huntington Mansion) when I was here before and really enjoyed it this time. It was reminiscent of the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, NY, another of the ""robber baron"" mansions. It is great that the Huntingtons made plans for this to be open to the public",David_Sabael
50,Lovely Walk in the Park!,"Beautiful late summer day at the Huntington! First time visit, easy entry, helpful map, and a docent ready to describe the best way to take a free tour, or to self-guide our way around.We chose the latter, and were soon on our way. We didn't realize it until much later, but the visit involved a LOT of walking, and we only covered about 1/2 of the grounds. For those challenged to walk that much, the terrain was mostly flat, with many places to rest, in the shade or sun, and spots to refresh with a beverage or bite to eat.Gorgeous grounds and gardens. We did audio tours of art exhibits which was marginally helpful. We ate at the cafeteria (very upscale menu for a cafeteria) late in the visit, and thoroughly enjoyed our time here.The gift shop offered shipping of items we couldn’t fit in our carry-on luggage, which was very helpful.",Seabreeze48

50,Hands down one of the best museum experiences in the world but give yourself a whole day!,"The title of this review pretty much says it all. The Huntington is a wonderful blend of breathtaking gardens, great library and magnificent galleries housed in stunning, meticulously maintained architecture.Even the book shop is marvellous, an absolute treasure trove of fascinating objects d'art, books, knickknacks and many other items I was surprised to even find in a bookshop.Whether you are passionate (and knowledgeable) about art, literature or gardens is immaterial. There is something at The Huntington to please everyone of all ages.One caveat though: The Huntington is extensive. It is best to plan for an entire day in order to experience the most of the gardens, the library and the gallery. If visiting in the summer, be aware that it can get very hot. There are excellent cafes and restaurants so do take advantage of these and pace yourself accordingly.I will definitely return and will be returning specifically to see this wonderful place again. And yes, the Blue Boy is well worth the visit as are the many, many other striking paintings in a superbly presented collection.",Alexandra B

50,"Lovely walk, delicious Tea Room","What an amazing morning and afternoon at The Huntington Library! My dear friend who I haven't seen for months invited me to go for a walk and lunch at the Rose Garden Tea Room.You can get free tickets (only the first Thursday of the month) by request, Tickets are free and can be requested online. You may choose from two arrival times: morning (10 a.m.) or afternoon (1 p.m.) below. A limited quantity will be available the first day of each month at 9 a.m. preceding the month you wish to visit. Other wise, tickets are $19.95 (adults), $17.95 (seniors 62+) and $9.95 (children 3-12. Under 3 is free). Park hours are 10-5, closed on Tuesdays.It was a hot afternoon and I dressed too warm. Fortunately, there was a nice breeze! We took advantage of the many areas to sit in the shade with the most beautiful views of the gardens. You may purchase water near the entrance or bring your own. There is a designated picnic area- eating, smoking and pets are not allowed in the park.Meandering with the map provided, we made our way to see the Huntington mausoleum. The area was cordoned off so we were unable to walk near the beautiful structure on the highest point on the estate.We walked through the Children's Garden (If you have kids you MUST do! Designed just for little ones with areas of play, including water play areas. So, so cute!Strolling through the Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden we realized we were running out of time - had to get to the Tea Room for our reservation at 1:30. We were near the Australian Desert and had to cut it a bit short to find the Rose Garden. Note to self: Next time start in the desert area on a hot day!We arrived at the Rose Garden Tea Room at 1:30, overheated. Thank goodness this little tea room is air conditioned! We were seated, gulped ice water and settled in to this beautiful room with awesome garden views. Another note- walk ins welcomed but I highly suggest reservations since you still need to pay for entrance to the park.Oh. My. Goodness! I've never been to tea. The selection was wonderful. My choice was caramelized pear. When my tea was poured, the aroma was intoxicating. $7 more and a glass of prosecco would be mine as well. This traditional tea service was $35 and worth every delectable, savory bite!The table was set beautifully with linen. When the tea service arrived I was in awe. I'm not a girly girl so this was a new, fascinating experience. I listened intently as the server described each of the three tiers of delights.Everything is made from scratch with seasonal, sustainable ingredients. We enjoyed scones served with clotted cream, lemon curd, fruit preserves and dill mascarpone, avocado mushroom sandwich, chicken salad, sandwich, cheese quiche, English cucumber sandwich, smoked salmon and caviar and cage free truffle egg salad finger sandwiches. We were so famished after our walk, I thought we'd finish all these dainty delights. Nope. We took home the petite desserts: chocolate raspberry ganache tart, coconut macaroon, mango cupcake, profiterole, rose cookie and strawberry cheesecake.The service, being for two people, had two of everything. We each took home some treats!After our lunch we wandered into the European Art building. So amazed at the extensive art and book collection Henry and Arabella Huntington amassed and thankful for the legacy they left behind for all to enjoy and learn.There's so much more to see and experience I plan on returning when the weather is cooler.",Tarkingtons

50,Exceeded expectations!,"Several huge gardens, each garden is different, unique and quite large. Some examples: a cactus garden, a jungle with tropical plants and waterfalls, a forest, the largest Chinese garden outside of China, a large Japanese garden and an indoor temperature controlled garden with cloud forest tropical plants. All of the gardens are very well done. If that weren’t enough Huntington also contains three museums - an American art museum, a European art museum and a science museum. Also included is a children’s play area and an indoor drawing area. You can easily spend the entire day here and not see it all. We met one couple photographing the cactus who said they are visiting 2 and a half days.",tinaNtravel
50,Desert Garden Conservatory on Sat. a Must,"We went just for the gardens, which are justifiably famous. If you've never seen a Japanese bonzai garden, this is your chance. Same with a beautiful Chinese garden around a lotus-filled pond. My favorite was the desert garden, one of the largest in the world. It's a jaw-dropper. In addition, we went on Saturday which is the only day of the week that the desert conservatory is open. This contains hundreds of tiny cactus and other succulent plants that are too fragile to survive in the vast grounds outside. The variety of form and color seems infinite. The facilities at the Huntington are first rate, down to the restaurants and bookstore. Free parking much appreciated since the admission is steep (more expensive on weekends). Glad we finally made it here after hearing about it for years.",Philip S
50,Worth a visit or two or three,"This is an amazing place with acres of gardens and vistas. There is also museums and restaurants, too.It is huge and would recommend wearing athletic shoes. Some of the paths were paved, others dirt. A gentleman in one of the motorized scooters had no problems getting around.There is too much to do in one day. We had a great experience at the Tea Room in the rose garden. Make sure to try the Huntington Rose Tea.It can be hot in the summer, so go early. The gardens open at ten.Entrance price $25 for adults.Traditional High Tea is $35",Morgan W
50,All Day Long,"It would take one an entire day to walk the outstanding gardens and to see most of the historic offerings in the best library on the west coast and to see the wide-breadth of art holdings from classical to modern. Over the past few years, they've remodeled, expanded and have embraced 20th C art into their collection. The art collection really awe-inspiring and unique. They have one of nicest high-teas offered in the area as well. Best advice: wear comfortable shoes if you want to explore the grounds from A-Z!",rocor335
50,Beautiful gardens plus amazing art collections.,"I had one day free in Pasadena and discovered this amazing place. I went to tour the gardens and enjoyed the added bonus of some wonderful art collections. I went through the Library quickly due to time limitations, but it would definitely be worth spending more time. The Huntington home was full of exceptional portraits, statues and beautiful furniture. I forced myself to keep moving even though each room was filled with wonderful things. The gardens were beautiful. At several points the view was great so I wanted to just sit and relax. I kept moving just because I wanted to see each of the gardens. Everything exceeded my expectations. My only negative point is the lack of snack spots to be able to get water in the farthest parts of the gardens. Make sure you have a hat and water before heading into the Desert Garden section. It was a tremendous day!",Phyllis C
50,I must if you're visiting Los Angeles.,"I take a school bus full of students here who are 11 years old every year. They're madly in love with this place! Their parents fight over me taking them for adult supervision. This place is lovely tranquil and amazing. Plan to spend the day!💞 Also, if you're not going to the Tea Room they have an amazing restaurant just outside of the entryway to the Huntington Gardens. It doesn't cost very much and the foods very very good.",Erudite_journey
50,Just Keeps Getting Better,"If you're near the north part of the San Gabriel Valley and you want to spend a fulfilling day, the Huntington Library is unbeatable. And it doesn't matter about your interests, the Library has something for you. Art, architecture,vintage construction, furnishings, landscaping, rare books and places to just sip tea or have a full meal. British assembly of centuries-old paintings and sculptures is remarkable and the Japanese Garden with its authentic residence and bonzai trees transport you to another place in time. New exhibits appear regularly and on special occasions, rare plants are available to purchase for your own garden. Do allow yourself several hours and, at that, you'll wish you had more time.",TraveLee073
50,"Beautiful gardens, great library, art...and Blue Boy!!","My wife and I spent a great day viewing the gardens -- all 6 of them -- Desert, Chinese, Japanese, Herb, Rose, and Succulents. I highly recommend taking a docent tour of the grounds, which takes about 2 hours. We then had some lunch, and visited the libraries, followed by an audio tour of the art collection -- also highly recommended. The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Also if you're in to photography -- great shots!!",Al M
50,Great Art & Gardens,"If you’re into great art, this is a must see location. Don’t miss Blue Boy & Pinky. The Gardens are fantastic & there is a space exhibit even the kids would like",Mimi C
50,Can’t believe we haven’t visited before.,"We loie in Orange County and have known about this place for a long time. For whatever reason, we never visited. A friend recently talked about the place and we finally went. Wow were we impressed. Between the artwork, the library and the extensive grounds, this is not a place you can easily cover in a day. You can wander through the various gardens themselves and never get anywhere near the actual museums. They have several food options including sit down restaurants and an outdoor cafe. We will definitely be back to explore what we couldn’t cover on this visit.",Samndjsdad
50,A true jewel!!!,"The Huntington Library and Gardens is a must for anyone who loves beautiful gardens and lovely art. Strolling in the gardens is a delightful experience especially the Japanese Garden with the koi pond. The Cactus Garden is one of the largest in the USA. It is great to see the paintings of ""Pinkie"" and ""Blue Boy"" in the European gallery too. I just love this place!",Soledad2009
50,Spectacular display of natural beauty and landscaping!,"My wife and I visited here on Thursday, 26 July 2018. Had a little trouble finding it with our GPS, but it was well worth the trouble to locate this attraction.We arrived a bit late in the afternoon (a little before 3pm). Consequently, we were not able to see all of the attractions, as the facility closes at 5pm. Did not see the library or the art collection. The admission was $25/person, a little steep, I thought initially.The gardens were just stunning! I especially enjoyed the desert garden, with all of the cacti and palm trees. Even the pictures that I have posted do not adequately represent the beauty and splendor of this garden. Like nothing I have seen anywhere!The Chinese and Japanese gardens were attractive also, but nowhere near as beautiful as the desert garden.My advice is to come early to give yourself enough time to tour the library and art collection. There are various cafes located throughout the grounds that serve a variety of foods.This one is a can't miss! Put it on your list of places to visit while in Southern California! The scenery is extraordinary!",Disco_Man57
50,"Fine Art, Rare Books, Botanical Gardens","Worth making a special trip for, and allocating most of the day.The art collections are varied and extensive, more than most private museums. The buildings themselves are very handsome and well-organized. The Library proper has a number of rare items, including a Gutenberg Bible.We especially liked the Japanese Garden, which is quite large and includes a house, many gazebos, and a rock garden.",MannyG2000
50,Much appreciated beauty!,"First and foremost, you’ll likely need two visits to see everything. With the summer heat, traveling through all of the gardens can be a real challenge. Bring good walking shoes, sunscreen, a hat or umbrella and water. If you can, get your tickets on the first day of the month for the following month (they are free) but you’ll need to get the tickets within a minute or two of them opening the free days tickets. They sell out in a couple minutes. This is really a gift as it’s normally $25 for adults to enter. The gardens are spectacular and well maintained. The buildings are interesting and filled with art and books. It’s always a pleasure to come here especially during the spring when the rose garden is in full bloom. It’s easy to appreciate all the beauty here. And parking is free.",Caroline L
50,We can never get enough time to see everything!,"this time we went to the Chinese Garden first to see what progress has been made since the last visit a few years ago. It appears that it will be a few more years since the next phase will be completed. But, as always, we enjoyed our time there, watched the koi being fed and just enjoyed the calming ambience there. The waterfall is a delight when it's hot. The new restaurant (1919) was enjoyable, as well as the gift shop. The ""Orbit"" exhibit was amazing; we spent a lot of time in there.",simivalley1699
50,loved it,The desert gardens were truly amazing. A little disappointed with the Chinese and Japanese - more about buildings than plants... but we had a great day there.,J8288YAcindys
50,Stunning grounds. Amazing art collection!,"We spent almost 5 hours at this beautiful place and still didn't get to see everything. The grounds and botanical gardens are stunning with various themes - Japanese gardens, Australian gardens, zen garden, rose garden. Lots of walking and not very ADA friendly in some of the areas, but certainly not a game changer. The European art collection in the mansion and statuary in and out were breathtaking. And the chandeliers throughout the mansion were amazing. Lovely Tea Room by the rose garden has it's own herb garden. A must stop for tea and finger sandwiches. Only drawback was the heat outside - galleries and estate were perfectly air conditioned, but walking outside in the gardens got a little bit much in the afternoon. our next trip will definitely be in the late fall or early spring. But we WILL go back.",Joanne W
50,"No books to check out, call it a library?","No books to check out, call it a library? Not! This is gardens, galleries, tea houses, and museums. Major, world class literary and art collection. Spend time drinking tea and sandwiches in the garden cafe.",Cavydad
50,One of the very best botanical gardens.....,"My husband and I spent 4 hours visiting these beautiful grounds. We started with the Desert Garden (before it got too hot) and then visited the Lilly Ponds, the Japanese Garden, the Chinese Garden, The Rose Garden and the Shakespeare Garden. The Desert Garden was amazing - as were the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. These would be our top 3 places to visit if you are short of time. We also saw the Corpse Flower located in the Brody Botanical Garden. Plenty of photography opportunities and as RHS members we feel it is well worth the higher entrance fee than some other Botanical Gardens. The grounds are very clean, well maintained, easy to navigate and friendly guides are freely on hand for advice and to answer questions. We had a lovely lunch at the 1919 cafe which is comparably priced with other similar size attractions. Parking and WIFI are free. Seating areas, water fountains and restrooms are thoughtfully placed throughout the gardens. The restrooms although well stocked and not awful - were in need of a good clean. We would imagine that the gardens are constantly changing so although we didn't have time to visit the other gardens or library, we would gladly return for a second visit.",sweetjustine
50,Huntington Library Group Tour with CIRM SPARk Students,"Having the opportunity to have the tour guide (Carl) take us around the grounds and give us insight into the beauty of the Huntington Library, was an opportunity the students and I enjoyed.Starting with the tour, we learned about the different components that make up the Huntington Library.We enjoyed the information, the sights and sounds of the Huntington Library and were amazed at every corner.",gblanquel
50,"Outstanding Blue Boy, and Chinese garden with lotus flowers.","2nd time to Huntington. Library is still best in USA with insight on importance of each tome from Gutenberg bible to economics to Declaration of Independence, Wm Shakespeare Folio and science of planets, telescopes too. Beautiful Japanese waterfall and Chinese garden with scarce lotus flowers. Blue Boy still hanging tall, and add time to walk around the int'l gardens with above average Greek/Roman sculptures. Family priced cheese burgers and Mexican fare in cafe with free fruit infused water.",haigow8
50,world class,"This is a world class place for an excellent day out. The main art gallery is in the Huntington's former home, so is interesting for that in any case. The real treasure though is that it has the best collection of Gainsborough and Reynolds paintings that we have ever seen, even in the UK. It has the most well known ones quite apart from the numbers of paintings it has. Combine this with some outstanding gardens (the japanese one is quite delightful, and includes a traditional tea house and bonsai collection) and the library, and you have a world class institution to visit. Better than the Getty!",Anne S
50,Hard to beat - A unique cultural experience amidst beautiful gardens.,"The library rare book exhibits alone would make any other museum envious, but to do so in the midst of magnificent gardens and then add several other art galleries of international renown and you have the makings of a full day. The price is well worth the treasures that are very well presented and the walks between and though the gardens and botany exhibit break up the cultural overload. An unforgettable experience.",Simon B
50,Love Love Love this place! An American Treasure!,"Don’t let the word “library” fool you. This is a real American Gem and so much more that a library. It’s a fantastic Museum, historic home, botanical gardens and so much more. I have an annual membership and whenever we can, my wife and I pop over for leisurely walks through the gardens, or some delicious food at several options. I really feel like a trip to Los Angeles isn’t complete without a visit to lovely Pasadena and top of my long list of things to see and do is the Huntington Library.",funnysean
50,Visit when the roses are in first bloom!,"My retirement group picked the Huntington Botanical Gardens for our monthly outing in April. I had not been there since college days when taking Art Appreciation. I guess the property has always been there but the approach, parking and entrance building (which didn't exist) are completely different. This is quite a destination and I wouldn't hazard a visit on the weekend. It was plenty crowded on a Monday. It could be that some schools were still on Spring break (you can never count on when that is anymore). But still. You might want to have some water with you as there is quite a lot of territory to cover what with the Australian, California, Camelia, Children's, Chinese, Conservatory, Desert, Herb, Japanese, Jungle, Lily Ponds, Palm, Ranch, Rose, Shakespeare and Subtropical Gardens. The property can be very hilly and steep in some areas. Make sure you are wearing walking shoes. As I mentioned, we visited in late April when the roses were in first bloom. They were really showing off and stole the show. The rose gardens probably covers about an acre and has mass planting areas, arches (the roses on the arches didn't even look real, incomparable beauty) and a long pergolas with plantings. I especially enjoyed listening to the young kids' reactions to the color and the flowers. Very insightful at times. With this many gardens, I don't think it can all be seen in a day unless you are stout hearted and take lunch on the grounds. There is food available but the café didn't get a good review from one of our group. I considered booking the tea but at $75 a person, I didn't want to commit the others to that expense. The Gardens, Library and Art Collections are open Wednesday through Monday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Tuesday, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and 4th of July. The entrance fee is substantial ($21 for seniors on a weekday, prices go up on the weekend) but as I understand it is good for everything. Children under 4 and members are free. Parking is free. I understand that the organization does announce free days from time to time. Visiting here is time well spent. Remember water and good shoes probably best to throw in a hat and sunscreen. San Marino area can get quite hot in the late spring, summer and early fall. Enjoy! p.s. I can't say anything about the library or art museum but the gardens are not really wheelchair friendly.",MaryLouise H

50,Do Not Miss,"An amazing place with lots to see and do. We went to an event through a company and saw some of the property (it would take several trips to see it all), and we had appetizers (great) and cocktails and then saw the mansion (totally amazing and worth seeing) and then went in for dinner and company ""business"" awards, etc. The food was amazing especially for such a large crowd, the space large and comfortable and the service was perfect.

50,Lovely,Went to a reception and dinner from an organization and enjoyed every minute.. The grounds are gorgeous and we got a tour of the home. The food was great and the service was perfect. It’s elegant yet not stuffy and a perfect place for a company to hold an event. For me it was my bank but we are also joking friends for an evening on roses and dinner. They have many wonderful things to enjoy and as I understand from my friends who live nearby and go there several times a month it’s constantly changing so you never get bored and the grounds are huge so you have lots of selections to enjoy.,jtzs
50,Breathtaking; Do not miss,"We spent about 4 hours here but wished we had the entire day. This is a fabulous place to explore. The gardens are incredible - interesting even for my teenagers - and when you get hot, go inside the beautiful buildings and look at the art. Do not miss the desert garden - I would have skipped that one but the different types of cacti are amazing and unusual. The rare books are a real treat to see, and the other exhibits in that library building are well-done. There are several places to grab a drink or a bite to eat, and if you enjoy British tea service, check out the high tea they offer (reserve on Open Table). My daughter and I loved the tea sandwiches, scones, and tiny desserts - and I added a glass of Prosecco. Perfect! It's a great way to end your visit.",laurak022
20,"Beautiful gardens, rude staff","The gardens are amazing, but the museum staff are rude. I was so put off by one guy I went home early. I've checked with my friends and the consensus is second rate art and ill mannered museum staff. Don't waste your money on a membership here. Go to the Norton Simon or somewhere where they have a knowledgeable curator, not some society woman with too much money.",Ann H
50,Here's Where the Money Went,"The Huntington museums and gardens are a treasure to see and experience. Take a few days to see all the parts of the grounds, from the many collections of paintings to statues, and furniture to silver. It is all there and so beautiful to see and learn from. Exhibits come and go so visiting anytime can bring new sights and opportunities to learn and behold.",1dudley
50,Beautiful!!,"Prepare to be wowed! You'll need two days (I made it in one but wish I had more time) to fully appreciate the expansive, very beautiful gardens and all the museums stuffed with every sort of treasure! If you have to pick only one place to see in Pasadena, this is it!!",Michael H
50,Simply the best garden in Los Angeles!,"The Huntington is the top attraction I recommend visitors to Los Angeles to see. If you love nature and art, this is the place to go. Its simply gorgeous and you can spend the whole day here. $29 a person and you can walk for miles in the themed gardens of Japan, China, Desert and Australia.The gardens are simply beautiful and well maintained. Stop in the Japanese garden for noodle soup or yummy lychee lemonade, then head over to the art galleries of Europe or America. Have tea in the rose garden or simply sit in the cozy chair at the mansion, this place is wonderful. They also have a great cafeteria in the front of the park and the food is good. The gift shop has wonderful and unique souvenirs. Parking is free and its located in a nice neighborhood of Pasadena.MY FAVORITE PLACE IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES, I think that says a lot.",Ashley S
50,Wonderful and Peaceful,This was the first time in about 15 years that I had been to the Huntington. My favorite part was the Chinese garden (which I believe is new since my last visit).

50,Urban paradise,"The botanical gardens are absolutely outstanding. From the desert to Australia and from China and Japan to the Shakespeare garden, each garden was meticulously presented and tended. So much to see and such a wonderful way to enjoy sunny California. Absolutely fantastic as far as botanical gardens go, and what I didn’t expect was the amazing collection of art housed in an original Huntington mansion home. The most spectacular painting was Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough, c. 1770. Such a treat!",carolannmp
50,Amazing art,"The Huntington art collection is stunning. There are so many different kinds of art.. European classics like “Pinky”, authentic English China, original pieces of furniture from 1800s, American art, the most amazing collection of books dating back to the 1400 including the Gutenberg Bible, works by Shakespeare and much more.

Beautiful Japanese gardens, ponds with many varieties of Koi, a gorgeous Bonsai collection, very pretty walkways covered in plants and so many roses. The main home was so large. We were offered headsets to hear recordings about the history of the family and the art work collection. You have to have the headsets. Just a stunning location and so well maintained. Don't miss out. The tearoom was as amazing.",ginakristan
50,Amazing Collection of Art and Plants,"What a gem! We never knew this place existed. We visited on the suggestion of a friend when we were looking for a place for a family outing. The gardens are amazing and so varied that there is something for everyone. There is such a variety within each grouping that it is hard to take it all in. Add to that water features and creatures of all sorts - hummingbirds, turtles, lizards, squirrels. Then there are the art collections. Beautiful displays in magnificent buildings - European and American. Wish we had known about this place sooner - we would have visited many times already. Just a note to those who are thinking of visiting with kids: there are some activities for them in the conservatories, but honestly, overall most of the kids we saw seemed bored. There are no play structures,etc to burn off energy - it's a botanical garden and for the most part you need to stay on the paths that can get crowded at times.",sushi4soup
50,Fanrastic,"There are free days at the Huntington so check a month before you go. Free or not, this is a fabulous adventure. From the Gutenberg bible to Mary Cassatt and The Blue Boy to Canterbury originals, the museums here are incredible.

The Chinese garden area is serene and the Dumpling House is perfect for lunch. Recently they have had live Chinese music on Weds. at 1pm. Free garden tours. The children's garden is magical. Note that there's music in summer; well worth price. So fortunate to have this awesome estate/gardens in our neighborhood. So huge that even on free days when there's a lot of people it doesn't feel crowded. Let's all support Huntington Library and Gardens; buy a membership!,cvcalifornia
50,A must see for residents and tourists alike.,"The Huntington is a treasure. It always surprises, and leaves you relaxed and your soul refreshed. The combination of the glorious gardens, the delightful art collections, and the lovely facilities that house them is simply magical. If forced to pick a standout element among all of its joys, I would say that the cactus/succulent garden is my favorite...it's simply jaw-dropping, particularly during winter when the aloes are in bloom. If forced to prove that I'm capable of being objective, I'd say the ditching of the buffet tea was an appalling mistake and I can't forgive it. Ever. But in the end, this complaint is a drop in the ocean of magnificence that is the Huntington. Go there. Now. Do yourself a favor. You're welcome.",venckman2017
50,Pleasantly surprised,"We went on an April Sunday with some of my wife's friends. I was expecting to be bored after a couple hours but ended up spending most of the day there. Highlights: Desert garden containing various succulents and cacti, Japanese garden (minimalist) and Chinese garden (more opulent displays of wealth). But the best was the rose garden. It seemed like every possible variety of rose was on display, and in full bloom on this mild spring day. We had lunch at the dumpling house within the Chinese garden (decent). After lunch we visited a couple of the art galleries on site. I appreciated some of the historical American art, and also a display of early 20th century craftsman style architecture popular in Southern California.",Greglena
50,A wonderful full day,"Wonderful gardens to walk around showing lots of different plants. The art collection is very good both the American art of which we knew very little and the European art which had lots of British artists, Stubbs Reynolds Gainsborough and Turner. Some really wonderful pictures to look at. There are also some wonderful books to look at in the library. It took us all day to get through it all.There is a cafe for coffee drinks and snacks or there is a tea room for afternoon tea but best to book that ahead.Just one word of warning if you go by Uber make sure you get the correct gardens we first found our selves heading to Huntington gardens which is miles away near long beach.",Bab5y
50,All Day Beauty,"This is a beautiful place! This place requires a lot of walking. There are many gardens to explore. With great weather we stayed for hours.

50,Keeps getting Better,"I was last here in January. Now is May, roses are blooming, trees and shrubs are blossoming, Just an awsome place to spend an afternoon. Parking is free and tends to be sparse, so on busy days expect that to take awhile. A bit expensive, a few extra dollars on the weekend but worthwhile if you have that constraint. The volunteers and staff are great and responsive.",Barry R
40,A Peaceful Experience,"This is not a place to visit if you are in a hurry. Even if you are not, you probably will not see it all. The grounds are a major attraction and they are a source of tranquility as you walk around. It is not possible to classify them as lush, because the soil is somewhat arid, but there is vegetation of many varieties. Of the two art gallery buildings, the one for American Art was more appealing. Before you reach that building you will likely stop at the building with the Gutenberg Bible along with other books and documents. Not too far from the American Art building is the Boone Gallery that was closed when we were there, and the Brody Botanical Center. Here there are specialized environments typical of say a tropical forest. You quickly understand how they differ, and what plant life thrives in each one.The European Art building is interesting because it was the Huntington residence. You can see some of their original furniture still there.We only ventured to the Japanese Garden area, but did not make it out to the Subtropical, Australian, Jungle, Palm and Desert gardens.It is possible to visit for free the area just up to the 1919 cafe. I believe it is the Garden Court where you can sit in this large covered area where birds are flying around and chirping away, a perfect place to read a good book.",THFinPR
50,Paradise!,"Two incredible days visiting this and it wasn't nearly enough. The gardens will take your breath away, the library and art collections will make you think and leave you in awe. If you are a succulent and cacti lover, you will want to come back over and over again. To see the full grown specimens of so many incredible plants is really a treasure. If you are a collector, make sure to go on one of the seminar days, they open the nursery afterwards for retail sales. Stay in Pasadena, where there's great hotel rates, and good food. An absolute must for any horticulturist or botanist.",Porter A
50,Beautiful!,We got there on a Thursday right before 10. I have foot problems so got a wheelchair. I had called to reserve it. It was a little difficult for my husband to push up the hills so I walked at those places. We especially loved the Chinese Garden and Desert Garden. We also went into the library and American Art Museum. I think I would have spent more time in the outdoor gardens and less time indoors since it was a lovely day. This was one of the prettiest places in the LA area.,Lynnette27

A marvelous collection of natural beauty and a gentle walk among a variety of found and flora!",beavrl
50,"Amazing gardens of various types of vegetation, museums - spend the day here!","My husband loves plants and trees, and he loved this place. There are several different gardens over the area, each one with an appropriate type of vegetation, for example, an herb garden, cactus garden, Japanese and Chinese gardens, and a lovely rose garden that was not in full bloom yet when we were there. All of the grounds are lush and very well tended. Many of the plants and trees have signs to identify them. The pathways are mostly flat so walking around was not too difficult even though the grounds are quite extensive. The lawns are also dotted with numerous sculptures. We had a chance to experience a concert of Chinese music near once of the lakes in the Chinese garden. It was a lovely setting and somewhat informal, so we had an opportunity to leave when we wanted to.We also visited the Huntington Library which exhibits several old manuscripts, such as historic letters and a copy of Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales."" We did not have a chance to see the art collections.but would go back to do so next time we're in LA. There is a gift shop and cafe, but we did not actually buy anything.",PeninaPaula
50,Great and amazing park/library,"The park itself has 3 different categories: exhibition in the library, art collections, and the botanical gardens. Tourists can spend a whole day here. Strongly recommend art lovers should visit here. The number of collections here is not too many. However though the tour guide machine(iPod) tourists can know the story of the art and their relationships with the Huntington's. I definitely think it is a must see place for tourists who love art collections and exhibitions. Besides, the different gardens here are also worth seeing.",Jamie C
40,Always a pleasant walk through the park,"I love Huntington Library, have been a member for a long time. At times, I’d just come for a walk, enjoy the views of the garden and just sit in silence pondering life.The garden is beautiful with landscape offer colors in all seasons. This visit in late April has the beautiful roses in full bloom.There are two specialty gardens - Chinese and Japanese.Their architecture designs are authentic and with meticulous details.In addition two museum - one is art and the other science.If you are just visiting LA, please find tune to visit this jewel - there are a cafe restaurant with bar and a tea room for high tea. Both are fabulous as a break from your walk in the gardens.",worldwonder805
50,Impressive Gardens and Art Exhibits $29 Admission,"Note: Adult Admission on weekends is $29 ($25 on weekdays).The gardens are expansive and include a wide range of flowers and trees (desert, sub-tropical, Australian, rain forest, Japanese garden, and Chinese garden). Plan to spend the entire day if you want to see everything. The galleries are also impressive: rare bibles, historical manuscripts, sculptures, and oil paintings (inlcuding Pinkie and Blue Boy). Our visit was in the spring (temp 73 F). During the summer months, the withering heat would make it difficult to enjoy the gardens.SKIP THE CAFE: Be prepared to pay a big premium for the location. We stopped there for drinks only ($2.75 for a 20 oz. soft drink, small package of nuts $3.00). The prices were high for cafeteria level food. (sandwiches $9.50, hamburger $9.00, fries $3.95). There were large crowds of people waiting impatiently for their over-priced food. Like most food vendors inside tourist attractions - the cafe is totally not worth the price. Save your money for a real restaurant.",Jerry B
50,A must-see. It's stunning!,"When a L.A. friend recommended we visit The Huntington Library during our one week visit to L.A., we were not sure we would fit it in. I'm so glad we did.The $25 entry fee is well worth it. The library is nice but come for the amazing gardens. There are desert gardents and Japanese gardens, Australia and Chinese gardens. There are so many gardens we could not get to them.The grounds are easy to navigate and safe for even those who find walking challenging. There are grassy areas and benches for resting. It's a beautiful place to spend a few hours.If I lived in L.A. I'd get a membership to The Huntington and visit weekly, if not more often.",GraniteSprite
50,A lot to see,"We just moved back to CA from CO, and when we lived in CA over 35 years ago we had never gotten to Huntington Library. We will have to go back as there is so much to see. All the gardens were beautiful, but I need to go back to the library where they have an original Gutenberg Bible, a book by Chaucer, and several excellent pieces of artwork. It is a long drive from Temecula, especially with/in the CA traffic that never ends, but well worth the visit. Not expensive to get an admission ticket either.",madmac
50,Absolutely Incredible...a MUST see!,"The Huntington was the BEST!!! We thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. Almost did not go to it as it was not listed in TA under Pasadena where we were staying. Spent a wonderful three hours there and could have easily spent 6. Since we had limited time we asked what were the must sees. There is a great 10 minute film that was a nice orientation. In the mansion, be sure to get the free headsets. The narrative of each room was long, but you can punch in the number by the work of art you are interested in learning more about and there is about a 2-minute description. It was great since we did not have a lot of time. I loved the mansion, art, gardens, library....everything! We definitely want to come back again and spend more leisurely time.",BDD_11_12
50,Better gardens than Powerscourt Ireland.,"We enjoyed viewing what was deemed one of the most beautiful gardens in the world, Powerscourt. The Huntington Gardens in LA far surpassed Powerscourt in my humble opinion. More than a dozen principal gardens cover 120 acres. The gardens include: the rose garden, the palm garden, the desert garden, the Shakespeare garden, the Japanese garden, the Camellia garden and the North Vista. In addition, there are three art galleries. The Scott Gallery of American Art should not be missed. The price of admission is inexpensive considering the quality. Note- The Huntington is closed on Tuesdays, instead open Mondays. Price per ticket on Mondays $2 less than on the weekend",811victoria
50,The Gardens & Collections here are Simply Incredible!,"A special thank you to the staff for the time and effort that is put into the details of maintaining this wonderful LA gem! If you visit, you will understand what myself and so many other reviews love about the Huntington Library.When I first visited, I didn't plan for enough time to see everything because honestly I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised and have been back various times since.Out of everything, the gardens to me were the part of that stands out. It is really peaceful and one can escape for a moment to appreciate all that LA has to offer.Overall, I would recommend this to a friend and would come back again if in the area.I’m a fellow traveler and have always appreciated when people write about their experiences so I can make informed decisions. If this review provided value, please hit that “helpful” button so I know I’m helping others and paying it forward as well. Even if it’s just one person it’s worth it to me.

40,Beautiful Grounds and Displays!,"We had no idea there was so much to see here! Plan at least 4 hrs. We did not plan enough time to see everything. Wonderful art displays, Chinese Gardens, Japanese Gardens, Greenhouse, just to name a few. The rose gardens were not in bloom yet when we visited during spring break. Nice cafe for lunch. Recommend for teens and older. (Teens only if they like this sort of thing).",sandi8697
50,Can't see it all in one day!,Very beautifully maintained gardens. Loved the Japanese garden and the rose garden. Lots of walking. Really enjoyed the European Art museum. Unfortunately it was very hot the day we went so we left after about 3 hours. Will definitely come back when it is cooler. The admission price seemed high but worth it with all it has to offer.,JoeyDog
50,Immaculately Maintained,"I was attending the library for a conference and was able to sneak off twice to explore the gardens. First, I was able to walk around right when they opened, and it felt like I had the place to myself. The Desert Garden was dreamy, surreal almost. The greenhouse opened at 10am when I was there. Amazing cacti and succulents. I also enjoyed the Japanese Gardens (which were quite the walk to the other side); be sure to find the touchable stones that are so slick they feel soft. I wish I had more time there so budget half a day. You could eat at the cafe or bring a picnic. Also check out the museum gift store: it has some unique finds.",roaminginrome101
50,Wonderful first class botanical gardens and museums,"Excellent day trip--and for that matter, night trip if you are a member---in addition to the beautiful gardens and very good food at their restaurants, they have evening musical performances and lectures to supplement one of the magical Oasis's in the Pasadena-San Marino area.",822JohnS
50,A true gem,"Spent the day at the Huntington Library and Gardens. My first visit and I was truly impressed by the facility and the means by which they handle a throng of visitors (it was the day before Easter). Both the professional staff and the volunteer docents were helpful, knowledgeable and ever present, although not obtrusive. We couldn't possible see/do everything in one day (I could spend the entire day in the Museum store!). I plan to return on our next visit to the area. If I leaved in the are I would be a member and be there often! Make sure to visit the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, and the European Collection housed in the original estate house!",Michaeline V
50,Amazing Experience!!!,"We had such a great experience, the gardens are so wonderful!! The place is huge and there is so much to see. This place is really beautiful, and you can just relax and walk around.",Q1689ECgregoryc
50,BACK AGAIN to PASADENA so MUST GO HERE!!!,"I can never get enough of the bloomin wonderful place. the ROSE garden is the BEST I have seen in the world, the succulent garden is spectacular, many awesome birds, this time gorgeous GREEN parrots all over, hummers and bunnies running around the cactus. great photo opportunities.........LOVE IT ALL........Japanese and Chinese gardnes too JUST DON""T MISS this, ONE day a month it's FREE so go online and book 1 month in advance to get that!!",jeannette y
50,Wonderful gardens,"These gardens are a must visit if you are in Los Angeles. There are several different areas to see and we took all afternoon to walk round at a leisurely pace.The area that most impressed me was the desert garden with the amazing cacti, though I also enjoyed the Japanese and Chinese gardens.There are several places to eat and we sampled the cafe near the entrance. There was a good range of freshly prepared food.There is also a gift shop with a large range of gifts.I didn't visit the art gallery in the gardens.",Anne C
40,Stroll around and enjoy and relax,You don't have to be a botanist to enjoy the gardens and the animals running around. Good fun for old and young and just wonderful. Come before lunch to have less trouble parking.,Hagar08540
50,Become a Member,"The Huntington is a great experience for all seasons, and at the cost of a ticket it's worth it to become a member. If you're local enough, membership helps to increase the value you get seeing the different exhibitions and blooming plants. The gift shop is great, so don't forget to stop by it as well.",mxs0755
40,"Huge Garden, Beautiful Area",We were here at a bad time of year (Late Winter). Go in the Spring through Fall to see the gardens. Parking was difficult. Easy to walk around.,LaurieandBrent
40,Lazy afternoon strolling the gardens,"Spring is the perfect time to visit the Huntington sprawling gardens, most of the flowering plants and trees are in bloom, there's color everywhere and natural perfumes invade the air. The galleries are also a magnet, specially the European art, the house where the family lived their last years, lavishly decorated gives us a glimpse of the aristocracy of the early XX century.",fredyair
50,Wow!,"An Instagram friend recommended this place to me when I mentioned I would be in LA and I'm so happy she did! I was blown away by the sheer scale of the art, facilities, and landscape architecture! The botanical gardens were my favorite part, even though I also loved the American galleries (a wall George Washington portraits is my favorite) and European galleries. Mr. Huntington and his wife (whose paintings are in the museum) are fascinating characters. Don't miss the STUNNING gift shop! I mean, you can do all your gift shopping there, there is so many ornaments, decorations, cards, books, etc., it's a museum all in itself. The staff throughout the library was very helpful and informative as well.There is so much variety, there is something for everyone! A MUST if you're visiting Southern California!",arissalovesart
50,So much better than expected,"So yeah, a garden founded by a railway billionaire some 150 years ago. Turned out that the Huntington Gardens were nothing short of fabulous. Almost Singapore Zoo class in parts. And there were colibris in the wild! And a Japanese garden. And a nice food court too.",Arneby
50,Spectacular Gardens and Cultural and Art Legacy,"Every time I go to Los Angeles a visit to the Huntington Gardens has been a must - a place to relax, enjoy nature, admire magnificent collections of plants and trees placed in sectors of the manicured Park that take you to the desert, to tropical countries, a rose garden, and to Japanese and a Chinese gardens. This time we had a bite of Chinese food in the latter. The Art galleries are very special, the exhibits curated with amazing access to art not seen elsewhere. The orange grove - and this time trees were laden with fruit - is spectacular. Highly, highly recommended.",Leona F
50,The Huntington Gardens and Library,We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Huntington. We most enjoyed the Estate tour and the gardens. We look forward to returning on our next visit to Burbank.,Brooke A
50,World class botanical garden from around the world,"The design, landscaping and variety of plants will blow you away. Most impressive botanical gardens I’ve ever seen.",EndlessRoadGuy
40,Third Time a Charm,"We visit the Huntington Garden everytime we are staying in LA. This was our third visit. It's a bit pricy on weekends (almost $30), but worth it. Today we saw the Chinese and Japenese Gardens, the Special Bonsai exhibit, an early American art and special home appliances exhibit, and had lunch in the Patio Garden. The weather was perfect. Dont go when its very hot. Last time, we did and got roasted, particularly in the cactus dessert section. This is one of the largest and most extensive gardens in the US, but much of the space is open. Thus, it requires a lot of walking and energy - particularly for senior citizens. Signage getting you from place to place is scarce. So bring water and rest between the different gardens. You could spend a whole day there, but I would recommend you aim for no more than 3-4 gardens a day, that are next to each other.You would then need 2 days to do it justice.",Murray E
50,Huntington Library and Grounds,"If you are anywhere close, do not miss this. The house is gorgeous, the library amazing, the grounds and cactus garden stunning!! You could spend a couple of days if you are a museum person. I had lunch at the Chinese Tea Garden - good food very reasonably priced; and “tea” at the Japenese Tea Garden (think you need reservations) with lots of tasty treats ( little more pricey).",49MD49
50,Wonderful place to spend the day,"My Mom and I went to the Huntington to spend the day and we were Very Pleasantly surprised to find there is So Much to see! We will be going back to the Huntington again and again after our experience there. One of the highlights of our time there were the fabulous Chinese & Japanese Gardens. Every detail to these magical gardens is a beauty to behold. Reflective ponds, bonsai plants, trees in bloom, elegant temple structures, rock sculptures, etc,..there is a restaurant within the Chinese garden that is a must. There are several art museums, a library and other gardens to take in also. We only made a small dent into all there is to experience.",Kim G
50,Beautiful space,I spent an afternoon wandering around the Huntington. It was a wonderful escape. I started by getting advice from the info center and watched the brief film which explains the history of the place. The grounds are beautiful as are the museums and their buildings. Unfortunately there was a bit of construction going on in the library and museum that held European Art. Wandered around the Japanese & Chinese gardens and enjoyed wontons at the Noodle House.,krae21
50,Lucky arrival time,"For our first-time visit on 9 March, we bought our tickets at 11:30 AM. Just as we entered the park, a free garden tour was beginning, and we joined it. The volunteer guide, Brian, was extremely knowledgeable and conducted an incredible 2 and 1/2 hour tour. Most of the time was spent in the 12 acre desert portion of the park which was extremely interesting and unusual. We learned a lot about how certain plants could flourish in the desert while others struggled. We ended the tour at the Chinese garden where we ate a delicious winter salad. Then we returned to the Japanese garden which is very beautiful, and we took many photos. A few nights later we were watching agents G. Callen, Sam Hanna, and the rest of the NCIS LA team on TV. They were meeting in a tropical garden in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) preparing a mission to rescue Hetty from a Vietnamese prison. That Vietnamese garden sure looked familiar.Guess what? The agents were actually meeting in the Japanese garden at the Huntington Botanical Gardens. Recommendation: Go to the Huntington gardens! You can imagine you are almost anywhere in the world, even Saigon.",tomski72
50,Fantastic gardens- number one thing to see in Pasadena,"We found this by mistake, we were at the Descanso gardens and the lady in line behind us said Huntington Library was fabulous. This place did not disappoint. Gorgeous gardens - do not miss the desert garden. Cafe 1919 has a wide selection of fresh delicious food but walk to the tea room first before you make your decision. The tea room is small and beautiful with tiered stands of finger sandwiches and delights. Gorgeous grand buildings house European and American art. The science building has a Gutenberg bible and Chaucers fairytales. Labels on most of the plants. Camellias, poppies azaleas were in bloom in March. No tulips here but so many other species it was incredible. Great herb garden.",dallasmommy
50,Absolutely Beautiful,"The Japanese and Chinese gardens are my favorite! All of the gardens are wonderful for relaxing, sketching, and to feel like you are away from the city. It was a warm day in February and my boyfriend and I were hot after walking through half of the property so we ducked into the galleries.The AC gave us a reprieve from the heat and we could enjoy the exhibits in comfort.The galleries offer a range of literature, paintings, and early exploration of science and tech exploration. The highlight for me was to see a painting by an artist I admire, Mary Cassat. In the science area I was unexpectedly fascinated by the various samples of early light bulbs. It was intriguing to see the many forms it's taken and to think about the work put into their development.If you have the time I recommend seeing as much as you can. Depending on your pace it can take most of the day to explore everything.",Shizue H
50,One of Los Angeles's best sights,"I'm still a bit taken by the visit, a stunning botanical garden offering a varied range of exciting vegetation from near and far.Add some amazing art collections with focus on European Art from the 15th to the early 20th century.Highly recommended!",Phayao13
50,"Incredible Place, More than You Can See in One Day",This place is huge and there's more than you can see in one day. The botanical gardens are incredible and the displays include some amazing pieces like a Gutenberg Bible and original copies of great works from the 1400's. A great place to spend a day.,PowerTrippers
40,Amazing Gardens,"Our family took a tour of the Gardens at Huntington Park. We witnessed some Chinese Festival entertainment and toured the Chinese Garden, the Desert Garden, and more. What a wonderful place, wish I had more time there.",Curt K
50,Always a treat!,"I’ve been coming here for a couple of decades.We do not come as often as I like due The the entry fee, but it’s always a wonderful time when we do.Gorgeous collections (art and flora).Although famous for the rose gardens, there is so much more.The cacti garden is outstanding.Don’t pass up the koi in the Japanese garden. The tea house and bonsai are lovely.",Barbara H
50,Marvelous Collection,"This is our second time visiting the Huntington and, of course, we haven't seen it all. It would take more visits. After all the other reviews saying how spectacular this museum and library are, what more can I say?We had visited several years ago and had remembered several things that we wanted to see again. Gainsborough's 'Blue Boy', Lawrence's 'Pinkie', the Gutenberg Bible, Hopper's 'Long Leg', Ptolemy's maps of the world, the early maps of the US, the Greene and Greene exhibits and the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit and others.Well, we've seen these, lots more and, funny, we still have not scratched the surface. There is still more we would like to see. Some other time. Nest time.",Nancy F
40,Beautiufl,The gardens are so lovely. I particularly loved the desert plants. There are some art exhibits throughout the gardens that are cool. There are also some lovely little lunch places to try. We went to the Rose Garden Tea and it was excellent.,trishakelley
50,One of my all-time favorite places. Perfect just about everyone.,"I've been to the HL so many times & every time with a different group: once with my mom. Then my cousin and her teenage daughter. then my man. and my sis. This place offers a perfect combination of art, history, nature, botanic and atmosphere. I recommend taking the tour: it's free and the seniors who guide them are extremely knowledgeable and sweet. We could spend hours outside, walking through the desert garden, the Japanese garden, the lake, the English rose garden etc. Not all gardens are in bloom all year around & I know this because I was there in almost all seasons. So don't expect the rose garden for example to be up in bloom all year round. But still, there's so much to see. The inside is also fascinating. I especially loved the old, rare books. You can combine the visit with a stop for walking around, shopping or eating at Pasadena. Highly recommended.",Chokocat
50,Hugh place. Blue Boy and Pinkie were beautiful.,Went here for high tea and got the bonus of gorgeous art and grounds. It's a very large place with European and American art. They also have a Gutenberg bible. The grounds are exquisite with many different types of gardens.,Connie12
50,Beautiful Gardens,We were there they were celebrating the Chinese New Year and though it was crowded it was still very walkable? You need a half day just to do the Gardens! We never made it to the museums but will be back.,JAN B
50,Amazing Place,"We wished we had more time here. There was so much to see. The gardens were beautiful, the art and books were so interesting. We had high tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room, which we really enjoyed.",Kandygram
50,Best designed gardens I have seen in the US so far,"You need to plan a whole day for it if you want to see both gardens and the art collections. The desert garden, Chinese garden, and Japanese garden are the best. The Chinese garden is so beautifully designed with details and culture elements, better than the onesI have seen in China. I will definitely visit again if I ever come back to LA, as the rose garden was not in the season, and the tea room has to be booked in advance to secure a seat.",xiaohongw2015
40,Little Big Oasis,"Mandatory visit if you love nature, history and world in general. You can have a little piece of most parts of the world - desert, jungle... and even visit the ancient orient, everything in one place! I highly recommend it and also give you the following considerations: it is a huge place, so have in mind you will have to walk (a lot!). I went alone so unless you are a really fan, go with somebody else; be careful on going on summer, huge place and cannot hide from the sun! And think on having some water. Besides that, it is a great whole day experience.",sergirisco
50,Looove it!,"The Huntington Library is definitely one of my favorite places to visit in LA County. My first visit was in February 2017 and I enjoyed it so much that I became a member. As a member, I have visited several times in the past year and I have enjoyed every visit. The Japanese and Chinese botanical gardens are absolutely beautiful. All other botanical gardens are also pretty great and the few cafes available serve tasteful and quality food. Whether you want to enjoy art, exhibitions, botanical gardens, or a good book or picnic on one of the lawns/gardens, this is a great choice that will never dissapoint.",jbirrueta79
50,Gorgeous grounds and really interesting museum,"This is a beautiful place and an oasis in crazy LA. Spent about 5 hours. They have a variety of beautiful gardens.....Chinese, Japanese, Desert, Austrailian, etc. Just wondeful. Art collections in the museums are amazing. Had a nice lunch at one of the outdoor grills. Beautiful photo opportunities everywhere.",BookReader31
50,"Extensive Buildings, Impressive Exhibits & Grounds","We visited the Huntington Library on Sat. 23 Sept. 2017. There’s free parking on site. Especially delightful was seeing the many excellent displays of rare and original manuscripts & publications. Placards described the importance of the work and provided context to the times. It takes a lot of walking to cover the many buildings holding American and European art and the extensive Chinese & Japanese gardens. We spent five hours including lunch and saw about 75% of what is there. Weekday admission $25 Adult, $21 Senior (65+) & Students, $13 Youth (4-11), weekend & holidays additional.Did this review earn a “helpful” vote?",JohnAnnColumbia_MD
50,Went for afternoon tea and found so much more,"We travelled up from the beach to the Huntington Estate which took an hour with no traffic hold ups. If we had caught traffic it would have been a disaster as you need a full day to scratch the surface of this wonderful estate. We had been given entry tickets ($21 each seniors) and the price of afternoon tea in the rose garden ($35 each) as a present and it was one of the best presents we have received in a long time. The gardens were fabulous, even though it was too early for most things - imagine what it will be like in the summer, there was so much to see and explore. The Japanese garden was our favourite with a remarkable collection of bonsai and sympathetic planting. We could only wiz through the two main galleries and the library as we had so little time but, although they make a big thing of having Gainsborough's Blue Boy, there are a couple of Turners and Constables too. Our afternoon tea was a great success and so well delivered - make a reservation as you could be disappointed. We can't wait to go again in November when we are next over in this part of the world.",VirginAgent
50,The Hunting library tour was excellent and informative. We had such a lovely time and I can't wait to go again.,It was a wonderful tour and I would recommend this to anyone. Our tour guide was so informative and polite. We had such a lovely day.,peggyfenger
50,Beautiful place to visit while in Los Angeles,I have lived in LA all my life and never went to the Huntington. What a lovely place to spend the day. The gardens are just wonderful. The artifacts they have on display are fascinating and you could spend several days there without truly seeing everything.,Becky197043
50,Amazing Gardens and Amazing Art Collection,"We are here at East Los Angeles College for a four day swim meet and found out about this place and decided to sneak there for a couple hours between the morning and evening swims. We wish we would have had more time. The gardens are beautiful. We were limited on time so went to see the Japanese Gardens, where there are some wonderful bonsais, the Chinese Garden, which was so beautiful. We ate lunch at the Freshwater Dumpling and Noodle House. No reserved seats, but were able to find a table outside overlooking the pond. We shared a winter salad and a Hunan Rice Bowl. The Huntington Mansion houses wonderful art, including the piece called Pinkie and Blue Boy. Our only regret is that we didn't have enough time to see more. We were there 3 hours. Indeed we were a bit frustrated at first trying to orient ourselves but if you read the map that you are given, it isn't to hard to figure out. There were many people around to ask and they were helpful in guiding us to place. We wanted to eat at the Rose garden Tea house bt did not have reservations, so I would recommend them, we would have been seated a couple hours later but we were on a time crunch. Parking was free and admission was 25.00 per adult. A beautiful place in a big city........",Evi_02
50,Brilliant,"This should be on anyone's itinerary in the Los Angeles area. Gardens great (also being extended) other displays of art and the libraries with world class items make this a real gem. We've done all the usual in LA area (Getty, Natural history etc.) and this is the pick of them all, mainly because of such a variety things to see. If you are visiting from Europe this doesn't seem to appear on itinerary lists from the usual travel guides. Just read a review saying it was difficult to navigate and the ""staff"" were unhelpful. Not our experience! Map is dead easy to follow and the staff (mainly volunteers after all) were very helpful!Loved it and a day wasn't enough!",graham w
20,"Shame on you, Huntington Gardens!","The grounds and botanical gardens are spectacular, without a doubt (which is why it gets such continued good ratings) BUT: this place is confusing, with maps that don't take you anywhere, and with a staff that doesn't know where they are, or how to tell you how to get to where you want to be. There was little to no signage on buildings--we had no idea what was where, and the directional signagle was basically non-existent. During our entire visit we continually came across others who were lost and asked us for directions. We paid almost $100 for 3 people on a Sunday that touted a camelia sale and display. We found the camelias by accident, and when we stumbled upon the ""sale""--we found that there was more variety, healthier looking specimens, and better prices at the local nurseries. The citrus gardens were completely off-limits, and while we were told they have a wonderful art collection, we could never figure out which building it was housed in. The gift shop was expensive, but beautiful, with a nice selection, although numerous items had no price tags. Again, the grounds are gorgeous, but their management should be ashamed of themselves for not having proper maps, plant identification signs, and trained staff. WIth these kinds of prices, they certainly should be able to afford it!",Julie W
50,A wonderful experience!,"If you are in the Pasadena/San Marino area this is a MUST! We spent the better part of a day there and didn't see anywhere near all that could be seen. The art, the different gardens and the restaurants are all delightful. DON'T MISS THIS GEM!",John B
50,"Books, Botanticals and Blue Boy (art & antiques)",Beautifully landscaped sculpture garden. Lots of paths designed with period and cultural aspects. The art is expectional (broad range). From European to American and exhibit galleries. The antiques (furniture and objects) are quintessential to the property. What a nice broad range. The library and rare collection of first edition books is a must! One must visit this gem property with plenty of time to take in all its facets and features. Images below,Trendy_Explorer
50,Above and Beyond,"I have been to the Huntington Library and Gardens on two occasions. If you appreciate gardening, this is the place for you! The museum buildings are impeccable and the art work and library titles are simply incredible.One should know that you will not see all of library/ museums/gardens in one visit. ( I would say this a place to be savored over at least 5 visits/ different trips.)It is easily a full and greatly appreciated experience for a day.",justme54481
50,The desert garden is spectacular,"I went with my family and we enjoyed all the gardens, but specially the desert garden, the jungle garden and the children's garden. I really enjoyed the classical sculpture dotted around the grounds. There was so much to see we never made it to the art collection or the library.",vrp242
50,Commination of arts and gardens,"Good historical heritage you can't miss if you travel Los Angeles. The landscape divided into several independent theme park, indoor botanical and museum. I personal like the desert garden since very seldom to travel in dry desert, there is a lot of difference kind of cactus which never seen before. Chinese garden still increasing, lot of construction site going on. Volunteer tour guides are helpful and friendly. Free parking is a great offer.",Albert L
50,"A gem, not to be missed in Southern California","Born and raised in Southern California, it wasn't until I moved away that I visited the Huntington Library for the first time in my long 65 years. And I was totally blown-away! While only a short drive from the centre of Los Angeles, it will transport you miles and miles away from the hub-bub of the city. It's spectacular and should be added to everyone's ""must-sees"" during a visit to Los Angeles. Or even for those day-tripping Angelenos looking for something to do on a beautiful day. An entire day can be spent, meandering the gardens - the best desert garden I've ever seen - including the botanical gardens in Phoenix and Palm Springs - Chinese and Japanese gardens are spectacular! It's a feast for the eyes and the senses. The mansion is extraordinary with a fantastic art collection. Tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room was a lovely throw back to an earlier time - delicious and great service. A wonderful day - a true gem of Southern California.",503cheryl
50,Allow Enough Time,The Huntington Library is a great place for a long visit. There is so much to see and do. The exhibits are excellent and the grounds are wonderful. The are several famous pieces such as Blue Boy and a Guttenberg Bible as well as many others. Don't miss the manor house and its interesting history.,Johnsotr
50,"A gem, a highlight, must do thing in L.A.","One of the best memories from L.A. It is mansion that consists of botanical gardens (rose garden, Chinese garden and desert garden), art collection (Blue boy painting and European palace style interiors) and library (Gutenberg Bible) where each part worth a full day. Volunteer tour guides are amazing. Their Café is a thing on it's own, with fancy organic food and terrace facing botanical garden.

50,Very Positive Surprise,"We were going to spend a few hours here, but ended up rushing at the end of the day to complete seeing most of it. Very beautiful gardens, and the library will blow you away....",Brett C
20,"Confusing, Expensive.","Our tour visited the Huntington Library and some of us gathered for lunch at the 1919 Café. I found the ordering system to be confusing and the prices too high for lunch. There are areas set up for the type of food one wants whether ethnic; Asian, Mexican, or something else. Prices are on overhead boards and if you chose the Hamburger Plate, there are slips of paper for you to indicate how you want it prepared. Fries and cheese are extra. These are cooked to order and then you decide on dessert in a different area, drinks from a third place, and pay in another. The order is called when finished. All this to avoid a wait staff, but the prices could have paid for wait persons. Then, one buses their own dishes.The food was OK, but not worth the hassle or the cost. Nothing was special or remarkable. A disappointment.",Violette54
50,The Huntington Library in San Marino,"The is the best garden in southern California and a hugh collection of arts other than the Getty Museum. But the garden in the Getty Museum is no way compare to the garden in this Library. This Library is also located in the heart of the city, very convenient location. The houses around the Library are also in higher class community.",King M
50,"Gardens, books, and art","I can’t believe it took me so long to visit this stunning property! Plan to spend at least three hours here – there is so much to see! The gardens are absolutely lovely, from the cactus and succulent garden, to the Japanese garden, and everything else. Even in December there was still much to be hold. We enjoyed afternoon tea by the beautiful rose garden as well. Spend time in the library where there are so many rare books, including the Gutenberg Bible and Canterbury Tales. Then there are multiple art exhibits, both American and European, all worthwhile. Don’t forget to take in Pinky and Blue Boy. Truly priceless works of art. The admission is very reasonable for everything you can see and do, and includes audio guides for the art exhibits. There are other places to stop and eat throughout the day if you need a snack as well. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting anywhere close by in Southern California.",Kaymtravel7
50,What a fabulous surprise,"We have visited many gardens, many art museums, and a few libraries. This is all rolled into one glorious property. You will need the entire day to explore all the riches it offers. Walk the gardens early in the day, before it gets too crowded. During the hot part of the day, do the museums and library. The museum of American Art is spectacular. Do not miss the library. It is filled with treasures.",Helen B
50,"Relaxing, amazing range of attractions","We have visited the Huntington several times over the past 6-7 years, and have found something new and interesting each time.If you are a gardener, this 208-acre beautifully-landscaped parkland should be a compulsory stopover - although a single visit will hardly scratch the surface.If you are interested in history and art, the galleries are also wonderful.And if you need some sustenance, the cafe and tearooms offer a delicious array of food and drinks. Highly recommended!",Michael B
50,Incredible,"Our first visit was amazing. We started by walking the gardens. The cactus garden was more than amazing, nothing compares. Other highlights were the Chinese garden, palm garden, rose garden. Plan to do a lot of walking. We also saw the library collection which is so special. We plan to do the art collections on our next visit which we are already planning. I envy those who live close by! What a great place to spend your day.",Dansker58
50,One of the most magical places in Los Angeles,"I can spend hours here.

50,"Overwhelming Amount of Beauty, Culture, and Knowledge","If there’s any place I know of that truly deserves a five-star rating, it’s the Huntington Library. It is huge and grand in scope, with Japanese and Chinese gardens, art galleries, the main Gilded Age house owned by the Huntington’s, and of course the library with a whole assortment of famous texts. Pinkie and Blue Boy are famous paintings that both reside here; there is also a pretty large American art gallery and the library has some absolutely stunning books and writings including a copy of the Declaration of Independence, Shakespeare’s first folio of plays, the Canterbury Tales, and of course one of only 21 copies of the Gutenberg Bible to be completely intact. There was an exhibit about the Protestant Reformation with Martin Luther’s writings (not Martin Luther King obviously even though today is his birthday) which I thought was pretty interesting and I also really enjoyed the scientific discoveries exhibit which had writings from Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, and Charles Darwin. There is still so much that I wasn’t able to see and I believe I spent about 4 hours here, so that tells you just how massive this place is. This library shows you so much and beckons you to return so that you can uncover even more things that you missed the last time. The admission price may be a bit steep ($29 on holidays), but with how much this place has to offer, it is money well spent. Overall, I’m extremely impressed and will definitely return in the future.",Colby S
50,"Library, Art, Gardens - It has it all","A terrific place to spend a day. Several hundred acres of botanical gardens, fabulous artwork and a library that includes a Guttenberg bible. Don't expect to see it all in a day or two or three.",Barry R
50,Get just the highlights in one visit.,"You can’t do it all in one day. There is simply too much to see and learn. This is one of the most incredible venues in the world for experiencing the development history of this area of California, view a huge variety of botanicals arranged in biome settings, and experience works of art that provide experiences you have never had previously. I can’t say much about the actual library because that is an area of the site I have not experienced.Start out in the orientation center and watch the short video about the Huntingtons. They impacted Pasadena and all of Southern California in ways that have had lasting impact. I was particularly impressed with how their wealth affected the landscape and people. Be sure to pick up a map, I found the directions arrows to be limited in their guidance but the map helps you find your way.The gift shop is very impressive with a variety of books and objects not typically found in other shops.There are several cafes and places to get a drink.All of the buildings have clean washrooms.On busy days the parking can be difficult and you may need to walk quite a distance.",Linda F
20,False advertising,"While the overall package is impressive and the grounds are undeniably beautiful, I am unimpressed with my visit.Two separate people at the information booth, one consulted first thing and one mid-afternoon, did not have information on what I was asking about. The expensive estate tour I paid $24 for wasn't very different from the free garden tour I started out on, and it ran 63 minutes long in spite of the website claiming it to be approximately 90 minutes. Finally, I bought a ticket with some signage indicating that a membership pays itself off in under three visits. When I went to get a membership mid-visit, having taken a leisurely lunch since I was convinced I'd be back multiple times, I learned that $159 is the minimum price for a membership. That would be more than six weekday visits to pay off membership. There is no membership offered for an individual.Karyn deals with guest experiences, and our phone conversation about what I dealt with was cordial, in-depth, and heartfelt. Her e-mail to the powers that be? It sits unanswered more than 48 hours later. Says a lot.",JJKFETP

On my first trip, I remember seeing succulents which I never saw back in New Jersey. Important stop for visitors!",JustinaTucson
50,Our first visit,We were visiting our son and girlfriend in California and he put the Huntington on the list for this trip. I have wanted to come here for years. It was beyond my expectations.

Over two hundred acres featuring many types of beautiful gardens: japanese, chinese, desert, palm, rose, etc. Many museum buildings featuring outstanding art, including the original Huntington home.

40,Beautiful place,"We were with a tour group for the Rose Bowl and opted to visit the Huntington. We did not have enough time to really see all there was to see. We saw the exhibits in the library which were so interesting. We are book collectors so it was fascinating to see the books there. We also got to see a temporary exhibit on rock art. The gardens are beautiful, it it would take at least a day to see some of them. We stopped for coffee, and enjoyed the people who shared a table with us. A wonderful place!",Laura P
50,Beautiful!,"We visited Huntington as part of a tour group, so we didn't have much time there, but the time we did have was fantastic! We started off with a tour guide, but about 10 minutes into the tour, we opted to go off on our own. This was due to nothing the tour guide did, but since we only had a couple hours, we wanted to see the art galleries and the gardens. We could have spent 2 more hours just walking through the gardens. The grounds and galleries were well-kept and clean. If ever in the area again, I would certainly re-visit Huntington to see what we were not able to see on this trip.",LauraandThomas
50,Botanical gardens are spectacular especially the Desert section,"Four of us wandered around here for a few hours and we enjoyed it immensely, especially the succulents area which is extensive. The Jungle garden was disappointing.We ate at the Patio Grill, tucked behind the tea room. Food was great (particularly the home-made soup) as was the outdoor seating and the pleasant service.Too much to see in one visit!The only disappointment was waiting for a free tour we were told would start at 11:30 but no one showed up to lead it. When I asked, I was told that the volunteer had not showed up. They should have let us know we were waiting for nothing but they did not.",Ann F

Nice, smooth concrete & asphalt paths for the stroller, plenty of benches in strategic locations for a rest, wheelchair ramps for the stroller, both sunny & shady areas and water fountains. The cactus & succulent garden is outstanding - especially the barrel cacti. So glad the rose garden had not yet been pruned. The Children’s Garden was great fun for both the 5yo and adults. Can hardly wait to return to see plants in other seasons! While admission is a bit pricey, it seems to be well spent on upkeep (imagine the water bills alone!) & education.",JeepMom05
40,Lovely,"Perhaps I was expecting too much but after hearing friends from the west coast rave about the Huntington for years , it fell a little short for me. Yes, the home and various gardens are lovely and interesting as is the library collection and the art, but while I was there two out of six of their top features were not on display and were instead replaced with facsimilies, namely Blue Boy and the Chaucer. Although it doesn't seem to be well promoted the Dibner history of science exhibit is well worth taking in.",chr_8

The place is quite large to explore, so plan your time accordingly, and wear comby shoes.Spend a beautiful day here, and it will take your breath away.",SheenaGao
50,Outstanding in every way.,"We visited the Huntington mainly for their library. I knew about the Chaucer manuscripts, Gutenberg Bible, Shakespearean folio, rare maps, and historical prints. What I wasn't prepared for was the size and variety of their magnificent gardens. With fifteen separate gardens the senses are overwhelmed. Our favorites were the Japanese, Chinese, and Shakespeare gardens, though that might change if we had time to see all of them. The Huntington mansion house, which holds an outstanding art collection is equally worthwhile. While all the art is amazing and irreplaceable, we were especially surprised the collection houses Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy"" (1770). The only problem with the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens is that no matter how long you stay, you won't have enough time (we were there for 5 hours). We have been to museums, art collections, and gardens around the world, and while individually there are more magnificent examples of each, you will not find such an outstanding combination of all three anywhere!",Denny S

They have several gardens, we love the the rose garden, the desert garden, the Australian garden, the Japanese garden, the Chinese garden.

Butler exposition, and read her books afterwards.",Eleonora_673
50,"Beautiful Walk on a Sunny, Warm December Day","Sister-in-law and her husband suggested this to wife and me. We drove from Westminster CA. to San Marino in a little over an hour. Very surprised at large numbers of people of all ages swarming the entrances and parking lot. Luckily parking is free and admission is $25 per adult. As first-time visitors, we chose the walking tour conducted by a volunteer guide. The tour takes about 2 hours and there is no additional charge. He was knowledgeable about how the gardens were constructed under the sponsorship of an early 20th century railroad tycoon, Henry Huntington. The gardens have several distinct themes and vegetation, e.g., Chinese and Japanese gardens; Desert garden; Rose garden, etc. We were very impressed with all of the beautiful landscaping. There are also buildings with indoor plants, paintings (Blue Boy is highlight), and a vast library of valuable books. Could spend several days more exploring this wonderous place. There are numerous food offerings and restaurants. We visited one that offered sushi, burgers, pizza, and sandwiches. Very happy with cheeseburger and fries. Sister-in-law and husband had soup (asparagus) and sandwiches. Note that these meals ran about $15 per person and they serve beer!",Buck911

We only spent about three hours there so saw a small portion of the 200 acres. But everything we saw was spectacular. The exhibit at the library was riveting (I imagine that this changes regularly and yet is always riveting), and the Chinese Garden is exquisite. Although the parking lot was busy when we arrived, there is no sense of too many people, and they all spread out among the many attractions and the grounds.

50,A nature and lanscape photographer's paradise.,"The gardens are well worth your time and cost of the visit as a nature photographer. This short review covers only the two Asian (Chinese and Japanese) gardens, which is a subset of all botanical gardens in Huntington Library.There is a gap close to 100 years when the two libraries were built. The Japanese Garden reflects an orderly, simple, serene and tranquil qualities of a typical Asian garden in early 1900. As you compose the photo scenes, there is always a focal element you can easily capture to demonstrate a harmony between men and nature. The Japanese dwelling architecture, internal furnishings and external layout of rocks and greens symbolize a culture at ease with the natural elements on earth.The newer Chinese garden, on the other hand, packs a lot of scenic content into a small place. With every twist and turn on your path, there will be lots of subject content to focus on. At times, scene composition can be complex among the willows, lake reflection, bridges, stationary boat, tea house and waterfall rocks. Suggest a photographer takes the time needed to absorb what comes along before their work. Phase II of this garden is still in progress. Plan your visit again at a later time.To cut it short, both gardens present a well-orchestrated sensory and scenic experience. Enjoy!",Anthony L
50,Enjoy this year 'round,"You can enjoy Huntington Library year-round. My favorite time is when the rose gardens are in bloom, but there are attractions that are to be enjoyed no matter what the season. The cactus garden is like an alien landscape, not to be missed. We enjoy the museums when the weather is hot or rainy. Here you can see the famous paintings of Pinky and Blue Boy, a Gutenberg Bible, and lots of beautiful stuff I'm happy I don't have to dust.",Wendor818
50,Wish I had two days here!,"It is hard to prioritize what to see when you visit the Huntington - it not only has a world famous library (the Gutenberg Bible, manuscripts of works by Jack London, a letter from Charles I to a supporter shortly before he was executed, the First Folio of Shakespeare's works, to name just a few), but also two world class museums. The European museum is, of course, the most well known think Gainsborough, Reynolds, Van Dyck, Ramsey, Sevres porcelain, Wedgewood.... And then there is the American Museum, which was an impressive collection of quilts, early American furniture, glass by Tiffany (including a temporary collection that is mind blowing), and contemporary American art.But there are also the gardens - one showcasing roses, another cactus, and special gardens in the Japanese manner and also the Chinese manner. There are a couple of greenhouses - one for tropical and rain forest plants, another for cactus and succulents.Of course, there are places to eat, 5 in all, including- a noodle and dumpling cafe at the Chinese garden, the Rose Garden tea room for a proper British tea (make a reservation in advance!) the 1919 Cafe serving sandwiches , pizzas, salads, and the like, the Red Car, serving coffee, and the patio grill. All of these offer the opportunity to sit down and refuel.Here are some suggestions:1. There is one free day each month (First Thursday). On that day your must sign up for the free ticket in advance, and none are sold that day - so, if you don't have a free ticket and show up hoping to buy one, you are out of luck, as we discovered!2. Admission cost includes maps of the garden, however, be sure to visit the orientation gallery, just past the ticket booths before starting your visit so that you will have a better understanding of the Huntingtons and the things you are going to see.3. Wear good walking shoes, a hat if you plan to explore the gardens, and carry water.4. You are not allowed to wear backpacks, even if they are just small backpack purses, in the galleries. (You can sling the purse over 1 shoulder and hold it under your arm, however).5. Water bottles may not be carried in your hand in the galleries. They have to be put into your purse, or left outside.6, There are free lockers in the galleries into which you can place your backpacks and/or water bottles.7. FREE Accousteguides are available in both the European and American galleries. Be sure to take one, because it will add greatly to your enjoyment of the art.8. There are free docent lead tours of the gardens. Check the website for times, and plan accordingly.The Huntington is a treasure house! Allow plenty of time to enjoy its riches.",nevertooold53

50,An amazing treasure,"The Huntington, covering some 200+ acres, established by Henry Huntington in the early 1900s, is a MUST visit. The site comprises a variety of different-themed botanical gardens; Huntington’s San Marino villa with its magnificent collection of European art and a superb library that houses a number of different exhibitions. The gardens are outstanding and full of interest, ranging from the desert garden, with a spectacular collection of unusual cacti and succulents, to the serene, quiet and exquisite Japanese and Chinese gardens with ponds, a Japanese House and ceremonial Tea garden. My wife and I were struck particularly by the Huntington villa, with its grand hall and dual staircase and the drawing and dining rooms. But the highlight is undoubtedly the art on display. Henry Huntington was obviously an Anglophile as the collection includes a number of portraits and landscapes by Thomas Gainsborough - unfortunately, the famous “Blue Boy” had been removed for restoration - Joshua Reynolds, J.M.W. Turner and John Constable, among others. Other European art includes paintings by Watteau, Canaletto and van Dyck, magnificent tapestries, sculptures and collections of wonderful Sevres porcelain ware. We visited two of the permanent exhibits in the library. The “Remarkable Works, Remarkable Times” exhibit contains some extraordinary works, including a beautifully, decorated manuscript of Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” (ca 1400-1405), a Gutenberg Bible (ca 1450-1455), a first edition of Shakespeare’s collected plays (1623) and a wonderfully illustrated “Birds of America” by Audubon. The “Beautiful Science; ideas that changed the world” exhibit with works and letters - original and facsimiles - by Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Einstein, which we both thoroughly enjoyed (being science instructors!).The Huntington should be top of your agenda if you are in the Pasadena area. We didn’t have time to visit the on-site restaurants as we were too busy enjoying the exhibits and gardens although we did manage to grab a coffee in the Red Car coffee shop while we waited to be picked up after a most exhilarating and full day!",Robin J

50,Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens,"I can spend a whole day exploring the treasures contained in this diverse venue. There are a various gardens to walk through and savor the beauty of each area. The Library with the fine collection is worth a slow walk through. One of the Guttenberg Bibles is the centerpiece of the library collection. The main house is filled with European art, furnishings, silver, dishes and other 18th Century European items. Take the free self-guided audio tour and go at your own pace. Fine American art is housed in another building. There is a cafeteria style café with excellent food. It is one of those museums that begs a leisurely stroll rather than a quick look-see. Although it may appear expensive with general adult admission of $25/person and $29 on weekends, it is well worth the one day vacation.",lovetotravel92630

50,A Treasure in Pasadena,"This is an amazing treasure, with books and art which reminded us of Europe. The gardens are spectacular and I imagine in the Spring they are even more beautiful. We traded our day passes for an annual membership because we just have to see the seasons change in the gardens. This is not to be missed.",Terri D
50,What a gem!,"A visit to the Huntington library was recommended by a friend and a short Uber drive from downtown LA brought us there.Absolutely wonderful gardens, galleries and to top,it off an great restaurant. Not to be missed,",elsvw
50,Great place to visit,"We spent hours along the Huntington Library, walking around and listening to a very refined guide who taught us about the building of the magnificent gardens and the unique library. Unmissable.",franciscaa820
50,What a lovely day!,"4 older adults borrowed 2 wheel chairs and spent the afternoon having tea and walking the gardens, the )Huntington mansion and the Library. Wonderful visions and everyone was very gracious and helpful. There are several days worth of activities and visions but it was a great afternoon for us oldsters!",kdlosangeles
40,Pretty area for a visit,"The Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens is a pretty stop while you are in the Pasadena/San Marino area. It offers several settings for your enjoyment and some nice outdoor areas.",buffalojim67
50,Fabulous gardens,We spent a wonderful day visiting these expansive gardens. Be prepared for lots of walking if you want to view everything. Lovely library buildings and museums where you can visit and escape from the heat. Has a beautiful tearooms in the rose garden. We enjoyed a superb afternoon tea here. You have to book tearoom in advance. Tickets for the gardens can be purchased online. It has a cafe and gift shop at the main entrance serving very nice coffees. It gets very hot so bring a water bottle with you. You can refill it at the water fountains dotted around the gardens. Plenty of shady areas to relax and have a picnic too. Great photo opportunities in all the gardens. The Japanese gardens are not to be missed with their beautiful pagodas and lakes.,Theresehols
50,Unique place,This is a very unique place to have vision enjoy much. They collected many masterpieces of art. You can walk outdoor to see many beautiful flowers and plants in different gardens also. Good for whole family to visit.,pldj m
50,A must see!!,I was so impressed with the grounds - they are absolutely beautiful! Staff were very friendly and welcoming.,Beth P
40,Put on your Walking Shoes To Cover Complex,"This is an amazing place. The collections are extensive, easy to spend the majority of the day. Art Gallery wonderful, try to take a guided tour to get the most out of it.Relax and take a break from the educational overload on a garden bench or enjoy a cool drink and snack at an outdoor table.Bring extra cash, their shops are chuck full of lovely items. Many small unusual items perfect for stocking stuffers and books for all ages you would normally not find. Lovely textiles, linens and scarves which are light and easy to pack in a suitcase.Had a private tour of a special Regency Jane Austen collection of items that experts gave background on in one of the archive display rooms. Very worthwhile. They do special programs for groups.The luncheon was tasty they offered for several hundred of us, but I imagine based on your needs any request can be met.The Huntington is one of America’s treasure spots, well worth a visit wether for a family with teens or a large conference group. Even if on your own, the complex is so large you can find a quiet spot to take it all in.",sallen1079
50,"Great Art, Books in a terrific Setting",We visited as a 3 generation family on a very very hot Sunday in September. We would have liked to explore the wonderful gardens more ......... but the heat with very young children in tow drove us into the fine Art galleries and the world famous Library. Never thought we would get to see an original Gutenburg Bible or early printed Chaucer. WOW!Loved the Art galleries and really pleased to see British Art being appreciated.,BobandJosie
50,Hanh's Huntington Library Review,"I was amazed at how kept everything was and how security guards were friendly enough to give people directions. I am a bit disappointed at how many trashcans are around the area however, it is also to help prevent people from throwing trash around as well. I loved the history and descriptions of gardens throughout. The Australian and subtropical forest were hard to determine what they were supposed to look at. I felt like I was just walking through grass and trees without no real way of knowing where I was going so I saw no difference between the two. Overall, I was definitely amazed at both the gardens and library buildings. I can't wait to take my parents here when they're more settled.",hanh154
50,Beautiful property in need of better signage and navigation aids.,"The gardens, art, and architecture were absolutely stunning. You need to work on peoples’ navigation aids. The distance between buildings was hard to judge and the best path to use wasn’t always clear. How about an app with a map, you-are-here tracking dot, and a walk-time to various buildings?Loved our visit!",J8399LZjackh
50,amazing,this place is filled with beautiful scenery and people as well . This is a must see ! I spent the day exploring It was so much to cover I knew I had to come back from time to time so excited to buy a membership package!,ambermelvisha
50,Wow! I had no idea how great this place was,"Spent a day with a friend at his suggestion in summer. When I looked online before hand it looked interesting, but the website does not do this place justice. It's a fantastic garden and library. It's definitely world class and if you're into art and botany/gardening, you could easily spend a day here. I was most impressed with the rose, Japanese, and Chinese gardens, but the whole place is amazing. The kids garden is also fun and so was the American art museum. Overall, I highly recommend this place as a must visit if time allows it.",Mike D
50,A Beautiful Day,"This was my children's' first visit to the Huntington Library. I say children but they are 18, 16, and 12. Last time I was here, I was younger than all three of them but I had lasting impressions, specifically the paintings Pinkie and Blue Boy. I especially wanted to share the experience of viewing all the beautiful art with them so they too, could remember there is an outside world from video games. I will say there was some reluctance on their part, but that all vanished the moment we walked into the rose garden. It was a beautiful day and it was very dreamlike how pretty everything was combined with the statues and gorgeous fountain. We made our way to the Tea Room and my son proclaimed this the best day ever in the middle of our scrumptious tea and sandwiches. Everything was wonderful, including the service and ambiance. Afterwards we visited the European Art Gallery and we were overwhelmed with the grandiosity and beauty displayed there. Every inch of the place had been addressed in its structure and I can only imagine the work that went into constructing it. On top of that, so many portrait paintings and stories to go with them, I could have stayed there all day. My only disappointment was that Blue Boy was not there due to a certain project, but I was able to revisit Pinkie and reminisce. I didn't do the audio tour but I plan to on my next visit. I realized how much I had missed when I was here as a child, you really can't do everything in one day. We went through the very zen Japanese Gardens but didn't have time to visit the Chinese Gardens. My kids are all begging to come back soon and I'm pretty sure I found the next incentive for good grades this year. I highly encourage anyone who hasn't been here to take a day with your friends, family, or loved ones and make some fantastic memories in this idealistic setting.",Valerie B
50,A Must!,I live in southern California and many of my friends and relatives have never heard of this place which is a shame because going to the Huntington was one of the best experiences I've ever had. You won't be let down with the enormous area you get to explore. It's an amazing place to just relax and enjoy nature. I highly recommend.,Chriselle M
50,Tranquility,"A perfect day in a perfect place. The Tea Room was better than ever. The newish Chinese garden was serene and very well done. Liked the way the pathway lead us right to the Japanese Garden, which is always beautifully peaceful.",Jon D
50,Worth the membership,"For a number of years, I have been a member of this place. The library, mansion, Chinese garden, Japanese garden, and art galleries are magnificent. But, my favorite is the Desert garden. This place has been used in numerous films, and has had many a concert held there. There is a delightful children's section and a huge greenhouse, presenting different biomes. You can eat in the cafe, or have a Victorian tea. This is a must-see!",teachinla2000
50,A great destination!,"Whether your interest is fine art, literature, one of a kind gifts, or specialty gardens (European, Japanes, Chinese, Australia, desert, etc.), Th Huntington has something for you - and that does not cover music and other special events. I have been coming back time after time since 1972.",Charles C
50,Beauty everywhere you look.,"This Art and Botanical Gardens is a well kept go to place in San Marino, Ca. As Pasadena gets all the glory for its Rose Parade and Norton Simon Museum, this gem of Gardens and Arcitechture, art, is well worth the visit.",ccunningham333
50,My absolutely favorite destination in the L.A. area,"The price for admission may seem steep at first, but is absolutely worth it! The botanical gardens are amazing! The Chinese garden makes one almost feel like being in China, and the Japanese Garden in Japan. These are not small gardens, either. The succulent garden was the largest and best I had ever seen. We had only about four hours to spend, and it was not nearly enough time, even just for the gardens. We never got to visit the art galleries or library. In short, words cannot describe it. An absolute must go to destination when in the L.A. area.",smithcu
50,Too Much to See in One Day!,"From gardens to art and furniture to historic texts, there's so much on offer that nearly everyone will find something over which to marvel. And, if you love it all, you'll need to come back again and again. There's certainly no way to see it all in one day!You can certainly get lost on the many trails through the gardens. So, bring your walking shoes, sunscreen, and a water bottle. The Desert Garden and the Japanese Garden and Bonsai Court are the highlights for me. If you're running short on time, I recommend skipping the Australian Garden since it requires a long walk and is probably the least impressive section of the grounds. You might also skip the Chinese Garden since much of it is still under construction and the flora in the completed section is not yet well established. But, don't miss the Brody Botanical Center as it houses a rain forest, a cloud forest, and a bog along with some great interactive exhibits that are educational for the young and old alike!The Huntington Art Gallery (European Art) and the Scott Art Gallery (American Art) both house excellent representative collections of art, sculpture, textiles, furniture, pottery, and tableware from various periods throughout history. The variety and quality of these museums is a delightful surprise with pieces by the likes of Thomas Gainsborough, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, and Frank Lloyd Wright. The Library is equally exciting for bibliophiles with The Gutenberg Bible and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales on display.There are three different cafes and several other locations with coffee available on the grounds. Some, but not all, of the trails are wheelchair accessible. And there is a special assistance vehicle for those who might have difficulty walking long distances.",JDBonthemove
50,A joy and a gem - finally visited!,"Our travel book gave kudos to the Huntington, so we had three hours on a Friday morning to spare. We got there before it opened, picked up a their map at the entrance and decided to visit three/four gardens first: Australian, Desert, Japanese and Chinese. Then on to the American art building. Blue Boy was removed due to temporary restoration but we saw the other artists. We were glad we fit this in but need a return trip and a couple days to explore all the beauty and culture and art the Huntington offers. The gardens were exquisite, the grounds incredibly impressive, if you love gardens and the outdoors, this is like Paradise! The Huntingtons' legacy benefits all garden and art lovers. Thank you.",440maryen
50,Beautiful Gardens,This is a really beautiful place. The gardens are superb. Fantastic photo opportunities. Beautiful galleries and interesting museums. We had a beautiful afternoon tea in the rose gardens. I would highly recommend Huntington.,Therese M
50,Wonderful Huntington,"This was our first visit in 10 years, and we found the place much expanded and developed. The gardens seem endless, a destination in themselves. We saw a friendly guide just setting off on a tour that would be 2 1/2 hours, but he invited his group to follow him as much or as little as they liked. Our main interest was in the art collections, European and American. The European collection is housed in the mansion where the Huntingtons lived in railroad-money splendor. It is excellent and well explained. Visitors can walk close to the art and take photos without flash. The same is true of the American collection, housed in a newer building. The library building has a wealth of fascinating historical exhibits, all beautifully displayed and explained. The only criticism is that it is unclear what is an actual document and what is a reproduction. This hardly matters because the point is education. The whole place was quiet and seemed uncrowned although there were plenty of visitors. One reason is that selfie sticks are not allowed, a policy that more sights should follow. There are several lovely places to eat. The museum shop is huge and really varied. We're planning to go back just to spend more time in the shop and the nearby cafe, which does not require a fee. Admission price is pretty steep, but worth it. It can be converted to a yearly membership which would pay for itself in less than 3 visits. If we lived anywhere nearby, membership would certainly be worth it.",tallpinesCO

50,outstanding museum and gardens,"One of the great collections of rare books and art in the U.S. Fabulous gardens that require at least 2 days to see.

50,The 1919 Cafe at The Huntington Library is very good; so are the Gardens,"The 1919 Cafe has some nice choices of food for lunch or even sometimes early dinner at The Huntington. It is operated by Border Grill and we ordered the sirloin burger and the turkey burger at the Grill. The two burgers were just grilled to perfection and just tasted so good. When it first opened, the 1919 was not as good, but now it is operating at a high standard and worth a visit for a hardy meal when visiting the Huntington. After lunch, we enjoyed a Garden Tour with Keith, one of the volunteer docents and found out lots of things about The Huntington we did not know.",geotech522
50,Classic Gardens Beautifully Maintained + World Class Exhibits + Great Docents,"The names says it all about the three aspects of this world class venue - and each is worth a visit on its own.We pre-booked a tour of the Japanese Gardens knowing that this would just be the start of our visit here. The amazing docent Darlene Kelly had a deep knowledge of not just the Japanese Gardebs themselves, but also of the cultural, religious, and symbolic history of this enhancing place. We thought we knew something of Japanese gardens before the tour, so we were amazed what more we learned from Ms Kelly.The recently opened (and on until Jan 08 2018) exhibit ""Visual Voyahes - Images of Latin American Nature from Columbus to Darwin"" exhibit was next on our agenda. Well done and unique art and artefacts.Time for lunch took us to the Noodle and Dumpling restaurant in the Chinese garden with a limited but excellent menu - we sat outside overlooking a beautiful pond and Chinese buildings - Stunning.Except for a brief visit to the amazing gift shop, this was it for this, our first, visit to the Hu tington, we will be back to explore the library and more.Importantly everything here is well maintained and spotlessly clean - including the toilet facilities.. Friendly and genuine staff enhance the Huntington as a place you want to visit again and again.",Traveller_45_UK

50,"Art, Culture and Gardens","This should be the top destination for visitors to Southern California. I always encourage visiting family and friends to spend at least a day enjoying this world-class museum.The art collection alone is worth a visit. There are works by great European artists including Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds and John Constable. Their collection of American artists includes John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt and Edward Hopper. They have several Hudson River School paintings on display.The main gallery was once the home of Henry and Arabella Huntington, a Beaux-Arts mansion considered one of the great Gilded Age residences of America. This building now contains over a thousand objects of art.The general public can see well-curated permanent and temporary exhibitions that highlight the most rare and historic materials in the Library collection. The Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Gutenberg Bible, Shakespeare’s First Folio, John James Audubon’s Birds of America, and Henry David Thoreau’s manuscript of Walden are on permanent display.Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to cover a lot of ground to see the gardens, which are varied and extensive. The desert garden is filled with bizarre spiny cacti that seem to create an otherworldly landscape. The Japanese and Chinese gardens are evocative and peaceful. The rose garden when in bloom fills the air with fragrance.Tea at the cafe in the Rose Garden requires advance reservations. However, no reservations are needed to eat at the fine 1919 cafe near the entrance.There is an entrance fee. See their website for details.Also see the website for details about current Free Day policies. At this time, Free days are every first Thursday of the month, and those tickets must be bought in advance online. The downside to this is that on those days, people who walk up cannot buy regular tickets and will be turned away.Members are welcome on Free Days and do not have to reserve a ticket in advance. Memberships are available for purchase and renewal on Free Days and every day.There is so much to see and do here that you could spend the entire day. Make sure to come early, because they close early. Hours are 10am to 5pm. They are closed on Tuesdays.Parking is free. They have a lovely gift shop with a great selection. You do not need to buy an admission ticket if all you want to do is shop.",madmadeleine
50,Fantastic Extensive Gardens,"Huge area of extremely well cared for gardens. We started with Children's Gardens. Out grandchild loved it (1 year old). It have tunnels to crawl thru, chimes to drop pebble on, lots of small pools/fountains to splash. Large area and safe for the kids. We also loved the enormous Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden (tea house worth a stop for fluids and enjoying the view), Desert Garden. There are many others also good but these were our favorite. The mansion is interesting and has a few good art works. The manuscript building had a great display of books including a Gutenburg Bible.",DrPaulS

50,ONE OF THE GREAT BOTANICAL GARDENS IN THE WORLD,"I've heard of this place for a number of years and finally got a rare opportunity to visit the Botanical Gardens for the first time. I will return, though! It's a huge place, so if you can, schedule several days to take in the Gardens and Museum. I must give you a disclaimer though. I was there with a master gardener special visit on one of the Huntington's typical closed days. So, we had the entire Gardens to ourselves, along with enjoying the 1919 Café and Store. Sadly, the museum was closed. Next time, though.Make sure you obtain the free map of the Huntington before you start walking around. This is particularly useful when you start going through the many sub-gardens. Our group got a grand tour of the Rose and Shakespeare Garden. If you love roses like I do, this is a MUST! Admittedly, one could spend one whole day just walking through each row of roses here.After resting and eating lunch at the 1919 Café (a nice place for lunch), I walked in the afternoon through the Palm, Jungle, and outskirts of the Desert Garden. The walking paths that meander through and among these various gardens facilitates the walk. However, you will need to take off the beaten path to really get a feel for these other gardens. The Jungle Garden is a great place for some quiet, solitary time...and some shade on a warm or hot day. On the walk back to the main areas, I was enticed by the Desert Garden succulents along the path. They truly are beautiful and some you may never have seen with your own eyes.I just didn't have time to visit the other gardens which are probably just as nice (i.e. Japanese, Chinese, Australian, etc.). I'll do that next time. On the way back, I spent time in the Store. This is really a great store and you're sure to find something to buy and enjoy representing the gardens or museum.Finally, I should mention the Children's Garden. This truly is a magical place for both adult and child (but, mostly the child). It's actually constructed for the child in mind, including height and access. If you're an adult, you will need to duck your head in places. A child will be just fine. Please see my photos of this wonderful garden. It's fairly new and it may not be on your map. It's located directly outside the Brody Botanical Center (another place to visit and learn).",johnnnita
50,Fun for all occasions,I love this place for its gardens and atmosphere. THey have a great art selection in the grand mansion and the botanical gardens are breath taking. My favorite is the Chinese garden and the Japanese garden both have lots of history and are a replica of the ones in those countries. Food is ok nothing special this place requires a full day there are over 5 botanical gardens and a lot of walking acres and acres of land with all scenic routes and a great place to take pictures for all occasions.,A8018LAjamesc
50,The Best,The biggest challenge with the Huntington is that there is far too much to see and experience in one day. We like it so much that we bought a sustaining membership so we can make shorter visits more frequently and enjoy the entire place. The new cafeteria/restaurant is superb.,allanabbott
50,World Class Museum and Gardens,"A trip to Southern California without at least one visit to the Huntington Museum, Libary and Gardens is not complete. The Huntington is a priviately owned institution that provides richly researched and curated exhibits. Depending on the time of year one should be prepared to say for several hours since there is such a variety of activities with a varied set of interests. Art, Gardening, Architecture and History are all readily available. There are also ample spots to have food, drink and other refreshments. There are enough sites and activities that all ages should find something of interest. The bookstore is worth a bit of time for exploring all the aspects of this venue. Of special interest are both the Japanese and the Chinese Gardens. Both are excellent examples and thelocal community has generously donated to both.",Paul D
50,A Must Visit Attraction,"With only a limited amount of time available, I walked the grounds, visited two of the gardens, and stopped at the Gift Shop before leaving. The grounds and buildings are beautiful and well maintained. The staff, wherever I encountered them, were extremely friendly and helpful, and the gift shop is large, well organized and has a wonderful selection. I visited the Japanese and Chinese Gardens and LOVED both experiences. The gardens are extensive, beautifully designed and manicured, and bring a wonderful sense of serenity to the visitor as one slowly tales it all in. Though simply a matter of preference, I especially enjoyed the Chinese Garden. I wold encourage anyone visiting the area to put this on their agenda.",Larry B
50,Spectacular Garden & Art,"Though it got to 113 degrees, the gardens and art collection were wonderful to see.

It was $29 to enter the park (weekend rate) and you got access to all gardens, observatories, etc. The place is giant with gardens from all around the world that are extremely well maintained and clean. The observatories you can enter are fascinating with information on all different plants and amazing things they can do. The small cafe is a little pricey for drinks but overall this is an amazing visit. Bring good walking shoes, sunscreen, and water! Also parking is free here.",SammiDeRosa
50,"Beautiful grounds, you can spend all day here","Impressive sprawling gardens with several themed areas. Japanese and Chinese gardens are especially well done and authentic. Lots of great photo ops. The 2 on-site art galleries are impressive and included with admission, so you can get out of the heat and enjoy some great art. I only wish more of the original Huntington mansion was preserved; instead they gutted most of the interior to convert it into art galleries, leaving only the 1st floor main rooms as original.",gwwyjjliu

Toured the house with its furniture, silver and china. Enjoyed the Library with its Gutenberg Bible(s), scientific works, maps and objects (like a Galileo telescope). Great collection. Texts are good for older children. Toured the Chinese Garden and had lunch at the 1910 Restaurant. All Excellent.

50,Wow! Worth the price.,"The admission price is steep ($25 for adults in 2017), but this place is worth it. There are 3 buildings with collections of art and books - the library, the mansion, and a museum of American Art. The Boone gallery was closed during our visit and we did not go into the Botanical Center. Do get the free audio guides to make your visit worthwhile.Then there are the gardens. Even on a hot day, these were wonderful. The day we were there, a musician was playing a Japanese zither-type instrument in the Japanese garden and it was ethereal.We were able to see the library and the mansion (European art) in about two hours and then we had a lovely lunch in Visitor Center cafe. The food was very good and fresh. There was both indoor and outdoor seating.After lunch, we wandered the gardens for about an hour and a half and then toured the American Art Museum.

Glass noodles were soggy, egg rolls tasted refried and low quality, though they were definitely premium priced. I hope they can improve the food quality.",ChrisSep2013
50,Science Exhibits Are Outstanding,"The Huntington has enormous grounds with extensive walks around the gardens. Beware the afternoon heat in August can be extreme. There are long walks between buildings with the various exhibits.We focused on the library. The small book section has such things as a Gutenberg bible, a Shakespeare folio and a history of early books before and after the invention of printing.But the science section is much larger. It features key books in the history of science with excellent AV hands on interactive exhibits: earth as center of the solar system, sun as center of solar system, solar system in the galaxy, early human anatomy and medicine, plants and animals, electricity, etc. Many of the books are from the Bern Dibner collection and is one of the most extensive collections in the history of science.The science museum is worth the visit alone.",Nostromo42
50,"AMAZING COLLECTION AND GARDENS, BUT SOME ADA CHALLENGES","We found that the Library houses one of the finest collections of manuscripts, rare books, documents covering early science, and European master works of art.

40,Art and Library are Beautiful,"We started with a walk though the gardens. In July, on a hot day. I wouldn't recomend a July visit, but if that is when you're in the area then go. The Chinese gardens are undergoing a huge development. The existing garden is very well done, the bridges and pavilions are nice. but everything looks a little new. I would like to see it again in 5-10 years. Enjoyed the Japanese, rose and herb gardens. next inside to a cool house. The artwork is amazing, the collection of Reynolds is not to be missed. Upon entering the library looks modest and then you start to read the items on display and the magnitude of the collection is almost overselling. So many historical document and books that we can look at and read. Amazing that its so accessible, Plan to spend at least an hour in the library.",robertinSJ
50,"Hot, humid and Magnificent!","I had been a year ago and last Friday I brought my friend who had never been. Such a treat to someone view the Gardens for the first time. It was hot and humid but we wore big hats and pretended we were on an exotic island! When I shared the photographs, some people thought I was in Japan when I showed them the pictures taken in the Bamboo. It was a magical day and the food at Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken's restaurant was fabulous! we sat in the Tea House overlooking the pond. Truly an amazing day. Filled with memories and photographs.",lindagG2258IT
50,Just Go!,"This place is incredible and has so much to offer. There's something for everyone here: of course the incredible gardens and fine are, but there's literature and science and horticulture, you name it. You will have to walk a lot, but that's the nature of a place like this. And you can do most of it in one day BUT, two days is even better. Weekdays are generally less crowded.",Gregg W
50,Absolutely LOVED Huntington Gardens,"Visiting Huntington Library & Gardens is worth every penny. The staff is extremely friendly and there is plenty to do. You can easily spend 3 hours here and I would recommend that you stay for as long as you can. There are so many different and beautiful gardens to walk through with plenty of stops for bathroom and to fill up on water around the entire grounds (definitely need water on hot days. There are plenty of spots to sit and the shade and relax or read if you want. On weekends it does get crowded as the day goes on, so maybe go a bit on the earlier side if you are looking for solace.The art collection and library are also impressive and included Chaucer's Canterbury Tales Manuscript, original drawings from a Charles Dickens novel and handwritten letters from Susan B. Anthony and Abraham Lincoln. Staff in the library was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, making recommendations to make sure you saw what you came to see.There is an on-site restaurant with plenty of food options, including that tacos that I ate which were delicious. This is a must-see if you have the time while you are in LA.",Christine
50,So much to see,"We made our first visit to the Huntington and there will be more in the future. We simply did not have enough time to properly see everything the complex has to offer, but the three gardens and two galleries we visited were spectacular. We strolled the gardens and got many good ideas for our landscaping at home. Next visit we will budget more time so we can see some of the things we missed. It is well worth the trip.",davidpZ6858BP
50,Day Camp Field Trip,"It was great. The kids learned a lot and many thought the trip to the Huntington Library was the best group trip with friends that they ever had. Many committed that it was the most beautiful library that they have ever seen. The garden areas were great for the kids also. So many types of gardens to see. Everyone left happy and extremely excited. The adults committed that it was great to be away from the city and the gardens were so peaceful and tranquil. They plan to make a return trip. Actually, everyone wishes to return. It is a great must see.",aactprogram

Later we went into theAmerican gallery and saw lovely painting including Mary Cassat'a"" Breakfast in Bed"" and Wharhole's modern painting. We walked fe building g to building g through the beautiful gardens. Gone are the roses. Replaced by beautiful plants and flowers native to the dry climate.

50,Multiple Days & Audio Gatden Tour,"The HLG is an incredible place that I always take visitors to, but it's really too much to see in one day. Maybe there could be a multiple day pass offered so that people who want to return to the HLG have an opportunity to do so. Also, going on a two-hour garden tour is really too long, even if you can jump off the ride at any time. Perhaps there can be an audio tour available for that, much like the art museum.",Michael C
50,Gardens!,"We spent 4 hours at the Huntington strolling through the fabulous gardens (Chinese, Japanese, Rose, Jungle, Lilly Ponds) and having lunch. The gardens alone were so enjoyable that we will have to return to venture inside to the exhibits. Well worth the admisison fee!",dcfisher4
50,House and Garden visit by two couples.,Excellent in all areas. Succulents were outstanding and well cared for. The main gallery on the Huntington House is or favorite. Thank you for the audio tape feature. Very well done.Tea room was fun. I graduated from Arcadia High School so we know the area and the Library.,James F
50,Huntington Library,"Enjoyed the American art the best, the gardens, and the Gutenberg Bible. Was able to use one of the wheelchair and lockers which was a nice bonus! Nice audio tours with players and headphones for many of the art pieces. We were a bit uncomfortable in the European Art collection as there were so many docents around (felt like) watching us all so carefully! My daughter and I are thinking of going next time without the kids to look at everything more carefully. The kids we took ranged in age from 5-8.",apricotorange
40,Nice but probably better seasons to go,"Two people (unknown to each other) recommended I go here and I am glad I did. The prime reason to go was to see the gardens. The Japanese, Chinese and Desert gardens were the ones recommended. Whilst the Asian gardens were nice, I found the desert garden amazing (Ok I am from Australia & we do not have cactus, yucca, aloes etc naturally). Heaps of the cactus's were flowering which just seem to pop out of the plant. Colours are spectacular.I suspect the gardens would be even more impressive when the flowers and fragrances where in season, but I also suspect the gardens would be very crowded.I am glad I went & will & will return when next in California. It would be very easy to spend the whole day here if not more just so you can absorb the ambience of the variety of gardens of which there are 12. & all this is before you look at the Art which is in buildings around the property.Cost per entry is $29. There are options to become a member so if you think you will go more than 4 times with in a year it would definitely be worth considering.",Gerry K
50,Best kept secret attraction in LA,"The Huntington Library and Gardens is one of the best kept secrets in the LA tourist scene. We visited LA 5 years in a row and never heard about it till the last time and even then, from a local person. This property used to belong to a local businessman, Mr Huntington who had strong interest in literature and arts. The library is magnificent and has a collection of the oldest books - when printing started - like the first printed Bible. Book lovers will not want to leave the library!! The gardens are equally beautiful - several hundred acres and separated on various themes - Japanese, Chinese, English, Rose garden, etc. A beautiful, beautiful, place to visit in Pasadena, few miles from downtown LA. Only word of caution - summer months can be too hot to enjoy the gardens specially since they close at 5pm when the LA sun is very strong.",Suvro B

40,World class collection of art in majestic gardens in a residential area,"While the place is ever evolving and getting larger though not always better, the collections and gardens are impressive. You can spend days and even weeks here, though most visitors just browse at the major artworks and walk some of the gardens. New visitors should begin with the short introduction video of the history of how Collins Huntington family amassed its wealth and how the nephew married the widow of his uncle at age 60 and left the bulk of their estate to the state of California.The library has an extensive collection of rare books and pictures including a copy of the Gutenberg Bible in vellum. There is also a vast collection on the history of California.While the residence is not as grand as the tycoon mansions in Newport, RI, it is still quite impressive with Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Pinkie. This is a must see for all interested in arts and culture.",cran
50,Where is that rating of six on Trip Advisor?,"If the Huntington was only its Botanical Gardens it would be one of the top places to visit in the world. Leave yourself a full day to stroll the grounds through the Chinese Gardens, the Japanese Gardens, the Australian Garden, the Dessert Garden, and the Rose Garden. You can start earlier than the Museum and Gallery spaces open. This is definitely one of the top gardens in the world. Warning especially if you are a gardener yourself, you will be totally surprised and awed at every stop. Take your time and remember to pick your jaw up off the ground before you stroll on.",Richard C
50,Lovely,Beautiful. Just simply beautiful with quite a history. The estate tour was informative and educational.,ryder596

50,SoCal's BEST Kept Secret,"I grew up in this area and moved away. My regret was that I did not visit the Huntington Library and Gardens earlier. This is one of the greatest sites in southern California! I am blessed to have visited the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage in Russia and can tell you with confidence. The Huntington should be mentioned in this august list of great centers in art, culture and science. I primarily went to see THE Gutenberg Bible. I was unaware of the number of original manuscripts and premiere editions of historical publications were also included in the library. I knew that ""The Blue Boy"" and ""Pinkie"" were exhibited at the Huntington. I was stupefied at the number of great paintings keeping them company. The themed gardens were a stunning surprise, too! There is a clever one dedicated to the children. The eateries and store are worth visiting on their own accord. They are available to the public without the price of admission. The entrance fee per individual is what you probably pay in one week for Starbucks visits. If you live in the area, you should spend the $139 for membership. This is the kind of real estate that should be visited weekly. The Huntington is open from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. but check the website for seasonal changes.",Kevin K
50,Something for just about everyone,"We visited the Huntington Library and Gardens this week and I'm so glad a friend of ours recommended it. More than anything, the scope of what is there to see and learn about is astounding: if you like history, it's there; if you like science, it's there; if you like art (so many Gainsboroughs!), it's there; if you like gardens; they're there, too. To top it off, the variety and quality of the food in the restaurant was remarkable. We spent half a day on the grounds and easily could have spent more time if it was available.",Thomas C

50,Special Birthday Event,Four of us women brought my best friend to The Huntington Library for her birthday. We went on a special Estate Tour lead by Judith Cobb. She made our visit so meaningful. We enjoyed hearing about the Huntingtons' and seeing each of the gardens. My favorite garden was the Chinese Garden and the history and making of this place. After our tour we enjoyed a lovely English Tea at the Rose Garden Tea House. My friend said this was one of her most memorable birthday celebration. We look forward to visiting again.,joanhX1667YS

50,Octavia Butler Exhibit was very special,"We came back to the Huntington especially for the Octavia Butler exhibit.

We also loved the history of the Huntington and how it was built into what it is today.The residence art collection was pretty amazing. The permanent collection is amazing. The Gutenberg Bible, Shakespearean manuscripts, and the letter from Henry VIII are definite highlights. The store is very well-stocked, albeit a bit pricey. The Huntington is really worth the visit.",RubenB74

50,Amazing gardens,"We went on a warm day, so we visited the gardens first until it became too hot for walking outside. Even so, we only saw a portion of the collection and are looking forward to going back when it is cooler in the fall. The Desert garden is spectacular with the largest collection of cacti and succulents that I have ever seen. We also saw the Japanese and Chinese gardens which are relaxing and lovely. My only complaint is that the area is so large, it was easy to get lost and few more signs here and there would have been welcomed. We also went into the museums housing American art and European art where we saw familiar pieces such as Blue Boy and Pinkie.",CalifCar
30,Average,I had come to the gardens to bring my family for the first time. I wanted to take a tour of the gardens. The website said that the tour hours were between 12 to 2. I arrived at 11:30 and had been told that the tour was at 10:30 and the 12:30 tour was cancelled. This was very disappointing especially when the website says one thing and the workers there tell me another!,saziz27
40,A day well-spent,"It really was a day well spent. The gardens are huge and various (Japanese, Chinese, Dessert, Tropical etc) and very relaxing, I spent a lot of time visiting them especially the Chinese one which provides shade and a few places to sit and enjoy the view in a hot summer day. And if you are a fan of Chinese cuisine there is also a Chinese restaurant in the Garden. There are a few museums included like the Museum of European Art and that of the American Art and provide a decent collection of paintings, and other historic collections. You will also find there some restaurant choices with generally good food. For closure if you want to take a souvenir for yourself of buy a gift for someone, go at the library and you will find a great collections of gifts on a variety of prices, sometimes a bit pricey but definitely unique.",Diana K
50,Desert Plant Sale Saturday,"Wonderful food in 1919.

There just is not enough time in one day. I was impressed with every Garden and plant collection we viewed. It was a lucky cool day in Pasadena, which made the day that much more enjoyable. Wear comfortable shoes bring some sunscreen and enjoy!The Chinese garden had lotus in full bloom, the Japanese Tea Garden was on the quite beautiful also. Soaring specimens of exotic trees dot large expanses of grass. A waterfall under a large jungle canopy of rubber trees tumbles through a cool shady hillside.The desert garden is stark yet full of cacti and succulents.It's a Disneyland for botanist.Looking forward to exploring the museums on my next visit.",MichaelSDCA

50,Incredible gardens and handicap friendly,The different garden areas are spectacular but are at different elevations that could prevent seniors from seeing it all. The tram service was so helpful. We just called the main phone number and minutes later the driver was there to take us to the next garden or art exhibit.,Kathy R
50,Terrific daytime date,My boyfriend and I went to the gardens and library for a daytime visit and it was spectacular! Stunning gardens and interesting exhibits that satisfied his interests in art and my interests in gardening and science. I recommend planning ahead: it's a large facility that encompasses several types of gardens and diverse exhibits. Planning ahead of time could help you get the most out of your visit.,Amanda R
50,Beautiful place,Well worth a visit. The gardens are amazing with really unusual plants and flowers.If you going in the heat of summer take plenty of water.It can be accessed by metro and a mile walk but in 40C heat we opted for a taxi which was really cheap,evag385

50,Morning walks through the garden,"Morning walks through the Huntington gardens is always a treat. Crowds are usually lite so one can enjoy the various types of landscapes. There's different gardens to suit everyone in the family. We usually start at the children's garden. Being early usually means the little ones get the garden to themselves. We then walk over the Chinese gardens to walk over the bridges and sometimes reflect under one of the pavilions. Continuing through the path, we ""hike"" up to the Japanese Garden where we usually hears the birds chirping. Walking through the tall bamboo is always a treat before hitting the lily ponds and the finishing up at the rose garden for treats.",keepitcimple
50,Amazing botanical garden and an even more amazing library,"We were attracted by the botanical garden, which lived up to expectations: one of the world's great desert collections and quite an amazing bonsai display, wiith a wide range of species that each reflect years of careful management. We enjoyed a leisurely stroll through the entire garden, with surprises at every turn: wetland species, nice rose garden,and wonderful conifers made for a very pleasant morning. We would have welcomed more informative signs, for example showing natural distribution and role in the ecosystem. We then visited the art collection, which was nice (fun to see Gainsborohgh's Blue Boy seemingly staring at Pinkie), but the library was absolutely amazing, well displayed and accompanied by a fascinating history of printing and bookmaking. This is a dramatic example of how a tycoon (this time Henry Huntington, who earned his fortune from railroads) can leave a lasting legacy that can be enjoyed by subsequent generation.",mcneely2015

There are several outdoor restaurants to enjoy food and beverages and soak up the beauty of the surrroundings. The museum store has some great finds to remember your day by. The prices are not overbearing as most museum stores.We only had 3.5 hours to enjoy (as we were on a tour that dropped and picked us up) otherwise we could have easily enjoyed the entire day here.,Gailybird
50,Wonder Around the Bend,"It was a beautiful day in so many beautiful gardens. From the desert landscapes, the lush jungle plants, the meticulous Asian gardens, and the vibrant Shakespeare flora, there was just so much to see and experience.

10,disappointed,"I've been before and it's a lovely place. We went with our family before. My son was 2 or 3 and we took a few pictures just with our camera. No big deal. This time however, it was packed! it was so crowded. They stopped us from going in because we had a change of clothes! I had to turn in my bag. You're not allowed to change your clothes. I went hoping to take a few pictures of my self since I'm 37 weeks pregnant. They do not allow us to take a change of clothes..... I didn't get any pictures. They took our bag. I packed snacks for the kids. we were not allowed to take them. We only had water bottles. They said I needed a permit from the city to take pictures. I was just going to do them our self. It's baby #3 so we don't have extra money for a professional photos. We did not get any photos that were decent. It's an hour drive for us to get there. I didn't have the snacks I packed so my kids we not happy, they couldn't run and climb much. We did not stay long due to long ride, and crabby kids. I would not go back for a long time. it was not worth it! The time an effort and money it took to go there. I want to cry just thinking about it. I won't get another chance to do this again. I'm due in a couple weeks! All I wanted was a decent family photo!",RodMommy

We took the estate tour which we booked online and I am glad we did. The tour gave us a background of the history and exposed us to the grounds and most popular gardens. You cant see everything in one day. We fell in love with the Huntington and will be back.,Martinkross
50,What a Grand Treasure!,So glad my friend shared this lovely location with me. We will visit again at our first opportunity.

40,Nice way to spend a sunny day in the gardens,"We did not go into any buildings. It was a hot day. Sauntered around the gardens. Some items marked some not. Incredible cactus garden saw some things new. Some of the others were just ok. The map (not atypical) is not to scale but could not figure out how to get ""there"" from ""here"" at one point. Nice children's garden. Was disappointed there was no picnicking on the grounds at all. We just ate ours in the parking lot. It would have been nice to at least heave a few tables in parking area especially for families. Not the best and not the worst but pretty nice - recommend a visit.",Jennifer J
50,Galleries and gardens in a park-like setting,"An outstanding collection of paintings, sculptures, manuscripts can be found in the library and galleries. The collection of recently planted cycads greatly enhances the already spectacular array of botanical subjects in a large garden with sections to delight even the youngest among us. The children's garden, the Chinese and Japanese gardens, the conservatory, the palm garden, the desert garden and the rose garden are each in themselves worthy of high praise.",Nels C
50,"An amazing place, filled with beauty","The Huntington was the locale for a get acquainted date with a local lady who was well acquainted with the place, and who served as an excellent guide to all of its wonderful features. We first visited the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, both breathtakingly gorgeous, endowed with plantings from their respective countries and furnished with beautifully crafted pavilions, bridges, and waterways. We next toured the Desert Garden, an assembly of cacti and other desert dwelling flora, all beautifully arranged and displayed. Lunch at the cafeteria was excellent, offering many choices of well prepared food items. The Art Gallery, located in the Huntington home, was next, offering fabulous examples of primarily English portraiture and including many well-known works by Reynolds and Gainsborough. The Library was last, with innumerable historic books and documents including a Gutenburg Bible and letters written by people of historic dimensions. This is an all-day experience, with lots of walking; my iPhone recorded over 10K steps! The date? Went very well, we're meeting at the Getty Villa in Malibu next week; my turn to guide!",DonaldYokum
50,Great way to spend the day,"If you are looking for a fun family day or just a solo getaway, then The Huntington is for you. Parking is free and plentiful. Admission was 23 dollars and well worth it. The Botanical Gardens are amazing to walk through and it's very tranquil. Lots of benches to sit in the shade and just take it all in. There's a restaurant on premises as well. PLENTY to do and be prepared to snap a lot of pictures. This place is magical. There's also indoor art galleries as well. You can easily spend the whole day here. Had a blast!",JFLapham
50,Great day at a great location,"Beautiful gardens. We loved the desert, Japanese, and Chinese gardens. It wasn't too crowded. Bring a hat and sunscreen.",la_alejandro
40,Anniversary Date,"Sunny day is ideal for scenery sightseeing. I wish I know of this place earlier during January through March, mainly for the cherry blossom (my favorite). The sights are quite peaceful, just wear comfortable shoes and lots of water. I mean A Lot of water.",qvo1043
50,A Must See,"Whenever I am blessed to be in California, the Huntington Library and Gardens is among my favorite places to visit. If fine art, beautiful gardens, strolling with a friend or purchasing quality items (not kitsch) are your thing, this place offers ready access to them all. One can easily spend a day (or two) and never see all the Huntington has to offer. Other advantages included:Knowledgeable docents: We had some amazing conversations with men who were more than willing to share with us all they knew about their area of specialty within the Gardens.Friendly and supportive staff: It didn't matter whom we asked, Each man or woman knew exactly where to send us when we were looking for a specific item (such as Paul Revere's silversmithing specialties or Mary Cassatt's Mother and Child painting). Gift shop workers were even willing to hold our purchases for us throughout the day if we had decided they were too heavy to cart around.Beauty, beauty everywhere.And an amazing restorer of fake trees (yes, the Huntington has them and they are very, very old) whose imagination is going to delight children of all ages for generations! See pic below.The Huntington and its amazing people take my breath away.Highly recommend!",Jennifer H
10,Terribly annoying,"Immediately after leaving the Huntington I would have given it an ""average"" rating. The art collections were just okay, as were the gardens, and my overwhelming sentiment on the drive home was, ""okay, we've been there and don't need to go back again."" I've been wanting to visiting the Huntington for years, I was really excited about it - we went for my birthday! -, but I felt like I'd just checked something off my 'to do' list at the end of the day, like picking up milk or doing laundry.What really ruined the experience for me wasn't the helicoptering museum staff (did my boyfriend and I look particularly sketchy, or just like we'd be fun to third wheel?), or the poorly designed and unevenly maintained gardens (they keep the Japanese and Chinese gardens picture perfect for the 'gram, but the others were a mess), or even just how tourist-y the entire thing seemed (this is not a place meant for Angelino's, trust).No, what ruined it for me was unrelenting, verging on harassing emails that started spamming our inbox at 12:10am the day after we visited, and have continued on a daily basis since then. So, fine. I'm here now. You want my honest review? I can sum it up in 3 words: go someplace else. Pasadena is packed with museums and gardens, so don't waste your time and money here.If you want to see a truly impressive collection of European art go to the Norton Simon Museum. They don't just have 1 or 2 pieces worth marveling at, they have rooms filled to the brim with amazing works of art from Renaissance to contemporary masters.The Pasadena Museum of California Art is a tiny, hidden gem that consistently has interesting exhibitions spotlighting Californian artists.The Gamble House is so architecturally significant it ""elevated living to an art form"". Forget about the paltry collection of Greene & Greene pieces at the Huntington and take a walk through this amazing house.Garden's more your thing? Not a problem. Take your pick between the Los Angeles Arboretum, and Descanso Gardens. They're both about 15 minutes away and are much better than anything the Huntington has to offer, without all the touristy nonsense you'd otherwise have to endure.Seriously, there are much better places, and they won't harangue you into writing reviews.",lblue2017
50,"Amazing place, huge variety of things to see, incredible art work","The sheer variety of the exhibitions was quite a surprise.The library area had some very rare items on show and they were all nicely displayed in date order showing how books and printing had developed.A hall of exhibits relating to the history of science was also well done.The house was interesting in itself, but the quality and sheer quantity of old masters on display there was jaw dropping - Gainsborough, Reynolds, Constable, Turner, etc, etc. But what made the collection even more impressive was the fact that the paintings are hung as they would have been when the house was used as a house, and so there are no barriers or cordons to stop you getting a good look at the paintings.The gardens were huge and so we focused on the Japanese Garden which was just lovely. So relaxing and full of nooks and crannies to explore.The only negative of our visit was an attempt to have tea in the Rose Garden tea room. We hadn't appreciated that reservations are required and, although there were clearly tables free (and indeed still free when we wandered past a little later) the greeter showed no willingness to accommodate us. But this petty nuisance couldn't detract from an excellent visit.",Sharon R
40,The rains make it beautiful,I have visited these gardens several times but usually too late for the bloom or during the drought. This time I got to see the beauty. Lots of flowers and oh the smells were lovely. They have a tea room there that is pricey but fun. Reservations are needed for that.,paortho
50,Love this place!,Love this place! My husband and I have been members for a couple of years and love that they offer summer concerts. The grounds are so beautiful and the art collection are definitely worth checking out. For me though it's the just being out in nature and enjoying the fresh air! Definitely recommend a visit here if you're in the area.,ImTropical
50,A first rate experience. A broad diversity of interests.,"This was my first visit to the Huntingdon; it will not be my last. It would take a week to really see everything. This is the estate of the Huntingdon family who were great art collectors and landscape garden enthusiasts. You have your choice of Classic European art (some Renaissance work but a great deal of 18th century English portraiture and landscaping including Gainsboroough's famous ""Blue Boy"" and its companion piece ""Pinkie""), American art, contemporary art, an array of large gardens from a formal rose garden to the natural curves of Chinese and Japanese landscape. There is also the library, although it is much more a research institution that a tourist stop. Still, for the bibliophile, this is a sacred place. They possess many treasures, including the oldest complete manuscript of chancre's Canterbury Tales from which all the printed editions have been prepared. There is a Gutenberg Bible, the only complete printed pamphlet version of Hamlet, first editions of Mark Twain's works with his hand written revisions for subsequent editions.The restaurants are also good. There is a very complete self-service restaurant that I would probably visit as a destination. There is a tea room that serves afternoon high tea. There are also places to get drinks and snacks. Prices are moderate restaurant prices. The museum store is also an uncommonly good one. Not usually included to shop in museum shops, we bought a lamp!",Stephen P
50,The Huntington Library visit,"I have skipped visiting the Huntington Library due to close to home. However my first visit to the site have opened my eyes wide open. It was bigger than my thought and a lot of stuffs to offer. My family had learned a big deal: a desert tree area was exposed to the life of desert reminding me Arizona and various gardens with flowers like a paradise. Thanks for offering my family a chance to see, enjoy and learn. We are sure to be back in a near future and recommend to our friends.",johnnyvo2017
50,A wonderful experience.,"We spend a warm, sunny and relaxing day. The whole experience was just wonderful. I have shared with all my friends the beauty of the museum. Definitely coming back with family and friends.",sacastellon
10,Rude Staff,"If you are on vacation in Los Angeles, do not waist your time here. The collections are very small. I expected more for what I was charged. It is not senior friendly either, dirt roads can be dangerous. Finally, the staff is very rude and unfriendly. Well, that was my experience.",2017jesse
50,Small but interesting collection,If you want to see The Canterbury Tales check ahead to see if the original is on display. When I was there they only had a replica since the original is periodically put away to rest the binding. You can see an original Shakespeare folio as well as some illuminated manuscripts. Not worth the admission charge unless you are viewing the gardens as well.,chillintravellin
50,Have fun,"It was interesting and energizing. I couldn't see the library, gardens and science collections in one day. I will return.",grclps
50,Beautifully inspiring,Was amazed at the natural beauty and great vision this place required. Easy to spend 4-6 hours just to scrape the surface we will be back,Ken G

50,Mother's Day,We particularly liked the Chinese garden. Go on a cloudy day so it will not be too hot. The desert plant were also very spectacularMarty,Martin R
50,Must see in LA for garden and art lovers,"Another fantastic museum campus for visiting. You can spend the better part of the day here browsing the gardens, art, and library. The Desert Garden is world-famous, in and of itself. The Australian garden is not worth the hike to the bottom of the hill. There is some steep terrain to navigate, though I think there is a shuttle. (I didn't see one, so I'd ask when you get there.) The library exhibits are really neat if you're into books and writing, so definitely don't miss those. The museum shop is out of this world. Tons and tons of great books and gift items. It is almost overwhelming, such a nice selection. We ate at the restaurant. They have several ""stations"" where you can get made to order food including sandwiches and salads, mexican, pizza, and some rotating hot food. They also have a table-service sushi section in the restaurant. (We had salads and sandwiches and they were really good and fresh.)",camellia10
50,Flowers everywhere!!!!,"The Huntington is huge!!! The gardens are spectacular!!!! Have at least half a day for here if not longer. It's hard to fathom any one person owning such a place!!!! I for sure put my Fitbit to the test!!!! Just every variety of flowers and trees you'd want to see. Time was limited for us, so we only roamed the gardens, which is our primary interest.",nancylucille
50,Great location for safe and interesting walk in addition to galleries,"With the right membership level, you can enter early, hours before general public entry to do a beautiful walk/work out on the grounds. I do this with friends every week and we love to see the changes that occur throughout the gardens from week to week.",Peggy M
50,Awesome family day,I wanted to say thank you. We had such an incredible day. We are recommending it to all our friends.,Scottsperling
40,Amazing grounds,"We visited the library after looking on a search for things to do in the area. It was a little expensive at $50 a person, but the grounds and art collections are incredible. There were lots of cool educational activities. The maps could be made a little easier to read but overall this is a great place to visit.",davesiddoway
50,Desert garden is unbelievable; loved the decorative arts,"Spent about an hour walking the grounds and was blown away by the desert garden. Never have I seen so many exotic plants in one place. Also loved the decorative arts of the Arts and Crafts period, including furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright and Greene and Greene. DON'T PASS UP A CHANCE TO VISIT!",Marblehead750
50,Worth a visit,"Today we visited the Botanical Gardens. It was a very hot day, so we got there when they opened at 10am and first visited the Desert Garden where many of the cacti and other succulents were still in bloom. We saved the cooler Japanese Garden for later in the morning, but it was still pretty hot there. The tall bamboo was very refreshing and beautiful. The bonsai trees are fabulous.We spent three hours and really saw only two of the gardens, so that will give you an idea of how much time it takes. There were many butterflies and birds flying around. Just an overall beautiful setting.",Edward S
40,Garden and Book Tour,Go early if it is a weekend. One of the best things to do in the area. It is a great place but need time at least half a day to see top things. It would take days to see all. The buildings with art and book collections are great. We saw most of the gardens which are many acres. They keep the gardens nice though additional signage would be helpful. We went in May so it was nice out.,Q1020TKdavidc
50,"The Huntington Library and Art Collection set in large Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California","The Huntington Library, Art Collection and gardens were the highlight of my ten day stay in Pasadena. It was a short drive in a taxi from where I was staying, and I was able to ask them at the garden entry kiosk to call the same driver back after I had spent most of the day there. The paintings in the family mansion were collected by the railway mogul and his wife during their marriage and include the Blue Boy by Gainsborough which I remember seeing in London as a child before the Huntingtons' purchased it.The Library has notebooks of Keats, Chaucer and many other well known writers on display as well as a Guttenberg Bible which exhibited two open pages only on any one day, but this was enough to view the beautiful calligraphy and painting. The buildings are air conditioned which was welcome in the dry hot weather which I experienced at the start of October. The gardens are designed in different styles, amongst them a Japanese garden, a desert garden, and an English garden. Long avenues of mixed species of trees and palms provide shade beside the lawns and there is also a tea room. I lunched in the excellent self service restaurant near the Library building which had top Californian wines and food and plenty of tables for groups or someone on their own as I was.A shop contained suitable objects for the buyer wanting mementos of their visit. Beautiful lawns lined by statues led the eye towards the pink slopes of the nearby San Gabriel mountains. There was also a gallery showing more modern American painters which was in process of being enlarged and in the same garden.",Elinor C

50,Better than you'd think,"This isn't the first place we'd think of when we have out of town guests, but we're always glad when it does bubble to the top of someone's To Visit list. The gardens are absolutely delightful, from the ornate Chinese Garden to the more rambling succulents in the Desert Garden, to the fascinating Bonsai's in the Japanese Garden, it is really a wonderful day out.It's been a long time since we went with enough time to do justice to the art/science/history in the buildings, but I recall them being really worthwhile as well, so we'll try to visit with a bigger time slot next time--it really takes at least 3 hours to do it justice.",TrDCpr

There is now a better than average food hall and bar in addition to the Tea Room, and a take out cafe near the entry.

50,Beautiful and plentiful,"We had a tip from a friend telling us this was a. Dry nice place to visit. They also warned us that you can spend a full day at this place. So we did visited this Garden and to our pleasured surprise, we really enjoyed this garden. The rose garden was at the blooming time and it is gorgeous. Most amazing is the desert garden. A lady was giving a tour and we had a short chance to listen in and she was amazing. The Chinese and Japanese garden was also very nice. We spent the whole day and did not finish the whole garden and exhibits. As mentioned, it is worth every penny spent here. Beautiful and plentiful",utthon

40,Spring TIme,"The rose garden has to be one of the highlights of the trip and seeing all the flowers and plants in bloom is amazing, so I would suggest to go in the spring time.Unfortunately, the museum section was really uncomfortable and I felt slightly discriminated against. My group consists of mid 20's Hispanics (everyone else was elderly/Caucasian) and the security guards followed us everywhere inside. No one else was being followed and one of the security guards just watched me sit for almost 20 minutes.",breyes33

There's something for everyone including a wonderful children's garden. This is a must see!!,Marjorie H
50,Highlight of my LA holiday,"The Huntington Library is magnificent. I was so determined to visit that I braved LA's public transport to get there - and I'm so glad I did. If you're into literary treasures, world class art (contemporary or classical), and/or gardens, you really need to add the Huntington to your itinerary. Plan on spending at least half a day there so you can see and enjoy everything. Unlike the Getty, LACMA and the Broad, the Huntington never feels crowded or overrun. I look forward to re-visiting it soon.",Anna J

40,Nice inspiration of gardening,"Visited just the Botanical Garden this time, leaving the Library and Art Collection for next time. Reason is that you really need the time just wandering the different gardens, either for your own gardening inspiration or to just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Divided into different distinct characteristic gardens like Japanese, Chinese, Australian or Shakespeare you'll definitely will find your favorite.Again, my suggestion is to take your time, don't rush it.",thella

50,Botanical Garden: Desert Garden,"This spring was the super-bloom in the California desert and also in gardens! The Huntington Botanical Garden was no exception particularly the rose and desert garden areas. The rose garden was clearly the prize for the garden staff and volunteers. Everything was manicured and labeled. The Desert Garden comes in a close second, particularly because this was such a good rainfall year and the majority of the succulents were in bloom, hummingbirds were flitting and little fence lizards scurrying about. It was a beautiful place on a warm afternoon but would probably be even better earlier in the day. The Australian Garden was not so well loved and the Japanese and Chinese Gardens are not focused on colorful flowers but on greenery, texture and the amazing Bonsai sculptured trees.There is so much to see and enjoy in this garden and all the exhibits you could easily spend a day or two exploring. The Huntington Store did not have much in the way of items about or closely related to the garden. Even the postcards were lacking. There are a variety of eateries which people seemed to be enjoying.",Camassia

There are also various restaurants ranging from snack bars to full meals. The Huntington Library is a must with various treasures on display such as a First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible.

The grounds are hilly, so wear good walking shoes and carry a water bottle. Pasadena can be rather warm. There are many shady spots and some air-conditioned buildings. Note - you cannot use hand or motor fans in the library for some reason, so skip if you get hot flashes. The roses were incredible - late April. Cactus garden is amazing. Hint - go through cactus garden first - down the hill then meander through the gardens to the other side - Japanese gardens, Chinese gardens. The Tea Room has a very elegant feel to it now that it's no longer a buffet. They will give you extra of anything if you ask - we got extra scones and salmon bits.

30,Frustrating/uninformed Staff,"We had reservations at the tea room. Asked directions at the parking gate. Gentleman told us ""Just park and you'll find it."" NO signs whatsoever. Had to guess which areas of the parking lot were close to the Tea Room. Then, asked a staff member how to get to the Tea Room. She showed directionsn on the map. Headed that way, and then was stopped by another staff member, saying we needed to purchase admission tix. Couldn't they have told us that before sending us to the tea room? Had to go to admissions to get tix. Impossible to find the tea room, because the signs were about 4 inches off the ground, small and many did not mark the tea room. Furthermore, the day before, they called to confirm my reservations. I returned to call, only to get a 6 month old greeting (from Nov 2016--and this was April 2017) how reservations were not available before Nov 2016 due to rennovations.

50,Book a full day!,"I first briefly visited the Huntington Library several years ago and returned in March. Many people go for the gardens, which are beautiful. My own interest was in the art collection in the mansion. Mansion is an understatement; it is a palace! the collection focuses on English 18th century art and furnishings. There is an impressive collection of Gainsborough and Reynolds paintings. American art is housed in a separate gallery, including an impressive quilt display. We enjoyed lunch in a well-equipped cafeteria which had outdoor seating on a sunny patio. The Library is very impressive and hosts temporary exhibits. On my previous visit, I had toured the Desert Garden, and enjoyed seeing a myriad of cacti in bloom. The complex is a bit out of the way, but one of the convenient highlights of our visit to LA was using the Uber service for prompt, economical transporation.",zipodoug
50,Amazing and worth a day,"As a gardener, I the Huntington Gardens on my bucket list. With a few hours free in Los Angeles before my flight, I headed to the Huntington. I enjoyed the drive through Pasadena and found the location unexpectedly in a residential area. I parked, bought a ticket and looked at a map. OMG. Where to start? A lovely volunteer gave me some advice based on the fundamental question, ""Are you more of a garden person or an art person or both?"" The Chinese and Japanese gardens were my suggested first stops and rightfully so. The rose garden was at the height of bloom and I loved the herb garden. My trip though the three primary museums reminded me of a classic article by Art Buchwald in the Saturday Evening Post entitled the ""The Six Minute Louvre."" I saw The Blue Boy, Pinkie, a Mary Cassatt an Edward Hopper, and a Guttenberg Bible on nothing short of a dead run. Then a beautiful gift shop, a scoop of sorbet, and my trip to the airport. Be sure to allow extra time for traffic; after all, it is LA.I highly recommend you spend a whole day at the Huntington and book afternoon to round out your day.",Bill B
50,A day at the Huntingtom,"Enjoyed the botanical gardens, most especially the gorgeous rose garden which was in its first bloom. The library with its treasure of manuscripts, incunabula, was also a delight. Can't wait to go again next spring! Just wish there were public transportation to and from Pasadena.",julianisima
50,Possibly the most beatuful place in California,"The Huntington Library has a series of gardens which are breathtaking. The best are (in order) the Japanese Garden, the Desert Garden, the Chinese Garden, and the Rose Garden. There are a few other gardens but do not leave without seeing at least these four.The ground also have several buildings containing European (mostly British) paintings, American paintings, and a library of rare pieces including a Gutenberg bible.We spent about 4 hours, and would have stayed longer but we were just too tired.Parking is free, and tickets are reasonably priced.Kids will be very bored here, but its great for couples of any age.Most paths are wheelchair accessible.",KosherAndGlutenFree
50,calming spring afternoon,"When we left, we strongly considered a membership because it was such a wonderful afternoon. If only we lived closer....We came in the afternoon and viewed the Desert, Japanese, Chinese, Rose and part of the Australian gardens before they closed.I would highly suggest arriving early and leisurely exploring the grounds and exhibits here. Due to our later arrival (1:00 PM), we did not see everything and decided to completely skip the inside exhibits. Also, be sure to bring your camera, comfortable shoes and some sunscreen or a hat.Eat a large breakfast before you go so that you can have a lighter lunch -- they have many options, but all are on the more expensive side. You cannot picnic, but can bring your own food to eat in areas outside of the gardens.",FALCA12
50,Awesome garden,Great to visit. lovely garden. you can enjoy afternoon tea. you can take great pictures. You need to visit the chinese garden.,eduardocE6871ZW
50,Wonderful gardens; beautiful art,"We had never been to the Huntington before so decided it was time to visit. My husband and our daughter and her two children (aged 3.5 and 1) all drove up from LA. The drive there takes you through a beautiful residential area, full of large homes with beautiful gardens. The entrance is clearly marked and parking is free. The grounds are quite large (120 acres) so wear your comfortable walking shoes and bring a hat. After buying our tickets, we checked with the information booth where they circled the areas on the map that might be most interesting for the little ones. We started at the Children’s Garden. The signage was good so it was easy to find. The garden has its own little blue door which leads into an area filled with spurting fountains, leaf covered houses, water features, a large globe of the world and a concoction where throwing pebbles creates music. It was truly heaven for our 3.5 year old. The walkway has the phases of the moon on it. And everything is in miniature. From there we wandered over to the Chinese Garden where we could walk behind a waterfall, watch the coi in the water, and picnic. It was then on to the Japanese Garden for more coi, a bamboo forest and a meditation sand garden. From there it was an uphill walk (and our little guy was getting tired), through the Desert Garden back to the Library Exhibit to see some of the old, rare books. There is an exhibit called Orbit where we could listen to the satellites circling the skies above us. We also stopped in some of the art galleries, but not for long as that was harder with the kids. Definitely worth coming back to spend more time enjoying the paintings. We saw geese, bunnies, lizards, birds. After all that we stopped at the café near the entrance/exit for ice cream. And of course the gift shop which had a whole section just for kids. All in all it was a wonderful day which everyone enjoyed.",Sa-i44
50,first time there and I will be back,"We went to the museum/gardens/art galleries. Such a beautiful place, so many things to see and do. The gardens was spectacular in the spring. Everything was labeled in the gardens so that was nice. Lots of exhibits, and accommodate lots of tastes. Fun store and lovely places to eat.",Betsie49
50,A National Treasure!,"I grew up in the area, so I am a bit biased. I have been to many botanical gardens, but the combination of architecture, design of the gardens, museums and not food and gift shop are outstanding! I loved the gracious staff at the museum and particularly at the gift store. It's all somewhat pricey, but the food was glorious and the setting is nothing short of a dream for a plant enthusiast and art lover like me!This is a MUST SEE if you have never been to LA. Driving around San Marino is an exquisite tour of architecture and grandeur of days gone by.",johncW1238OE
50,Another great visit,We had another great visit to the Huntington Library and Gardens. The roses were SPECTACULAR.The other parts of the gardens were as beautiful as ever.,HappyRetired92662
50,Another great visit to the Huntington!,"As always, the Huntington Library and Gardens are worth coming often to visit because of the ever-changing seasons the expert maintenance of the entire grounds. The exhibits in the library of rare and unique books and artifacts make each visit a stimulating learning experience. The Library makes history come alive and the guides are so knowledgeable and instructive that each visit is one that makes you want to explore the history of the works on display even more. Please tell everyone you know that a visit to the Huntington is a must when they come to Southern California!",David R
50,What a treasure!,"What a wonderful legacy, in the spirit of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London -- a place devoted to the love of learning, the love of the arts, the love of nature. First, get your bearings at the information center and the friendly, knowledgeable Lisa who has been volunteering as a docent for decades!The thematic gardens are just magnificent in the California sunshine. Take your walking shoes and your camera.The museums and library really have so much to offer. Of course the famous Pinkie and Blue Boy portraits were on my Bucket List and they did not disappoint, but there are so many other wonderful faces in that portrait gallery from artists like Gainsborough and Romney. The American gallery displayed amazing objects that might have been used in everyday homes: quilts, spinning wheels, stoneware, weather vanes, furniture, etc, in addition to paintings, photography, sculpture and other visual arts. The Library is an amazing collection of first editions and original manuscripts, in a low-light setting.The recently opened Orbitz exhibit is so much fun, in concert with JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs), allowing the visitor to ""hear"" satellite communications (including the International Space Station) transformed into musical tones. The volunteer docents are treasures themselves.We had a very nice meal at the Patio Grill. Do try the watermelon agua fresca, and the coconut cookies.Our only suggestion would be for the Museum to offer a two-day pass option for those of us from out-of-town. One day is just not enough time!",Lisa C
50,"Splendid gardens, and a wonderful attracton.","There is something for everyone at the gardens, and you can spend as long as you want walking around, through the different 'zones', enjoying everything there is to see.Very close to Pasadena, and less than 30-minutes from Los Angeles, I feel a visit here should be considered by everyone visiting LA.If you live here, consider buying an annual membership; it will pay for itself if you go twice!",Echo_Oscar_Sierra
50,The gardens are extensive and extraordinary,A magical experience to visit ---for all ages.Nice to get away from all the artificial entertainment surrounding our children.,862heather
50,A Day Immersed in Beauty,"First of all, the back story. A young woman with a questionable past marries a very rich man much older than she is. Alas, he dies and she marries his very rich nephew. They proceed to combine their ample resources as well as their rare book and painting collections and purchase some of the best of the English masters from the stately homes of England struggling to pay hefty estate taxes after World War One. The result - The magnificent gardens, library and home that comprises the Huntington Collections.The Gardens - if it is a beautiful day, spend an hour and a half strolling through the desert garden, the Japanese and the newly completed Chinese garden. If you are hungry by now, stop for High Tea at the rose garden (reservations recommended).The European Museum - this is at least an hour of viewing the most delicious of paintings. Don't miss the Ghirlandaio portraits on the second floor along with a charming Watteau, gripping Turners, and a little gem of a Constable.The grand salon on the first floor is one of the best museum galleries in the country. Here are those paintings that were England's great loss and California's great gain. Larger than life men and women look down on you, dressed in their ethereal, pompous or theatrical finery. Gainsborough, Reynolds, Romney and Lawrence - the great English portrait painters show off their genius. Don't miss ""Pinkie"" and ""Blue Boy"". The art dealer who sold the Huntington's that masterpiece was so hated for letting this painting leave England's shores for the Wild West that he had to flee to France.Finally, there is the Library with its Gutenberg Bible, double elephantine Audubon Birds of America and Shakespeare's Folios. Plan to spend at least a half hour here gazing into the minds of the writers and artists and map makers who have shaped Western Civilazation.We did not visit the American Museum simply because we ran out of time and energy. We did not sample the several restaurants in the Huntington with the exception of 1919, a very good food station-type cafeteria with a terrace view of the gardens and distant hills. Alas, we will have to return to see the American Museum and to discover what is blooming in the gardens during another season. We can't wait!",Sara B
50,Exceptional Gardens and Exhibits,"Beautiful place, I have been coming for more than a decade and it always seems to grow. The galleries are small and accessible with a great selection of art and manuscripts. This is a really great place to see a collection of many different items from old books and science exhibits to modern American and European art. There are even furniture and the buildings and old mansions are themselves an experience.The gardens are exceptional I especially like the Japanese gardens.",JKPImageFusion
50,Too beautiful to miss!,"There is truly something for everyone here: beautiful grounds and gardens, including succulents, for gardeners; art galleries and a library with impressive first editions for art and antiquities lovers, great restaurant choices for the hungry... Did I mention the gift shop with an incredible selection of treasures? On a sunny day, this is a great place to spend your time!",86laurelb
50,An oasis of brilliance - a gem,"Pasadena was the last place we stayed on our US trip to celebrate my hubby's other ""big"" birthday and thanks to my 2nd cousin we visit this beautiful place. The Huntington is collections-based educational and research institution established by Henry E Huntington located in San Marino California.What a gem. Even if you are not a gardener this place has so much on offer. Different gardens yes with very knowledgeable staffpkus a library with a fabulous collection of early manuscripts and papers inc The Ellesmere Chaucer and lots more.Go. Visit. Spend time with or without a camera. This was a great place, we were there over 4 hours and we still didn't manage the whole site - I'll definitely visit again. What a delightful way to end our special trip.",Elizabeth
50,Acres of interesting landscapes,"We spent a beautiful afternoon wandering the grounds. Particularly enjoyed the desert, Japanese and rose gardens. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Easily accessible to pushchairs. An oasis of calm about half an hour from downtown LA. Very well kept and a vast array of plants. Also painting galleries which we didn't visit. Thoroughly recommend. Local town of Pasadena good to visit for food, drink and shopping too.",Peeksm
50,Great day of beauty!,"Wow this place is amazing! We arrived when it opened at 10am, parking was no problem. No parking fee which was amazing in LA! We got free tickets online and printed them, then had to get sticker from admissions to enter. First walked into Japanese garden, into children's green house area. (Our least favorite) Then onto rose garden, Chinese garden and through desert succulents. Huge place to walk around. I would give yourself at least 3 hours to see everything. We went to lunch in cafeteria and had a yummy beet salad and croissant turkey sandwich. Prices seemed fair for amount of food we got. There were a bunch of tour buses that arrived and was pretty crowded by noon. When we left, the parking lot was packed and people were following u for your spot. This was on a Thursday. Great day seeing lots of beautiful blooming plants. Our favs were succulents and Chinese garden!",southerncaligirl72
50,FREEDAY = Advance (1 Month) Planning,"Tickets are free and can be requested online. You may choose from two arrival times: morning (10 a.m.) or afternoon (1 p.m.) below. A limited quantity will be available the first day of each month at 9 a.m. preceding the month you wish to visit. (For example, if you wish to visit on August Free Day, you may reserve tickets beginning July 1). And Free Day tickets are NOT available at The Huntington, learn that the hard way.PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: tickets are gone within the first TEN MIN the day off. IN THE PARK it is super worth! BEAUTIFUL SCENERY. My all time favorite garden were the Chinese and Japanese Garden. Super breathtaking. Rose garden is nice too! If you love flower and nature, bring extra battery because there are sooo many flowers waiting for you to take photos of! NO PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY INSIDE like weddings and whatnot but it is so beautiful inside, I would suggest wearing something nice! Potential profile pic awaits! Bring comfortable shoes, its a lot of walking inside, but of course, there are places for people to rest.There are other things to do besides walking around in the gardens. For instance, there are museums and the indoor Orchid collection. There are a few museums, inside there's a wide range of silverware tea collection, European paintings, contemporary paintings, sculptures, greek statues.KIDS: there are pokemon go stops everywhere (haha) cute ducks and koi fishes at the Japanese GardenFOOD: I would normally not eat inside because San Mario is right next to Pasadena, where it is like a food center for me (Old Town Pasadena). But I did saw some pork dumpling cafe inside the Chinese Garden, I never tried it but I know there are food inside but I prefer eating somewhere else.",THEAdventureAWAITS
50,"Excellent museum, amazing garden","I spent a lovely afternoon at this museum in December 2016, and for families, the children's garden is a magical experience.For the grown ups, one lovely thing about this museum is that it has a carefully curated selection of works, so that you are seeing really high quality pieces for the periods displayed. On the library side, I appreciated the illustrated manuscript displays and could have spent hours there alone. I also appreciated the way the collection is thoughtfully displayed in the various buildings, each building on its approaches. There is certainly enough variety here to satisfy many visitors.We also enjoyed walking through the garden, experiencing the interactive pieces as well as watching and exploring the children's garden. That particular feature is outstanding and if you live nearby with young children, your children will benefit from a membership. The way the children's garden is set out is beautiful: hidden features waiting to be discovered, a multitude of viewpoints and secret doors, as well as refreshing features, all with corners to hide behind. For kids, this garden is really special.",NYCmom50
50,Stunning gardens,Bring comfortable shoes because you will walk ALOT! I came here around 1:30 pm and I was able to see 5 gardens and go inside the European Art Museum. I truly enjoyed the museum and seeing the Blue Boy in person. My favorite gardens are the Chinese garden and the garden with Lilly ponds. I personally think that this is a must see if you are in the LA area.,Marinita
50,Gorgeous Garden and Breathtaking Collection,"Wow! Let’s start with that. This place tops the list. The garden is just stunning. The must see are the Japanese Garden, Desert Garden, Chinese Garden and the Rose Garden. The others are: the Australian Garden, California Garden, Camellia Garden, Lily Ponds, Palm Garden, Shakespeare Garden and the Subtropical Garden. The Japanese Garden is fabulous. We enjoyed having tea and spring rolls at the Chinese Garden Tea Shop, overlooking the pond of the Chinese Garden. You need several hours to fully walk this place. The Permanent Exhibitions were nice too that included collections from Shakespeare. The gift shop is large and has a huge collection of gifts. We need to go back to look at what was missed during this visit.",Dude_IN_LosAngeles
50,Our favorite place of L.A. area thus far.,"We've lived in Los Angeles since 2008, and finally visited Huntington Gardens and Museum in 2017. I regret now that it's taken us that long since it's now my favorite place to visit! I have two young children (6 and 2), and they have asked several times to go back to ""the Gardens"" since. We went to the museum first, and I saw their imaginations piqued as I told them about the house and that someone actually lived there a long time ago. We gave them a camera and the headphones and let them learn and take pictures of anything they wanted. They had huge smiles on their faces as they ran around the grassy areas after, and as we walked around the gardens. We did A LOT of walking, and they were awesome about it. The koi fish in the Japanese gardens engaged them for nearly an hour, and we sat under the trees on the hill watching... basking in a warm spring day with a gentle breeze... Seriously, it was heaven. We saved the children's garden for last, which was great because they expended the last bit of their energy for a full hour, completely engaged in the sweet attractions there -- the vibrating water fountain, the pins that make music when you dump rocks down the crevice, the water spray play... I cannot say enough good about our visit, and I cannot wait to go back!",Anna C
50,Superb: Amazing and a complete must visit.,"I'm not exaggerating or getting carried away with hyperbolic language. The Huntington is the best museum, art gallery and garden (as it is a collection of all three) I've ever visited. Kew Gardens meets the national portrait gallery with a sprinkling of the Tate would perhaps describe it. A superb example of American philanthropy. Beautifully crafted gardens play host to a number of art collections. A day is not long enough, go early and have lunch in the excellent well priced restaurants. Eat in the Chinese garden on the terrace over the koi pond.",Paulaustin
50,Fantastic place to relax,"We became members right after our first visit. Living in LA for one year, this is the perfect place to hang out on days off or the weekend.",ernstjan104
50,Always a special treat,"I visit the Huntington Library and Gardens often since it is very near my home in Passdena. This visit was to attend a specialty tour of the grounds, along with 4 other women friends. We were lucky in having extraordinary weather for the outing. And with the help of our knowledgeable guide the whole garden came alive with historical detail about the Huntingtons and their mission to create a plant museum as well as a beautiful place to house their collection of paintings, tapestry and sculpture. We finished the morning walk with a delicious lunch at Cafe 1919 on the grounds where the food was by far better than any other museum cafe in the greater LA region.",Psynthia

Rare and beautiful plants and flowers everywhere. Only bad experience was lunch at the Chinese Restaurant...food was very expensive (3 people over $70.00) and very bland and greasy.",Terry L
50,Garden wonders,What a treat ... this was by far one of the best gardens we have visited . The Japanese garden was breath taking / the rose garden was just starting to bloom ( a bit too early in the season ) but you could get sense of what it would be like fully bloomed !( heaven!) bonsai exhibition was delightful and the cactus garden breathtaking!if you can avoid going going during the weekend ( it was parked ) and parking was hard to find. All a great afternoon spent with Mother Nature.,Brioche21
50,高雅華麗的美術館和花園,"這座漂亮的美術館有二幅名畫 ""The Blue Boy""和 ""The Pink Girl""(俗稱 Pinkie). 館址在San Marino, 位於寧靜的高級住宅區中心, 外表看來毫不顯眼, 但院內卻是佔地207英畂, 有南加州祕密花園之稱的富豪宅邸. 其中的 Huntington Art Gallery乃2層樓房的典雅藝廊是由主人的住處改建,在一樓主廳高掛著 The Blue boy by Thomas Gainsborough,circa (1770) 和 Pinkie by Sir Thomas Lawrence. (1794) 這2幅畫是英國畫派的代表作品, 主要特點是混合了浪漫主義和新古典主義, 所以畫中的少女男孩神韻都栩栩如生, 宛如是完美的玩偶. 但背景卻只是未經理想化的英國田園或陰晴不定的天空, 看起來並不十分相襯. 這種風格和同時間在法國流行的洛可可畫法並不相同.",Andre C

50,Be Sure to Visit the New Chinese Garden,"The Huntington consists of a World-class library with original books, such as a Gutenberg Bible on display, several art galleries housing collections of European and American art, as well as a Japanese-style garden and a 120 acre botanical garden.The latest addition is an authentic, 5 acre, Chinese-style garden that recently opened and is still not totally finished. This garden is constructed in the style of the famous gardens of Suzhou, China that were built during the Ming Dynasty, (AD 1368 - 1644). Craftsmen from China are in charge of the overall design as well as the detail work. The garden surrounds a small lake and has several pavilions where a visitor can sit and relax. There is also a teahouse where one can buy a snack. It is my understanding that this is the finest example of a traditional Chinese garden outside of China.It would be very difficult to see all of the Huntington in only one day.",Dennis N

I'm from Washington, DC, and so, I've never seen a ""Desert"" garden. It was amazing. But the real show-stopper for me was the Chinese Garden. Lovely attention to architecture as well as the over-all setting. It seems that the top traditional garden planners from China were part of the planning and execution of the Huntington's Chinese Garden. Well done!",bdleckie

Be sure to see the Chinese Garden, the Rose Garden, the Desert Garden, and the Zen garden. If you go in the afternoon, make reservations to have tea near the Rose Garden. The Children's Garden is wonderful and kids are welcome throughout the property. In the library look for the Gutenberg Bible. In the art collection don't miss Pinky and Blue Boy.

50,Local Favorite - Gorgeous all the way through,"I grew up getting to go here on the weekends, as my parents bought a membership. If you are visiting LA, it's absolutely worth making the trip to this place. It's not that cheap (although they have a free day each month), so if you go, definitely make it a full day trip. They are only open from 10-5 on the weekends, so plan ahead to go early so you don't miss out. I've gone here with friends, dates, etc. I mean, this place is always wonderful, I have never gotten bored. I mean, I guess if you hate art, nature, or architecture, then maybe avoid this place. Everyone else, children included, will probably have anywhere from a decent to amazing time!The gardens have different flowers blooming each month, there are different museum and library portions, a section that is extremely kid-friendly and educational, a tea parlor (you need to make reservations), and a lot of walking. Wear comfortable shoes, bring your camera, a refillable water bottle... If you don't want to pay for food, you can bring an ice chest, leave it in your car, and eat it in a nice little designated spot in front of the parking lot before you enter the place.",Jaywon L

50,Gorgeous Gardens and Great Rare Book Library,"DO NOT MISS this place when you are in Los Angeles! Even if you don't care for art museums, the gardens alone are worth the trip! As you walk the paths throughout the property, you enter small garden masterpieces: Chinese garden with a waterfall; Japanese garden with a Zen garden, bonsai display and a teahouse; Shakespeare and herb gardens; vast rose garden; a housed tropical rainforest. The art is secondary to the grounds in our opinion, but don't miss ""Blue Boy"" in the European art collection. A huge must see is in the rare book library: you can view a Gutenberg Bible and a first folio of Shakespeare's plays. Best to go on a nice day so you can enjoy the exquisite gardens.",linda g

There are separate gardens for each of these: Chinese, Japanese, Desert, Cactus, Australian, Rose, Shakespeare, and more. I loved the Japanese Garden the best: with a bonzai area, bamboo forest to a waterfall, and a pond filled with Koi, surrounded by lovely trees and flowers and the red bridge. There are three wonderful art galleries on the site, too, showing a variety of well known artist's work: The European Gallery, American Gallery, and the original Library Building with Blue Boy. There are also 4 restaurants on the grounds. We ate a nice Chinese meal of spring rolls, dumplings, rice, spicy cauliflower, and beef and noodles right in the center of the Chinese Gardens by a pond. Visiting this lovely place is a great way to relax and get away from busy city life for an afternoon.",kathyhappytraveler
40,Awesome rare book collection,"The rare book collection was amazing: a Gutenberg bible, early printings of The Canterbury Tales and letters dating from Charles I. All with just the right amount of background to set it in context without becoming dreary. The European art collection was interesting mostly because of how it was displayed in the Huntington's residence. The American art included some impressive folk art and portraits but felt like a bunch of stuff thrown together at random.",Gail
50,Huntington Library Museum,"5 stars, you get a lot for your money. Famous artworks, huge world-class gardens, modern exhibits, nice store and modern upscale food court, a bit pricey, but that is to be expected.",coreychambers
50,The Huntington and 1919 restaurant.,"The Huntington Museum and Gardens are exquisite. We had a meet up with friends at the 1919 restaurant. I want to go back to the gardens but in the spring or early summer as that's when everything is in bloom. I love that there are tags near every bit of flora so you can see what you are looking at. The paintings and American memorabilia are not to be missed.One thing you should miss is the 1919 restaurant. It is kind of cafeteria style. You go up to the counter of the food you like and order and wait in line. I ordered soup and salad. The salad was good but you could taste the thickener in the soup. The setting is minimal and not too pleasant. There are other restaurants, that we did not try, that should be better. Or you can wait until you leave and try some outside restaurants.I gave the Huntington a 5 because of the gardens and museums. There are benches around the gardens where you can sit and commune with nature.",Skyros7
50,The most beautiful place to visit in LA area,"I try to come here monthly, and absolutely love it! Wether it's in the gardens or the museums, I find a new treasure every time I visit. Also, depending on the season, you will find something unique about the gardens, as different flowers are blooming year round. It's enjoyable to sit and have lunch, and just take in the beauty all around you. There are many options for lunch, and all are listed on their website.I bring my child in a stroller, and I have no problem getting around everywhere. It's a great workout too!The first time I visited The Huntington library and gardens, I was just visiting California, And now that I live here, I make it a point to visit as often as I can. I find it funny that so many people don't know about this amazing place!",drmstr
30,1919 - How to not make the most of your time and ticket price,"I had not been to the Huntington Library for 30years and really looked forward to visiting with my wife. Overall the library has vastly improved and my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed some of the art collections, library, and grounds that we had the time to see. 5 StarsMy only critical comment would be around the 1919 restaurant. My wife and I chose to sit at the tall 'full service tables' (as described by the host located at the front door) for sushi and bar service. We sat for a long time at the table, 10min?, and no one seemed a bit interested to give us the time of day. That said, I walked up to the bar and placed my own orders and then waited for up to 30min before being served. As it turned out, there wasn't anyone to even make the meal, until 20min into our wait...and during a peak hour!...which was a very disappointing loss of 40min's of our time. 1 Star. Especially when there's so much to see and you want to get the most out of your day and cost to see everything the Huntington Library has to offer.I really want to give a 5 star rating, but given the 1919 restaurant experience 3 stars is rate. Lesson learned: If you wish to enjoy a meal at the library, stick to one of the many 1919 cafe' self service offers.",Eugene L
40,visit on spring season!!,"nice gardens, especially on spring season when the flowers were came out. they also have a beauty japanese garden and small traditional chinese garden. bring your student card to get special discount! Hope u guys enjoy the visit!",yulyul37
50,Cultural contemplation in LA,"For those that have had enough of Hollywood and shopping and would like to spend a day of cultural contemplation, the Huntington library, art and botanic garden is well worth a visit. Thanks to Henry and Arabella Huntington, who were enormously rich, you can enjoy their outstanding collection of books, a less interesting art collection, mostly portraits, and a fantastic botanic garden. The buildings and the botanic garden were created during the early period of the twentieth century are reminiscence of a time when business and wealth created a platform for cultural debauchery, something we today can relish and appreciate.",klkmn
30,The tea room,"The grounds are extremely beautiful however the tea room I consider over priced. They used to have a buffet style and the food, dessert, fruit was delicious. Now a new company came and change the menu to a fix menu for $35.00 a person for few finger sandwiches. Not worth it sorry to say.",Sandy L
50,Beautiful day,Had a great soup and salad at the cafe on the premises. The day was gorgeous and the many camellias were in bloom,bonniestauch

50,Mother Nature at her best!,So much absolute beauty to see everywhere! Get your walking shoes on and prepare to spend a whole day surrounded by mother natures finest and the museums make you wish you lived in those times where art and literature were well appreciated!,cloud1717
50,A wonderful afternoon!,"The gardens are beautiful. The ""Desert"" and ""Japanese"" gardens were my favourites. But, that does not diminish the care and attention that has been lavished on all the other gardens. In addition to the Australian and Chinese gardens there is also a garden dedicated to children. The library and galleries are easily accessible and the staff on site were knowledgable and helpful. Easy parking.",Bob H
50,Spectacular!,The Chinese Garden will literally transport you to China... Several years ago I went to China and toured several gardens. The HL did a phenomenal job recreating a Chinese Garden in the US. Truly an experience you can't miss.,Greta4149
50,Chinese celebration,Excelente people great showsGreat food only bad thing was the parking lotCan't wait for next year !,lumbiya18
50,Meditative Walk in the Gardens,This place is YUUUUGE so dont stress out if you are not able to see everything. Best way is to take your time and absorb any parts you visit and just live in that moment. Walk in the gardens as if you've always lived and belong there. Appreciate every little details. Dont forget to visit the mansion which house some amazing art collections. My personal favorite part has always been the Desert Botanical Garden. Enjoy!,mondchere
50,Wonderful way to spend a day,"Three of us (all above age 72) spent a day at the Huntington Library and Gardens. We truly enjoyed walking through the various garden venues and we toured them all! It was a great way to get plenty of exercise while enjoying nature.We ate at the cafe. They offered a variety of choices which were perfect for lunch. Heard the tea room is wonderful. Plan to do that on a future visit.After lunch we toured the library and gallery. The Gutenberg Bible was fascinating as was viewing Blue Boy. History buffs will love this!It was a very full day and we were pretty tired that evening, but our visit was well worth it.",Calgal39
50,Wonderful gardens with a beautiful home and art collection,"This is a beautiful home with an extensive library for scholars, an impressive collection of American furniture, art as well as European art. The surrounding gardens are well worth a visit for them alone. We were attending a a low point in the garden year, roses were still blooming but past their peak and most other flowers were not yet in bloom. The dessert garden is enormous and impressive. There is an herb garden, a Japanese garden and a variety of other displays, all well cared for and worth a visit.The cost was appropriate for this kind of collection.",Monica S
10,1919 : the restaurant at The Huntington Gardens and Library,"If you don't get a discount, don't goMy husband likes the sandwiches here. Skip the pseudo Mexican food altogether, bland and very unremarkable, yet overpriced. Unfortunately the take over by Susan fender and company has not resulted in anything but pretentious ""gourmet-ish"" food. We get a discount with our member ship and the outside eating area is lovely. They have burgers, which in retrospect, I probably should have gone with. Limited selection of beer, unless you want Japanese beer. Wine available also. A definite difficult for children who are picky eaters-get gelato at the front instead.Most likely will avoid eating there in the future, because we leave close by and can just go somewhere else or go home. It is possible the Chinese food has improved.However the gardens and museums are lovely, wear comfortable shoes! The museums are also interesting. You really can hardly see th entire place in one day.",lascola
50,My Huntington Library and Getty Mix Up,"So many major Museum collections and so little time. I was doing one collection a day recently and got them mixed up. My review of the Getty Museum posted recently was actually all about the Huntington I switched names by mistake (big mistake!) Big mistake telling you to see Pinky and Blue Boy at the Getty. These iconic portraits are at the Huntington along with the charming early American portraits of young children and stern faced forefathers and mothers. George Washington portraits are at the Huntington.Beautiful painterly portraits of rich royalty are seen at both the Getty and Huntington and are a nice contrast to the early American limners, artists who were self taught and traveled around the country painting important people in town and country wealthy land owners and business people.",Marsha S
50,Cactus heaven,"Among the many wonders at the Huntington Garden - timber bamboo, ducks and geese, herbs, Chinese stones and lakes, huge shady oaks - one especially stands out for me: the cactus garden. Tree-sized spiny silver specimens share gently undulating paths with tiny spiky orbs covered in thorns and blooms. It's another world.",karenpK9273YH
50,Beautiful Garden,We enjoyed every aspect of the Huntington Library. We walked through the beautiful gardens and then went inside to see the art collection and library. We also got to see the origami exhibit which was amazing. We especially enjoyed the Japanese and Chinese gardens as well as all of the camellias. We ate at the Noodle House where we sat outside and enjoyed the view. We want to go back when the roses are blooming to enjoy the rose garden. We bought the tickets online which was very easy to do. They then sent us a reminder the day prior to our reservation.,AndieJMc
50,Lots of culture,We visited here during the last couple of hours it was open. It was not long enough.There was an interesting exhibit that captured satellite signals you could listen to and see which satellite it was coming from. There was also a Van Gough exhibit in progress. We got to explore some of the artwork and collections in a couple of the buildings. Absolutely amazing. We also explored some of the gardens which were beautiful even for it being December.I hope to get back and spend more time exploring the grounds and the rest of the museums.,Tiner721
50,"Where to start? Beautiful and unique gardens with different areas including a spectacular Chinese garden, Japanese garde","You need a minimum of a whole day to even scratch the surface of the Huntington.If you are going to LA you cannot miss it.Starting with a volunteer tour of the Gardens is a must for orientation; then you can decide where to go next. Tour volunteers(or Docents as Americans call them) have in depth knowledge of the gardens. The Shakespeare garden had quotes from the bard and plenty of herbs that would not be out of place in Stratford Upon Avon UK;but still was different due to the climate and issues with drought at hotter times of the year.The Chinese gardens were made by craftsmen and gardeners/ stone masons etc from China and based on others I have seen in Suzhou in mainland China. All look authentic but have been adapted due to local conditions and the geology of LA.The Bamboo groves and Japanese gardens have unusual use of concrete but made into authentic looking balustrades and walkways too. You could spend days here and never tire of it.Acres of plants and rocks and sculptures and streams and waterfalls make this a magical place for all.There are so many sections to the garden, including the Rose Garden that you have something for everyone.A world class library and research facility reflect the Collectors passion for Literature and other interests. What a setting for research.Go and see the collection. I cannot even get started on the Art Collections but spent a while looking at the Impressionist paintings, sculpture and also Arts and Crafts furniture etc.Go visit.",CassandraHolly
30,Outstanding Refund,"Given recent booking, reservation changes, coordinating a visit for my sister's birthday celebration was more of an ordeal than I had planned. I am still awaiting a refund for a tour that I booked for five due to one party being unable to attend. Though I notified the same day of the need to cancel and received a reply email the next day that it would be handled at the first of the year, it still has not been done. I have emailed and called since with no response. This has tainted the day for me unfortunately.",Nicole L
50,Simply magnificent!!!,I have lived in L.A. For 23 years and I have never encountered anything quite like this. The gardens here are spectacular and enormous! Tea at the Rose Garden was lovely and delicious! You absolutely must go!!!,debydoodle
50,Too much to see,"I live pretty close and always take visitors here. There is too much to see but something for everyone. The gardens are terrific particularly the Japanese and Chinese gardens. For those intellectuals and English buffs where else can one see an original Chaucer, folio of Shakespeare's and Gutenberg vellum bible. Then there is the mansion and the Art galleries. The price is $20 a person so plan to spend the day.",Jan K
50,One of the best gardens in the world,"We have traveled to many countries and always try to sample the best gardens. Huntingdon is at the top on our list. It has variety, history, good guides, and delightful surprises (like the tea garden). Give yourself several hours - it is not to be rushed.",Lusite
50,We'll be back!,"We had an amazing visit, and took a wonderful tour led by the knowledgeable and friendly Carl. The Estate has so many things to see. We knew after only half of our tour that we would not try to see everything because we wanted an excuse to return, as if we needed one.",GregandEileen
50,Wonderful gardens,"Even on a rainy, cold day this place is beautiful. We spend 2 1/2 hours touring the place and could have spend another 3 hours and not seen it all. The docent gave us a great deal of information and we really enjoyed out time here, just wished we would have had more time.The café food was great and the staff very friendly.",mgdevine
50,Oasis in SoCal,Plan to spend at least a day if you can. The gardens should be walked through slowly with occasional stops to take in the beauty. The library is a must along with the museum. Each is small but great collections. There is a restaurant for lunch. Great place or regroup.,Ann U
50,"Loved it, needed more time","Part of a tour package. The views of gardens were spectular - especially the Chinese and Japanese views. Needed so much more time to visit entire facility. Did get to see Guttenberg bible, canterbury tales volumes. Many portraits, including Blue boy and Pinkie....still so much more to see. Rose garden was beautiful",offkilter2016
50,100% Surprise,The collections are impressive. What comes as a bigger surprise are the extensive gardens. You have Japanese garden which is so mesmerising and authentic. Even the Chinese garden is beautiful and tasteful.The variety of cactuses are extensive and beautiful.What a pleasant place to spend the entire day.,Yvette T
50,Take a tour,"This is a must visit when in Pasadena/L.A. and even more than one day. The Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens while all on one very large site, are worth individual tours and several hours each. The Gardens have several areas where you can rest, buy a snack and enjoy the surroundings. Very handicap accessible. The Gardens are easily accessible by the L.A.. Metro. Call in advance for a reservation in the Tea Room for a decent English Tea time. The variety of teas that are available was plentiful and our only complaint was that the pastries were a little stale. Staff in Tea Room not stingy about second portions. Tea Room is in Mr. Huntington's private office/villa and surrounded by Gardens and a vista view.",Judith F

Beautiful gardens, art galleries, hands on activities for kids, a photographers wet dream, several different dining areas. We are actually members so that we can visit as many times as we want. There is too much to see or do in one visit. This is a work of love for the people of LA and the world. Please go. You will not be disappointed",Susan A

50,Expectation,"My wife and I hadn't been to the garden in +/- 10 years and remembered a great experience. When planning this trip we wondered if it would live up to our memory. We purchased our tickets online which was pleasant and efficient. We arrived at 10 AM and spent 5 hours in the garden, Spectacular!!",mphilp

50,"History, Art, Nature In One place","Love the place. Discount for students at entrance. Ask information desk the best thing to see. We only have under 3 hours that day. Advised to start towards the right then go around, which was perfect. Nature- we saw the Chinese garden then the Japanese, walk through the rose garden. Saw the Rose garden tea room. Hint it was packed, but if you're planning a whole day. Stopby and get your name on list, they will have room by 2:30. Late lunch. And yes, you need to pay the entrance even if you're just going to the rose tea garden. Art- Great European Collections, that day, we saw some Van gogh, lucky us. Beautiful! Marvelous. History- saw one of the Gutenberg bible and my oh my rare books. This is a must see. I love the balance of outdoor then indoor experience. Been to Italy and France, yes the art is so amazing however, I felt I had an art overload. Glad I went. You will love the place. One more thing, they have awesome food inside the place, no need to go out. Chinese food by the garden. Big food area just after the Rare books bldg. with outdoor seating. So beautiful. And I guess because this is California in december- just always bring a light jacket.",Cristina J
50,Plan on at least 4-5 hours to truly appreciate the gardens,"The Huntington Library and Gardens is not self-contained like the Norton Simon Museum. You need to plan on doing a lot of walking because this is more of a group of buildings surrounding the main home and art museum. If you like Renaissance portraiture and 19th century art, this is right for you. I personally like the Impressionistic and Post-Modernists, and there is some of that for you here, but more at the Norton Simon.The gardens are extensive and well planted and maintained. This a good for a sunny day. The rose garden has numerous varieties, with arbors. Even in December, the roses were in full bloom. Many species in all the gardens were blooming, which was such a great surprise. The Japanese Garden even has an authentic Tea Room which was brought from Japan and reassembled. This garden has also been used in movies.The garden with the small waterfall and the rainforest feel makes you feel you are in another time. Overall a great trip, but the kids might get bored quickly. Also, spend a few minutes driving through the local neighborhood to see some really great homes.",Crystal B
50,"Grand gardens and galleries, plus great new food options!","As a regular visitor I have seen every part of the grounds and never fail to find something new. They recently brought in a new team to revamp the food, and it is amazing.Visit the galleries, but save time to enjoy the gardens. This time of year the Camellias are blooming, but there is always something interesting to enjoy.",peppermanPasadena
40,Refreshing changes at every visit,"In different seasons and with different exhibits this place always enchants with something familiar and something new! Sometimes the Cacti are in bloom, at other times the roses.What captivated me this time was a rich dark iris!",EuForia_01
50,Something beautiful for everyone,"The Huntington Gardens is a wonderful destination in Pasadena. I spent five hours visiting one day in November and needed another day, which I didn’t have. There is something for everyone: outdoor and indoor gardens, libraries, art galleries and special exhibits. You can leisurely stroll along the walkways and enjoy plants from many parts of the world, or immerse yourself in historical paintings, sculpture, books and botanical research. The gardens and galleries cover over 200 acres, and even though it was a Saturday, it did not feel crowded. (However, the restaurants at lunch time are very busy.) The Chinese and Japanese gardens are especially nice, and the entire family will enjoy the jungle and subtropical gardens. Young children will have fun in the Brody Botanical Center which has indoor hands-on exhibits and an outdoor children’s garden. With your admission you are given a detailed map to navigate the grounds. There is too much to see all in one day, so pick your favorite highlights or plan to return a second day.",CJSArizona
50,"The Library is amazing, and the gardens are great","The Huntingtons obviously had tons of money and they spent it very well, with extremely eclectic collections. Their books are astounding, and include several unique pieces. The signage is a bit simplistic but it hits all the high points and does a good job tying together groups of books. The gardens are amazingly well kept and diverse. The art is not up to the standards of the books or gardens, but it does include some interesting pieces.",dven8
40,A special place,"One of our favorite museums in the area, especially for the grounds and special exhibitions. They have finished a major construction with new restaurant, expanded shops.

50,My Favorite Place in SoCal,"We are members, but also treated our family to the private tour and tea in the Rose Garden. What a lovely experience. The tour starts earlier, before it gets hot, and then ends with a relaxing high tea. Dress comfortably, take lots of pictures, and enjoy this gem of an establishment. There is something for everyone and plenty of grass for children to run around, and a very fun water/children's garden. Bring a change of clothes for them, they will get wet. Also, the dining choices are exceptional. We always get treated like royalty here. Now, if I could afford house in San Marino to buy, my dreams would come true! Until then, we'll visit frequently and continue to dream!",melissakO7723AK

50,A wonderful family outing,"Definitely this is one of the best gardens I have been. From library, art collection and botanical gardens are organized perfect. You can enjoy different view from different angle. Chinese garden is new but standout. Japanese garden is very authentic and awesome. It is good for family day trip.",hwang123
50,Love It,"I would recommend the Gardens in a heartbeat. If you love nature it really is the place to go. There are so many things to see and you could spend a whole day there, that's what I did. There are a few places you can eat as well. which is great",sigridblaauw
50,Fantastic - don't miss this gem of visual delights,"Get yourself to Pasadena to check out the Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens. Give yourself plenty of time, something like 6 hours or more, to soak in the beautiful art work (notice the tension created by the placement of Blue Boy and Pinkie) in the main house. Then toddle over to the Library, and gaze upon the Gutenberg Bible (maybe make a point of explaining to your kids how books were made originally, and how the Gutenberg was one of the first to change the model). And finally, wander about the grounds and enjoy the vegetation and their placement.The Huntington is wonderful mental floss for adults. Don't rush your visit!Maybe you should spend two days there (well, probably not if you have kids - on to Universal Studios or Disneyland). Heh heh.",Seadog69
50,Spend a day here!,"What a beautiful and amazing place to spend a day! Beautiful gardens in many styles appeal to those who love all things botanical and those that don't. Great for families, lots of space and few restrictions. The Japanese and Chinese gardens are simply amazing and the Bonsai Collection fabulous! There is a delicious cafe serving Dim Sum and noodles and adult beverages in the Chinese section and we were even treated to live music in the gazebo. Don't miss the Desert Gardens with more cacti than you can imagine. The cafe offers a variety of well priced snacks and meals. And the patio dining is again, lovely. You really might think you are in Europe as you round corners with views of expansive lawns and mountains in the distance. We never even made into the art and library collections - definitely worth a next visit or three!",Abigail M
50,Wonderful day of fun and viewing,"We went for a friend's birthday, signed up for the Tea and Garden Tour. It was well worth it. The tour group was very small, so it was quite private, and was the best way to get a great history lesson, an intro the grounds, and figure out where to go after. And the tea was super! Really need a couple of days there is so much to see. It was amazing.",leesonline
50,Great gardens and art works !,"We spent a full day here viewing the gardens are the art ! What a great day, the weather was superb for walking through the spectacular gardens.

Really enjoyed the shop at the entrance/exit - the best gallery shop we have visited.",rojaan1
50,"Spectacular Hungtington Library, Art Collection, and Botanical Gardens","This spectacular location exemplifies the California lifestyle and climate. Living in the grand style adjacent to Pasadena and only 20 minutes driving from downtown LA. The meticulously maintained 120 acres of gardens & fountains on a sunny, warm California day are spectacular ...particularly for folks from back East who deal with winter as we do. Allow at least 2-3 hours with lots of walking up and down paths and steps + bring your camera for pix of settings and semi-tropical plants that are monuments to the gardener's expertise and patience. A romantic location for a date..no matter what your age or status. Inside is the renowned Library and Art Collection that includes ""Blue Boy"" and ""Pinkie."" Allow another 2-3 hours for the museum. Better yet, spread your visit over 2-3 days and cover only a portion (2 hours?) each day, so you have time to digest it. Prepare by visiting the web site ahead of time, so you can plan and know what to expect and to choose.",aeg100
30,Tea at the Huntington,"We took a specialty tour, $89/person for a 2 hour tour and tea at the end of the tour. The tour was very interesting and the gardens are beautiful. At the end of the tour we left our guide to have our reserved ""tea"". The food was ok, maybe a little bland. At the end of the meal we were given a check for $70. We called our waitress over, luckily I had my receipt with me showing we'd paid for the Tour and Tea. She said she needed to talk to her manager. Several minutes later the manager came over and told us she'd take care of the check, but she wanted us to know it did not include gratuity. As if we didn't know! All in all left us feeling like the wait staff thought we'd pulled a fast one. Not a nice way to exit our graceful tea.",CraigKim88
50,Awesome -- in and outside,"Go to the Big, Beautiful and Bold the estate of the railroad tycoon Huntington now housing museums and showcasing gardens. A current exhibition not to be missed is ""Gardens, Art and Commerce in Woodblock Prints"" that includes some rare and nver before shown pieces from China. So save yourself a trip abroad and visit before Jan. 9. Keeping with the Asian theme stroll through the adjacent Chinese Garden where the Freshwater Dumpling and Noodle House beckons for tea, beer, dumplings or gravy noodles in an exquisite pond setting. Don't linger too long because also worth seeing are the ""Van Gogh and Friends"" show in the main house and ""Florileggium: Folded Transformations from the Natural World"" (i.e. origami) by Robert J. Lang that's only open on weekends.",GlobalGypsy_13
50,Little Know Outside of California,"If this were back East, it would be world-famous, but tucked in the botanic gardens of Huntington in San Marino, it is not.

The gift shop is terrific.Wear good walking shoes and allow plenty of time. I logged 8500 steps on my Fitbit wandering around for several hours. Next time I'll allow an entire day.",noaccidentaltourist

10,review of the Huntington's new Cafe,"Let me begin by distinguishing between the Huntington Gardens, which are wonderful, stunning, excellent, and the newly opened Cafe. The Cafe is totally forgettable. It all looks so wonderful until you taste the products. We didn't try everything, but everything we had was poorly done. The pizzas look great, but the two different slices (one overcooked and crispy and cold, the other with a crust that was so crispy it tasted like a cracker) are mediocre at best. The plate of the day, which looked good, where three very small pieces of dry chicken served cold (supposed to be hot) accompanied with a small scoop of roasted butternut squash...however the squash was again cold and only partly cooked. The salad itself was fresh, but the balsamic vinegar dressing tasted like salty water. I was so looking forward to enjoying a meal here....sad to say, our experience was not good.",Ann S
50,A must see!,We visited on the recommendation of family. We were not disappointed. The grounds were beautifully maintained and I even saw my first Van Gogh and Monet paintings! We were not able to see everything in one visit so if we are in the area again we will definitely return!,mariediaz7
50,Wonderful Art Collection in a beautiful old home,This museum is known for the gardens but I enjoyed seeing the mansion with all the art work and historical books and manuscripts even more. It was wonderful to see Thomas Gainsborough's portrait of The Blue Boy up close. I enjoyed seeing the french furniture and the beautiful tapestries and the famous sculpture of Diana the huntress. It was a very relaxing day walking around the mansion and then the gardens. Since it was raining the gardens were not in their full glory. Definitely worth a visit!,fancythis72

50,New eateries at this wonderful art and garden destination,"We have just returned for another visit and lunch on Sat. We tried 1919(Cafe) and was pleasantly surprised with the fresh Mexican fare. We had a table on the terrace. The expansive views of the grounds and the new NASA installation in front of us made the eating experience very special. It reminded me of dining on the patio of Galleria Nationale d'Arte Moderna in Borghese Garden, Rome. We are very fortunate to have such a treasure as Huntington in a very accessible location.",sfeats
40,"Amazing place to visit, so much to see.....need whole day","Visited with friend amazing, different beautiful gardens to view & walk around my fav the Japanese gdn. A lot of ground & exhibitions so you need a full day to enjoy it all at a good pace. Library incredible with the Gutenburgh Bible & a letter written by Abraham Lincoln plus Shakespeare etc. We had an English cream tea in the tea room which was great with so much choice & good staff. The garden tour guide we chatted to was helpful & knowledgeable. My friend returned with other friends following week & did the full gdn tour & said how good it was tho long (over 2 hrs). Lovely shop. Quite pricey entrance fee so need to spend all day. Plenty of places to sit & relax away from public.",M J
50,One of the Best Kept Secrets!,"We came back here twice. The gardens are too amazing to describe! I took photos of soooo many varieties of roses, the Japanese garden, the Chinese garden and we still didn't get to everything. The library and art collection is beyond belief---what a collection!",Margaret M
50,Exceptional landscaping and museum,"Truly one of the most interesting gardens and landscaping we have ever visited.This place is an absolute ""must visit"". Several museum buildings set in unique gardens from Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Australian etc. Splendid !Moreover, had probably the best and perfectly served espresso macchiato (Illy) of our entire 5 week trip through Oregon and California here.",Karel V
50,"Books, botanicals and beyond ....","What a treat - a friend took us to the Huntingdon for an afternoon; it was not long enough! What a really special place. We spent a couple of hours walking in the amazingly beautiful gardens - Italian, Chinese, Australian, Japanese; the Rose garden, herb garden, palm garden ... Absolutely stunning.Then we had a bite to eat in the restaurant - nightmare, so so busy, disorganised, no way of knowing how to order (it's not as easy as you first think - take a piece of paper, put it in front of the chef ....) It was incredibly busy, and the chefs could not cope and we were in line for EVER.But then we went into the buildings and OH MY the MSS and books and old printings were STUNNING. I poured over the Gutenberg Bible, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Shelley's notebook, a French book of hours, Shakespeare ... Galileo's works, medieval maps ... then a vast collection of light bulbs (much more interesting than it sounds!) and then - Impressionist paintings, Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne ..... then fabulous furniture, ceramics, tapestries ...This place is full of things wonderfully ancient and modern, fascinating and fantastic. I would have liked at least 2 days to see and appreciate it all.",PJaneS
50,Fantastic Botanical Garden Experience!,Amazing botanical garden experience. The California dry garden is truly beautiful and a fine example of the garden of the future for California. Low water requirements yet lovely to look at. We didn't not have enough time to check out all the gardens but we will be going back. Don't miss out on the cactus garden.,300GWA2
50,Unique landscaping,"I was there for one day; only had time for the landscaping, which was my primary interest. You'd need at least two days. This is the most spectacular and artfully designed garden I've ever visited. Don't miss the cactus garden, which I found much more unique than the Chinese or Japanese gardens they recommend (I've been to Asia).",tedcamesano
50,How can I express the sheer joy each time I visit the Huntington Library and Gardens?,"For the price of one admission its an escape into a Garden of Eden. If for only the Cactus, Shakespeare, Japanese, and Chinese Gardens it would be a bargain. But then you can also visit ""The Blue Boy"" (and other Gainsboroughs) and 18th C. paintings in the Museum created by this railroad magnate. Then there's the library with an original Gutenberg bible and other gems for the enjoying. Then there's the tropical eco-environments, and the Herb garden, and the Rose Garden, and the Japanese Teahouse and Zen Garden, and you've touched bliss in Pasadena. Take your visiting guests there and spend an afternoon. I believe they open at noon. Its a joy every time…you can even become a member and save on the entrance fees.",eggcreamer
50,Wow!,"An East Coast resident, I was not aware of this facility. It is fantastic: gardens, landscaping, architecture and art museums. A visit should include at least two full days, maybe more.",Allen P
10,Not tech or handicapped friendly,Ordered tickets online in the hopes that we could be admitted quickly to orchid show as my husband is ill and uses a scooter. Still had to wait in long line to with everyone else buying tickets and exchange our online tickets for admission. At one point they opened a handicapped window so we got out of line and went there but were told it was an info only window and to get back in other line. The orchid vendors were in a very crowded tent on uneven grass. My husband could not go in due to space and stability restrictions. It was a very disappointing experience for him. They seemed very inconsiderate of their disabled guests.,188kayf
50,I nice place to put your minor troubles in their proper place,A real gem of a garden in the San Gabriel Valley. But be warned the place is huge. So wear a proper set of walking shoes and some sun screen is a good investment. If you are handicapped in walking long distances as I am. Then make sure that you plan for enough time to take it all in.,David L
50,A Lovely Place!,"My husband always wanted to see the Blue Boy by Gainesborough. When we were planning a small getaway, we decided to go find this painting and all of the others found here. The staff went above and beyond, from the security guards, the cashiers, the Huntington Tea room server, Gabriela and the docents. The positioning of the artwork in the buildings, the statues and fountains and hideaways in the gardens are done with such care and symmetry. I highly recommend everyone come here for the ambiance, the collections, the gardens and the staff. We plan to return to finish what we couldn't see.",drojano
50,Incredible,"Plan on spending a whole day here as there is much to do. The mansion itself is a museum that holds many artifacts from when the Huntington family lived there. In addition, the mansion houses the art gallery and the library both offering glimpses of rarified books and art. However, the real fun begins when you start to stroll through the grounds which contain the botanical gardens. It's massive. A leisurely stroll might take you several hours if you include stops for something to eat or drink. If you are a photographer you have found your paradise.Both desert and tropical flora abound and plants from all over the world are on display.",Dave H
50,"Wonderful collection, serene setting.",To have such a lovely collection so close by...one of the best museums close in and easy to get to. Check with them to see the current exhibit schedule.,Tim B
50,Huntington Tea & Tour,"Visiting The Huntington after a few days in Los Angeles was a relief to eyes and ears tired of big city lights and noises. We bought the Tea & Tour package, which was well worth it. My husband and I shared the tour with a family of 4 people. The tour guide was a very patient and knowledgeable man, who walked us through the history of the place and left us at the tea house doorsteps.They have a delicious rose tea and a nice buffet of cheese, patés and other finger foods and desserts.I recommend it and will visit this place again if I am around.",nanemiho
50,"Wear walking shoes, it's big.",Beautiful grounds and original art by the masters is what it's all about. We did lunch at the cafe. It was not too bad and very clean. The price was reasonable. The personnel were very friendly and helpful. We didn't get to see it all in one day there's just too much and will return for another visit soon.,Norm K
50,Tea & Tour is a great way to see The Huntington,"Great tour, great tour guide, great ""brunch"" at the Tea Room. We had not been to tThe Huntington for at least 10 years. Much has changed - and all for the better! The tour and tea was a great way to re-experience it.",Dennis H
50,Garden Walk,"First visit to the gardens, what a place, have only managed half the grounds before running out of space on my camera, luckily I had my phone with me. This place is well worth a visit, the longer you can spend here the better. The Children's garden, Chinese Garden and Japanese Gardens are a must, followed by Shakespeare's garden and the Jungle, that's without the galleries, a must visit.",Tony W
50,We always see something new!,"We went to see the gardens of course but there were three new exhibits we wanted to view. We saw the Geographies of Wonder about the realization and evolution of National Parks, Real American Places, the iconic photos of Edward Weston/ Leaves of Grass exhibit, and Van Gogh and Friends which were on loan from the Hammer Museum. We went on a Monday and it was not busy. We also had lunch in the cafe with was delicious!",Marjie S
50,A step into the world of art and beauty,Visited for the third time with friends and every moment special from the art galleries to gardens of beauty.We had lunch which was marvelous and the staff are gracious. The gift shop outstandingWe visited October 22 when Van Gogh exhibit was on,Gavin & Nicoole B
50,Reliving old times,"This was a reprise of my first date 30 years ago with the woman who would later become my wife. She was a Los Angeleno and I was from out of state but she had never heard of the place and a bit skeptical of my choice but it worked out great!The smog seems to be worse than 30 years ago but the botanical gardens and the art collections are even better than we remember.Also, the food at the cafe was great. Either there wasn't a cafe during our first visit or we did not eat there.",BayAreaGuySanJose_CA
50,A Garden of Eden,"While on a short visit, I got to see the botanical garden only........but it was worth every minute......acres of palms of every sort........the Bismarckias were so beautiful! The gardens have an elaborate, computer controlled greenhouse complex, where once can go from one climate to the next............my favourite was the rain forest. could have spent all day there!",DonBrown
50,Great variety of gardens,"It is great to spend an afternoon at the Botanical Gardens. They have Australian Garden, Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden. Especially the Chinese Garden, they imported so many Tai Lake stone from China and the garden is well designed. There is also a place inside that one can order different kind of afternoon tea and snacks.",Zhi-Shao LIU
50,Spend the Day!,"A wonderful place to spend an entire day - so much to see! In fact in my 5 hours there (self-guided, slow pace) I saw just the European art galleries (American art and natural history/science exhibits are in two additional separate buildings, and there is a library as well) and the rose, Japanese, and Chinese garden (missed the desert and Australia gardens). The Japanese garden, the highlight for me, includes a bonsai court with a collection of very old and distinctive trees and a full-size Japanese home, along with the garden. The Chinese garden is organized around a sizable pond with at least 5 different pavilions, with sculptures placed throughout and a small cafe with plenty of outdoor seating. There is at least one other cafe on the site, but I didn't visit that one. There are many lovely places to sit and relax throughout the entire site -- as others have noted, there is a good amount of walking required to get from garden to garden.",eyeful11
50,So much to see and do,This is one of those attractions that you really ought to see on a visit to SoCali. There are several gardens with plants from all over the world. The docent tour really brings it all together for you. We stopped at the Tea Room for tea after a couple of hours of looking at the various displays. Didn't even get to the art gallery and other attractions.Highly recommended!,Jack C
50,A Enriching Array of Wonders to Behold,"My husband and I made this a day-trip excursion, leaving at mid-morning from Santa Monica and departing by 3 pm to better avoid freeway traffic. We visited the library and took a guided tour of the botanical gardens. Our docent concentrated on the Desert Garden, Subtropical Garden, Palm Garden and the Rose Garden and, after an hour and a half, ended at the entrance to the Japanese Garden. By that time we were too exhausted to venture into the welcoming allure of Asian gardens. I recommend starting with the Japanese Garden, ""the jewel in the crown,"" and working your way back to the beginning. The cornucopia of indoor and outdoor offerings warrants multiple visits. Be prepared for a lot of walking as one picks and chooses among an abundance of displays within the estate grounds.. An on-site cafe offers salads, soups, hamburgers and pizzas, cold beverages and indoor and covered patio seating overlooking the surrounding gardens. The Huntington is closed on Tuesday but open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from noon to 4:30 pm, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Check the weather before proceeding.",BAKSPIN
50,A Stunning Treasure,"A friend recommended this place to me and I am so glad I visited. This is a must-see for those who love nature, art, and/or rare books and it is well worth the $23 fee for a day pass. An immense amount of acreage is devoted to the Botanical Gardens, the crowning gems being the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The Chinese Garden has fantastic architecture and amazing rocks and plants surrounding a large pond that is filled with koi fish. The Japanese Garden is amazingly landscaped to provide a serene spot in which to rest and reflect. There are many shady spots along the path and many water features, including waterfalls, streams, and ponds (more koi).There are several galleries spread throughout the sprawling estate, many with changing exhibits, so be sure to look up the website to help plan your visit. When I visited, I was pleased to see the Chinese Woodblock Prints exhibit in the Boone gallery, especially because I ha the place to myself. The Huntington Gallery exhibits mostly western art from Europe and America.Don't forget to take a look inside the library itself. It houses many rare manuscripts, including early copies of the Gutenberg Bible and The Canterbury Tales.This is a true treasure in the greater LA area, close to Pasadena and Glendale, northeast of downtown. Be sure to block out several hours to explore this gem! There is a lot of walking (I walked 4 miles on my visit and didn't see everything), so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and be prepared if you are visiting with children.",Sophie_girl
50,Hollywood knows why it comes here,"I had always wanted to visit The Huntington (complete name: The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens), in the beautiful Pasadena area, but never got around to it until 2016. The Huntington is HUGE and actually comprises several different gardens, ranging from an Australian garden, Chinese garden, Japanese garden, desert garden, palm garden and so on. We visited in May and everything was in full bloom so it was really beautiful. If you are a movie fan, you will certainly recognize The Hungtington (and certainly its Japanese garden) even if you have never been there, as it has been featured in countless Hollywood productions (Beverly Hills Ninja, Starsky & Hutch, The Hot Chick just to name a few). The Huntington was once the private property of Henry Huntington and covers more than just trees and flowers. As you can deduct from its full name, the grounds also offer libraries and art collections. They also offer ever-changing exhibitions (unfortunately, we were just too early to catch the new exhibition on the National Park System). Time you should spend here differs on your level of interest, but you can easily spend a full day if you wish to (do at least give it a half day). You’ll pay $23 for standard admission ($25 on weekends), which is pretty affordable, considering the fact that you could spend your entire day at the park.",stijntailly
50,Paradise of privilege,"Huntington Gardens exist in a posh neighborhood, nearly extinct in most urban areas. It the vast estate of an educated oil baron. The gardens are exquisite collections and are thoroughly enjoyable, a rare gift to exist in time of extreme drought in the American Southwest. What I find discomfiting is the lushness and opulence. I have a real sense of ""don't touch....this isn't for you"" when I visit. I bring visitors and grandchildren and before the entrance fee enlarged past my budget, I visited often to saturate myself in the beauty. I was also immensely fond of The Ranch, a unique and successful approach to food and habitat production, no longer accessible.",leighlaughing

THREE art galleries full of paintings, sculpture, china, silver and furniture. The Library with 420,000 books and manuscripts including a Gutenberg Bible, a Shakespeare first folio and Audubon's Birds of America.When you're tired of walking, there's The Rose Garden Tea Room, a café in the new entrance complex, The Chinese Garden Tea House (more than tea) and a small cafeteria with patio dining.A plus for families: Lots of room to run along the garden paths, on the greens and a magical ""Children's Garden"".",Cindy A
40,More than Gardens,"The whole 120 acres were beautiful. A lot of flowers in bloom, grass green, and grounds very well kept. It is at least a half day venture to see a good portion of the site. The buildings house fine art and literature. Each building took about half hour to an hour to see the art and artifacts. Not many steps to climb, small inclines once you go down to the Australian and lily pond area. They have patrols out in carts and one gave us a ride to an area we wanted to see. Well worth the effort to see as much as possible. Call for prices, parking free.",Terry B
50,Tour and Tea as Fabulous!,"I visited the Huntington on Saturday, October 1 with two friends. The Tour and Tea was my birthday gift to them and the semi-private tour was fantastic. Juana was an incredibly knowledgeable and friendly guide. Everything was superb - the grounds, the displays, the gardens and the tea. What a memorable day!",Dawn S

50,A Day in Paradise,"The basics: friendly, knowledgeable staff; large variety of interests: art, architecture, gardens, history; cafes and gift shops; free parking; they take the North American reciprocal museum card. We spent a full 6 hours wandering through the gardens, taking detours into the museum buildings, browsing the galleries and estate. Most of our time was spent in the various gardens - cactus, jungle, Japanese, Chinese, rose, herb, and others. It was early October and numerous plants were still flowering, but the bones of the gardens are so good that the blooms were the proverbial icing. With about 120 acres you'll need some time and a water bottle (they have drinking fountains scattered about) and lots of camera batteries to soak everything in. We saw many families with kids that looked like they were having tons of fun - picnics, rolling down hills, and running from flower to flower.",jcs2470
40,Fantastic gardens,"We only visited the Chinese, Japanese and rose gardens but they were all very nice and upkept well.

50,Beautiful and Historic Gardens and Museum,"We have been to Huntington Library several times and we still enjoy these beautiful gardens and art collections. The Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden,and Rose Garden are our favorites. Also, there are many sculptures and art works to appreciate as well as historical books and documents.The first Thursday of every month is free, but you have to get advance tickets one month ahead and they are in limited supply. A few shops and a small restaurant provide a much needed break, especially if you are there on a warm day in summer. It is tucked away within an upscale residential neighborhood but well worth the visit.",MandC0218

I love the gift shop, it's loaded with local, unique gifts and books.This is a whole day adventure and shouldn't be missed!",James S
50,"Incredible gardens, art collection, and library","I've resisted visiting for decades as I had vague recollections of a hot and uncomfortable visit when I was in elementary school. My wife's desire to see the gardens finally overcame my reservations and I'm glad. This is a very large and incredibly well maintained estate with a range of landscape styles and plant varieties. The art collection is broad and deep. While it may not be as substantial a collection as the world's larger museums, I particularly enjoyed the American collection. It's a big space so be prepared to walk - if you're not able there are accommodations made for wheelchairs as well as electric carts that can help to get you around. We'll likely be back as our 4 hour visit just scratched the surface.",gosaka
50,Incredible place to visit while in the LA area,"Had always wanted to visit the Hungtington Gardens. Didn't realize what a treat it would be. So much more than a garden. Several buildings with art displays that are incredible. Slightly reminiscent of the Ringling estate in Sarasota, FL but with a definite California feel to it. There is so much to see that you should allow a whole day and then you are really brushing the surface. If you love plants, architecture, art and views, this is a must for your trip. It's amazing that the original owners had the foresight to create this estate for the public to enjoy.",Jim D

50,Amazing and Then Some,"One of my fav SoCal pastimes is to spend time wandering these grounds and visiting a variety of gardens, museums, and the old mansion house, etc. We got here only an hour before closing last Saturday, so time was at a premium and most areas were closing. We wandered wherever we could in that limited time frame, and tasted the flavors whetting our appetite for a return visit-- especially to the European gallery, Chinese and Japanese gardens. The varieties of flowers, trees and crafted gardens were amazing. The rest areas very calming, great energy.

It was simply outstanding. A marvel!",BozemanTraveler145
50,The Huntington: Wonderful Art,"I visited in April 2016, and it was just the right temperature to not get hot walking between the buildings. (The layout of the different museums involves a fair bit of walking.) The library is a must for anyone who enjoys history or books as there are several examples of extraordinary historical manuscripts. For art lovers, there are several different buildings housing different time periods of art. I didn't do any research on what famous paintings were housed at The Huntington, so I came upon a room and stopped dead in my tracks ""The Blue Boy"" was straight in front of me! Then, I turned around and there was ""Pinkie"". Lovely Gainsboroughs, and many other famous artists from the 18th century. I truly enjoyed that building the most. However, the Impressionists and other later works were really good also. There are a lot of photo opportunities in the gardens as well. The flowers are truly lovely.",okladytexas

Tons to see and every part of this place is well kept and the best gardens and artwork to view compared to others in the same area.

They have a fast grab and go snack shop on site along with a few coffee shops and other quick service cafes, all a little expensive. They do have a tearoom that is an all you can eat tea service with little finger sandwiches, fruit, olives, a few dips and a random assortment of desserts. If you have a large party or small children I would not recommend it as it is expensive, crowded and would take a long time to have children sit still.",LisaLeeArts

They are very well displayed. On Saturdays only, there is a greenhouse with cactuses too delicate for outdoor display.The Japanese Garden is peaceful. It features an authentic dry raked garden. The Chinese Garden has pavements in the Suzhou style, and water features alluding to the Summer Palace in Beijing and to the West Lake in Hangzhou. The Chinese Garden also has a cafe with a limited but delicious menu of Chinese-style food.",Oliver1646

50,Amazing gardens and art exhibits,The gardens are exceptional especially the newer Chinese garden and the beautiful Japanese garden. We really liked seeing how they have adapted to a drought tolerant environment.,BoboTravlr
50,Great place to spend the day,I started visiting with my parents in the 1950's when it was free; Many a Saturday afternoon was spend walking the lovely grounds of the Huntington Library. I remember the RED BRIDE over the Japanese Garden and ringing the Gong against the large Bell. Sweet memories.Now I visit with my Grandchildren and very good friend. Life is always Good at the Huntington Library. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Peg Seal Beach, Ca"
50,My time at The Huntington,Had a wonderful time with friends. The views and culture surrounding all the grounds was peaceful and enriching.,ndcornejo
30,"Both a Library, Art Museum and Gardens","Can spend many hours. Some of the Gardens are beautiful (Japanese and Chinese).Others affect by the drought in California. Library is formidable. While I went for the gardens, I also wanted to see some of the Special Museum Art Exhibits. They were all disappointing. Not enough to be worth going to see.There was a Chinese Musician playing in the Chinese Gardens.....very nice and relaxing. Nice respite from the heat.",Bob S
40,Beautiful and interesting,"I visited huntington gardens with my parents and my toddler. Huntington garden boasts of flora from around the world and so there is a lot to see and learn. I highly recommend visiting during winter and spring. There are some shaded paths but on a hot day, it can get pretty exhausting. Also, we decided to have lunch at the restaurant near the Chinese garden. There was a long line and it took us a long time to get food. The food was delicious though! But it may be better to either grab lunch before visiting or getting food at the entrance (which looked less busy). All in all, I hope to keep visiting.",Rumblingstrips
50,A Beautiful Summer Day in Los Angeles,A beautiful area to get away in the middle of Los Angeles. Some areas you feel you are in Europe and other areas you feel you are in Hawaii. A great place to spend a day in LA.,Runningdoctor
50,Unexpected joy,"We experienced a remarkable day at the Huntington Library. Having visited nearly 50 years ago, I knew the trip would be interesting. However, after our visit 2 days ago, I was surprised and grateful for the unexpected joy found in the Huntington's beautiful gardens, art, and shared knowledge, which have been preserved as an precious touch point for its visitors. Though we saw only a bit of what the Huntington has to offer, highlights include a morning tour, seeing cycads and the Australian Kauri tree, learning about pruning and care of roses, the herb garden, the intricate craftsmanship at the Chinese garden, the spectacular collection at the residence and imaging Henry and Arabella's life in the early 1900's. The vast collections and beauty at the library connected us to the extreme value of public contributions and the Huntingtons' passion to share their bounty with the world. Their legacy and commitment will continue to deeply touch and enlighten generations!Thank you to the foundation and its employees, and in particular, the dedicated and knowledgable volunteers!",nalby28
50,"Excellent plants, landscaping that is imaginative and well laid out","We explored the entire estate one day. The botanical gardens, the desert and had a light lunch at the Tea Room.Certainly very enjoyable and a worthwhile visit with young persons was an educational trip.",Haamid J
50,WOW! That's all I can say. WOW!,"My wife and I were fortunate to be able to visit with her cousin, who is on the staff here. We spent a few hours walking the grounds and trails through the various gardens. So, peaceful and beautiful. So well designed and cared for. What a wonderful, wonderful resource for the Los Angeles area!If you enjoy horticulture and/or arboriculture, you'll be thrilled by a tour of the grounds. There are many, many interesting specimens and the garden designs are just gorgeous. Be sure to view the Japanese, Chinese and Rose gardens. The amount of work that has gone into establishing and maintaining these beautiful displays is astounding.Once we saw the grounds, we only had a little time to view the art. We were very pleased to find works from many of the masters: Monet, Matisse, Van Gogh, Renoir. In fact, one of the Van Gogh's seemed entirely out of character for him. It was bleak wintry scene in mostly greys - not at at the usual, colorful works most people think of from Van Gogh.A highlight for us was seeing a Gutenberg Bible on exhibit - and one of James Audubon's huge books.The hours are from 10:30am to 4:30pm. That's just 6 hours. If you plan carefully, you might be able to see everything in one day. But, this place holds so much of interest, it really might take a few days of leisurely exploring to find it all. There are several options for dining - from snacks to meals - at several locations on the grounds, so you won't starve while you're feeding your mind.",sssster
50,This place is amazing.,"Beautiful gardens, well maintained and varied. The Desert garden has beautiful succulents, and scurrying squirrels and lizards, blooming cacti. Something for everyone with the Chinese garden, Australian Garden, Japanese Gardens. You will need an entire day to see everything. It's very large and extensive. Wear comfortable shoes The docents are helpful, and the tea room delicious. Our server, Ana Maria was lovely and very accommodating.",susieq6759

50,Beauty in these Gardens,"Specifically came out to see the gardens. We were able to get on the first free botanical garden tour of the day. Included with paid admission. Our guide Robert was the best! It took about an hour and a half, quite warm day, but with all the foliage, there were cool spots to enjoy the views. The Japanese Gardens was my favorite. Such beauty in the settings and the story of how it got there was amazing! Did enter European Art Building to see The Blue Boy painting by Thomas Gainsborough. Breathtaking! And to imagine all this was a ranch estate a hundred plus years ago.",TG_World_

50,Our Family Membership Allows for continually renewed appreciation for this Southern Califronia Treasure!,"Like the Borghese Villa in Rome, the Huntington Library and gardens is a treasure unto itself, and within its confines are further treasures. They frequently change art exhibits, and there is always something new to see. Recently saw the ""Van Gogh and Friends"" show, and could not take my eyes off of the pieces by Vincent on loan from the Hammer, especially his ""Hospital at Saint-Remy"" (1889).",E Dominic B
50,Let go,"Got there at 10:30am and started my excursion exploring the magnificent outdoor habitats. Soaked in the silence and solitude while I walked. Prayed and meditated. After about 3 hours I visited all the art galleries. It was nice and cool in there. I had to remind myself to slow down and take in the paintings, sculptures, furniture and decor. My mom is going to love the greenhouse when I take her! I left at 4:30pm.",Raul H
40,Nice big garden,"This place is quite big, nice, clean and well taken care of. The highlight here would be the chinese and japanese garden. The desert cactus garden also large and very interesting. It's nice to have a stroll here and enjoying the view",badwolflibrarian
50,I LOVED IT .,"The tea room even my son and husband liked it , usually they wont go near one. Its a great place to walk around and spend a day I really enjoyed the time there was a heat wave at the time of my visit so being there made it all the more worthwhile. Such history such beauty.",HULA2613
50,"Paintings yes, but books wow!","It had been many years since I last visited the Huntington Library. I recalled Pinkie and the Blue Boy from my childhood. While the main mansion and the art were attractive, the biggest draw for my college age sons was the Guttenberg Bible, the Lincoln letters and the rare texts. These are all in the main library north of the mansion.Take time to watch the 10 minute historical film about the Huntington family as it sets the stage well. The gardens hold some amazing sights as the plants are from around the world.Entry is expensive $$ so make sure your young adults bring their student IDs. Entry is also cheaper on weekdays.",Chip L
50,The tea room,"I celebrated my birthday at the tea room with my family. The food was great as well as the teas. Great service and the tea room is beautiful. Would definitely return for another celebration. Afterwards we saw the beautiful gardens, you can spend hours and hours walking the grounds. I love this place.",Sandy L
50,"Give yourself enough time for tea, gardens and museums!","Make sure you book a tea, it isn't fussy or fancy but it's a great introduction to a nice tea. Make sure you walk through all of the gardens, they are fabulous and worth the time. Lastly, make sure you have time for the museums, they have free audio guides that you can pick up when you enter to make your visit truly inspiring!",jwdemario
50,Lovely way to spend an afternoon!,One of the nicest Art collections and Gardens in So California. Blue Boy and Pinkie are the most famous paintings they display. The gardens are remarkable. They has several but the Japanese and Chinese are my favorites. There is a Tearoom there that is wonderful but not cheap. Make reservations for that. There are 2 cafes on site as well. The gift shop has items that are hard to find and very intersecting.The place is decorated with strong Arts and Craftsman style. It's quite a large place and you can spend an afternoon here and feel pretty relaxed. A lovely rose garden is here so you can stop and smell the roses while relaxing.,Mona S
50,Amazing Place,"We visited last Wednesday and took a guided walk with one of the volunteers, who was very knowledgeable and passionate about the house and gardens and shared photos and stories. The gardens are wonderful in particular the rose garden and the Japanese garden, unfortunately we didn't get time to see them all but the guided tour gave us a flavour for them all. The house is well worth a visit as the paintings are fabulous, also the furniture and other items that are displayed throughout the property.We had lunch in the café, the food selection was good and very reasonably priced.Will definitely visit when I am back in the area as so much more to see. Wonderful to have the opportunity to visit these beautiful gardens and enjoy the fantastic surroundings.",Sue C
40,Mixed: from ok to very good,"The weekend cost to enter is $25 per person. Parking is included. What is not included is a complementary bottle of cold water when the temperature is over 90 degrees.When I was standing in line, I saw a lady holding an umbrella, and wasn't sure. I later learned that because of the lack of shade on the garden trails and the main paths, she, and many others brought umbrellas for their personal shade. So, bring an umbrella if it is going to be a warm day. Also, finding a water fountain among the garden trails was impossible.At least the buildings where they display the paintings is properly temperature controlled.They do not allow any bags into the musuems and have storage lockers.If I had any influence over the administration, during the summer I would have the gardens stay open later, say till 7 or 8 pm, so visitors who are heat challenged, could visit without having the heat attack them.aOne very nice surprise was discovering that Gainsborough's The Blue Boy was hanging. I spent awhile there visiting with the painting and the surrounding portraits.",bigbasin
50,Touring the botanical gardens should be at the top of any gardener's list,"Our whole visit focused on touring the beautiful gardens at the Huntington. After waiting for a no show docent to lead a garden tour and learning the next docent had not checked in yet, we headed into the gardens using the visitor map. Exquisite is the word that comes to mind when viewing the mature gardens at the Huntington. There is a lot of walking involved to travel through the different gardens. There are accessible paths to view the gardens along with many stairways. Parking in included in the price of admission.There is an onsite cafe, serving standard lunch fare, with inside and outside table seating. Dining is also available in the Chinese garden area and at the Tea Room (reservations required) in the Rose Garden.The gift shop is large with a wide variety of inventory, including furniture pieces.The Huntington Botanical Gardens are a must for any gardener visiting the area.",shewoo
50,Fantastic......,"Spent the day...so much to do and this was my second visit and I still haven't seen it all! Took a guided walk with ""Big Ed"" which was a great move. He spent just over an hour taking us to various parts of the garden giving us historical facts, funny stories and insight into the gardens. If we hadn't taken his tour likely we would have missed the William Morris stained glass in the main house. Thank Ed....The art is breath taking, the gardens absolutely gorgeous and so different dependent on which part of the property you are wondering in. Bonus, the cafe offers a really good variety of foods, that is good quality and reasonably priced. Great value, great day!",Anna B
50,Beautiful Place to relax,"Love the Huntington Library, can walk around all day just looking at the beautiful flowers and taking pictures. A must see for those in Southern California and everyone who comes to visit",suzyq818
50,Great Experience,"It is hard to say it all in few words.. It is an amazing place for all ages.. We has the luck to see exhibition of Bangoh and Monet..(Originals)The Gardens are great and I specially liked the desert one.. We saw it last but I wish I had seen it first as it is the one with the most variety closest to watch. Definitelly a ""go again"" place.",JuanchoGalan
50,Tea shop a plus!,"Incredible gardens, special visiting art exhibits, and many special plant societies have shows here. Rare plants foer sale at their annual plant sale! Be prepared to stand in line for that one if you want first pick. Reservations recommended for the Tea Room- posh setting, but casual clothing the norm.",fiddlernan
50,Excellent place for visit,"Best place for take photo with family and friends .i always feel relax each time visit.they have koi fish there. Rose garden,Chinese garden,Japanese garden are must see. If you hungry they do have place for food and drink there .",Tuyet N
40,Remarkable Collection in a delightful place,"The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens are more than what the name suggests: expect to find here a HUGE collection of Art (from paintings to books) and Sciences (original manuscripts that are masterpieces in Sciences) and History (a elaborately decorated manuscript of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a original Gutenberg's Bible), but you will also find one of the most beautiful Japanese Gardens in the US, and more if you have time and willing to walk (Chinese Garden, Australian Garden, Desert, Rose garden and much more).I think that this amazing place has only a couple of problems: first of all, as i said, it's huge, and the risk to get lost and to don't know where you are going is high. Second, they close REALLY EARLY, too much in my opinion, that leads to some other problems, such as that you will probably enjoy the gardens in the most hot hours of the day when the sun is high (and it gets really hot there) and that you must go there early in the morning to visit with calm the whole place. I don't know why they don't leave the park open during the evening, during summer it's a perfect set for concerts, movies, theater plays and much more. 4 Star for these reasons, otherwise it's a 5-star location.",Filippo C
50,The absolute GEM of Southern California!,"This place is magical. I have been a member for over 25 years and it is the first place I take tourists that have never been to SoCal.You can wander the gardens for hours finding shady, grassy spots near waterfalls, benches hidden under spreading branches of giant trees, while constantly being amazed at the variety of plant life here. The new Chinese garden is a spectacular combination of water, giant rocks imported from China, Asian plants and a killer Chinese food restaurant to cool your heels. If you're tired of that, reserve a spot for high tea and biscuits in the tearoom and then wander out into the camellia, rose and herb gardens. For the kids, they have built the best children's garden I have seen and in the large greenhouse there are collections of insectivores, orchids and tropical plants with interactive displays.Then there's the art (some housed in the Huntington's original house and a couple of outlying galleries) and the library. The art collection is heavy on 19th century portraiture, but also includes an incredible collection of William Blake (when they display it), an American gallery and killer special shows. The library is outstanding, containing a Gutenberg bible, Audubon's ""Birds of N. America,"" Newton's ""Principia Mathematica,"" and Shakespeare Folio edition, all first editions.There simply is nothing to compare to this place in California, nor in my experience, anywhere else in the world. Go, bring your best camera and prepare to stay for many glorious hours.",Ted T
50,Beautiful Stately Library & Grounds!,"Had a wonderful time today meeting up with an dear friend from out of town at the Huntington Library & Gardens. Started off grabbing an iced coffee & snack and caught up on a nice shady patio area. Then walked a part of the beautiful gardens! The Japanese & Chinese gardens are stunning! I must go back and walk the entire property! I hear the Succulent Gardens are really something! It was an extremely hot day, so we made several stops into the many Gallery Blogs. and viewed the incredible art collection! So much to do & see! Deserves visits thru out the year as different plants are in bloom.",bbnyla
50,One of th best gardens in Southern Califonia,"Must see, if you have the time please visit the Huntington Library in San Marino, CA. Open at 10:30 am during the summer and 12:30 pm winter/fall",Alexander W
40,Need to visit again - did not know it was so HUGE,"We were clearly not prepared for a visit here. The place is huge and very spread out. It was boiling hot and we weren't wearing appropriate shoes! My advice? Wear sneakers, bring water, sunscreen and maybe a hat! Plan to spend several hours - a whole day. They have beautiful gardens - the Chinese garden was a favorite. They also have Japanese, desert, jungle, Australian, rose..... etc ! I commented a few times that while there were some signs, we always came to a fork with no sign and just wandered to the next thing - someone could actually get lost I think! There is Chinese food that you can eat in a Chinese pavillion - will do this next time now that we know it's there. They have a tea room with buffet style food - nothing looked great and there were a million noisy kids - I'm not against kids but it wasn't very relaxing so we didn't eat there either- they have a cafe with sandwiches, pizza and some grill offerings and a coffee and ice cream shop too. I say all this because you may want to pack a snack if the offerings don't suit you. There is much to see inside too ( where there is fabulous air conditioning !!!) art, tapestries, original documents, an astronomy area, medicine area, land geography, silver and so on. The buildings are very ornate and it reminded me a lot of Europe. If it wasn't $23 to enter I would say to break up the visit into 2 days. I also saw many young and very bored kids. Truly, I think teens and up can hang with all the walking and would find more of it interesting. It's lovely and interesting but do come prepared :)",RandRCalifornia
40,Something for both art and garden lovers,"This is a place to linger for a slow day. It is not a huge museum. Rather they have a nice, albeit smaller collection of largely English portrait paintings. That it is surrounded by acres of beautiful gardens is what makes this place special. I recommend that you tour the grounds first before it gets too hot (which it frequently does in Pasadena between May and October). Then have a refreshment or lunch in their very nice patio restaurant adjoining the front entrance. Then go to one of the two museums on the grounds. The American gallery and library is in one building while the English collection is in another. Each of these buildings could easily take a couple of hours if you enjoy spending time in museums. There are not many child friendly activities and I would not encourage bringing toddlers or small children. There is a very large and well stocked book/gift store which carries items infrequently encountered in other stores. Very large selection of books for both children and adults.",Dorothy C
50,Spend the whole day,"This is a terrific place to spend the day. There is much more here than most people can possible see in a single visit. The gardens are spectacular. The desert garden is particularly impressive, with plants from desert regions all over the world. Also amazing is the Chinese garden, beautifully designed and refreshing. It just keeps getting bigger, as even more areas are planned and under construction. The Japanese Garden and Rose Garden are wonderful, too. If you have time, there are many other large and small gardens, including a steamy conservatory with rain forest plants.In addition to the gardens, there are some very interesting art galleries (nicely air conditioned for a break from the summer heat in the gardens) and a library exhibition hall that often houses science exhibits.I recommend arriving early, to get a good parking spot (no charge for parking) and to have plenty of time to wander around (opening time varies seasonally, and they close at 4:30, not open on Tuesdays). Tickets for adults are $23/25 (higher on weekends), for seniors ($19/21) and for youth (4-11) $10. They are free on the first Thursday of the month, but you must reserve and advance ticket for that day. There is a coffee shop and a couple of cafes, where the food and drink are, of course, overpriced.",Rosemary W
40,Great Gardens,"Extensive cultivated gardens in various styles (jungle, desert, Australian, Chinese, Japanese) and some limited 18th century art (mainly) good for most of a whole day's exploration. The printed guide maps need clarifying (more than one person holding a map asked me for directions, and I couldn't help) and the signage needs improving generally. The café has a wide and affordable self service menu and a huge dining room. Despite the $25 entrance fee (no idea why the organization needs to make money) the place was packed.",Crabbus
50,Gem in the heart of the city,"This is a real gem in Pasadena, a must visit! It feels like another world far away! Too much to see with variety of plants, beautiful landscape, our favorite is the rose garden, Chinese and Japanese garden and of course the tea room and visiting the Canterbury Tale!",Sugaylange
50,Best of Pasadena,"Beautiful gardens (especially the Japanese, Chinese, and Rose gardens), impressive collection of historic books and documents, good art collection, very interesting mansion built by an early 20th century railroad magnate and his wife--both avid collectors--a very good, but pricey tea room, and excellent shop, and more.",Michael G
40,Beautiful Gardens,A place for garden lovers You can easily spend a day or more at these amazing gardens So much variety and such history with the gardens being 100 years old Don't miss the Japanese and Chinese areas but its the age and size of the cactus in the Arid garden that are awe inspiring Then if the gardens are not enough you can head indoors to look at the library and the art collections There is a well stocked gift shop and a few cafes to have a snack or lunch Could have spent more than the one full day here,Bazzioni
50,Fabulous Place,"What a great place to spend a weekend afternoon. This 120 acre enclave has beautiful gardens and wonderful collections of art. We particularly like the rose garden, the Japanese garden, and the original Huntington mansion with all of its artwork. The Botanical garden building was very cool as well. American Art building was a bit less than expected, except for the Frank LLoyd Wright furniture, as anything of his is great to view. We spent 3 hrs wandering and didn't see it all. Parking was a breeze, btw.",Dale G
40,A stroll through the park.,"I have been wanting to come here for so long. The place is absolutely beautiful. There are different areas to visit. There's the desert area, rose garden, bonsai section, Japanese section..so many things to see! If you want to stroll around you are able to spend a day here. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes, bring some water and snacks. Parking is free, but admission is quit pricey. The gift shop sells things that are nice to look at, but really no use for.",kisssmee
50,For all Gardeners and Garden lovers!,"What a wonderful place to visit to view various designed gardens representing various global locations. Desert, Australian, Palm, Japanese, European, Chinese. Even family who offered this venue on a recent vacation to CA and are not gardeners thoroughly enjoyed the gardens. Having lived in Europe I did pass on the Museums with the exception of seeing Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough. Options for food breaks, lunch etc are located throughout the site. Prices reasonable and food in the Café quite good. Truly enjoyed the day here.",BeeJL56
50,Wonderful place to spend the day in Southern California,"There is so much beauty and history packed into this gorgeous spot tucked away in stately San Marino. Where to start? The gardens are exceptional. There are a variety of gardens from the newer and serene Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden, the Dessert Garden and and the Rose Garden. Each is beautifully maintained and features plants that are rare in this part of the world. The museums are also a must -- paintings including old masterpieces (the famous Blue Boy and Pinkie reside at the Huntington), European and Early American furniture, rare books and manuscripts. Several nice restaurants to choose from including afternoon tea (plan ahead and make a reservation otherwise you probably won't get in) and Chinese food located in the beautiful Chinese Garden. The gift shop was relocated to a much larger space when the front entrance area was renovated a few years ago and has some really beautiful items. Don't want to forget to mention the gorgeous water wise landscape that was installed during the renovation as well! So worth your day! Then have dinner in trendy Pasadena afterward!",Pingpong1229
50,Great opportunity,I visited this beautiful park with a friend. We took a portion of the tour which was spectacular. We learned a lot about the plants and the history of their modest beginnings. We had lunch at the Rose Garden restaurant. The food was amazing. My favorite was the scones with clotted cream. Afterwards we walked through the other sections of the park. The Chinese garden was similar to the summer palace in China. It brought back memories of our previous trip. I highly recommend this destination place if you like to stroll around gardens and enjoy the scenery.,Sue D
50,Great quiet place,Take time to walk slowly and absorb all the exhibits. Nice t become a member of th society The supervisors at each entrance are very knowledgeable,desparatehousewife07
50,World-class gardens,"I've visited at least 60 or 70 botanical gardens on six of the seven continents in my life and this complex of gardens certainly ranks in the top 10 for quality, quantity and variety. I was especially taken with the Asian garden, but their flower and desert gardens were almost equally impressive. Take your time and try to devote a full day, if at all possible.",Jeffrey D
50,Worth A visit,"Plan to spend the day or more if you can. You cannot see it all, and do it justice all in one dayThe Hunting Library and Art Collections are very impressive and well thought out. The exhibits are all worth seeing, much to read and look at. The gardens are beautiful, many different sections to visit. If I lived in the area I would buy a membership and visit often. You could spend a week here and not experience everything. The gardens are quite large with quite a bit of walking. If visiting in the summer sun screen and hats are a must. Good walking shoes always. We were able to purchase healthy foods in the food areas, which is a plus. The gift shop was delightful.",Chellye E
50,Beautiful Gardens,"The Huntington Botanical Gardens are beautiful iconic gardens that are a work of art. It is laid out with featured gardens like the Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden & one of the most incredible desert gardens. The Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden had specialty places to eat & the food was good. It is busy on weekends & I recommend a membership as you can't see everything once. It is totally worth it. A peaceful, inspiring visit. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking & it does take an entire day. Bring sunscreen. There is also an art museum collection here. It is truly a place for cultural enthusiast. Totally recommend this place.",Akiko A
50,Impressive !,"This is one BIG and IMPRESSIVE place! It takes a full day (or more !) to explore everything here. The collection of European Art is excellent, and the American Art collection is also notable. Periodic Special Exhibits are worthwhile visiting. Many important and historical documents, manuscripts and art works are contained here. The many different gardens throughout the facility are stunning. It is rare to find an estate so large, with so much land, in the Los Angeles area. Definitely a relaxing ""oasis"" in a major metropolitan area.",TheBrasilian
40,Don't miss the gift shop and the Chinese Garden!,"I have never visited a large botanical garden so I have little basis of comparison, but let me offer my views of what I believe are worth the trip.First of all please reserve a cooler day to visit the gardens. And this attraction could be tiring for someone elderly or with a health concern... There is quite a bit of walking involved. If you add extreme heat, it could pose an issue.That said, the Chinese garden was a must see. Gorgeous setting with a fantasy like feel complete with pagodas and bridges. You are transported to another time and place. The Japanese garden too is beautiful, but I don't feel as memorable. Lastly. Don't skip the gift shop...one of the best I have ever visited. Even my husband who hates shopping enjoyed it!",Stathy W
50,LOVELY ART AND GARDENS,"Quite unique to have art gallery and beautiful gardens in one area. Went end of May-only $15-spent nice afternoon there. The 79 bus from downtown goes there about 45 min journey-its just off the Sierra Madre Boulevard crossroads along Huntingdon Drive-Starbucks close by just turn off Oxford Rd. They have nice restaurant with good selection and value plus other food places dotted in gardens. The art and old manuscripts are superb and the wonderful gardens with statues, cactus and roses and japanese gardens all around make this a truly place to visit in Pasadena. Noon to 4.30 mid week except Tues longer at weekends.Nice place to get away from LA bustle.",SIMON R

50,Beautiful gardens and art collections,"The Huntington Library is amazing. You'd need to set aside 3-4 hours to explore the grounds. I also suggest visiting during different times of the year since different plants and trees will be in bloom. The art collections are also a pleasure to experience. My favorite area is the Japanese and Chinese gardens. I suggest that you bring a hat, comfy walking shoes, and a bottle of water",chickabeegrrl
50,Definitely worth a visit.,"I spent a few hours here one afternoon killing time waiting to pick up my daughter nearby. It was extremely hot so next time I would come earlier in the day and also spend more time. I didn't get to see everything before I needed to leave but the rare books collection is outstanding as are the Chinese, Japanese and rose gardens. The gift shop is excellent. Definitely worth a visit.",SCheng46855
50,Stunning,"My first time here and wow completely beautiful. I went on a very hot day but didn't matter, lots of places to stop of and have a drink and relax in the beautiful scenic setting. I would highly recommend anyone visiting here, wear comfortable foot wear as a lot of walking involved",Chickaboo01
50,Go as early as possible!,"Go as early as possible and spend the day ambling through this sublime collection of fauna, art and more.Great for kids too with an inspiring experimental & education centre as well as an interactive play space for those 10 & under.Examples of Chinese and Japanese gardens, rose garden, desert, tropics etc. Really well worthwhile.Grab a bottle of water, a complimentary map and head out in a direction of your choice. Wonderful.",KaarinH
50,One Day is not Enough!,"Get there early as possible in the day to fit in the most you can. One could spend the large part of a day just roaming around the extensive botanical gardens, but there are also the European Gallery containing incredible artwork and antiques, and the library itself containing rare books and manuscripts. There is also a visitor center and botanical center, and guided tours are available. Don't miss the masterpieces in the Gallery: Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Sir Thomas Lawrence's Pinkie. All in all, a very pleasant and educational experience, but to get the most of it you need to plan ahead and strategize your time.",philbyco
50,Wonderful way to spend a day,"I took my mom-in-law for a girls day even though it was almost 100 degrees. As we arrived, I asked if she wanted to get a membership as the value is great if 2 people plan to go at least 2 times in one year. I figured it would give us a good reason to get out for girl time through out the year. Once I put it that way, she said yes. As we signed up, we found out that members night was the same day, so we made quick plans to run to Trader Joe's for food and wine for the live music event. In the mean time, we ran into the gift shop (20%off for the level of membership we bought) and found lots of adorable items, but didn't buy as we needed to get to our tea room reservation. It was a beautiful walk to the tea house and shaded a good portion of the way. Luckily we chose the later afternoon for tea, so it wasn't crowded and we weren't rushed out. We enjoyed iced and hot tea, salads, sandwiches, fruit, cheese, and desserts. We had a delightful server named Joanna. We spent almost 2.5 hours eating, drinking, and chatting. The library/garden is cleared out at 5pm with readmission after 5:30 for the members night. We took that time to pick up our wine and picnic food. Families arrived with blankets, chairs, and coolers for an hour of live music. The sun set behind the trees and temperature was just perfect as the evening faded. We're glad we got the membership as we never got to any of the gardens or museums. It really is a great place to spend a day. They do have a free day one Thursday a month. You need to try to get tickets on the first of the previous month.",chinadoll418

The exquisite hand lettering of the Canterbury tales looks very similar to the beautiful printing of the Bible. Both are illuminated with beautiful colored and intricate drawings. I had no idea that these two works were contemporaneous.Don't miss the Gainsborough gallery, either.",JandJ67
50,museum tour,"This was our 3rd or 4th trip, and it was truly hot. So, we spent more time in the art museums and visited the library exhibit area. The newly reopened American Art collection is quite impressive; but the guards were zealously watchful, looming large and making sure everyone knew they were being followed from gallery to gallery. My prior experience with art museum guards is they are a bit less noticeable.",tlb91
50,Inspiration at every turn. . .,"The Huntington Library and Art Collection is world renown for Gainsborough's Blue Boy and the Sir Thomas Lawrence portrait of ""Pinkie"", but the extensive grounds surrounding the various exhibit halls and library are breathtaking. It's more than the botanical specimens and beautiful roses, it's the superb landscape design: the layers of trees and shrubs, the textures, colors, and fragrance and the way it all integrates with the architecture and sculpture. Strolling through the gardens, each view is a work of art in itself! The new entrance highlights the uncommon beauty of xeriscape with flowing grasses integrated with Mediterranean, Australian, and local native plants. Both the Japanese and Chinese Gardens capture the seamless blend of nature to architecture, and the cactus garden here is a favorite. Come stroll the herb and fragrance gardens to take in a myriad of busy pollinators and lovely butterflies. This is a photographer's paradise and a delight to the senses! Set aside a day and come for tea and the amazing gift shop too!",Cattylea

You can spend too much time in one place and short yourself time in another The Library is home to one of the greatest collections of rare books and manuscripts and the Dibner Hall of History and Science held our interest. The Huntington Art Gallery's collection is significant but save some time for the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art.The botanical gardens cover over 120 acres and include a desert garden, a children's garden and rose and herb gardens. Don't miss the Chinese Garden with its lake, stone bridges, a stone grotto, a tea house and pavilions and the Japanese Garden featuring bonsai trees.",Cabchidester
50,Be ready to stroll for hours.,"What a glorious day out! The magnificent gardens are well planned and maintained. My husband was impressed with the desert garden but my favorite was the jungle. The rose garden was in full bloom. The Huntington mansion and amazing library reveal the history of the family and its bygone era of lavish living as well as renowned, museum-quality exhibits. However, it is so much fun to rest in a wicker chair on the mansion's loggia and imagine being a resident way back when. The art collection is wonderful. I could have stayed another hour strolling through those rooms. We stopped for lemonade at the Rose Garden Patio. Take extra money for the gift shop - irresistible items for sale. Take a water bottle for the long walks, too. The tickets aren't cheap but I read that they offer ""free days"" once a month. What a place!",Sharon M

More than just lovely, they tell stories. The Rose Garden is a living history of 2,000 years of cultivating these glorious plants, the symbol of nearby Pasadena's annual Rose Parade. At the Japanese garden you often find living celebrations of Japanese life and culture.A place unlike any other, food for the mind and the soul.",Ernie S

We were fortunate to visit when the rose garden was in full bloom. Thousands of roses, every color and type; The Japanese Garden was the biggest surprise. I didn't expect this. Every detail well thought out. There are art galleries on site - we didn't have time to visit them; there is also a cafe on site. Will definitely return to see the rest.",Ann W

50,Wonderful experience,"The Huntington is a marvellous way to spend the day, with the vast gardens and all the cultural collections. There's a Gutenberg Bible, a Shakespeare first folio and quarto, the famous Blue Boy and Pinky, and several rooms of scientific equipment and texts. The presentation is more informative and imaginative, in my opinion, than the Getty. There are many casual places to sit, relax, have a snack or meal in beautifully landscaped settings. And one thing to add, the gift shop is the best I've ever seen anywhere (even compared to European venues) with all kinds of replicas and original works, especially of arts and crafts styles. I wish had had more money and more time for the shop.",SeattleTravelChik

You won't recognize the entry, as they've added new buildings including a cafe and a wonderful gift shop and hundreds of beautiful water-wise plants. If you're thinking of changing your Southern Californian landscaping to native plantings, you'll see the huge variety of beautiful plants that are available to use in your design.

50,Eclectic collection displayed on a great site,"The Huntington had several great collections to see. First, the British portrait gallery is a must see. The pieces are significant and impressively displayed within a historically significant mansion. The historical manuscripts exhibit was probably the jewel of the place; significant documents are well displayed and explained by helpful docents. The scientific document exhibit next door, especially the astronomy section, had tremendous depth and was very engaging.In comparison, the American art collection was not really to my taste and did not make much impression on me. Also, the rose garden was a big disappointment. It was small and had already finished its first flush of blooms, but since the plants had not been deadheaded there were few fresh roses to see. This garden needs a lot more work to show it at its best.",Dave J

The gardens are beautifully designed and incredibly large. Every garden is so unique and meticulously maintained. I feel inspired every time I visit. Sometimes I come just to shop for unique gifts at their wonderful gift shop.The only thing I don't like here is the cafeteria restaurant. The room and patio are beautiful, but the food is boring and overpriced. It wouldn't take much to upgrade that. I went there once with my friend who is gluten free and I'm a vegetarian, and we both were not inspired by their lack of fresh food and creativity- especially in comparison to the rest of the gardens. I just choose to never eat when visiting.",sjkel

We spent most of our time in Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden, which was in “incomplete” stage. Saw two wedding couples taking all kind of shots on themselves (shot by professionals, of course).

His enthusiasm for the gardens, and intimate knowledge of all the plants and the history of the property itself made our two hours with him fly by. The smells, colors and beauty of the various areas was lovely.We were able to tour the Huntington Library after and see the two most famous paintings Blue Boy and Pinkie.

We only had enough time left to see some of the American collection (Eakins, Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, etc.).If we ever have a chance to go again, we'd allow more time and break up the visit with a little time in the pleasant outdoor cafe area or in the tea house in the Chinese gardens.",ABroad1

50,Japanese and Chinese Garden areas are breaththaking.,"The Huntington is the most beautiful botanical garden we have encountered. Within the Japanese and Chinese garden areas you regularly encounter unexpected little nooks or structures that encourage time to stop and drink in the feel. The desert garden was amazing. While the docent was very knowledgeable , he moved a little slowly which meant not getting the highlights that we would liked to have started with. The art collection is small but interesting. My only suggestion is that the grounds are so extensive that more signs would be helpful to navigate around the multiple areas.",djstoll808

We were most recently there on Mother's Day, so it was a bit overcrowded but no less beautiful. In the era of cellphones it is hard to avoid a selfie-taker every few paces, but on weekdays I think it would be much calmer. It would be helpful to know that there is a cafe, a tea room, and now a Chinese restaurant. You're not technically allowed to bring food in (though we saw people picnicking).",HongKongSojourner
50,This place is stunning!,"The gardens at the Huntington are absolutely stunning, they are huge too, you can walk around for hours. There are meandering paths and places you can just roll around on the grass. It is a welcome retreat from the normally brown Southern Californian landscape. One admission price gets you into the gardens, the art galleries and public areas of the library. The library is one of the few places on Earth on can go in and see a Shakespeare First Folio on any given day. Really amazing stuff here from illuminated mediaeval manuscripts to rare books and photos on California. The Blue Boy is the highlight of the art collection, not my favorite style but an impressive work for sure. The art museum and library can be viewed in a fairly short amount of time but if you like walking through gardens then leave yourself at least a few hours to do so. Don't miss the Chinese and Japanese gardens... just breath-taking.",StevefromExeter

I think it would take a few days to see everything. I rushed through in 2 hours one day, then went back the next day for 3 more hours. I ended up becoming a member and I am sure to go back.The saddest and strangest things was seeing people litter in the gardens. Three separate occasions I watched people discard their candy wrappers and napkins under the bench they were sitting in ... what's wrong with those people? There's no eating in the gardens! The Huntington staff was there to pick up two small piles, I picked up some wrappers. The other bizarre thing was watching the adult geese with their baby geese flock. You have to see it to believe it. The Huntington assigns a guard to the flock! The people harass the birds! I saw two flocks shadowed by two guards ... just to keep the people away from the birds! Unbelievable. Very strange behavior on the part of some people. Wake up people, The Huntington is a mini Versailles!Must see all the garden areas. Chinese and Japanese areas are awesome. Also the new book, ""Blue Boy & Co"" is top shelf, filled with high level research and a must have for $39.",Smith & Jones

They have several museums dedicated to astro worship and the Huntington's, we take away from it whatever is Godly. The tea house is also a great place when it is NOT packed which is rarely.

50,It is the totality,"What's great about this place is the sum of its parts. The museums are good, although I missed one or two. I particularly liked the library, with the Shakespeare Folio, an early copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Gutenberg Bible among other treasures on display. We only saw a portion of the grounds, but they were lovely and impressive, particularly the Japanese Garden. The view of the surrounding countryside is also smashing. I wish we had allocated more time. We bought an annual membership despite the fact we live across the country. We went a second day, but both visits totaled maybe six hours, far too little it turns out. We hope to get back before our membership expires. If you go, I recommend a full day, from the moment it opens to the moment it closes. You will need it.By the way, the cafe was quite good and the gift shop was very large and among the best I have seen. I also like the fact that they lockers and extraordinarily clean and well-maintained rest rooms. In fact, the whole site is simply spotless and near perfect condition. Like I said in the title, it's the totality of the experience that is the key to just how great this place. I had planned to visit here for maybe fifteen years over maybe 10 trips and was glad to finally make it there. I only wish I had taken my son on one of our six trips to California.

The Shakespear garden is also very nice place to take pictures.I went to the European Art and its astonish how bit this house is. There is art but there is also old european decoration, think Pride and Prejudice.I recommend bringing water or stopping by Starbucks (or your favorite drink)before heading here it will make the walk much more enjoyable.

It is a great place for nature photographers to immerse themselves in the various gardens and be surrounded with the beautiful masses of flowers. The rose gardens alone fill the air with sweet aromatics. Always a wonderful day trip.There is a tea house which requires reservations and serves yummy tea - various flavors for different tastes. There is also a cafe in the Chines garden. There is a garden for the youngsters but enjoyable enough for the parents. The greenhouse garden is neat. It has all the orchids which are amazing.,b4sence2000
50,Huntington Library and Gardens - Something for Everyone,"Huntington Library and Gardens has a large collection of books, exhibits and art to enjoy. All this is surrounded by acres and acres of gardens. You can enjoy the desert collection, rose garden, perennial, children's garden, tropical conservatory, as well as the highly acclaimed Japanese and Chinese gardens - authentic in detail.When you get hungry there are several choices; a cafe with light refreshments, a new spacious food court and coffee/wine bar with an outdoor terrace, a tea room - (reservations a good idea) and Chinese food in the Chinese garden. All this and a fabulous gift shop.I go here a lot and advise you to allow several hours, bring a hat, sunscreen and relax. You'll love it!",thelonliestmonk
50,I wish I could give it 6 stars,"The grounds are lovely and extensive, the paths generous so even when the gardens are crowded you're not overwhelmed. Gorgeous landscaping, a mix of gardening and water feature styles, Japanese and Chinese garden area, mixed terrain with open expanses. Fascinating buildings mixed in which are interesting architecturally and filled with a surprising amount of really quality art and sculpture. The Huntington's home is a wonder of interesting 'over the top' features inside. Great to be able to wander in and out of doors to escape the heat. Admission fee of $25 is a very good value.",Denise V
50,Newly renovated grounds,"The newly expanded site includes beautiful additions, like the Chinese garden behind the Japanese garden. The main house has a great art collection, including Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy"". The library requires at least 30 minutes of your time to peruse the literary artifacts. Enjoy afternoon tea with fresh scones in the tea room,and excellent service.",Spike875

50,Gardens are Spectacular!,"A great place to spend an afternoon. The gardens are lovely, wonderful library and former Huntington mansion to tour. The Japanese and Chinese gardens are world class and truly do represent gardens from their native countries.I always take out of town visitors there. A place not to be missed when you're visiting Pasadena. Good for children,too.",K_OKane
40,Awesome Gardens!,"Fantastically awesome! Great gardens, fantastic art. Loved the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Great food at the Chinese restaurant.",toni861
50,Unbelievably beautiful,We drove four hours just to spend a day here. Such a beautiful place words really don't do it justice. I made the mistake again this year by not packing snacks or water. This is a must if you plan to spend a few hours in the gardens. They have a couple restaurants but take food/water anyway. And make sure you take a camera! Oh... I always bring a small parasol to keep the sun off.,SVinLV
40,Great place to visit but expensive,"This is a beautiful and enormous botanical garden. A really lovely respite from the busy city. Know going in though, this is expensive. My husband and I bought student tickets with our college IDs and those were $19 a piece. Regular adult tickets are $23 a person. So plan on spending several hours here to get your money's worth. The botanical garden is split into several sections: Chinese garden, Japanese garden, rose garden, herb garden, Australian garden, lily ponds, desert, palm tree garden, and there are several art museums and indoor tropical garden areas. The Chinese and the Japanese gardens were my favorite. So peaceful and tranquil. Small ponds filled with koi and manicured bonsai trees and replicas of temples are in these areas. There is a tea house there as well but it was very packed so I recommend making reservations if you'd like to stop there. The Rose garden was in full bloom and was so beautiful! All the different types of roses and smells really awakened the senses. The Australian garden was like being in the outback. The desert area had a great variety of cacti. The palm tree garden had so many varieties of palms! I didn't even know there were that many. There are great explanatory exhibits for kids that are hands on and engaging. Lots of bathrooms throughout the place. Bring your water and your sunscreen when you come!!!",Jvalliant
50,"Something for everyone - gardens, science displays, art work, kids playground, Chinese and Japanese gardens & food","One of the most comprehensive library/gardens around--would recommend for everyone -- a large area so there is a bit of walking-but sidewalks and signage is good, the people that work there are helpful and can answer questions and give directions. The food is good there. if you want tea at the tea house - probably best to make a reservation ahead of time. Chinese food outdoors in the Chinese garden, even the regular eating area is good. Been coming here since I was a child with my parents and now I bring my kids. There is an admission, but something u should try at least once. They also have memberships so you can spread the cost over a year--you really can't see everything extensively in a day -- it should take you at a minimum 3 visits to cover everything properly.",A M
40,Was worth the trip,"Travelled from Palm Desert, California to Pasadena for this wonderful day trip. There was so much to see that we were not able to do it all. Go early and take in as much as you can. The Rose Garden was amazing.",Lienfin
50,Springtime at Huntington Gardens,"Spent the better part of the day touring the grounds of the Huntington Library and Gardens. Had a docent lead tour with some friends the early part of the day in the Chinese Garden. Our docent had be giving tours for over 20 years and was very knowledgeable of every aspect of the Library and Gardens. There are a dozen or more dedicated gardens, all impressive. I'm not a big fan of roses, however the Rose Garden was extremely impressive. Drinking fountains and rest rooms were available throughout the gardens. They also have three different places to eat. I had lunch at the cafe in the visitor center where there are stations for sandwiches, pasta, pizza and salads plus a variety of drinks-including wine. My sandwich was made to order with fresh ingredients which came with house made potato chips or mixed fruit. Everything was fresh and reasonably priced. This cafeteria style cafe is air conditioned and has both inside tables or outside table looking over the gardens. The atmosphere is casual as the most comfortable guests wore shorts, tennis shoes and hats as the day was warm. They have a website for hours and admission prices. POn site parking was free.",sandy1954
50,Worth for your time,"If you feel boring at home, this place is worth to visit. It will take about 4 hours to see all.Nice and relaxing place to go for a half day.",Winnie F
20,"Nice gardens, messy management","Now this is a mixed bag. Granted, the area is beautiful and the gardens are quite remarkable, especially if you know where to go and the guided tours may add to the experience.However, I was really bummed with how they mismanaged the special event. We went for the Shakespeare day and namely the LA Opera show. We tried to arrive early, yet by the time we got to park the car (parking lot was full, however attendants kept directing us go in circles for over half an hour!) and got back into the premises, got the tickets and went through unmarked paths (as directed by another attendant) we were right on time to see the artists pack up and leave.It gets quite hot during the day you'll be looking for shade or air conditioned areas. And those are a few, however while the library has some really interesting peaces and some remarkable background history, the art collection is mostly quite mediocre.By the time it gets cool enough to walk and enjoy outside - guess what - they close at 4:30. Seriously!? In summary, the cost of admission and all the hassle really kills it.First time an definitely a disappointment. Don't think we will be back and would have certainly not gone had I known this would be the case beforehand - just a heads up.So unfortunate - as the park is beautiful.",Jonas C
50,Do you want to see a cop guarding a tree? Here is your chance!,This is an amazing place. I always send my friends who visit and they come back saying that it is an amazing place. You can visit 5 days in a row and still produce wow material for your Facebook. Once I went to the Zen garden and saw a policeman guarding a tiny 10 inch bonsai tree. He explained that the tree was has just won some world bonsai championship and is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The number of spectacular plants is amazing! Most of the people go to the gardens but do go to the library. Excellent exhibits of 500 year old maps. You can see the map that Columbus used to take his boat ride. Being Polish I was tickled seeing the manuscript from 1577 of Copernicus's breakthrough work. The gardens and the library are in top 5 of LA attractions!,Art C
50,Great day at the Garden,"Botanical garden is amazing - I could spend a few days exploring all the sections. The art galleries are great as well - hard to see them all in one afternoon - and the library...well, too bad the books are under glass but what a great collection.",kateskitchen2016
50,The best in La county,"I usually do not like tourist attractions around la county but this one is exceptional. Numerous species of plants can be seen. Also, there are a lot of activities that you can participate. Their explanations of ecology and plant biology are wonderful. Also, do not miss the library itself. It has so many precious collections all around the world. Art galleries are worth to visit too.",minimize940314
50,Fabulous gardens & exhibits,"Huntington Gardens exceeded my expectations for a botanical tour. The range of flowers and gardens -- such as the Japanese Garden, and the Rose Garden -- is exceptional. The knowledgeable and engaging docents make the walk around the extensive property enjoyable, and the Library exhibit is fascinating. The Gutenberg Bible is a highlight, along with the Book of Hours. The art collection in the mansion -- including Blue Boy and Pinkie -- is superb. A memorable afternoon well spent exploring this atraction. Highly recommended.",Sandy G

30,Sadly much was closed for construction and it was HOT!,"What were onsite was wonderful. Sadly the American collection was very sparse, having been moved during construction for repairs. The gift shop is a wonder, the grounds were beautiful but unfortunately even with an umbrella and air conditioned buildings it was almost unbearable hot. We would recommend a winter, spring or fall visit.",Carole K
50,One of the best botanical gardens,"We spent the entire afternoon walking and having lunch at the cafe. Beautiful gardens, well maintained flower gardens. If you are into history the library is full of interesting information 😊 if you can make a reservation, the tearoom is also really nice😊it's a great day to spend with family and friends😊🌺🌸",Faranak M
50,Never enough time!,"Be sure you schedule a full day to walk the gardens and all the exhibits...and that probably still won't be enough time. Lovely gardens, wonderful historical grounds and buildings, remarkable fine artwork.",jaguarford
50,WE ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY,"On a Sunday afternoon it was moderately crowded. The flowers and gardens are well worth seeing. We liked the Chinese granite boat, waterfalls, etc. We had a bit of rain earlier so it took a small toll on the roses. A guide said the first bloom of the season is the strongest. They prune periodically during the growing season to make them re-bloom but clearly Spring is the best time to see the roses. The various types and variety of rose and the year created is clearly labeled. If you are from the north, the Palm Garden will be of interest. There is a glass conservatory that houses many orchids. Be prepared to walk a bit and spend 3-5 hours especially if you wish to view the paintings as well as the gardens. We did not eat there, but did pay the $21 senior admission. Overall terrific!",flyboy1320
40,"Beautiful Botanical Gardens - Incredible, Colorful Flowers","Although the Library is interesting it was not really special. However, the Gardens made the visit totally worth the trip. Rose Garden and the Japanese Garden were really outstanding. Roses had unique colors and hybrids. Throughout the Gardens, one can find really unique flowering plants.",Gasper M
50,Favorite Place on Earth so far,"If you were fabulously wealthy what would you spend you money on after you were gone. The gardens are from all over the world and the perfect climate of Pasadena means they are able to survive. There is delicious food and cafes all around the gardens and there are museums. The library collections contain original Shakespeare manuscripts, a Guttenberg and amazing American historical documents. I go here every time I am in town.",ntraveler19

Rose gardens, Japanese gardens, Chinese gardens etc. etc. just unbelievably beautiful. Very nice support facilities with nice cafe, good food, etc. Great art but we liked the American collections the best. Don't miss visiting this Pasadena museum.",Tee-Bone-Tee
50,"Oooh, aahhh","A fellow wedding guest recommended this site to us. Arrived at 3 on a Sunday, knowing that it closed at 4:30. Admission is $25, so be prepared--the price is a drop compared to the value of the exhibits. The admission staff recommended the Chinese Gardens for the length of our visit. We took a leisurely visit there, and to the Japanese Gardens, intending to include the conservatory as well, oohing and aahing all the way through. Plenty to delight the eye, and oh the initial fragrance walk! And these few acres was just part of the gardens. The next time we come to Pasadena, we know where to go on our own. To be sure, there were some crying babies and small children, but most of the families were well-behaved, and the conservatory is full of interactive exhibits that children could easily spend an entire half day in.",Magdalena H
50,"Tranquility, art and tea","As a local, I’ve had a membership to this beautiful location for many years. Whether you want to wander through 300 acres of beautiful gardens — from the austere beauty of the desert garden to the lush foliage of the Japanese garden — enjoy fine art in the galleries, shop for handcrafted jewelry and fun knick knacks in the gift shop, gawk at rare books (including one of Shakespeare's first folios and a Gutenberg Bible), explore the “beautiful Science” exhibition in the library, let your children romp through the children’s garden, tour the rain forest in the conservatory, or have tea in the beautiful teahouse by the rose garden, there’s something here for everyone.A couple of tips: my favorite garden is the Chinese, the most recent addition. There’s a great little counter-service tea and snacks shop in this garden. If you want to have the more formal tea, make a reservation at least a week in advance. The Chinese garden is a wonderful place to sit and sip tea as you watch the koi swim by. Another great place to sit and think is by the lily ponds, which are at the bottom of the hill between the desert and subtropical gardens.If you’re interested in rare plants and very lucky, you might be visiting one of the years when the corpse flower is in bloom — it’s only bloomed five times (the last in 2014) and always brings long lines.Truly, this is one place you may want to explore over a couple of days, especially if you plan to go through all of the art galleries and the rare book collections. But even if museums aren’t your thing, the gardens alone are worth a visit. Come when the Huntington opens and get a map so you have time to walk through and see all 12 gardens, with over 15,000 plant varieties.This is one of my very favorite places in the world.",Kristin T
40,Alice Would Like This Garden,"I felt like I was in Wonderland and that either the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar or Alice herself would come sauntering by.Once we paid our admission, we were left to wander through the grounds without direction or signs to guide us. First up, was an eclectic cactus garden with tropical plants thrown in for good measure as well as arty looking beings among the cactus. Slowly we made our way to the Japanese section with a Koi fish pond, a tea garden structure and bonsai plants on display.We had an okay cafeteria style lunch (with only one vegetarian option) in the Japanese Garden area, near the Koi pond and Japanese Pagoda.Wandering down a small path we wandered into another Japanese area, climbed a hill and fond ourselves by a horticulture center. Inside were an array of irises and humidity controlled plants. And on the other side of it was a children's garden with short entrances, little areas to explore and plant sculptures to enjoy.It was a toss up which way back to the parking lot after 4 hours of a wonderful exploration.There appeared to be an outside/inside area by the admissions which could accommodate lectures or theater or music although there was none the day we went.This is a spot to put on the...when in Pasadena, I will go to place. Other than the abbreviated food choices where we ate and the lack of signage on how to get from one area to the next, it was fab-u-loso",Bhajji
50,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","This is another of those wonderful places you can go again and again and again. It's a historical place with many wonders to see. They have a great great art gallery, a fairly new Chinese garden, that is exact replica of a place in China. They had brought in workers from China to build the garden. Close by is the large Japanese garden. Both of these places are tranquil and relaxing to visit. Between these two areas is the famous their famous rose garden. They also have tea room there, but reservations are difficult to get unless you book far enough in advance. The grounds are very extensive so there can be lots of walking. I'd also recommend seeing one of the most extensive cactus gardens that you may ever see. This garden has helped me so much in deciding what and how and where to plant my many many cactus and succulents in my southern California yard.",Richard S

50,A beautiful place,We took the family there for my birthday weekend for some time outside. That last time I was there was 30 years ago! The gardens are beautiful and I never get tired of seeing Blue Boy and Pinky. The house is gorgeous! So hard to imagine they only spent a month there each year. My only complaint was the food service. We did not go to the Tea Room (college aged guys were with us) so we opted for the Cafe. Food was fine but DONT even think of adding anything not expressly stated in the description. They only make it the way it is listed (I didn't think adding celery to my salad was that big of a deal but evidently it is lol). I found the service to be not as gracious as the Huntington's may have intended.,Patty V
50,Wonderful birthday celebration at the library for high tea,"I went with a friend to the Huntington Library for high tea overlooking the Rosegarden Basically it is an all-you-can-eat buffet for about $45 per person. Food included caviar, sandwiches , various pastries, salads. You could have tea or other drinks which was included. The main drawback to this High tea is must pay for admission and pay for the tea. Best to go on the first Thursday of the month for free admission. Overall, food was above average and abundant.",ScottyHNLGirl

You can get all the details online with a little research. I recommend wearing comfortable shoes since there are large grounds to cover and bring a stroller if you little ones with you. I also recommend bringing your own lunch and snacks with you since the food inside is limited and/or expensive. I believe that this place has something for the entire family, where the adults can visit the gardens and museums and the kids can run around to their hearts content.

We arrived shortly after the 10:30 AM opening time to a nearly empty parking lot. This was a good time to arrive!We started in the Desert Garden which was spectacular!; on to the Australian Garden and over to the Japanese & Chinese gardens - Awesome! We ate lunch at the Chinese Garden Tea House which was very nice. Then we took a quick stroll through the Botanical Center and then on to the rose garden and herb garden. The herb garden also has quite a few vegetable selections which was a nice addition. The herb garden is not to be missed, if you are a garden to table cook.We ended our afternoon with a stroll through the Subtropical and Jungle gardens which were beautiful. We stopped by the gift shop on the way out, which has something for almost every taste and budget.

50,Most beautiful gardens in California,"My wife and I are now members of Huntington Library and Gardens and go over couples of months to see the changes in season from one garden to the next. Huntington is filled with over 12 beautiful gardens.""Henry Huntington's superintendent, William Hertrich, was instrumental in developing the various plant collections that comprise the foundation of the Botanical Gardens. Together, they molded the working ranch into a botanical collection of rare and exotic plants. They searched local nurseries and visited other plant collectors in the area to find mature and unique specimens. Mr. Huntington imported plants from many parts of the world to experiment with their cultivation in Southern California.The Lily Ponds were developed first. They were heated at the time to maintain the giant-leafed Amazon water lily during the relatively cool Southern California winters. Huntington and Hertrich also worked together on the Palm, Desert, and Japanese gardens and planned the North Vista and the landscaping around the mansion.Today, forty gardeners, a curatorial staff of seven, and more than 100 volunteers maintain the botanical collections, provide educational programs for visitors, and propagate plants that are often included in special sales.The grounds also include the Huntington Ranch, a demonstration garden that holds workshops and classes focused on sustainable urban agriculture.""",Normienorman

Adequate parking that day and was not crowded to the least bit. Paid student parking and toured some gardens. I would suggest to bring comfortable clothes and shoes. If you plan on speed walking, it'll feel like a hike and you'll break a sweat. We began on the Chinese gardens, made our way to the Japanese gardens, subtropical, jungle (not too sure), then quick tour of the Art gallery. I would have loved to redo and take my time in the Chinese and Japanese gardens as well as take a stroll through Shakespeare gallery and have a picnic on the lawn, but we were pressed for time. you will appreciate the history you see and the artifacts in the galleries as well. It's definitely worth the money and i appreciate all the work they put into labeling all the plans and importing and caring for the gardens. You are doing an amazing job!

This garden is so beautiful all around, it will take at least 2 visits to cover it all. Highly recommend to go in March & April for best pictures of all the flowers like cherry blossoms, magnolias. The Chinese Gardens is the best, the scenery will make you feel like you're in China. You can easily spend an hour here because it's beautiful everywhere you look, it's off to the side so you might miss it the first time you go. The Japanese Garden is also beautiful and peaceful with lots of one of a kind bonsai trees. If you love flowers and garden, this garden is a must. It's beautiful and romantic for a date too.

Once you drive through the entrance gates, there's oodles of free parking and the grounds are extensive, airy and beautifully manicured. When we were there, the gardens and exhibitions were quiet and uncrowded.The jewel in the crown are the manuscripts in the library exhibition - the Ellesmere Chaucer, Shakespeare's first Folio, a Gutenberg bible and many other treasures and curiosities - an absolute delight.The art collection in the old house is worth a look also - it ranges extensively from 15th to 20th century. However, we didn't manage to locate the prints and drawings, and we'd wanted to see the Blake works - I don't know whether they're on public display and we didn't have time to investigate further. We didn't see the gardens either - we visited in January so there wasn't much happening, but even if there had been, we wouldn't have had the time, as our trip was a last-minute affair. You'd need to set aside at least a full day for a visit to this place, and possibly do a little research in advance.There's a lovely café/restaurant - bright and airy, spacious and uncrowded, with a plentiful variety of reasonably-priced good food on offer.The craft shop near the entrance was gorgeous also - much bigger than the usual gilt shop, with lots of really attractive merchandise. I could happily have spent an hour or more browsing, but again, we didn't have time.Overall, a beautiful, relaxing spot.",Banjax
40,Beautiful Place,"I do love going to the Huntington when I have time and the funds . They have many lovely gardens and they even have a children's garden geared towards kids which is extremely fun and engaging. I also like to look at their collection of art and books and their temporary exhibitions. They also have some wonderful events every month that can make your visit even more fun.The two drawbacks are the price to get in and the crowded/limited eating areas. It costs quite a bit to get in at $23 and even a basic membership can run you $120 which makes it cost prohibitive for many people. Also, if you go for the day it can be a bear to try and eat at one of their restaurants/cafes. They can get extremely crowded and crazy. I would suggest maybe bringing your own picnic. This will save you some aggravation and money and it will probably be much better food.",FlatowLeach
50,An absolute gem,"I had no idea that Los Angeles would be home to such an amazing museum. The gardens are absolutely gorgeous (and the roses weren't even in bloom due to the season"". The science museum was such a highlight. They have so many original works from minds such as Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Pasteur, the list goes on. They even have one of the original Gutenberg bibles. I had an absolutely wonderful day exploring all there was to see.",AlyssaD509
50,It doesn't get any better than this,"With the Norton Simon and the Huntington, Pasadena is simply the best small city for art in America--anywhere. Superb gardens, including the best cactus garden in the world, surround two absolutely wonderful art museums. The first museum, the former home of Huntington and his art-lover wife, has the best collection of 18thC British portraits this side of the National Gallery in London, significantly better, for example, than the excellent groups at the Met or the Frick. The mansion also houses superb French decorative arts, as well as many other masterpieces of European painting, from the late Middle Ages on. The other museum is an excellent museum of American art. Finally, the Hungton Library is a much larger, equally high quality answer to the superb Morgan Library in NYC, chock full of amazing historical treasures. A comprehensive, thoughtful visit to the whole Huntington would take two full afternoons, since it's only open from noon to 4:30. But you can do the two art museums in only one afternoon if you keep moving. One of the greatest temples to Western civilization in America and on the planet.",FWhiteIII
50,Best place to spend a relaxing day!,"Huntington Library is an amazing place to visit for anyone looking for a peaceful day away from the rat race.My wife and I visited on a Saturday, arriving as soon as the doors opened (10:30 am). After a nice cup of coffee and pastries from the cafe near the entrance, we set off looking for plant and flower gardens, starting with the cactus garden. We were totally surprised at how many varieties there are from various parts of the world, each one with a tag identifying the plant and also where it's from.We continued through to the Japanese garden which is delightfully manicured. Lots of photo opportunities there.Beyond that we walked over to the highlight of our visit, the Chinese gardens. A beautiful place from start to finish, full of pagodas, lots of vegetation, a lake, various traditional structures that looked like Buddhist temples and even a Chinese restaurant. All of it a beautiful place to take lots and lots of photos!After that we visited the museum of American art, which was a very worthwhile experience in its own right. Once done we wanted to see the rose garden but it was not yet in full bloom; the only disappointment of the trip, just not the right time of the year for that.There was still so much more to see but we had run out of time. Huntington Library closed at 4:30 pm so we had to leave a lot of places for our next visit.This is a place I would highly recommend for a family day trip, or for a couple wanting to spend some truly enjoyable time walking together.- Cheers!",Dave G
50,Cactus Blooming,"Really enjoyed the long walk around the place. Bought an annual membership, because there is too much to see in one day. The cactus garden is blooming. Nice cafeteria.",Donald P
50,"Lots to see, overwhelming!","Where to begin. It was obvious to my wife and I that there will have to be multiple visits to see all that The Huntington has. And we are lucky as we have a son and his wife living there. He is a PhD student at UCLA and has a few more years to go, so we will return. We did a little art, the Huntington Art Gallery, former home of Henry and his wife displaying a stunning collection of 18th century British art, not my cup of tea but worth seeing, part of the library - an exhibit titled Remarkable Works, Remarkable Times and of course the botanical gardens. We strolled through the Herb Garden on our way to The Japanese and Chinese Gardens. They are lovely. Everything is lovely. Hard to believe you are in the midst of 20 million people. You could easily spend a day there.",twomartinilunch
40,The gardens,"Enjoyed everything about the library especially the Japanese garden. Also, the extensive art collection.",Irene A
50,Gorgeous!,"It's a very big botanical garden. One day is definitely not enough to explore. The gardens are divided into many different themes: desert, Chinese, Japanese, and many more.Beautiful art and book collection.Must visit the gift shop!",Lili L
40,The Huntington is for everyone.,"My wife and I are new members of the Huntington family. We have enjoyed the grounds, art exhibits, Chinese, and Japanese gardens for several years. But, we had never visited the Children's exhibit facility. We have several grandchildren now and wanted to check out what was available for them. We were very impressed with the intimacy of the garden and the thoughtfulness of its design. It can get warm at the Huntington and this is a good place to retreat from the heat. The indoor tropical plant exhibit is excellent and adjoins the kids' garden. Highly recommended whether you are visiting with kids or not. In order to see everything plan on a full day. It is an excellent place to walk with many beautiful walkways.",David B
50,"Library of Congress of the West, Gardens - Wow!","There is so much to see that it cannot all be seen in one day. It has something for everyone. Have been coming here for 15 years.If you only have a few hours:Gardens #1 the desert garden which is 100+ years old, #2 the Japanese which is the second oldest and has recently expanded, #3 The Chinese and the newest.Library and Art #1 The original library (F on the map) with its science, astronomy, and historic book collection is a lovely building and what I call the Library of Congress of the west., tied for #2 and 3 are the mansion with its European, classical art (J on map) and the Scott Gallery (L) with American art from colonial to modern. Don't miss the Greene and Greene room!Children? For the little ones the Children's Garden is a must. Shhh...We adults let out our inner child here. Delightful! For older children the Brody Botanical with its different forests and hands on exhibits holds their interest.Need to take a breath and some quiet time? Pull up a bench in the camellia garden or one of the remote corners of the desert garden.Look for birds, especially hummingbirds in the desert garden.",Nat S
40,worth the time,"We visited on a busy Saturday when a Bonsai-athon was going on. Parking was difficult and we had to hike to the entrance. We managed to catch a 1:00 free garden tour which was helpful to navigate the large garden areas. the camellias were in bloom and the new Chinese gardens, still under construction, are vast and interesting. We did not visit the Library or museum areas. The gardens were great but crowded. We also ate a the Norris café which was very good. We will return but will try for a weekday when crowds aren't as large.",jfd
50,This is a great half day venue for museum and garden goers.,"Huntington Library has some great attractions including a Gutenberg Bible, letters from famous scientists and inventors, a medieval text on herbal medicines, early american and european historical documents, and paintings. Most noteable are originals paintings titled Pinky and Blue-boy and other great 18th and 19th century portraits. Although a smaller collection than what you can see in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, there were many attractions that I thought were every bit as impressive. The price is a bit steep for a 1/2 day venue, at 23.00? but season passes are available for a little more. The museum is staffed with many docents and security personnel so you can understand the cost. They have many very valuable pieces to protect. I found the docents very knowledgable and if you are somewhat informed, they can answer the more in depth questions, and they are friendly and anxious to fill you with facts and side stories. The gardens are beautiful, particularly the Japanese and Chinese gardens, great for a quiet stroll. Small children would likely get bored, so consider this an adult activity. The botanicals are well cares for and much variety. I would come again",Steven S
50,Fabulous Gardens and Art,"We arrived an hour too early--the venue opens at noon on the weekdays, but, were told that we could wait at the cafe, which was open. There is a free first Thursday when they open at 10:30 am. Reservations for that must be made in advance. We were able to get senior rates for $19 each. It would be $21 on weekends. Check their website for the other rates, but, it is worth every penny. The botanical gardens are just amazing with a variety of plants from the country the gardens represent. The Chinese Gardens were exquisite and the spring flowers were blooming, reflecting in the pools and water features. We were rushed on this visit, but, will make time to take a break at the tea house cafe in the Chinese Garden area to soak in more of the views. This gardens were even more beautiful than some that we visited in China. We spent too much time in the Library and viewing the amazing art collections, so, didn't have as much time in the gardens. Allow at least 3 - 4 hours to enjoy everything The Huntington Library Gardens and Art Collection has to offer. You can easily spend an hour in their well-stocked and organized gift shop.",JanHana
50,Our own American Downton Abbey,"What a beautiful place, especially the gardens and walking paths. The library, museums, and displays are interesting, educational and well done. Only downside was the cafe was disorganized and food disappointing.",dmks
50,"World class gardens, architecture, and art","Amazing gardens and house, the former mansion of the Huntingtons, of Southern Pacific RR fame and fortune. His will left the house and acres and acres of gardens to Pasadena to be a museum and library as well. Chinese and Japanese gardens cover a wide area, and there are several more we did not have time for despite spending all afternoon. Impossible to see everything in one visit! Several art museums and the main house contain many priceless objects. Books, gift shop, restaurants, ample parking. Better to buy membership than pay as you go if you plan to visit more than once. A grand day out! Superb! Wear your walking shoes.",Merrill C
50,Could spend days here,"We visited here on a girls weekend. Walked for hours around the most beautiful gardens. We had lunch at Asian garden, very good. I recommend this place for everyone.",Bulitlist
50,Wonderful gardens & museums,"A wonderful place. Plan about 3-4 hours. The American & European art museums are excellent with a lot of great classical masterpieces, some very famous. Didn't think much of the current exhibit of garden paintings - many were not even gardens. The actual gardens are extensive and lovely - particularly the desert gardens and the very charming Japanese & Chinese gardens. The Library collection is one of the great ones (and most valuable) in the world, and the exhibitions are fascinating. Don't miss that! All-in-all, a terrific place to visit & learn.",BunkyVA

20,"Go for the gardens, not the food.","This was supposed to be a highlight of our trip. My friend had been before, and wanted me to see the gardens and have ""Tea"".The gardens are lovely for those who like to look without an ounce of curiosity. I live in the Northeast, I would like to know what I am looking at, most labels were difficult to find or nonexistent . Pretty but somewhat disappointing.The ""Tea"" was just ok. Finger sandwiches on supermarket bread, under ripe strawberries (it was winter, but this is California, there had to be something in season), unremarkable dessert pastries. The dishes on the buffet table were dirty. Kitchen personnel were bring them straight out of the kitchen....dirty, having been hurriedly rinsed or so it seemed. The first plate I picked up from the stack had a blob about the size of a tablespoon of egg salad stuck to the bottom. Others had black water stains. I sent my teacup back because it was not clean.Service. They seat you, and bring your beverage. The room is attractive, but crowded. I cannot recommend the ""Tea"".The European Art is a nice collection of small scope. It certainly reflects the persona of Mr. Huntington. Exhibit of rare books is also limited. Please be sure to exit by 3:59, doors are closed at 4PM.",Susan P
50,Very interesting and beautiful.,"I went here not having any idea what I would see since I went with my sister who lives nearby. It is pricey, but I think it's a must see.

40,Great Picnic area and garden comparison,"There is several garden with different architecture style and plant from all over the world.We joined a tour at 1:30pm and an elderly man guided us to visit place by place.

50,Beautiful Place to Visit!,"My boyfriend and I visited here on a recent trip to Pasadena and it was time well spent! We were there for a little over 3 hours and could have used more time to explore everything (their hours are limited, so I would advise going when they open. 12 - 4:30 p.m. on weekdays. Closed on Tuesdays). Check out their website for more information.The gardens are lovely, expansive, well-maintained and very peaceful. We made it into only one of the buildings (""European Art"") and saw some lovely paintings and also just enjoyed the architectural aspects of the building. Again, we just ran out of time.There are several dining options within the grounds (we only grabbed a beverage at the coffee shop) that look intriguing including a tea room that I hope to try on my next visit (and I WILL go back the next time I'm visiting).This was an enjoyable day and I can't wait to re-visit. We each paid $23.00 for an adult admission.",jahhp
50,One of the best attractions in LA,"By far one of the most worth while attractions in LA,A must visit place.Lush gardens with amazing set up and beautiful walks, take a life one or family to walk around or sit and enjoy the greenery around you.Watch huge variety of cactus flowers or the zen Japanese gardens.",Shay M

If you enjoy paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, flowers, wide open spaces, cactus gardens, quiet (among many other things), you'll love the Huntington. With some recent changes, the Huntington now also has a wonderful cafe and an enlarged gift shop. Because the entrance fee is a bit steep for many people, plan to spend a few hours or more there to make it worthwhile. Just walking the grounds, without going into any of the buildings, can take a while (and can be made much more special by going on a docent-led tour). If you add visiting the various buildings/galleries and having a bite to eat to walking the grounds, expect to be at the Huntington for a good 4-5 hours. You won't regret it!

I would recommend 3-4 hours, instead of the 2 that I spent.",Maximilian G
50,A surprising find,"In the middle of a beautiful high end city stands the Huntington Library ang Gardens. It is a difficult place to explain because of its many attractions. The newly restoredHuntington masion, he was a wealthy railroad baron is a thing of beauty. The numerous art works will be appreciated by all given their broad range from Pinky and Blue Boy to Andy Warhol. The Chinese Gardens is the most authentic garden of this type outside of China. Flowers, plants and trees from around the world are in abundance. Given their excellent food service it can be a day long experience if one so desires.",Paul K
40,Review of the grounds.,"The library is beyond comparison, but, so are the grounds. To say that they have achieved the pinnacle of sculpting and landscaping would be an understatement. But, we were there with my cousin and her husband from Missouri and the renovations being performed were at the extreme. I wish they had more guides to provide tours but understand economics. That means, you mostly take walking tours. And, mostly get lost. The map is somewhat to scale but leaves you lost more often than not. We had lunch in the tea room but it was over-crowded and the air conditioning could not keep up. Our visit was worth the time and it peaceful in the gardens. We will go again but probably in the early spring, on a weekday.",Deborah S
50,Peaceful Pleasurable Pastimes,"There are many reasons to go to the Huntington Library and Gardens. Simply pick your pleasure.The Library has huge collection of first edition books that are really fun to explore. Gutenberg bible, illuminated texts, gorgeous letters written by amazing men and women from throughout history. A book lovers paradise. Can't relax with a few good books? Try the Main house and a have a pleasant visit with England's most amazing portrait artists. Gainsborough and Reynolds and Lawrence are among the many artists who tells us stories of their famous, rich sitters, through their paintings. Don't want to converse with the Royals? Go back to the Americas with the Virginia Steele Scott gallery, a comprehensive collection using art to lead us from Colonial America to the New Deal. How about not going anywhere indoors at all? The Desert, The Tropics, Asian gardens, The Rainforest, Roses, even Bogs and Fog await you. The many types of gardens here are joined together by shady paths, so you can traverse from East to West easily. Perhaps you'd rather just have a cuppa? Make a reservation for the Tea House and get your high tea on! The spread is yummy and all you can eat.Yes, many things to be found at the Huntington; Classes, Lectures, Concerts and Garden info are all here too!Fan can be had by all.",deabs8

If you download their mobile application there are great audio guides around the property too. My favorite part was the library though, which includes many wonders not least of which is an original Gutenberg bible. The Blue Boy painting was also something I'd seen plenty in books and it was not a disappointment in person.If you have a few hours to spend pleasantly ambling around staring at pretty old stuff then you're not likely to find a better option in Pasadena.

You may want to check their website for operating hours as they may be different depending the day or the season. The desert garden and the Chinese garden are must-see sights. We also enjoyed the Shakespeare, herb, and hothouse botanical gardens. The main house displays mostly older art displays and showcases one contemporary artist. The first floor also housed the enormous original Huntington library. There are a few on-site restaurants, including one at the Chinese garden and a tea room at the herb garden. There are also various restroom locations. I wish we had arrived earlier, as we could have easily spent another couple of hours exploring the grounds and other galleries.

My husband and I arrived just in time for a Docent guided glimpse of this enormous beautiful lush garden. He was very nimble on his feet and shuttled our small group of 5 running and out of breath as he shot past the higher learning Library Exhibit Center, the magical and whisical Children's Garden where he pointed out the Mausoleum, the educational Brody Botanical Center, he rushed past the American Art into the 'to be or not to be' Shakespeare Garden, said a brief hello and goodbye to tbe main house where we got a glimpse of the palm tree collections, into the fragrant Rose Garden and the perennial Herbgarden, crossed over the wonderous Japanese Garden, our sayonara stop. We went on our own leisurely and made our way back to the Europe Art Gallery to view the world's famous Thomas Gainsborough's The Blue Boy. By this time, we were neckered and in desperate need of refreshments, so reluctantly we had to leave the Australian Garden, the Subtropical Garden, the Jungle Garden, the Palm Garden and the Desert Garden for future visit as it is humanly impossible to see everything in 1 day. The Huntington fueled our brain, feasted our eyes and intoxicated our senses and we were dead tired happily.",connie l

40,So much to do and see,We visited the gardens right after new year and they were still magnificent. Some of the cacti in the desert garden were blooming. The Chinese and Japanese gardens are serene and well laid out. The directional signs were easy to follow but bring your walking shoes. The grounds are extensive!,Alexandra T
40,A terrific day out...,"As relatives of Charles Darwin and Galton being our family name, it was fascinating and hugely interesting to be given a private tour of the Huntingdon's permanent Darwin and Galton Exhibition by one of their experts, who had helped set the whole exhibition up. Our family was there in force, and afterwards we had lengthy visits to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, as well as the Cactus and Succulent Garden. Beautiful and enjoyable!",Peter T
40,Slow down and enjoy lunch overlooking a garden,"The newly-built cafe here is fully available to non-members without admission, very amiable, light and airy, with nice soups, salads and sandwiches which are not too expensive.AND you can sit outdoors right on the edge of the gardens, rather than in them, enjoying a quiet and peaceful lunch or tea break with great views in a nice setting.Setting aside the fact that Huntington Gardens (in the 1970s) got permission to break the trust in which Huntington had required free attendance to the public in perpetuity, it IS a beautiful place, and now you can see at least some of it without paying ($25!?) to get in. (I am usually a member, anyway.)",drfertig
50,beautiful gardens,it is a collection of different plants and art exhibition. I like every part of this garden from cacti to roses to bonsai and so on. camera is a must! you can take lots of lovely photos. one can spend whole day over there. the ground is very big so it's better to wear comfortable shoes. I enjoyed the serenity of this place.,HodaM_13
50,Outstanding museum and gardens,"The private collection here is one of the best in the United States-- a Gutenberg Bible, the Declaration of Independence, early Shakespeare and Spanish colonial explorer manuscripts, and much more! The Huntington's house is an interesting American combination of English manor and Versailles. There are several smaller collections and exhibits too. The grounds are beautiful and in many ways symbolize the best of southern California-- Japanese and Chinese gardens, a rose garden, a dessert-y walk, and don't miss the lawn with sculpture looking up towards the mountains. There are several places to eat and a good gift store too.",davisellu

50,Amazing gardens close to downtown Pasadena,"I never knew about this place until a photographer guy told me. There are so many cactus here, I think more than any desert. There are also other gardens, a Chinese, Japanese and Australian gardens, maybe some others. The national gardens were nice but the cactus area was incredible. Must see!",deathblosom
50,Beautiful Gardens,Huntington Botanical Garden has the most beautiful gardens in LA County. We visited the Japanese and Chinese Gardens and both are spectacular. I am impressed with the improvements done to the Chinese Garden which can soon be the most beautiful of the seven gardens. Entrance fee can be pricey especially with the limited operating hours.,BobC2003

50,Our Go To Spot for Out of Town Friends,"We love the Huntington Library! So much so that we became members. We love to stroll the gardens and enjoy viewing the beautiful paintings. Our new favorite place is the Chinese Garden. We really enjoy the traditional Chinese music played every Wednesday afternoon in the Garden of Flowing Fragrance. The Chinese Garden is a very beautiful new addition to the Huntington and is a great compliment to the Huntington.We've had friends from Japan and South Carolina visit and our first trip is always to the Huntington. It never fails to impress and impart a beautiful memory of their visit. As Christians, we always like to show our friends an original Gutenberg Bible in the collection of books. Its a rare and valuable book along with being the early attempt to get the Bible in the hands of the common people.If you can, schedule a lunch at the Tea Room. It's a nice delicious buffet but expensive. It's a nice place for a special visit or a special someone.Our last trip we ate at the new restaurant near the entrance. Sandwiches, pizza, hot entrees, coffee and wine. The food was good and I can recommend as a less expensive option to the wonderful Tea Room.The Huntington Library is a great place for you and your visitors. See It!",ralphh909
50,Sensational food and service,"Visiting Huntington Gardens in the winter can be just as rewarding as a summer visit, considering how much there is to see. Not only is it less crowded, but there is a chance to have lunch/brunch at the very stylish restaurant/tea-house, which we did on this occasion. Although it is fairly expensive, the quality of the food and service made it totally worthwhile, particularly during the festive season. We had the special loose tea offered during the holidays, which was exquisite, finger sandwiches and a basket of home-made scones, which were absolutely scrumptious. The policy is eat as much as you like, so it feels like good value for money.",andrea_vinifera
50,A Place of Wonderment,"The Huntington is a place of wonderment.The Gardens are beautifully kept, endlessly fascinating, always surprising and contain many rarities. The cactus garden is beyond compare. The rose garden in spring is enchanting. The Japanese and Chinese gardens combine exquisite architecture with their plantings.They have specimens of the rare corpse flower (amorphophallus titanum) here. Should you hear its going to bloom you can track progress on the Huntington website and visit when the flower opens. Its an experience.The Library and Galleries contain amazing, world-class, collections of art, history, artifacts, letters and printed materials. Exhibitions change regularly.Aside from the above, its a beautiful place to come and simply sit and read a book on a quiet afternoon.The Huntington recently finished a sizable building program adding new spaces, gardens, expanded food service and a much larger gift shop, which in itself can take up an afternoon's browsing.We found ourselves coming here so often, we became members, which for people in the area makes the Huntington extremely affordable.",DoubleP
50,Great historical museum,The art here is fantastic! Even in the rain the gardens are gorgeous. If you are challenged they have golf carts to take you from building to building. Be sure and stop for guide information before starting. That helped us not waste energy on exhibits that were closed.,jandavidson19
50,Tickets to the Huntington were a wonderful Christmas gift. Highly recommended.,"It's hard to put the Huntington in a particular category. It has an amazing collection of art work, the most famous piece being The Blue Boy, by Thomas Gainsborough. There is also a highly regarded research library that includes historic works such as one of only 11 vellum Gutenberg bibles known to exist.We spend most of our time there enjoying the botanical gardens. We concentrated on the desert, Japanese, and rose gardens. We were there on a sunny day just before el nino brought torrential rains to Southern California. As a result we were able to take very good photographs.This is an attraction that takes more than a day to appreciate, but we greatly enjoyed the five hours we had.",H Joseph F

40,My favorite gardens in LA,"I have been visiting this incredible place since the 80's and have re-visited the gardens many times and will again visit it next week when I go. It is a real treasure for LA and particularly for cities like Pasadena, San Gabriel, Arcadia that are nearby. I have recommended to everyone who asked me about what to visit when in LA. My recommendation have always been to include The Huntington Library and Gardens.",sfeats
50,"Impressive gardens, art galleries, library","Many may overlook this gem, but the gardens, with varied themes such as Chinese, Japanese, and tropical, are spectacular. Great art gallery -- had to see ""Blue Boy!"" Knew of the research offerings of the library, but their historical book display is awesome (including the Gutenberg Bible). Enjoyed excellent buffet in the tea room. Guide was super.",BlackBear5146
50,A day at the Huntington Gardens,Huntington Gardens is a must for travelers. Its enchanting gardens and museums are unique. Its a feel good place. For locals I recommend you get a membership so that you can enjoy it frequently. I take family and friends to visit every chance I get.,marta469
50,Excellent half day trip.,"Wonderful setting in the San Gabriel Valley. Beautiful Gardens and one of the best Libraries anywhere. And touring the house to see the fruits of the ""Gilded Age"" in Southern California. A small but very good English Art Collection in its' own Gallery. Just a wonderful place for a low key half day and don't miss the Afternoon Tea in the Gardens.",Aston B
40,Timeless,I have been here for all occasions and there is never a time I have not been where I did not enjoy my experience or discovered something new.,Moxie_Grrl
50,A Wonderful Way to Spend a Day,"I am so grateful to have the Huntington in my neighborhood. We love taking out of town guests, and everyone (even kids) always enjoy it. It's always different because different things are blooming. The desert area is always a hit from people not used to cactus & other succulents. The Japanese & Chinese gardens are beautiful, and I especially like the bonsai trees. It's a lot of fun to look at all the different roses, their names and to smell them. Then, there are the different galleries! American art, European art, a greenhouse with a fantastic exhibit of different climate zones, a children's garden, and a fantastic tea room. Definitely a Pasadena Highlight.",NatAtHome
50,"Local Treasure - Gardens, Museum, Cafe","I've been coming to the Huntington my whole life, and regard it as a true local treasure. Recently I developed a new appreciation for the level of service they provide. I went to the garden with a large group of family, including a motion-impaired relative. When a staff member noticed her having difficulty walking, he very politely came up and mentioned the free shuttle service they provide to allow guests with difficulty walking access to all of the gardens. So thoughtfully offered, and a terrific service. Bravo, Huntington, I fall more in love with you each time I come.",ElizabethDGB
40,Something for Everyone,"The museum appeals to those who love art, nature, history, and architecture; or even those who just want to go on a lovely stroll.",Neale M
50,Top notch gardens and museum,We never tire of coming here and see more each time!! A lovely time. Be sure to wear good walking shoes!,cchrcro
50,Amazing Gardens and Collection,"One of the best museums and with comprehensive gardens and a great gift shop and multiple places to eat. Allow a full day at The Huntington and arrive early. The museum and grounds are not open for extensive periods, usually the late morning to late afternoon, so plan to spend as much time as you can there. If you are planning your visit a few weeks in advance, consider having lunch at the Rose Garden Tea Room inside of The Huntington. You certainly need reservations for this... and you make them on The Huntington web site in as much in advance as you can plan your visit; you can rarely visit the Rose Garden Tea Room as a last minute decision without reservations. It is also costly, but a fun lunch. No visit would be complete without seeing Blue Boy and Pinky so be sure to make that part of your visit in the galleries. We like that The Huntington has an eclectic mix of art, statuary, gardens, and structures... different from most museums dedicated to a single genre (like the Getty). Adults are about $25 a person admission for the day.You have to drive your car to The Huntington, through the streets on the tony San Marino neighborhood, and likely along part of the route of the Rose Parade when you drive through Pasadena.",DrSteve818
50,Beautiful Gardens,"We spent a day at the Huntington Library and Gardens. Our family, including our kids, ages 11 and 5 really enjoyed the different gardens and libraries (up to a certain point) with younger children, going to the libraries first is a good idea. The libraries are more like an art museum. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. The libraries were so interesting with the different book and art collections. Go early, preferably when the place opens. Then enjoy the libraries first before they get crowded. The gardens were nice to visit after lunch. We liked how the gardens had different themes. Well worth the day trip.",mgeorge987
50,"""A Place of Beauty - History - Art""","There is no place more amazing and beautiful in LA County. The gardens offer beauty from every continent. There are so many places you can sit and enjoy a beautiful picnic, book, or take some amazing photos. The library offers a treasure of history and books. The American and European museums are wonderful. The Japanese garden area around the lake is my favorite place to just sit and enjoy the truly special environment this place has to offer. Check out the gift shop on your way out, there are some great gifts for those hard to shop for people.",AnnieP7
50,Second visit,"This is the second time I visited this place. There were some renovation of the entrance, I almost couldn't recognize this place. The modification was good and made the place better and easier to access.There were some new exhibitions, too. Most of them are fine, except the arts from Alex Israel. It's not that his pieces are bad, but when they're displayed together with the old pieces, they seemed out of place. But if you're a whimsical kind of person, you might like this odd combination.",Tzu-Li T
50,Visit,"This place is incredible. Museums are fantastic. Grounds are wonderful. They keep improving them. It really takes several days to see it all. The number of Thomas Gainesborough's painting are numerous. Also Reynold's paintings. The literary works takes hours to marvel at. Parking is free. The Tea Room is great but expensive. Starts at $31.00 and goes up. Very crowded too. Wise to make reservations for Tea Room. There is another cafe on the other side that is good alternative. Highly recommend the cafe in the Chinese Garden. You order from a limited menu including tea and then take to tables in a great setting around the waters. You can sit inside a Chinese Pavilion that is mostly glass on outside. Gift shop at the entrance/exit is worth browsing. Also, the Huntington has some very interesting talks and demonstrations. I really love this place. I have taken quite a few of my friends and family here and everyone thinks it's great.",ElmoSanDiego
50,One of the most amazing places one can imagine!,This is a great place to spend whole day. Huntington offers one of the best collections of 18 to 19 century European and American arts. Plus amazingly beautiful gardens of every season. The Chinese gardens are comparable to the best gardens in China if not better. The desert garden is most likely the best cactus garden in the world with vast collections and thoughtful design. Huntington is really an amazing place to visit.,PortDoverBeach
40,"fascinating landscaping, fine arts museum, great museum store","One of the major American art museums was closed while we were here, so if that is important to you call ahead and see if it has reopened. The various gardens are stupendous, but I was MUCH less impressed by the garden docent. Her speech was a bit halting, her knowledge was somewhat limited, and her attitude about water conservation was truly appalling.",tlb91
50,Almost a theme park for intellectuals,"A wonderful place. I was there yesterday and I will be there tomorrow. There are art galleries, an incredible library, and wonderful gardens. A young Chinese gentleman I passed on his walk told his companions that this was almost as good as the scholars garden in China. The Japanese Garden is wonderful. I love the Cactus garden and the birds it attracts. Check it out. An inexpensive vacation.",Bj L
40,great place away from hustle bustle of LA,"Not too far from center of LA. Enjoyed walking and appreciate the gardens. Once indoor, you will see great paintings, sculptures and antiquities.",weiliu2014
50,Always a joy,Cannot rate this place highly enough. My only minor gripe is that it is so popular that it can be hard to find the peace and quiet in the gardens. Immaculately maintained with recent upgrades to the visitor experience. World class art too,KEinSF
40,Peaceful and stunning,Homes in the San Marino neighborhood are beautifulTo start.. Then walk the gardens.. Catch a meal at julienne in the cute downtown after and take it in. I used to bring my kids in a stroller and get A work out in while appreciating the dogwoods.. Or roses or wisteria or whatever was in bloom at the time ..locals can plan ahead and eat lunch in rose garden or get an annual passTo avoid all the parking and paying nonsense.. And Benin and out for a gorgeous walk in an hour.Statuary and formal gardens have a Pitti palace nod.. Southwestern /desert area is my least favorite .,drmader
30,Too expensive & too little time to enjoy an intellectual's Disneyland & LA's hidden gem,"This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles and possibly the world. However, it has become incredibly expensive ($23 for an adult) for only 4-5 hours of enjoyment. If you get there when it opens at 12:30, you will end up getting hungry and wasting time with lunch. That leaves you maybe 4 hours at best to soak in the amazing library, fantastic art collections, beautiful architecture and stunning gardens. We rushed so much to take in as much as we could (my husband's one and only opportunity to go) that we couldn't stop to enjoy it like I had in years past. It's more expensive than most LA-area museums with fewer hours to enjoy it. Very disappointing.",RedJet728
40,Great place to fill a day,Love the outdoors? The expansive and well-curated gardens can fill your day. Love art? Check out the collection of modern and impressionist art in the multiple galleries. Looking for a fun (& educational) place for the kids? The botanical gardens and children's gardens will keep them busy.I definitely recommend taking the free garden tours (1-2 hours) for a good orientation of this beautiful property...and ask for Big Ed. He was our volunteer docent who was filled with facts and answered all of our questions.,loveDCA
50,Wonderful day,Stone and bonsai show and exhibit. Club meets to show their finds Stones are found in nature and exhibited. Mini mountains and rock islands displayed in own sand gardens or teak stands. Beautiful simplicity. A Must-See,Lori R
50,Just a great place to visit,We just love to roam through the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. They are very authentic and capture the spirit of gardens from afar. The botanical exhibits from all ofver the world are just first class and the art collections are also excellent.,geotech522
50,Excellent as usual,"I could come here every day just to walk in these beautiful gardens. This time we saw the new (well new to us) Chinses gardens with lovely live music in a pagoda. Except for the poorly behaved, loud children, just lovely. The library and house also always a thrill to see. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting the area as something to NOT miss.",stephaniekustner
50,"Wonderful gardens, art and science","Even if you've been here before, it's still a treat, not only because everything here is kept up by 400 workers, but because they keep adding great new things to the mix. The greenhouse has fine plants, but also is a first-rate educational experience. Their children's garden is pure fun. The Chinese garden is going into another building phase, but it's first phase has grown into a beautiful space. The gardens are a treat year-round and the art and science exhibits are treasures. They've even built a new eating area with both inside and outside seating and much better food than before. The tearoom is still there if you're into such things.",CaTraveler7777

40,A must see for the famous English pictures,Living in Constable and Gainsbourgh country England this was a must see so we passed through Pasadena and had to make a stop over. We did not check the opening hours and found out after we srrived at 11 tthat they do not open untill 12 because of this due to the extensive area in which it is set meant we really only had time to do the European gallery and a quick skim of the American but we were told that the orchids are also very good.,ea217

Heck, they're right up there with the Getty in terms of an incredible way to spend an afternoon. Visit the seven gardens and then tour the Huntington mansion where French Impressionists and other works that America's leading female collector of her time purchased. Then head over to the library where you will see, among other things, one of the 40 extant vellum Guttenberg Bibles. There is a cafe and two teahouses (I think). The Huntington is a true treasure.",LilyK88

Rich architecture, very extensive and beautifully laid out and kept gardens, amazing artwork and library. Includes Sculptures and even a prayer chapel with gorgeous stain glass work. I can never say enough. It has gotten to be a pricey day if you can get reservations for afternoon tea with your admission, but well worth the experience, once in a lifetime! Of course you can get in free on the first Thursday of the month, but you still need to reserve a ticket for the day call early, it fills up fast!.",Meg T
50,Paradise in San Marino California,"A paradise in Los Angeles is hard to find, that is if you don't know where to look or who to ask. Nestled against the San Gabriel mountain range there is a beautiful setting just east of Pasadena California. The Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens was once the home of the railroad and real real estate developer Henry Edward Huntington . Who with the help of William Hertrich transformed the large tract into a world class garden in 1903.What started out as a labor of love, turn into a world class garden. Huntington and Hertrich set out to test plants for cultivation in Southern California and by doing so they accumulated pants and cactuses from all over the world. The Desert Garden contains a vast collection of desert cactuses. There are several Lily ponds through out the garden with benches for one to sit and relax in a beautiful and lush setting. With in the grounds there is a Japanese and Chinese gardens which contain plants and flowers that are native to both countries. The Huntington is also widely known for it's rose and camellia gardens and are a ""burst of color"" in the Spring which is the best time to visit the gardens. The library and galleries contain rare books, manuscripts as well as paintings and beautiful sculptures. You can even spend time in The Tea Room which has a wonderful assortment of delectable salads and deserts. If you can spare a half day or so, you won't be disappointed.",Brian L
50,New dining hall,"Life just got a lot more tasty in San Marino, home of the Huntington Library and Gardens. If you want a great food experience with a variety of palate raising choices, try the new food hall at the Library and Gardens. You don't need to buy a ticket to eat here.

40,"Art Ok, Gardens and Tea Are Amazing","Come and see British art staples like Blue Boy. Stay for the amazing gardens and fantastic high tea (reservations on weekends and during holidays essential).

A beautiful, beautiful compound, amazing architecture and exhibits with many acres of various gardens. It's a wonderful way to spend a day, and there are several places to rest and eat.

50,Beautiful and peaceful Huntington,"A pretty and quiet place that you can walk around and enjoy your peaceful moment. There are different gardens and museums which I enjoyed very much. I have to say the tea room buffet at is a bit pricey (on top of the admission fee of Huntington Library) but i think the atmosphere, the staff and the food were worth the money. I hadnt made reservation online as it was fully booked. I think I was lucky there was a few empty tables as it was a bit late, around 2pm. The tea room is right in the rose garden which I loved so much, and if you are even luckier, you may have a table by the windows with the view of the garden. Their gardens and the buildings are just awesome and beautiful and the museum with historic and ancient book collection was really eye-opening. You just can't miss them. Anyway, the Huntington Library and Gardens is really a great place to visit when you are in Pasadena. I will definitely go again when I am in Pasadena.",luig0121
40,"Mr. and Mrs. Huntington Did an Amazing Job of Building Their Mansion, Galleries and Gardens","I returned to visit the estate home and gardens of Mr. and Mrs. Huntington. They built an amazing library, mansion, and gardens that have lasted more than a century. The staff there maintains them.They have added some expensive administrative offices and an overpriced restaurant that serves wine. My ice tea and salad cost about $15.00.The entrance price is now $23.00; although parking is free.While i have mentioned the mansion, many may not even realize they have seen it. The current management did a lousy job of maintaining it and now just turned it into another art gallery. The mansion staff (9 out of 11 I asked) did not even know that Mr. and Mrs. Huntington had lived there.There is an additional Chinese Garden that was not part of the original estate. One can no longer ring the bell in the Japanese Gardens.There is a disrespect towards history. While the gardens are truly amazing and the art is as always good to see, its sad that the management does not care about history or maintaining a sense of the past.When I asked at the information desk why this was - they said that the current is more important. If I wanted to learn about the past, I could buy an expensive book in the gift store.The current management could do a better job of educating people about the important work of Mr. and Mrs. Huntington. I respect them for doing so much to acquire the library, the art, and build the original library and mansion. The gardening team then did an amazing job of putting in the different gardens such as the Japanese and Cactus Gardens.While its a great place to visit if you have not visited before, its somewhat sad that they refused to keep a sense of history as part of the Huntington Library as well.",mini

The rose garden was pretty much gone for the season but still some roses (albeit past their prime) and I can only imagine what it must look and smell like in it's prime. I was hoping to get into the tea house but hadn't made reservations and they were fully booked. Another visit I'll plan ahead and do that.,Stephanie W
50,Beautiful,"Outstanding gardens, in a peaceful setting. The rose garden is well worth visiting; it has an enormous selection of different varieties and types of roses.",Susan C
40,Peace and serenity.,"My first visit was exactly what I needed. The further you travel into the gardens, the more relaxed you'll feel. Bring comfortable shoes, you'll want to walk for hours. We didn't even make it into any of the art exhibits. The happily spent our time in the gardens and still didn't see them all. There are great food options as well. Option 1: plan your visit and hit everything. Option 2: (Our choice) Just go, enjoy, and go back for what you missed. An annual pass is a great option to consider.",Tony M
50,"Overpriced entrance, but worth it!!!","Next door at the LA County Arboretum in Arcadia, it is only $9 for adults and $6 for students. When I found out about the entrance fee to the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens, I was a little hesitant to go since I thought it was overpriced (weekdays: $23 adults/$19 students & seniors) (weekends: $25 adults/$21 students & seniors). However, I decided I would attempt to get away with the student discount, even though the sign says: full-time students 12-18 yrs old, student ID required. I am 23 yrs old and already graduated college, but I do look very young... the man at the admission counter did not even ask me for a student ID and I got the discount I hoped for! ;)I came here to explore by myself, and I was really impressed with everything! I especially loved the Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, and the Chinese Garden. I felt like I teleported to Asia because it seriously felt like I was no longer in Southern California. Of course the other gardens are beautiful as well, but these 3 were my favorite. I only took about 3 hours to walk around the whole place, and I was pretty tired! You will walk ALOT at this place & comfortable shoes are a must!If you love the Huntington and you don't live too far away from the Pasadena area, you should definitely get the membership. I am thinking about getting the $120 membership for the whole year with up to two named adult card holders.. in addition, free admission for any children/grandchildren 18 and under, accompanied by a card holder. For sure I will be back more than 5x and I certainly don't want to pay the entrance fee every time, so I think this will be worth it.",Annemae B
50,"Library, Art, Gardens: All World Class","The portion of the library accessible to the public includes items such as a Gutenberg Bible, early Chaucer and Shakespeare, and a copy of the Principia annotated by Newton. The art and gardens are comparable in their uniqueness and importance. The tea is a bit less ""proper"" than in the past, but still a great experience.",WHS-Eagle
50,"Peace, Beauty, Art, and Culture","It's hard to choose what to call the Huntington. Gardens? Library? Museum? It can justifiably call itself any and all of the above. The gardens are simply magnificent any time of the year. Every time you round a turn on a path you meet another view that stops you. I can see why people get permits to do portrait and wedding photography here. And if you have any literary interest, it's impossible to pass up the opportunity to see a Gutenberg Bible, or an original signed letter by Abraham Lincoln. There are two separate art museums as well for American and European art. Though, personally, of the three, gardens, library, and art, the art comes last, particularly with the Norton Simon so close by. Free parking though the admission is rather pricey. Three restaurants on the grounds offer lunch, snacks, or tea. Absolutely recommended.",Michelle B
50,"Gardens, Artwork and Tea","Where else can you find several types of gardens (Japanese, Chinese, Dessert, etc), beautiful paintings (American and European), historical artifacts (Canterbury Tales), sculpture (Puck by Harriet Hosmer is my favorite), a well stocked gift shop, a lovely Tea buffet amidst a Rose Garden? I simply love the Huntington Library. I have an annual membership so I try to go as often as I possibly can. The entrance fee is $20 (I think) if you are a non-member. It's really worth the time and the annual membership fee. Don't miss checking out the Gutenberg Bible, Canterbury Tales, Pinkie, Blue Boy and my all time favorite, the sculpture of Puck by Harriet Hosmer.",Maria A
50,"Art, architecture, history, beauty - all in one","Spent a half day here after a business trip. It's in the heart of old rich gracious Pasadena/San Marino. Even the residential environs are pretty spectacular on the drive there The Huntington is an art museum, a library of rare books and extensive gardens. It's the former estate of Henry Huntington, who built the LA Streetcar system and other holdings. Just to contemplate his home, a palatial mansion which is now the art gallery, his huge estate , now the gardens, tells you all you need to know about the enormous wealth of the 1% of that era, 100 or so years ago.I took a one hour free garden tour. It kept to the most level and easily walkable route, still encompassing the Rose Garden, Shakespeare Garden, Palm Garden, Herb Garden, Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden. The docent was very well informed and shared with us how much study they had to put in to pass the test to be tour guides. I spent the rest of my half day in the library exhibit hall - A Gutenberg Bible, a First Folio, a letter from Isaac Newton dated 1678, Jack London's diary and personal photos from the San Francisco earthquake, one fantastic thing after another. Then the art gallery - the former Huntington mansion - I could only sample a few of the beautiful galleries. There is an outstanding gift shop, plenty of small nice cafe's and coffee shops, easy free parking. I highly recommend it and I'd love to return.",cdctosan
50,don't miss the Chinese Gardens!,"The Chinese gardens change as the seasons pass, and are always beautiful. Although I have never been to China, I feel as if I get to visit when I go to the Huntington. The rocks, the craftmen who did the work, and the designs were all Chinese. There is a small cafeteria with Chinese food and teas. Be sure to look online before you go see if they have live Chinese music being played when you are there ( this often occurs on Wednesday pm). It so adds to the magic of the garden.",sandylindy
50,Always a pleasure,"The Huntington is one of the most spectacular gardens I've visited (even compared to those I've visited in Europe and the tropics). Add to that with world-class museums, lectures and even theater events, it ranks as one of my favorite places on earth. When my son was a toddler, this was a safe and fun place to explore with an unsteady walker. :) Now he's a teenager and we still love visiting for exploring, live Shakespeare (the company from The Globe, and the performance of Much Ado About Nothing was amazing), even a nice meal at the café. Always worth the drive for us.",judysj
50,Wonderful History Surrounded by Peaceful Gardens,"My friend is a member and got me a pass so I don't know the price of a ticket but I will gladly pay full price for my next visit. I work a stressful job so a major theme on my vacations is relaxation, and you can't get a better location for that than this place.My favorite area is the Japanese Garden and particularly the bonsai court. But really, all the gardens are peaceful and beautiful: Chinese, Rain Forest, Desert, and Lily Ponds.Also quite enjoyed the American History and ancient books.The grounds are large, but there are plenty of cafe's spread around so you're never far from a cold drink or snacks. There are also nice items in the gift shop.",Wannabekauai
40,"Beautiful Gardens, Interesting Museums...but a lot of Walking","This place is beautiful, but with an injured knee, it was a huge amount of walking between the areas.",exchef1
50,Lovely Collection and Grounds,"This relatively expensive, beautiful attraction takes at least two visits to see everything, but the ticket only covers one day (noon to four). We visited the main house and walked part of the garden trail and, unfortunately, ran out of time. Members are allowed to walk the trails longer. The guards are vigilant.One especially nice aspect for all of us, including those with food allergies, is their cafeteria. The food was good enough that we went back for lunch the next time we were in the area!Gift shop is full of colorful, varied items displayed within a background of classical music! A treat for the eyes and the soul.",H E
30,Great for culture vulture but not necessarily a 'must visit' if you only got limited stay/time in LA,"Great for art and botanical garden buffs but not for those whom don t fancy the art or garden scenes over Disneyland, Universal or Hollywood stuff.Having been a frequent visitor to LA and the whole circuit of amusement parks and science museums and LA s must visit cultural places, I thought I would add this place to my bucket list.However the visit did not meet my expectations in view of the lack of public transportation to here from Pasadena.secondly $25 is I feel too pricey as the exhibits are in no way matching those of art museums in NYC (MeT Art ) or Chicago. You can argue they throw in the various gardens in the price but on hot cloudless afternoon(typical LA climate) one would rather not walkabout the various gardens in many places unshaded.Maybe this plane is geared towards people from in state but seriously speaking you can visit similar gardens or museums in San Francisco.Not being overly critical here, my advice to foreign tourists is to give this place a wide berth as the entrance price and taxi ride to here is exorbitant. You might well chill down in downtown museums !Did not notice many foreign tourists here or tour buses understandably.",Highadventurer
50,When of my favorite places in the world,"I told my kids the name of this place and I could see the look of doubt in their eyes, but of course by the end of our visit they found it as enchanting as I always have. In fact, my son lives in LA and is considering becoming a member. You can meander through the gardens for hours and still not see everything, and each area offers something special and unique. The art exhibits are small, but quite impressive, with separate buildings housing different exhibits. Treat yourself to tea in the Tea House -- at $31 it's a bit pricey for cakes, but it's quite an elegant experience.",sabrinayb
50,Lovely Place with amazing Artwork,"Began my visit with the library. The library is beautiful and its displays were interesting. I got to see things like a Gutenberg Bible, a letter written by Sir Isaac Newton to Robert Hook, and old travel posters for Yosemite Park.Next, we visited the house, which is now home to the Huntingtons' art collection. Throughout the 2-storey house are statutes, pottery, and amazing paintings. This place rivals some art museums I have visited in regards to the artwork itself and how the artwork is displayed.My only regret is not having enough time to go through all the gardens. Only had enough time to walk through the rose garden and it was very lovely.Has a huge gift shop, bathrooms, a cafe, and car parking.",Wanderer_Jen
40,Superbly designed and maintained garden but quite expensive,"Beautiful botanical garden, superbly designed and maintained. Desert, Japanese (with a nice bonsai collection), and Chinese sections are in my opinion the most interesting. I particularly enjoyed the cactus collection which is found in a greenhouse located in the Desert Garden section and opens to the public on Saturdays only. It is quite big, so plan for at least 2-3 hours for a complete tour. It is quite expensive to get in (25 USD/person).",Voyager059
50,Truly a must see.,"If you are visiting the LA or Pasadena area you must stop in at the Huntington gardens. It is a spectacular collection of flowers, trees and gardens you will find. Be prepared for a lengthy walk. It is wheelchair friendly. Backpacks are allowed. It has plenty of shade through out the entire area. You will find a really neat hands on botanical gardens for the children and adults. There is a restaurant onsite. Plan on 6 hours or more to see it all.",Richard H
50,We didn't get past the Library and the European Art!,"The Huntington Library with its Shakespeare first folios, Gutenberg Bible, maps and many other fascinations kept us interested for several hours and the onto the European Art in the just as magnificent Huntington Mansion with its period furnishing and art took another hour or so. We did get to have a quick look at the American Art as well but that was brief as that gallery is being renovated. This left us with time to have little more than a cursory look at the gardens and resolve to return another day for an in-depth look at the vast gardens that included a cactus garden, a Japanese Garden and an Australian garden. We did however get to the shop - another must! Highly recommended if you are in LA.",Sydneysida

50,There is a scent garden and a lovely rose garden.,There is a historical rose garden that takes you back in time to the earliest roses. The scent garden was great. We just lined up near the entrance and followed a docent around for a free tour. It was completely worth it. The gardens are lovely and the historical buildings are great.,HaveringBob
50,The gardens are outstanding plus great art to boot!,The best of two worlds- nature and art. There are many gardens but the Desert garden full of cacti and succulents is simply amazing while the Garden of Flowing Fragrance (Chinese) is very lovely.

50,Art and garden lovers delight!,"Where else can you tour several different themed gardens and art galleries that contain actual well known works? The Huntington is the former estate of Henry Huntington, who amassed a vast art and literature collection with his wealth. Works by Gainsborough,Van der Weyden, and Mary Cassatt are just a small few of the beautiful selections to be found. The library itself contains rare books and prints by Chaucer, Thoreau, Twain, Shakespeare, and many more. Not into the fine arts? Then just spend the day walking through large botanical gardens, each a different theme. My favorites are the Japanese, Chinese, and Rose gardens. Regardless of what you choose to see, you will be busy all day. I enjoyed the Tea Room for lunch which is pricey, but worth it to experience a traditional tea. Before you leave, the gift shop is a must visit. This is not a typical tourist shop. Don't expect just T-Shirts and key chains. Expect fine gifts, stationary, toys, and music that are coordinated with the exhibits. Due to short hours of operation, it is best to get there right as they open.",StewartbarS

Next visit the conservatory then follow the map to the Rose Garden where you can have tea or lunch. Down the path to the Japanese Garden and fine collection of Bonsai and down through the Australian gardens to the Cactus and Succulent area.

The Chinese garden is just a lovely place that warrants you to take a seat on one of the many benches and take in the clean air and scenic beauty. If you're into taking a stroll around grounds for relaxation or even fitness, then this place is ideal. The parking is free. There is a cafe at the entrance that is super clean and has the best pastries. There are plenty of staff guiding you to scenic grounds and are very friendly and helpful. If you're in southern California, you wanna come through this.",brownybros21

If you have tea in the Rose Garden tea house--very good--plan on an hour. Don't miss the Japanese garden but it's a walk--once a month they do tours. The European art gallery in the Mansion takes 1-2 hours and we had no time for the American gallery. We raced through the Library exhibits to see the Magna Carta exhibit, now gone, and early Guttenberg bible and Chaucer books. Could have used an entire day.",cfuller603

But there are several other gardens: the Rose Garden, the Desert Garden, etc.Additionally, there are numerous areas just for children.Inside, the art is also amazing. Paintings of major importance, such as The Blue Boy and Pinkie: paintings you would expect in a museum such as the Met or the Louvre.

50,Hidden Gem,"What I have seen after two visits is just the Gardens. I will have to go back to see all of the great works of art. Growing up in Southern California, The Hunting has always been here (since 1912). It just took me a little time to finally go visit!",Jim H
50,One of our favorite places to visit,"We are members of the Huntington Library and try to go often for a walk or to look at the exhibits.The gardens are huge. My favorite sections are the Chinese garden and the Japanese garden. The Chinese garden has a large water feature (it is too grand to call it a pond) and I like walking around and looking at the koi. The Japanese garden has a zen garden in it and also a bansai tree exhibit. The path between these to sections is along a nice stream. There is also a nice section with ponds directly north of the main house.They way I count there are 3 different art galleries. The nicest is the one in the main house. It is mostly a permanent exhibit but there are a couple of small rooms that change. There is a gallery of American art that is nice too. The actual library has many historical items on exhibit and has a room for changing exhibits.We haven't tried the new cafe, but the food there looks pretty good and above average for ""museum food""There are many more things to see than I listed, you can return many times (as we have) and I think still not see it all!",So_Cal_Illini_81
40,Beautiful and peaceful place to visit.,"It was a rather warm day when we went, but it was well worth it. Huntington gardens is a gorgeous place to visit and spend at least 2 to 3 hours. Of particular beauty were the Japanese and Chinese Gardens, vey well maintained, and very serene. Thee were various exhibits while there, including the Magna Carta, which unfortunately because of a tight schedule, didn't get a chance to see. I can see that during cooler days, this is the place to dedicate a whole day to, its really quite amazing this is in the city, yet you feel in another world. Its the perfect family attraction, and can't wait to go back.",2lifeadventure
50,Mother Nature in Pasadena,"I live in a rented condo and though it's very nice I get claustrophobia sometimes. I moved to Pasadena from the beach so there was always the ocean. In Pasadena, for me, it's the gardens. Large green lawns, beautiful zonal plantings, a kid's garden. And that's not even mentioning the art and letters collection. There are programs of interest like music in the Chinese Garden and author readings in the auditorium, a famous tea room, plant sales, and a fabulous gift store. It's one of the must-sees of Pasadena.",slynnmirell
40,"I'd recommend this to a fellow plant-, art- or book-lover.","We saw the ads that said ""See the Magna Carta, leaving soon!' so we went--and felt a teeny bit cheated. because a) what was on display, while perhaps even more rare than copies of the MC, was actually a sort of draft document, and b) it might have been leaving display, but they actually own the thing. But, we're glad we went, because there was an excellent (small) pastel portrait show, plus the gardens. Plus Blue Boy and Pinkie. But it's expensive, so plan a full day there to take advantage of everything that's on offer.",cherimich
40,A Haven of Peace in the middle of a Busy City,"Our family always enjoy going out on this garden with different themes throughout the property. There's the Japanese Garden, the Chinese Garden (with some seating area where you can purchase Chinese snacks and drinks...yum!!), the Rose Garden with its tea room, and some museums as well. The greenhouse also house some tropical rain forest plants. Parking is relatively easy except on weekends where it gets quite busy with visitors. Ooh, and if you don't have annual membership make a point to visit on the first Thursday of the month. But make sure you call ahead, because they need to book a ticket for you.",RayT6040
50,This place is a must see!!!,"We went for the first time this past Saturday. Why did we wait so long? There was gardens everywhere, so be prepared to walk.

50,My FAVORITE outdoor space in SoCal; see tips to help with your visit,"I have been visiting “The Huntington” for about two decades and find it to be exciting, beautiful and relaxing, all at once. I go solo or with friends, family or dates. EVERBODY gets impressed! I would recommend a visit here to anyone who enjoys an indoor or outdoor artistic environment. [Disclosure: I am a member at the “Contributor” level, so my visits to the gardens are almost always during the weekend prior to opening to the general public]There are three main aspects to this attraction for casual visitors: (1) extensive botanical gardens; (2) a fine collection of European and American art, in both temporary and permanent exhibits; (3) first-rate library exhibits (e.g., illuminated manuscripts and texts of exceptional historical significance). There are also extensive research facilities, but admission is restricted to true “readers” and “researchers.”Here is what I would recommend for your visit (after dozens of trips, I do this as a matter of habit):(1) Arrive as early as you can, especially during the weekend or on a holiday. This also applies to warm days because the temperature can get up there as the day progresses. You should have footwear that will be comfortable to walk around in for at least 2 hours.(2) After passing by the Education and Visitor Center, walk to the right and aim for the Chinese Garden; this will start a counterclockwise trip around the property. I prefer to see all the outdoor sights before the temperature and crowds increase.(3) Your counterclockwise route will take you to the following, in order: Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, Australian/Subtropical Gardens, Jungle Garden and Lily Ponds, Desert Garden, Palm Garden.(4) Then, keep walking (if you’re not tired) and spiral in toward the center of the grounds, where you can visit the Shakespeare Garden, Herb Garden and Rose Garden.(5) Now you’ll be closer to the galleries to check out the art, if you’re in the mood.* European Art is in the Huntington Gallery (“the mansion”), in the center of the property* American Art is in the Scott Galleries (two linked buildings)* Special exhibits are in the Boone Gallery* Library- and science-related exhibits (awesome) are in the Library Exhibition Hall(6) The Conservatory has interesting indoor flora, and might be fun for kidsFor lunch visit the new café, which has been expanded, upgraded and moved from its former location to the north side of the visitor center. Seating is available both inside and outside. There are various walk-up (take a tray) stations serving grilled food, salads/sandwiches and pizza. The food is fairly good but, as with most museum offerings, the pricing is excessive. My little salad = $8.75; fountain drink = $2.59. The bottled drinks in the cooler case are upwards of $3 (uff!).In case you have to rest: there are many nice benches (often shaded) on which to sit and enjoy the scenery. My favorites are under the giant trees that can be found near the Lily Ponds and Palm Garden. Also, the new Rose Hills Foundation Garden Court (halfway along the Visitor Center) has several comfortable nice seats under the dome, where ceiling fans produce a nice breeze.In case you have to go: the are restroom facilities all over the place, including various locations throughout the grounds, i.e., you do not have to hightail it toward a gallery. The garden facilities are well-kept and adequately private.",Jim L
50,Enjoy your day with nature and art.,What a wonderful place to spend a day enjoying nature and art. The Huntington Botanical Garden has an enormous collection of cactus from all over the world.

Make sure to have tea in the tea room---great food and nice ambiance, thought a bit crowded. Reservations are highly recommended.

50,Go in the morning when it is cooler in the Botanical Gardens.,"I have a membership to the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens. It is overall, outstanding. I am going to comment on the gardens in this review. In this season I frequent the gardens because I bring my toddler granddaughter and she particularly loves the Japanese Garden with the Koi fish and turtles. It is a very refreshing and lovely garden, one you do not want to miss on a visit to the Huntington. Also the Children's Garden is a delight with an iconic wee blue wooden door for little ones to enter the garden through. Grab a picture of this with your child! It is like entering a Secret Garden. There are small people sized arbors and water spouts - little ones can wear swimsuits, but must have shoes on at all times. Also, no strollers are allowed in the Children's Garden and must be parked just outside the entryway. I think most fun for age 18 months to 7 or 8 years old. The Chinese Garden is lovely too, and you can dine at the Teahouse here.The food courtyard near the entry has definitely improved. Chicken Caesar Salad is good. Coffee drinks and yummy ice cream.",LuluGrace8
50,"Amazing and perfectly cared for is this wonderful Library and the Gardens. If you are in San Marino it is a true ""DO IT""","The Huntington Library and Gardens are fantastically beautiful and extraordinarily well cared for. Visitors are amazed.

50,"Beautiful, incredible gardens","This is a beautiful setting with plants from many regions of the world. Love the desert climate and Japanese sections and the Bonsai exhibit.

50,it takes two (days),"There's so much to see and enjoy, from the grounds to the exhibits, that the best strategy to is to expect to spend two or more days at the Huntington. If you've got toddlers, they'll LOVE the Children's Gardens so much, you can easily spend an afternoon there. But there's much to see in terms of art and artifacts. Consider picnicking on the grounds or enjoying an English Tea. Meandering about in the various gardens is an excellent way to pass a day. This is certainly not for thrill-seekers, but it's a retreat from maddening crowds.",linda c
50,Worth a visit,If you're looking to get away from the traffic an chaos of the big city then visit the Huntington. The various gardens and galleries are wonderful. Admission is steep- $25/person so come early.,lislander
50,"Wonderful place, avoid the tea room.","Stunning beauty, interesting history, a lovely place to roam, have a bite outdoors and relax. However the tea room is not the best. Service is snarky and prices are over the top for a buffet tea with stale bread and little to nothing between the bread.",JACB5
50,One of my favorite destinations in L.A.,"Although the price went up a lot since I was a kid (now $25), it's still worth it. Every garden has its own unique feature and each is well taken care of. You have the Japanese gardens with bamboo trees, bonsai trees, and a beautiful pond. The Chinese garden also has a pond with traditional Chinese architecture. Equally impressive was the desert garden with so many different kinds of cacti and plants that can only survive in hot, dry weather. It was amazing. Finally, we saw some French and British paintings from the Enlightenment period. The most famous painting at the Huntington Art Gallery is The Blue Boy.",LASeoulGuy
50,Deserving of more than a day,One entire day is not sufficient to truly discover or experience this place which not only is a museum and and art gallery and a series of gargantuan gardens and an arboretum....and its still big enough to lose oneself in solitude if desired- beautiful!,Forkandcase
50,One of the Largest and Varied Botanical Gardens in the World.,"The Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino CA, near LA and Pasadena has acres of exotic trees and other plants. There is plenty of free parking on a lot. There are several specialized gardens – a Desert Garden (my favorite), Australian Garden, Jungle Garden, Palm Garden, Rose Garden, Herb Garden, Japanese Garden, Chinese Garden, even a Shakespeare Garden. One can spend hours wandering around the extensive pathways and admiring plants from distant places, that were planted here decades ago and have grown into spectacular specimens. There are also exhibits in several buildings, including “Library Exhibits,” which houses rare publications, including many devoted to science. It is well worth the trip",capitol-hillian
50,Worth More Than One Visit,"I spent approximately 3 hours here and could only see part of it. Wonderful exhibits in the library and the art collections, with beautiful architectural features and elegant outdoor rooms.Still, I was most enchanted by the gardens, which blended from one type to another. All were beautiful but I will need more time for these on a next visit, especially the Chinese garden. The scent throughout the rose garden was exquisite. As I wandered under a long arbor, I met an artist/craftsman who has been working for more than five years on restoring the sculptured (very skillful) cement trees that support the arbor. He stopped his work to explain it and answer my questions; it was a fascinating project.The day I visited was extremely hot and the water fountains I found were not working. If you go on a similarly hot day, plan your route for strategic stops at the tea rooms. Thank goodness I could revive myself when i got back to the admissions area by getting cabernet gelato and iced tea from the coffee shop!",SEEKSanFrancisco
50,Does not get any better !!,"This facility is both a museum, art gallery and gardens. Easy was spectacular. My wife and I went back a second time during our seven day visit to Pasadena. The many gardens (Japanese, Chinese, etc) were some of the nicest I've ever seen. The art gallery, while not as large as the Norton Simon was still impressive and the library/museum which had a display of a Gutenberg bible along with a show on printing was not to be missed. If I could only go one place in the entire Los Angeles are this would be it!",Elon B
50,Amazing gardens,"We visited two different days and barely scratched the surface. The Chinese garden, still under construction, is already a massive, authentic work of art. The well-established Japanese, desert, and rose gardens are magnificent.

Amazing treasures. Plenty of parking, cafeteria food/restaurant on siteJust so-so: We paid extra for a docent tour. We had expected the tour to be more about the plants, paintings and collections, but it was more of a history of Mr. Huntington. The docent wasn't able to gauge the audience's interest and age. Would not do the docent tour again, but walk around ourselves.Was not able to stay long (2 hours) so missed the back part of the garden (the tour took 1.5 hours) Need a good 4 hours to see everything at a good pace.

The gardens are interesting with their own individual character, you really do feel like you are entering completely separate climates as you walk through the gardens. The rose garden is awe inspiring, one never knew how many different kinds of roses or how interesting the names are. The buildings are a nice break from the gardens and provide fascinating art work and cool library. Would totally recommend this experience.",jrhickman
40,Overpriced!,"I have been visiting the Huntington my entire life, more when I was younger than recent years because the admission has gone up so much. They are rolling in money; no reason they need to charge that much other than elitism. I was going to give them three stars because of it, but added a star because of their recent astounding drought tolerant garden transformation.",AB4415

50,Better than ever!,"I've been visiting the Huntintington for over forty years, and I can honestly say it's better than its ever been. Recent renovations to the front entrance included a buffet style cafe which offers nice views of the gardens. And you can eat there without paying the admission fee!Go with the idea that you will be spending most of your day, not just because there is so much to see, but you may feel like you aren't getting good value for your money for a short visit. It can cost as much as $25.00 to get in. And don't make the mistake of arriving after lunch since it's only open until 4:30. This makes no sense to me, but I guess they have their reasons.Don't miss the Chinese gardens. They are sublime! And if you can find a docent ask him or her about the gorgeous limestones used throughout the garden. And the succulent gardens are world class and other worldly at the same time. Such fascinating plants used in gorgeous and clever designs!The American art gallery is currently being expanded which is needs so that will be a welcome addition as well.In short, just go with a sense of discovery. Wear very comfortable walking shoes and a sun hat on hot days. Bring a camera and prepare to be impressed.",6Quinns
50,All in One,"Extensive grounds, including beautiful gardens reflecting different geographies and cultures, art museums, rare book library, special exhibitions and a number of cafes and restaurants. Among the highlights are the Japanese gardens and tea house, Chinese gardens boasting an abridged version of the Summer Palace garden in Beijing, Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Pinkie portraits and original Shakespeare manuscripts. It's very easy (and relaxing) to spend a day here but you need to reserve at least 2-3 hours to get any sense of the place. This was the estate of Henry Huntington, who created the Southern Pacific Railroad and once owned all of San Marino (the very pricey suburb of Pasadena) as well as Los Angeles' ""Red Car"" trolley system.",jdh44laca
50,What an outstanding LA gem,"We spent six days in the LA area and found the Huntington to be an outstanding experience. First off, it's hard to say if the gardens or the multiple museums are better then the other. The gardens were beautiful and presented in multiple formats. The art museums were great as well as the manuscript library with the magna carta!, Gutenburg (sp) bible and a number of remarkable documents. Expect to spent 4 to 5 hrs if you want to see what is there. Enjoy!",Steve B
50,Fun for the whole family,"We were lucky to go on one of their free days, so we saved a lot of money. The Gardens are a little expensive, but you could spend all day here.

It has a Gutenberg Bible and a rare, preliminary 13th century draft of the Magna Carta.In addition to the library, there's an art collection that's truly world-class. A couple of the most familiar paintings include Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy"" and Thomas Lawrence's ""Pinkie."" It's collection of British portraits is grand.The gardens, including the desert, Australian, and Japanese gardens, are worth the trip and price of admission alone.If you have several hours and enjoy beauty and history, this is where you should definitely go.

We were there from open to closing, didn't linger, and didn't come close to seeing even half of what is available. The gardens are spectacular. The library had a special exhibit on the Magna Carta - a must see if you can. Even the standing exhibits are special- don't miss the Gutenberg Bible!We ate at the cafe. Not cheap of course but it is super convenient and it tasted good.You'll have a great day. Just be sure to bring your walking shoes!",Michael P

50,An Amazing Place to Visit.,"I originally went to the Huntington Library to see one of the very few Gutenberg Bibles still in existence. I've since returned numerous times and not even come close to seeing all it has to offer.The library itself has the Gutenberg Bible as well as numerous other books on display. Might not sound too interesting, but I found it fascinating to see the animals portrayed in ""science texts"" from a few hundred years ago. The medical texts are just as interesting. Many historic documents from the US and Europe are also on display.In addition to the library, the Huntington also offers three buildings of art galleries as the Huntington family collected art as well as rare books. I believe the most famous painting they display is Blue Boy and Pinkie, but there is much more to see. The home the Huntingtons lived in with many of its furnishings are still intact.The buildings of art are surrounded by 15 themed gardens. My favorite garden (and worth a visit on its own) is the new Chinese gardens. With many of the elements of this garden coming from China, this is just a spectacular space. I have spent hours in this garden exploring all the paths, waterways, and buildings. The Chinese Garden Tea House serves a small but amazing menu and provides several awesome views.I have also visited the Rose Garden Tea Room. It requires reservations and is a bit pricey, but is worth the price for a special occasion. The staff works hard to accommodate everyone's taste in tea or drink and the food is served as an all you can eat buffet and is elegant and super yummy.My only complaint about the Huntington is their short hours. They do not open until 10:30 and close at 4:30 during the summers, and other times of the year the hours are even more limited.",Emily S

50,"If you love history, then this library is something not to miss","Truly one of the historical wonders of the world, and I'm not exaggerating. Want to see an original Chaucer Canterbury Tales? Want to see documents from the original Spanish explorers to Southern California? An original Shakespeare play? Then spend an afternoon at the Huntington Library and Gardens and see this and many, many other amazing pieces of human history.",Chaslosh
50,BEAUTIFUL,"Huntington Library is not only a library, it also has beautiful gardens around it...there's a desert garden, a japanese garden, and many other areas. It's great to come here for a nice walk out in the open. The park is very well taken care of, and the museum is worth a visit!",Tina C
50,"Art, History, Science, and Biology all in one Spectacular Setting","My wife and I recently visited the Huntington Library and Botanical gardens just to spend a quality afternoon together. After witnessing all of its splendor, I simply cannot understand how I have lived in Southern California all my life and never visited the Huntington before. It’s safe to say that it has something for everyone, whether you’re an artwork aficionado or a science geek (like myself). We only allocated enough time to spend about 3 hours there and it was nowhere near long enough. We will definitely be going back, and soon!The Huntington is set atop a picturesque plateau in the affluent city of San Marino which is nestled comfortably in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. The grounds are expansive and sprawling, which caught me off guard because when you’re driving up to the front gate it seems to just appear all of a sudden in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Parking is free and ample so even on a busy day you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a good spot. The fee for visiting is nominal and helps to fund the facility, which is definitely a noble and worthwhile cause.The Huntington is divided into a plethora of different areas, each with their own designated theme. Most of the original buildings are dedicated to art galleries, museums, libraries, and etc, while the open air areas are dedicated to different types of gardens. I appreciate art, but I found the gardens to be much more appealing (personally speaking). The gardens range from desert, to subtropical, to forest, to jungle, and almost everything else in between. I was especially fascinated with the conservatory, which features interactive exhibits and hands-on science experiments.I could go on about the Huntington, but it’s one of those places you just have to see to appreciate. I will probably add more to this review after my next visit. If you’re in the Southern California area then definitely take a day to visit this incredible venue. It will do nothing but fascinate, captivate, and mesmerize. I love this place!",MShelbourn

50,An oasis in a car nightmare,"The library needs to be visited if you are into cultural things and yes we did get to see an original Guttenberg Bible. But, its the gardens that need to be seen, they are vast and amazing and when you are strolling around through them its hard to remember that you are in the vast car park called LA. As an extra bonus we had a lovely guided tour about the Japanese Tea Ceremony. This place was an outstanding highlight of LA for us.",DavidofWatford
50,Magnificent gardens and museums!,"I was impressed with the immense size of the gardens, tremendous variety of plants from around the world and fantastic curated exhibitions in the museums on site.

There's also a decent cafe and posh tea room in case you get hungry.Tip: wear comfortable shoes, a hat and sunscreen.",CoastalCruiser27

They also have an amazing tea house with all you can eat...the scones are delicious, plus they let you take them home if you didn't finish them. This place is very relaxing...my favorite is the desert garden, which at first I was hesitant but I absolutely fell in love with it. Also you can get free admission, I think it's the first Thursday of every month, you have to request tickets a month in advance. I have visited in all seasons, and let me just say...each of them is my favorite, never a wrong time to go here...the Huntington is always a good idea💁🏻.",Monica V
50,What a wonderful place to wander.,Although i only visited twice it is very memorible. it is delightful to wander through each type of garden and be in awe at all the work that goes into this beautiful place. You will not be able to do this beautiful place in one visit.,Regina M
50,Docent tour of gardens - excellent,"I went to the Huntington Library and Gardens often as a child, but I hadn't been again in many, many years. It is still a magnificent collection of indoor and outdoor interests, and my only disappointment is that visitors can no longer ring the gong in the Japanese garden. I am told that they only ring it on the Lunar New Year holiday. The new-to-me Chinese garden was a pleasure and beautifully executed. The library is also a high point. Personally, I'm not a fan of portraiture, so the gallery home is not my favorite, but other people enjoy it. Highly worth more than one visit in order to take in the whole place. In fact, do your best to preselect your interests as it might not be possible to do it all in one day. Also, be aware that you will want hat and sunblock to tour the gardens, especially in summer.",Innerartist

50,A Luscious Escape in San Marino,"We spent enchanted afternoons and evenings at the Huntington Library and Gardens over the past three years - whenever the pace of life required a slow down or visitors were seeking something unique and wonderful. Whether it was exploring new exhibits, the various climates of the grounds, the tea garden or just a quiet escape, every visit was a reminder of the value of community-minded benefactors to the people of the Pasadena area.

50,"A Must Do, Can't Miss","A premiere set of museums surrounded by beautiful gardens. Plan ahead! You cannot do it in one day two is the minimum because the gardens are worth a day and the library/museums are worth at least a day. Plan ahead! The beautiful Rose Garden Tea Room is a delightful place for lunch - and their teas are handcrafted. Admission price does NOT include the Tea Room; it is a separately priced item but sooooooo worth it. If you absolutely can't, there are other dining options, e.g. coffee shop, a newly opened café, and a Chinese Garden specialty house. Since it's operating hours are 10:30-4:30, it's kind of a short day so to make the most, be there when it opens 'cause you will surely be there when it closes.",The_Sequoias
50,Simply Amazing!,"The gardens are absolutely wonderful! It's a great place to go to take a nice little stroll through all different types of gardens or just to sit and read a book on a bench in the shade. If you prefer art instead they have great galleries. The whole place is very clean and nice and so big that crowds aren't really a problem even on weekends. I would definitely recommend the cactus garden, there's a large variety there and you will likely see different types of butterflies and hummingbirds while you're there.",LucyAbu
50,Spend a most beautiful day here.,"Every time I go to these amazing gardens, there is something new to experience. Every season brings added joys as the buds open and leaves change colors. Don't miss the indoor spaces for viewing ancient works of literature and spirituality.

No one should miss the Library Exhibition Hall which includes a Guttenberg Bible. There is even a delightful maze and play area in the Children's Garden.

We spent the day touring the botanical gardens, and the wonderful art collection. Some friends gave us good advice, get a picnic lunch, we went to Whole Foods and bought picnic items before arriving at the Huntington. Start your tours walking the grounds, like the Desert Garden, Chinese Garden, or the Japaese Garden. Have your lunch, and then walk back to the Huntington home to enjoy walking through the beautiful art collection, including Gainsborough's Blue Boy. The grounds open ant 10:30 AM and close in the afternoon. Take a hat, comfortable walking shoes, and a soft demeanor, you will be rewarded. If you get past the lush Rose Garden I will be surprised.

The Japanese and Chinese gardens were well maintained and absolutely beautiful. We just visited last week and were lucky enough to see the water lotus in bloom. The is a cafe in the Chinese gardens where you can enjoy a quick snack by the water. If you like shrimp the shrimp spring roll (it is fried so technically and egg roll) was full of fresh chunks of juicy shrimp! Plan to visit on a nice day and bring plenty of water/snacks. Well worth the price of entry.,travelbrat20

50,The Gem of Pasadena,"The next time you are in LA, take some time out to visit the Huntington Museum and Gardens in Pasadena. It is such a treat! First are the 120 acres of year-round gardens with what seems like miles of walking paths. There's the Chinese Garden of Scented Fragrance with a teahouse (and the coolest stands of bamboo I've ever seen); the Japanese garden with ceremonial teahouse; the desert garden; the Australian garden; the children's garden, and of course, the rose garden. If you happen to be in the area in late April or early May, the rose garden is a MUST.Best is that just a few years ago the Huntington stopped using pesticides and cut back on its watering yet the roses are thriving.But wait there's more....in the old Huntington mansion is a museum of European art, which Henry and Arabella (his wife and his aunt) Huntington collected. You'll see Gainboroughs, a Van Dyke, ""Pinkie"" and ""The Blue Boy"" and many others.A newer museum building houses a collection of more contemporary American art with Frank Stellas, Warhol, Lichtenstein and other represented.AND THEN....there's the library of rare books and papers, where you can see up close and personal (but behind glass) one of 42 extant copies of the Gutenberg Bible on vellum and an early Canterbury Tales.Not knowing that there was so much to see and do, we hadn't left enough time to explore the library but there is always next time!",LilyK88

Although they have designated picnic places, i've seen people sprawl out across the lawn sipping on some questionable beverage.It's relaxing and away from the traffic that you forget you're in LA. This is recommended for families and seniors. If you're younger and this is your first trip to LA, i'd probably skip it for another visit.They also have high tea, reservations recommended. $25 entry per person unless your a senior. Then all the deals start flying in .. like quarter coffee at Mc Donalds.",JolieCrush
50,Always amazing,"I love art. I love history. I love miles of pathways walking through various gardens, especially if I can see exotic plants I've never seen before as well as plants that I can grow in my own yard, here in Southern California. The Huntington scores top marks on every count. So few places any more are ideal to stroll with someone and just talk and think and be together.Another thing I love about the Huntington is that the price for an annual membership is very close to the entrance price for our family. So if you're going more than once, just get a membership. I can't wait to go again and again this year.",Michael P
50,History and Art lovers you will love this place,"Coming to Los Angeles and the Hollywood scene is not really your thing then make the time to travel to The Huntington Library and Art Collections which is far removed from all the typical celebrity touristy attractions. The Huntington is a very large which means you will really need to plan to spend the whole day out here to take in the botanical gardens, historical grand buildings and many pieces of art. Even if you do not have a car if you are fit it is less than 1 mile walk (20 Minutes) from the nearest bus stop and you will walk by some amazing looking homes.",Marty
50,This must be a priority if you are in Pasadena!,"This is more than a library or museum; it's an all day adventure. With over 200 acres of grass, gardens, and art galleries, and a cafe and beautiful store, you can easily spend an entire day here. The European art galleries have some stunningly beautiful paintings by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Van Dyke and others, and the setting is the 2 story mansion once lived in by Henry and Annabelle Huntington. The rooms on the first floor display ornate antique french furniture along with the paintings, making it so pleasing to the eye as one wanders from living room to dining room to library to drawing room. It almost feels as it you are in a private home. Upstairs in all the bedrooms, which are mostly enormous, are more works of art and furniture; many writing desks and side tables with amazingly colorful marble tops. Every piece of work is explained with a placard on the wall, but you can also get a free audio tour when you first arrive. You input the number of the painting or room, and listen to an expert describe what you are seeing or how it got there.The American art galleries were partially closed, and still I found them fascinating. The Mary Cassatt ""Breakfast in Bed"" is one of her best, I think, and it's to nice to hear some background about the artist and the painting.The library exhibits include a Gutenberg Bible, numerous other first edition Gutenberg press books in their original bindings (1470's), and a Chaucer's Canterbury Tales first edition; also Hamlet, first folio. Older school kids will enjoy the Science and Medicine rooms, with books and inventions from the 14th century onward. Hundreds of lightbulbs from Edison's time forward, telescopes, medical books, Astronomy books; from when experts thought the sun rotated around the earth, and lots of fascinating stuff! The cafe has nice choices in sandwiches, salads, pizza and entrees, to keep you going for another few hours. Reasonable prices, and you can sit outside and overlook the beautiful grounds. The Botanical center is almost overpowering with it's rain forest under a three story glass structure, and it's side gardens, featuring a dry garden and experimental gardens. The rose gardens are like a trip back in time; all are labelled so you can write down the ones you like. They have done a nice job of integrating some water-wise plants into the landscape here too. Overall, a delightful way to spend a day, educational, inspirational and peaceful.",Leslie E
50,A Must See in Pasadena,Since growing roses is my love and therapy seeing the rose garden as well as all the other gardens was awesome. Not to mention the wonderful tapestries and artwork from around the world as featured in the museums. If ever in Pasadena I will return to see more.,Charlotte S
50,Simply Fantastic,"Where else in the world can you experience world class gardens and world class museums all in the same setting? Well you really can do both at the Huntington in San Marino, California. With eclectic nature vistas that include a Japanese and Chinese garden, a Shakespeare garden, lilly ponds and an amazing desert area, one can spend all day wandering the grounds. But there is so much more - art galleries full of English and American paintings, glimpses of some of the world's greatest books, a greenhouse that would appeal to all ages, and on it goes. The only drawback to the Huntington is that the hours are a bit limited. Guests are not allowed on the grounds until 10:30 and must leave by 5 pm. Since San Marino is somewhat inland, it gets quite hot there in the summer and it would be so nice to start one's adventure in the morning hours when the warmth has not yet crept up. However, that really is the only drawback to an amazing place.",RCYankee

50,Amazing gardens!,"This was beautiful, wish we had arrived earlier but since we had planned our day a certain way we got here around 1:30pm. To enjoy it all, spend all day here.Too many gardens to name and it was a lovely walk. There is a cafe which serves food and there's a great variety. The chicken breast sandwich was overpriced though. Didn't want to eat too much but the chicken breast had been thinly sliced and was about 5-6mm. For what we were charged, that was bad value. My boyfriend had a hot dog which was a more appropriate price I thought.Aside from that, if you plan on using public transport, we got on the metro gold line and got off at Allen station, walked straight down south and you will see the gates to the Huntington Gardens. It's about a 20-25 minute walk. We left at the other gate (east of the gardens) and walked further south to catch a bus back into L.A.",Meeshlee
40,Wealthy,"Very nice place to visit on a nice day. There is a lot of walking involved, sometimes up hills. The free parking lot is pretty big, but we visited on a Memorial Day Sunday afternoon, and had to park on the street. There was also a wedding that evening, so some areas were blocked off. The grounds are large and there is plenty to do and see. There is a large lawn that my four year old enjoyed running around on. The new Chinese garden is well designed and better suited for photography than the somewhat crowded Japanese garden. There is always something in bloom somewhere, and there is lots of art indoors if the weather is bad. The membership is well worth the price if you live nearby.",Brbnkseaj
50,Wish We'd Had More Time,"A close friend had suggested we visit the Huntington Library a while ago. We go to CA often, but this was our first opportunity to go - and it won't be the last time we visit there! We had no idea what to expect. It's not just a library, but also a museum, amazing gardens and so much more! We were overwhelmed and just did not have the time or energy to see everything - we wished we'd had more than one day there. We had a docent guided tour of the gardens from an obviously well trained and enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide -who made our visit that much more incredible and interesting. After touring the gardens for a couple of hours, we visited several of the buildings and were blown away by the displays and information. In one building, we each went our separate ways for about an hour and both came out raving about what we saw. If I lived in the LA area, I would definitely join as a member here, so I could go often.

40,Impressive place,"This is a large place with a library with many antiquities, an art museum, the usual store and food place.The gardens are the most impressive part of this place.It is expensive and it is large. Plan to stay a long time.",Dennis D
40,Impressive museum,The library museum has impressive collections and antiquities. The art museum is also nice and an interesting collection.The gardens are the most impressive part of this place. Many different gardens on very large grounds.It is expensive but a fine price if you spend most of the day.,Dennis D
50,Nice and Relaxing,"The cost of entrance was 25.00 on the weekend, very high I thought. Rather large grounds, with lots of cool plants and flowers to check out. I would think that all of the weddings that seem to be going on after hours, the income from those would help defer the cost of entrance. (costing $100,000 or more)",Mark J
40,Beautiful afternoon,"This is a first class museum, garden and historical gem. The art exhibits are first class. Our favorite was the old mansion, which is lovely and classy.",R H
50,wished - I live closer ..I'd go more often !,"visited the gardens for the 1 st time recently - , after a rain and weather not too hot yet in San Marino ! - way difficult to find among the winding roads leading to the place..new Chinese Gardens, recently open was pretty - can even order ' noddles plates ' for a meal ! lotus cakes could been better with MORE filling - need a better vender ?ran around - OK WALKED around the whole place, seeing every garden / area for more than 5.5 hours and still didn't get into - every house/ museum !did see ' Blue Boy and "" Pinkie"" though and amazing the Huntingtons willing to collect and share ...slightly commercialize but heck someone and $$$ had to keep up the grounds ?not cheap at $ 25.00/person entrance fee but worth it . TEA Room packed and I wasn't interested , especially without a reservation - been to nicer places for TEA ...Children Gardens - cute and hubby and I had fun checking out the area. like the teepee volcano!Desert gardens - LOTS of Cacti - minimal shade and hills !people everywhere but place large enough , not to feel too crowded ( compare to the parking lot )even witness a marriage proposal in the Japanese Gardens - sneaky husband to be - had a photographer friend , hiding in the trees recording the event ! lots of couples hand in hand...plenty of benches for couples to hang or old folks to rest ...",Roxanne M
40,Stroll Through Beautiful Gardens,"This is a great place to spend the day. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as the estate is larger than you would imagine. There has also been a major landscaping renovation. The plants are now more drought tolerant and there are less lawn areas. Unfortunately, the lawn in the statuary garden is full of weeds and thistles. This could be the result of recent weather conditions.There are 15 gardens to explore including Japanese and Chinese Gardens, a Rose Garden, an Australian Garden, Children's Garden, a rain forest and art museums.There is also a Tea Room in the Rose Garden that serves a very nice selection of tea sandwiches and desserts. Reservations are required.I would suggest carrying water bottles as this is a prodigious property to explore. All buildings and most gardens are accessible to visitors with mobility impairments.http://www.huntington.org",SoCalFrancie

50,Beautiful Gardens,"I hadn't been to the Huntington Gardens for decades - and boy has it changed! The entrance has been redone with a beautiful water feature, the Chinese pavilion made me feel like I was back at the Summer Palace in Beijing, and the herb garden and the rose garden still looks wonderful. We spent 4 hours and barely touched the entirety of the gardens, and didn't even get to see any of the exhibits. But what a wonderful day this was! If you like being outside, you will enjoy yourself!",Vicki K

If I lived in LA I'd be a member.Unbelievable, enthusiastic docents - I'd be one if I lived there.You should know the basics - original manuscripts in the library, Blue Boy and Pinkie. The Chinese Garden was new to me. Get there when they open and plan to spend the day. You can;t see it all in a day and I can;t imagine anywhere better to be.",RayF237
50,A relaxing gorgeous spot,My first time to the gardens was extraordinary. There is so much to look at and admire that you're almost overwhelmed at first. It would be fun for family as well if you're looking for a leisurely day to walk around and have lunchThe tea room is a tiny little air-conditioned spot with all sorts of foods and desserts. I suggest going to this at least once.,Klkoklk

50,A must see Southern California destination.,"The Huntington Library and Gardens features one of the best gardens in the country, and certainly in Southern California. I am always impressed by the amount of culture that one experiences visiting the gardens as well, coupled with the truly extraordinary plant life represented. The herb garden is always a hidden favorite of mine as well; and don't forget to stop in to see the library, especially if you are a book nerd like me!",Jordan H
50,Great Day Outside,"First off, plan to visit on a day where you won't over heat. March-May is the best time of year from my experience. Second, take sunglasses, sunscreen, or a hat. Third, relax an enjoy.It will take around 2-4 hours depending on how long you can last, how quickly you walk, what you want to see, and whether you plan on eating. The new entry complex has a full cafe and a separate coffee counter which serves gelato and baked goods. The new food options seem to have cut down on the crowding at the Tea House, my party of four was seated immediately with no reservations at 2:30 on a sunday (unheard of, you should probably call ahead).Highlights include the Chinese Garden, which is undergoing expansion, the rose garden which is miraculous during spring, the main house which is the home of Blue Boy and Pinky. But there is so much more. My favorite part is the cactus and succulent garden, it is amazing, and there is so much wildlife; lizards, bumble bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds.",SionnanH
50,A San Marino hidden treasure!,"The Huntington Library and Gardens are in a word SPECTACULAR! Be sure to take advantage of the wonderful docent led tours if you can... docents are VERY well trained and spend a year in training for each area that they are tour leaders (I know as spent 15 years as a Library docent!!)... this is a wonderful place for just roaming around in the gardens, seeing the wonderful collection of English landscapes and portraits, the Virginia Scott Steele gallery of American art and furnishings, and the Library filled with such treasures as an original and complete Gutenberg Bible, the Original Elephant folios of Audubon's Birds of America, Shakespeare's folios, and of course the Ellesmere Chaucer!!! This is a very special place and if you are in the vicinity of Southern California, a place NOT TO MISS!!! (Reservations are not necessary to visit The Huntington (with the exception of Free Days). Tickets may be purchased at the time of your visit.) See their website: http://huntington.org/PS: Great kids programs too!!!!!",savvytravelerCal
50,Lovely place,"I only had an hour and a bit here but I really enjoyed the experience.It was a bit hot to wander in the gardens, but I enjoyed the Library and the Main House. I took the guided tour via voice recorder, which was free. I'd highly recommend it as it gives extra insight into what you are seeing.The gardens are lovely, but it was a super-hot day which was a shame.It would be a great place to spend a bit longer.",Quack_quack_quackl
50,Exquisite Day,The grounds of the Huntington are lush and exquisite. We roamed around in its quiet setting and literally smelled the flowers in their gorgeous outdoor settings. There is a small museum and it was well represented but we were there for the floral creations and it dod not disappoint.,Ann B
50,Awesome!,"Huntington Library in Pasadena, California is well worth the trip. It sits on 120 acres of diverse and beautiful gardens. There are Chinese, Australian, Rose, Desert,Japanese and Jungle gardens to name a few. There are a many things that are hands on exploration for both adults and children. Huntington's mansion has over 500,00 original books and manuscripts such as the original Gutenberg bible, Canterbury tales, Mark Twain, etc. Fascinating! Other museums on site contain millions of prints, sculptures and artwork such as the original Blue Boy and Pinkie. It's difficult to see all of it in one day. Bring a good pair of walking shoes and dress comfortably. This is an experience not to be missed!",drgnldy52

50,Too much for a day.,There are so many things to do here..that one day does not work for me. So I have gone many times and try to go different times of year. The library offers insight to a time and society gone by. The gardens give you a chance to travel the horticulture world. .,Jerry P
50,Wonderful Gardens and Exhibits - A perfect place to spend the day,"I had not been here since I was a child and was really looking forward to the visit. While I can't manage to keep plants alive at home, I love wandering through gardens and these do not disappoint. The entrance is well laid out and very inviting with many benches. The main garden ways are wide, so you never feel crowded and even the unpaved paths are hard packed and wide enough that you can easily pass another group. Only a few sections are steep but there are places to rest. From the cactus to the Japanese gardens, you will find nothing but the serenity of nature artfully laid out and very carefully maintained. There are places to eat spread out, both for full meals or just for a snack and a quick bite. The statues, the ponds, the buildings and the lakes are not to be missed; we saw plenty of koi, ducks, geese and turtles.One of the galleries was closed and another just had a single room, so you might want to call to see what exhibits are there if you are traveling from a great distance in order to check to see. The main house is an amazing visit, not only for the architecture but the art. If you love books, make sure to visit the Library to see the amazing books they have on view (protected behind glass).",Laura R

40,Huge botanical gardens + so much more,"Gorgeous gardens to meander through. Different than the standard LA hype. So many acres, it is easy to spend at least half a day here. A whole day would allow you to see everything – museums are there as well.",traveller2332
50,A Treat!,"The Huntington has recently opened a new, easy to access entrance from the North, and new facilities for the reception area, and to house the impressive Steele collection. A visit to ""Blue Boy"" and ""Pinky"" are always encouraged. Take the time to tour some of the gardens - Japanese, Australian, Rose Palm, Sculpture etc. And don't forget the manuscript / document collection. A week should be enough to cover everything.",GentleKnight
50,New visitor center and cafe!,"Three years ago we visited and there was a lot of refurbishing going on and the Chinese garden was open but not finished. This time the house was open and they had just opened a new visitor center and a nice large café. I really enjoyed the new additions especially the new larger museum store which has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl. This time we also took some friends along with their 16yr old son. We are all from the Seattle area so this was new to them and they really had a good time. The art, the library, the gardens, especially the Japanese and the cactus garden. The café food was good and fresh. A little standing in line but worth it. If I lived closer I would become a member!",ToniB119
50,Must see!,"Beautiful place to learn about the history of Southern California and the Huntington family.There is so much to do here, and great for everyone who enjoys learning, history, art, and even going for walks among beautiful plants and follows.Many of the buildings are new or updated. It is a really well maintained piece of history. Enjoy looking at all the beautiful old homes in Pasadena as you drive here too!By the way, the bookstore is awesome. So many great and unique gift ideas!!",Carrie B
50,First visit - hope to return!,"Had a wonderful time strolling these beautiful gardens and grounds. The Japanese Garden and Desert Garden was my favorites by far. Australian Garden was a little underwhelming. All the gardens could use better signage on pathways, as we found ourselves doubling back by mistake several times. The artwork in the Huntington Mansion was incredible and we enjoyed lunch in the Cafe. Hope to return here when the roses are in full bloom - I'm sure it will be spectacular!",Hippster
50,New Entrance is Magnificent,Went to the members only preview of the new entrance to the complex. The Orientation Gallery does an excellent job of letting the visitor (either new or experienced) know how the Huntington was started by Henry Huntington. They have included a model of one of his Pacific Electric trollies and a map of the extensive system. There is a short video telling the Huntington story. The new Cafe' has good food and an paralleled view of the Desert Garden. The new book store is much larger with a lot more to see (and buy). California is very fortunate to have The Huntington to enjoy. Become a member so you can go whenever you wish.,TerrywHamilton

40,Beautiful Gardens,"These gardens are really amazing, I know an over used word, but in this case it's true! I loved the Chinese and the Japanese with Bonsai, my husband loved the cactus and succulents. We ate at the cafe outside tearoom both days. Not artist friendly for traveling artist just to warn other traveling artist but there is so much to see and so much ground to cover we were busy with are cameras for two days. We went on a Saturday with Sunday open (no plans) and went back on Sunday because we felt we hadn't done the cactus area justice. There's also museums and house gallery. Great place!",travelingartist_8
50,What a GEM !!!,Incredible grounds/gardens with well thought out flow of foot traffic. The house is wonderful to walk through. What a vision he had and the results are terrific. If I lived ing the area I would have a full membership and would be there once a week.,Bruce D
40,Glad to give it a second chance,"The last time I have visited this place was when I was in the third grade. I didn't appreciate it very much back then. Thanks to Tripadvisor's high reviews, we decided to give it a try.This place is a hidden gem in the city.We started off with the cactus garden and then to the Japanese garden. We are glad we took that route because it gave us something to look forward to as we walked throughout the garden. Because there is a lot of walking involved, we might have skipped and assumed the cacti wouldn't be anything special if we started from the other side. Both sides are so beautiful.Another plus was rose garden was in full bloom. As we entered the rose garden, we smelled the sweet roses from the nice breeze.Wear comfortable walking shoes. I wore my Converse Chucks and was sore the next day despite my daily workout.",kewpiemayodoll40
50,always wonderful,"this is a place of many faces: gardens, galleries, shops, etcthe gardens are fabulous, especially the newer chinese garden they have done a fabulous job and it is now quite full of vegetation which makes it restful and photogenic there are several art galleries with a wide range of styles and eras also a big collection of silver items & porcelaines everyone can find something to like the food is the only place i think needs work",brittGlendora_Ca
50,The best thing I have done in a long time!,"I think we might have been here on the most perfect day of the year, but this is by far the best thing I have done so far this year. We managed to stumble along into a tour given by a botanist of the desert garden, learned all about the plants and their history at the Huntington, adaptations, etc. Then we managed to run into a friend's partner who happens to be in charge of catering only to find that that was the first day that the new cafe was open! He sent us to eat at the Chinese Gardens since we wanted something different. We had a lovely ramble through the Chinese and Japanese gardens, ate incredible shrimp spring rolls, cold yam noodles, and spare rib stew, got to see Shakespeare's First Folio, an early edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, some incredible illuminated texts and more! We then took some time in the absolutely overwhelmingly stunning rose gardens. One was more magnificent than the next. And we didn't even get to the art museums! We spent 5 hours here and it was absolutely magical. I can't recommend this enough. Perfect for a day of leisure and joy!",wombat1223
30,"Disappointing Art, Interesting Library Exhibits","My wife and I visited the Huntington primarily to check out the art collection. Headlined by Gainsborough's ""Blue Boy,"" the European collection struck us as heavy on portraits by big-name artists and not very exciting. The ceramics were attractive but nothing special. The highlight of the American collection is an okay Edward Hopper. Overall the art left us disappointed. The library was more interesting, with manuscript pages from well-known authors, such as Jack London, the ashes of the manuscript of London's ""The Sea Wolf,"" and a Gutenberg Bible We strolled around the pleasant grounds but did not focus on the gardens, so I make no comment about them. At $19 each, we felt overcharged.",Jeffrey B
50,The Stately Huntington Gardens and Library,"The Huntington Library and Gardens is a lovely way to spend an afternoon with guests. The entrance and grounds are newly rennovated showing drought tolerant plantings and water saving landscapes. However, the highlight is the Chinese Garden decorated with rock sculptures and bridges spanning ponds with koi swimming below. Visitors should be forewarned to wear walking shoes and if the weather is warm, to wear protection. The new cafe provides a comfortable place to sit and rest. Don't expect to do the entire garden in one day, unless you are a master gardener. The galleries house Gainsborough's Pinkie and Blue Boy and the grounds give you an idea of what it was like to live in splendor. The parking is ample and while in the city of San Marino is sort of in mid town Pasadena. The new gift shop is elegant with an array of souvenirs and more elegant gifts.",Dessertarian44
40,really nice afternoon,"my husband and i visited the huntington library and gardens this last weekend with my mom, grandmother, and sisters to celebrate my grandmother's birthday and had a great time! all of the gardens are spectacular - plants from all over the world and a bunch of different regions represented... there's a desert garden, japanese garden, australian garden, rose garden, etc.the rose garden was my personal favorite - literally every single kind of rose you can possibly imagine. so beautiful! we also went into the library, which was nice. in my opinion the gardens are the highlight though.two downsides: parking was INSANE (we ended up having to park outside the gates and then walk in) and it's a bit expensive just for some gardens and a very small museum. $25 for adults on the weekend. we enjoyed it, but $50 for the two of us to just wander around for a few hours was a bit steep.one other thing - my grandmother is in a wheelchair and although there is wheelchair access most everywhere, several of the trails are very inconvenient and you end up going way out of your way to avoid the stairs. we ended up just carrying her wheelchair up/down a few sets of stairs just so we didn't have to go so far out of our way.",Whitney C

50,Outstanding Rose Garden in Full Bloom!,"We have visited the Huntington many times, but I had never seen the rose garden in full bloom. When we visited at the end of March (March 29) it was at it's best, with virtually every one of the numerous varieties showing flowers at their best. Truly a lovely sight. The gardens overall were looking beautiful and provide an excellent place to bring your kids to enjoy the outdoors in a beautiful, safe environment. There is ample room for children to run to their heart's content. For the adults the library and art gallery are also treats not to be missed. We ended the day with a lovely meal at the Tea Room- $30 per person for a self serve buffet of delicious finger sandwiches, delicate sweets, fruit and other goodies, and a large selection of excellent teas, coffee, etc. We found it to be worth every penny.",GloriaD121

50,A lovely way to spend a day,There are some very famous art pieces here that I very much enjoyed seeing. I also really enjoyed walking around the gardens that are on the property.

Lovely California xeriscape garden surrounds the new entryway and a 15 foot high pergola shades the outdoor dining area. Last Sunday was opening day and there was a marvelous flute and harp duo playing. The Huntington was always a delight, now its even better. Also don't miss the new Chinese gardens copied after Souzhou, also the wonderful science book exhibit in the Library annexe: Versalius, Hooke, Darwin et al.",232DavidW49
40,Oasis in a busy city,"The Huntington Library and Gardens are tucked away in such a way that you would never know that you are in the metro Los Angeles area. When we visited they were finishing construction of a building and possibly a parking lot, so it was confusing to find our way to each of the buildings. It was also a very hot day for late March so we didn't enjoy as much of the gardens as we would have liked to.We spent some time in the American and European Galleries. There is some lovely art, in particular we enjoyed the European gallery, but that's more a matter of taste.For us, the gardens were the great draw and I would go back, but on a cooler day so we could enjoy more time outdoors.",Gabby R
50,"Unsurpassed desert garden, English portraits and significant books s","The Huntington is always on my list of places to go when I am in LA. My favourite things are the desert garden, the collection of English portraits, and the display of historically significant books and letters. What a day out!The desert garden is unique in its scale, variety, and pleasingness of its labyrinthine layout, which has many well framed views. The crowds seem to get lost in the cactii, which is where it scores so highly over the new Chinese gardens. The Chinese gardens are more crowded and more mannered: pleasant, but not a reason for visiting.The English portrait galleries are second to none, partly because of the magnificence of their display, but also because of their quality and quantity. Worth a visit in themselves.The collection of books and manuscripts and clear display will take your breath away. This visit I was amazed by the photograph of Beverly hills taken in about 1925.There is plenty more to see. The Hudson river school, antipodean plants, and more. But for me it is the desert, the English portraits and the books and manuscripts that make the Huntington unforgettable and unmissable.",peter s

There are several different varieties of plants from all over the globe. My favorites are the tropical gardens and the Japanese gardens. I brought my 8 month old son for the first time and his eyes were popping from the beautiful colors and sounds of the gardens. The grounds can be rented out for parties or events.(very expensive) The price is about 15 per person. There is a gift shop, café and plenty of restrooms.",toshinacrockett

50,Beautiful gardens and museum to enjoy on a summer day,"Huntington Library has some of the most beautiful well-kept manicured lawns/gardens anywhere.

50,Small doses,"if one has the time, multiple visits are the real key to the Huntington. The Library is a delight for the bibliophiles and historians; the galleries can take several hours; and the gardens, while lovely, require a good deal of time. It seems to require a season pass and walks as the seasons change. The Rose Garden, for example, was not in bloom in February, nor were the cherry trees.",Mary R

I started by walking through the Japanese and Chinese gardens, which were beautiful. Traveled through the main house/gallery listening to the general family audio tour included in the initial fee. Finally, I was advised to walk through the camellia garden to the conservatory. This garden was magical! I thoroughly enjoyed this estate tour.",makingtheleap
40,"Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World, a permanent exhibition","Then Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens are always a fun day out. Most people wander around the gardens, especially if they have small children. However a permanent exhibition: Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World is visually stunning, and will interest children as well, although their age will determine how long they can spend in it. The exhibition is called Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World. It is divided into four sections: Astronomy, Natural History, History of Medicine, and Light (physics, optics, and engineering). I posted 2 photos of my own below, but there are more from the Huntington here: http://huntington.org/WebAssets/Templates/content.aspx?id=16992The natural history section in particular has a wonderful way displaying illustrations that shows visual thinking. Some of the earliest images were clearly drawn based on accounts from others, rather than what the artists had actually seen themselves. Then in the next centuries you can see the influence of Enlightenment ideas and the Scientific Method -- that is drawings based on direct observation and in depth knowledge of the specimen depicted. Add different techniques of creating, to constantly evolving technologies in printing production, and there is a clear picture of what people across the centuries understood about the natural world.I recommend going to the Huntington to see the exhbition (and the gardens) if you happen to be in Southern California.",RoseR2
50,Blooming Fabulous!,I have gone to Huntington many time. I even worked there on summer teaching ethnobotany - It's a wonderful beautiful garden - there's a great green house too- and if you like museums and high tea - all are available. I wish it were less expensive though.,Elizabeth Eve K
50,Garden AND Museum,"We were unaware of the Huntington until our son suggested a visit. It was a bit off the ""beaten path"" tucked away in San Marino and we were staying in Santa Monica, but worth a visit. It is both an extensive garden complex (organized in different thematic areas) in addition to a moderately sized collection. The original architecture is also interesting to see. Taking into account the context of the original owners, the development of the property/collection/gardens, and it's evolution makes for an entertaining visit. If you want to try to see everything, you better plan on getting there early as the grounds are rather expansive and you can do a lot of walking if you want to see much.",mnb22055

Cactus garden better than any i have seen in the desert, Japanese garden, Chinese garden, herbs, flowers, a children's area. When we visited on a hot day there were misters to cool off in the children's area. OH WAIT there are four major buildings full of treasures. A Gutenberg Bible, The paintings Pinky and Blue Boy, (most of the art is old masters of that era -- but there is a changing gallery too) Go to the website. Parking is free and it can get crowded and hard to find. Come early. Stay till closing. They sell so so sandwiches and other food. Also have a fancy Tea but i have never been tempted as it is a bit pricey.",Louise A

Suffice it to say that grounds are exceptional - could have spent 2 hours in the desert section alone. I can't imagine how much more there will be to see when the Chinese Gardens are completed.The Special Exhibits were great as well - we especially enjoyed the photography exhibit but each was well presented and unique. I'm envious of locals who can be members and just hang out at their leisure and/or visit the rotating exhibits.The permanent collection is OK - covers the bases but not necessarily the premier works of the necessary artists.",Philip C
30,A bit pricy but nice art gallery,"We toured the grounds a few years ago when the mansion was being renovated and loved it. Was a little too early for a good garden tour since it was February. The quality of the art in the gallery was fantastic and worth a visit. Unfortunately after the renovation, there is little left of the ""way of life"". Most of the furnishings and much of the art are new and not from the original setting. The upstairs is now just a gallery. I would return only if I had an entire afternoon to do both the gallery and the grounds in better weather. The gallery alone wasn't worth the $23 pp admission.",Tracy58
50,"Fantastic, exquisite gardens!","Oh my gosh, this place is amazing! We were there on a hot day, and despite that it was wonderful. The Cactus/succulent gardens were my favorite. The jungle and the conservatory ( glass structure) were fantastic. Normally I would not be as into this type experience, however this was great. Hours are short, 10:30-4:30. Closed Monday(?). The museum aspect is also out of this world. The Guttenburg Bible original, really!! Unbelievable original examples of books, maps, art, and music from the 1300's on. Do yourself a favor next time you are in Pasadena and take this unique garden museum in!",mpn7330
50,Unmissable,"We visited three wonderful places in Pasadena at the end of a stay on the west coast (from England): the Norton Simon, the Huntington Library, and the Gamble House. All were amazing, and relatively close together but had similar closing days so needed careful planning, especially as there was so much to enjoy at them all.The Huntington opens at 12 noon and closes at 4.30 which does not give enough time to see everything in the builidings and extensive gardens in one visit. One could easily spend all this time in the Libraries which are world class. The art galleries too have world renowned works. The gardens are beautiful - we enjoyed the Japanese and Chinese ones which were outstandingly beautiful.",geoffrey.hollis
50,Excellent collection and gardens not to be missed,"This place is a must see when you visit southern California. The collection includes a bonsai exhibition, tropical greenhouse, cactus garden and a really remarkable Japanese Garden, ponds, bridges, etc. They have a significant collection of art, furniture and photographs as well as a truly interesting library. And be sure to enjoy high tea service at the Japanese pavilion. Beautiful!",SDwalkerSOCAL
30,Disappointed in everything,"For years I had waited to see the Huntington Gardens, and when I had an open day in Los Angeles, I decided to head over to Pasadena and tour the gardens. Being in LA, its possile rot grow just about anything, which was the problem, the place seemed overgrown and not especially well groomed. The Japanese Garden was a huge disappointment after having studied Japanese Gardens in Kyoto. This one didn't know the concept of restraint. The Chinese garden seemed a bit cohesive. The American art collection was one of each, no real depth, and the European collection in the old mansion was portrait after portrait of people I didn't care about, the house was more interesting.",GlenClarkST
50,Exquisite Magnificence - A Sensual Delight!,"If you are visiting the LA area in southern California, a day trip to Pasadena is a must. You can begin by visiting Old Town, perhaps for a light breakfast or a simple cup of coffee and then make your way over to the Huntington Library and Gardens, about 4 minutes away in San Marino. Its hours are limited so you should plan on arriving at opening time since one can easily spend the entire day enjoying its many offerings. There are several cafes, restroom facilities and drinking fountains scattered about the property along with a Special Assistance Vehicle (SAV) or tram that continuously makes its way around the property with stops at several convenient locations, picking up tired visitors or those with special needs. There is also free and ample parking.The house is magnificent in architecture and style, capturing a time in America’s history when the industrial giants were in their heyday. Its contents include some of the finest European art, furniture, tapestries, etc. in the world.Caddy-corner from the house is the library, another magnificent building housing a vast collection of works and special exhibits and functioning as a research facility for scholarly pursuit.Another large building houses American Art with its Scott & Erburn Galleries and the Chandler Wing. Works by Andy Warhol, Mary Cassatt and other American expressionists, etc. along with photographs can be found here. Special exhibits are also possibilities for this building.The gardens are exquisitely maintained and lush, providing an intense, pleasurable barrage to the senses of sight, smell, sound and feel of the cool breezes that wistfully and periodically pass by, carrying the pleasurable scent of various blooming flowers. You can easily spend the entire day enjoying the large Desert Garden with thousands of cacti and succulents, the Japanese Garden with its lovely moon bridge, Japanese house and ceremonial tea house, the Chinese Garden with its flowing lake, tea house and shop and 5 stone bridges.The large conservatory contains collections of orchids and tropical plants along with a laboratory for hands-on experiences. These are educational and great for both children and adults. A child’s garden features a maze and activities for active children while adults can sit by, chat and watch.The entire property is exquisitely maintained and provide a rich experience for all who choose to visit. A big two thumbs up for the Huntington!",PAAbee
50,Cactus and greenhouse,"While we visited, they were having a bonsai exhibition. That was good. The tropical greenhouse had everything including orchids which I love. The cactus garden was amazing! I have never seen thousands of cacti in my life. Pictures to be taken everywhere.",SugarmillJim
40,You can spend a whole day here!,"The Skinny:Parking - Free paved lotAdmission - $23 weekday, $25 Weekend, closed TuesdayHours - 12p-430pFree Day - first Thursday of the month (opens at 1030am) - you must get ticket in advanceTime - you can spend over 4 hours easyRestrooms - scattered all over the groundsLuckily for us, my friend and I went on a free day so we had more time to explore the grounds. The gardens are so big you really need several days to see everything. If its too warm you can always escape to one of the buildings and check out the exhibits in the cool. We also had reservations to have afternoon tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room. If you are going to eat at the gardens I would suggest bringing your own picnic and enjoy your repast on one of the lawns. I went to the tea many years ago and I had a nice time. This time the tea was served buffet style and while we weren't rushed by the server, it was a lackluster display and the tea was average at best.While there are a lot of areas with shade, a hat is a must or at least sunscreen and sunglasses. Comfortable walking shoes are also a must because the terrain is uneven.If you like museum stores then you need to check out this large and varied store with gifts for everyone!",melobeam
50,One of the world's finest,"My family and I have enjoyed going to the Huntington Library, Museums and Gardens for almost 40 years -- thus hundreds of times. And, each time I ready to go again, a sense of excitement prevails. It is a combination of seeing the familiar and the new. At the Huntington there is always something new to dazzle -- a blossom, a work of art, a vista. Each and every aspect of the Huntington holds appeal and underscores its international stature as being one of a kind. Regardless of the crowds, you can always find spaces to yourself, but admittedly it's good to chose your day and time of day to avoid the flocking masses. I've travelled much of the world, but there are few if any other places which combine the extent of spacious and immaculately kept gardens, such handsome architecture and extraordinary and diverse art collections, and a pleasing, relaxed atmosphere. Huntington -- you are special.",enroute55

50,Great place to spend an afternoon,Unfortunately it was raining heavily when we visited which almost never happens in LA. Still we managed to spend a wonderful couple of hours in the Chinese Garden and indoor museum. I was recommend the Chinese Garden in particular where they did a really good job of replicating the tranquil feeling of what it must have been like to be a wealthy mandarin enjoying your own backyard.,Kenneth C
50,An Art & Nature Lover's Escape,"Escape to the quite bedroom community of San Marino, CA, and you'll find an oasis in the middle of this beautiful community. Critics and scholars have written much on the Huntington Library and Gardens, so believe me when I say, a visit makes for a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the world outside of the Huntington's gates. A day walking through the varied specialty gardens and galleries that are the core of the Huntington, are a true stress releaver. The variety of gardens is delightful, and although I missed the bloom of the roses by about two weeks, the buds are all there, just waiting to burst forth. The cherry blossoms are in bloom in the Japanese Garden, and stunning camellias are alive with color throughout the grounds. Sit in the Chinese garden and sip a cold drink as you gaze over the pond. Admire the beautiful statuary throughout the gardens, or just sit and meditate on all the beauty that surrounds you. Summer will bring tremendous crowds, so if you want a lovely escape to all things beautiful, the Huntington certainly fits the bill.",Sheryl D
50,Be prepared to wear out your feet,"because there is so much to see. You can easily spend a whole day there. The desert garden is spectacular. There are the Japanese,Chinese, rose, herb & children's gardens and more. There is not just one museum, there are a number. The mansion has Blue Boy & Pinkie. Another has just American artists. And there are special exhibits. There has been construction there lately but it won't get in the way of your visit. I'm excited to see what they are building. Don't miss it if you are in the area.",pat q
50,Exceptional Gardens and Museum.,This is as good as it gets with lovely gardens and a fabulous treasure chest of many forms of art. The collection of paintings rivals many of the best museums and it is such a treat to see so many really special works as well as magnificent porcelain and furniture. It is all beautifully displayed and such a pleasure to view. There are a couple of cafes situated around the gardens and an excellent gift shop. This is just not to be missed and the location is nearby by to gracious and exquisitely maintained gardens.,LynnSeattle
50,The Most Exquisite Gardens,"We visited here the last week of February 2015. Even with it being ""off"" season, there were still many flowers in bloom. The only garden lacking blooms at the time of our visit was the rose garden.The gardens are massive so wear your best and most comfortable walking shoes. There are places where the ground is uneven, so it might be hard on some with disabilities, although there are plenty of pathways.Each garden was absolutely beautiful so it is hard to pick out a favorite. The Japanese Garden was stellar albeit a bit more crowded that I would have preferred. The dessert garden was starkly beautiful with more cacti than I have ever seen in one place at one time ever.We did eat lunch at their little lunch spot and it was okay.I highly recommend going as early in the day as you can to help avoid some of the crowds.",camrachic
50,Gardens and Art,I spent a great Monday at the Huntington in Pasadena. The combination of gardens and gallery's has something for everyone. Both the Chinese and Japanese gardens offer tranquility and beauty among their water features. The art collection is legendary. There is something for every taste from dutch masters to Andy Warhol. The children's garden and learning center make it fun for the kids.,tsbreeze
50,A wonderful and unexpected surprise,"If you enjoy the beauty of nature, and want to be amazed by the diversity of what it can produce - this is a do not miss!!! The succulent garden was overwhelming in its' glory. We spent 3 hours here, which was just enough time - and if you go you must go into the gift shop, which is as diverse as the gardens. We will definitely be going back.",StrollMyWorld
50,Lots to see!,"I had found the Huntington Library online while looking for something fun to do in Pasadena and the excellent rating is well deserved! Our only regret is that we arrived much too late in the afternoon to make our visit really worthwhile. They close at 4:30 and we had less than 2 hours to see everything. Lots of walking through lovely gardens and the art galleries, science gallery and mansion have much to look at. We managed to rush and skim most of it, but missed some of the other gardens available. We're already planning on going back again with a whole day to really enjoy.",tkpruden
50,Wow. Just . . . wow,"Wikipedia says the Huntington is among the wealthiest cultural institutions in the US. I didn't realize this when I went to visit and was expecting something much less amazing. it was simply awe inspiring. We went initially to view Blue Boy and Pinkie - i had no idea there were so many more lovely paintings to view. We spent hours in just two galleries.The botanical gardens were equally impressive. Each ""attraction"" can stand on its own. You almost need a day for the galleries and a day for the gardens. There is no way we could have seen everything in one day.There were a few places to eat spread throughout . . . but I wish I would have taken some snacks with me. Also, be prepared to walk for miles if you want to visit the various gardens.Trying to put into words the beauty of the gardens and portraits is impossible. You have to see it for yourself.",SVinLV
50,beautiful place,"we were there with a conference last year. the grounds are quite beautiful and extensive. We walked and enjoyed the flowers and property. It is easy to get around, and everywhere you look, there is interest.. love this place.",monkeysmom21
50,Like visiting a well educated friend,"This private institution maintains the houses, grounds, and collections of its founder, Henry E Huntington. His interests in books, art, and gardens defines the property - if you are interested in any or all of these areas, or history, you will be delighted.A photo safari to this property would also be rewarding - one of our party is already planning to return for a whole day to do just that.Those with mobility impairment are well accommodated in the buildings. On the grounds, a small trolley makes a curcuit every half hour for transportation purposes (not a tour).I can't really say any more as we had only 2 hours to spend and merely touched the surfaces of the collections.The admission price is a good value if you visit from opening to closing: 6 hours in summer, 4.5 or 6 hours in winter. Note that the property is closed Tuesdays.",Janet F
40,The Biggest Flower of the world is here on display,"From Beverly Hills it certainly takes more then n hour to get there, but then it is certainly worth the effort on a Sunny day. We had a great walk thru the Chines and Japanese Garden, admired the exotic big Desert Garden. In the greenhouse we saw the biggest flower of the world on display : ""The Corpse Flower"", of which foto is enclosed hereby. We concluded this fantastic visit with English Tea in the Rose Garden Room with delicious small food of which the spoons were best. Obviously were were there very early in season no roses yet, but absolutely worthwhile to do.",nicolasHolland

50,Very Enjoyable!,It has a limited time that it is open daily so plan well. There is a docent tour of the gardens that changes depending on what is blooming at that time. The house tour was excellent with the audio tour. I listened to several options on the tour and enjoyed the insights. The other two buildings that have changing exhibits was enjoyable because few people were there and not to large to be overwhelming. I was there the whole time they were open. I would go back again when I am in Pasadena.,Theonek
50,Most Amazing Thing in LA Area,"For some reason, I'd never heard of the Huntington Library et al until I was planning a recent trip to LA. I was looking for other museums beyond the two Gettys and this showed up in my search. Thank goodness I clicked on it.They have Gainsborough's Blue Boy! I grew up looking at Blue Boy and Pinkie in prints. The prints were almost de rigueur for mid-century living rooms. But Blue Boy is only the tip of the iceberg. You could spend days on end discovering your way around this wonderful attraction. Unfortunately, it's only open between 12 and 4:30. Not nearly enough time and the people I was with slowed me down. If I lived in LA, I would have a season pass/membership and I would be there at least weekly. Go! Go! Go!The price of admission is 20-23 dollars according to when you go. You might think this is a little steep for a half day ticket, but I don't care what it costs, you need to see this place.I made a beeline for the Huntington Art Museum. OMG!! It may just be the most beautiful place I have ever been in my life. It was the Huntington family home, back in the day, but now it is a museum. Elegant, amazing, gorgeous, breath-taking - all of that and even more than that. It's like every decorating dream I've ever had come to life. I ADORE the decorative arts and this was decorative arts in situ! Be still my heart!! Even if I had not recognized a single painting in the place, it would have still been one of my favorite art museums EVER - and I've been to a lot of them.Then there was the room with Blue Boy and PInkie. They hang there on the wall gazing across the room at one another - and they are big, very big. Most people are surprised because the Mona Lisa is so small. This was the exact opposite, I'll be honest with you, there was a portrait of an opera singer in the same room that I thought was a more magnificent piece of art, but to stand there in the presence of those two famous paintings was almost shocking. I had to sit down. I tried to explain to my grandniece what an amazing thing she was seeing, but I could tell she thought Aunt Jane was losing it.I was there with a large group and the natives were getting restless, so we went out to see the gardens. Do not do what I did. I thought it would be easier for everyone to take it in if we just strolled by on the paved trail. Repeat!! Do not do this. The edges are lovely, but don't give even a hint of what treasures lie down the footpaths. Take your time and wander all you can.By the time I figured out I'd goofed up, the younger crowd was bored and ready to move to the next activity. Thankfully, we didn't follow them out. We let them go and started wandering the small garden paths. If I'd been amazed in the Art Museum, I was stunned by the gardens.The first we wandered into was the Japanese Gardens. Lovely, but they led to the Chinese Gardens. OMG!! I've run out of superlatives, but I doubt any could do it justice anyway. I've been to a lot of Japanese and Chinese gardens in my life, but these took the cake. It was like my Chinese Garden fantasy come alive. WOW!We tried to squeeze in as much as we could in the time left, but we didn't even scratch the surface. The Huntington House Art Museum was devoted to European Art. There's an American Art museum on the grounds also and a Special Exhibition museum too. Needless to say I didn't get there, nor did we even scratch the surface of the Library.I've also got to tell you the gift shop is a wonder. I bought my best friends a gorgeous bracelet there, but I pretty much wanted one of everything I saw. Don't pass up the shop thinking it's just another souvenir shop. It's a lot more than that.",Jane S
50,Excellent ambiance; limited hours and expensive,"The main complaint is that the hours are limited, and it is so beautiful. It is also $20 to get in, which is high for a short time. The sticker shock is forgotten as the house and gardens are gorgeous and calming. Never done high tea there (not my thing) but many people also enjoy it.",msa23_2000

50,Must see the new Chinese Garden,"The Huntington has one of my favorite places in the whole world....the cactus and succulent garden is way cool. Add the new and absolutely wonderful Chinese Garden and you've got a place you should not miss. And when we visited, it was only half complete, so it makes me want to come back when that's done.Don't bother with Blue Boy and Pinkie and go for the gardens. Did I mention the camellias, in bloom now, and the Japanese garden? Plan on sitting down and getting tea or eating in the middle of your visit, because the site is huge.",barbgal

50,A breath of beauty near LA,"We became members in 2012, and keep renewing because this is a great stopover any time of year when we head to LA or locations east. We usually stop in and have lunch in the newly expanded Chinese Gardens. Do not miss their fried shrimp and teas.We were greeted with the new entrance and beautiful gift/book shop on our visit February 2015. We were a little early for the cherry blossoms, but the extensive camellia walkway by the main lawn was in full bloom mid-February. No visit is complete without a perusal of the Greene and Greene room, and the art presented in the Huntington's mansion, built to display their collection, fully planning for it to be a museum after their deaths. Blue Boy and Pinkie have become old friends, as has Lady Hamilton.The gardens are extensive, so allow a few hours to wander through the Australia, succulent, cactus, bonsai, and Japanese Gardens, just to name a few of this amazing landmark. We caught the tail end of the blooming stinky plant in the conservatory on one visit.The library collection includes a Gutenburg bible and original Audobon plates. I always find a new interesting factoid in the science room and in the temporary exhibits, which keeps us returning several times a year.",dkayrenick
50,Hidden in Plain Sight,"This is a repository and research facility for historical and literary scholars, as well as a botanic garden, actually several gardens, and grouping of art galleries. There are Turners and Constables, it is a British-centric institution, as well as a smattering of American art. One room displays Frank Lloyd Wright furniture, and another furniture designed by Pasadena architects Charles and Henry Greene. There are spectacular Japanese and Chinese gardens, the latter with a teahouse and food pavilion. It is pricey but a very worthwhile attraction.",MichaelofPasadena

40,Pleasantly Surprised,"It has been a while since i have been to the Huntington Library, so i decided to take my kids last month and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised. Their gardens are beautiful! They have a wonderful atrium that really give you a small taste of different climates. Although smaller, the Japanese gardens really feel like you are in Japan. The roses were all asleep but i do have to say i could imagine what they would be like in full bloom and i must go back! The children's garden was very nice as well (i do recommend bringing a change of clothing because there is water play) We did have tea in the rose garden - and i have to say that i wasn't too impressed with :( i felt like they bought most of their stuff at costco... which is not what you want when you go to tea. but all in all the Huntington Library was a great experience and i will go again!",MargoHemet

30,Amazing for people who loves plants,"Great if you love varieties of plants from all over the world. But for people like me who cannot differentiate orange tree from Apple tree (unless there's fruit on it), this place is just like a giant park. Some highlight for me are the bonsai trees in Japan garden, the China garden is great picture spot, the park is very big for the kids to just run around like crazy.

50,Glorious!,"I took my three young kids here for an afternoon, and cannot wait to go back! It is absolutely spectacular. The front is a bit disconcerting, because there are massive renovations underway, but the gardens are so expansive that you don't notice or hear the heavy machinery once you walk past. We had a lovely (and not particularly overpriced) lunch at the cafe, enjoyed the self-guided audio tour through the mansion, loved the Asian gardens and learned so much at the conservatory. The children's garden is magical, too, but we didn't have nearly enough time to explore it. It is a little pricy, especially considering that the nearby Getty and Getty Villa are free, but this place has a very special magic, and if you can afford the entrance fee without hardship, it is very worth the experience. Also - the newly-renovated gift shop is spectacular. It's a beautifully curated collection of items both lovely and educational. We'll be back in LA with my mom in a couple months, and a return visit to the Huntington is at the top of our to do list!",DolleyMaszola

50,I could spend days there...,"This is one of the most expansive gardens and collections I have ever seen. After 5 hours I felt overloaded, and wish I had brought a blanket to laze on the gorgeous grounds for a break.As others have written, the gardens are really something. Evidently they have a lot of volunteers. Even the children's garden is a blast (and we were sans children!).I am not a fan of the primary focus of their art collection (I prefer modern and contemporary), but my friends really liked it a lot, and there were a few nice contemporary sculptures. There is evidently some modern American art, but I couldn't locate it among the enormous collection.Alas, I inadvertently their Greene & Greene room; it was tucked somewhere in a very large building. No matter - I probably couldn't have absorbed it anyway, and definitely plan to return.The Library is immense and fascinating, yet there is way too much to take in, at least for us, in one visit. There is one bood, manuscript or poster right next to another (left, right, above, below) in large room after large room. Think - Smithsonian.The complex covers over 120 acres, and when walking through the very quiet, serene gardens I was constantly amazed that I was in the middle of the L.A. area!The only downside to the museum, for me, is the organization of the collections. They are very crowded, jammed into rooms with no clear flow inside huge buildings. Still, I look forward to returning the next time I am nearby: I'm hooked on the place.Well worth the time and price of admission!!!",David B
50,Beautiful!!!,"This is one of the many jewels of Pasadena. As a visitor, this is a must see.Beautiful Gardens, a place to spend the day, take many pictures, smell the fragrance and relax.

I was surprised to see the extensive renovations - new buildings plus some upgrades to existing buildings. The exhibits have new, interactive components and, for example in the library, are displayed with more modern and more captivating ways. As always, the grounds are fun for families to roam. The new gift shop is huge and there's something for everyone and every price point. Entrance fees have gone up to about $20, so plan the day there (not a few hours), since there's plenty to do.",NinaPintaStaMaria
50,Lovely...and worth the money,"We stopped at the Huntington on a Monday morning on the way to a friend's house. It doesn't open until noon but we were able to walk around the gift shop and get some coffee and wait. The admission is $20 and we felt that we got more than enough for our money. There are many different gardens and multiple areas of paintings and sculptures. In the 3 hours that we were there, we went to the Chinese gardens, Japanese gardens, European collection (in the main house) and the desert garden. All were exquisite! We walked through the rose garden but the roses had just been trimmed and were not in bloom. There is so much to see there so I would estimate we saw about half of what was available. Blue Boy is located in the main house. As part of the admission, they will give you an audio tour. We were in too much of a hurry to listen to most of that, but we did listen to some of the items being described and were glad we picked up the units before touring. The house is magnificent and the number of paintings in it astounding.We found the Chinese and Japanese gardens to be very peaceful and serene. The desert garden was huge with so many different...and very large...cacti. There are several other gardens which we skipped because of a lack of time. You have to be willing to do some walking but we are so happy that we went!",Barb D

And allow yourself plenty of time to wander -- there's a lot more to see than many visitors realize, and from Labor Day to Memorial Day, it's only open to the general public in the afternoon.

I have no complaints whatsoever about the attraction, only that you pay a lot of money to access something that is relatively standard. I went once, and I'm glad that I did. I probably will not return.",Constance F
40,Something for everyone,"Even in Janurary, these spaces offer pleasure and beauty, from a childrens' garden to a Japanese teahouse and Chinese Pagoda. Over 200 beautifully maintained acres are devoted to varioushorticulture. This involves 2-3 hours of walking and lingering. Also, there is an art museum and library. Not everything can be experienced in one visit, but one will most likely leave satiated from the experience and well-exercised from the walking. Price is high (~$18) but value is equivalent.",barb883
50,Great place to take a walk through the Gardens and Gallery,We have been members of the Huntington for years. They have one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in Southern California. I love to use the gardens when I want to take portraits of family members. The gallery has many beautiful works including Blue Boy and Pinky by Thomas Gainsborough.,csarchibald
50,beautiful!,"The gardens...the artwork...the architecture...the grounds.Huntington is, in all ways, a wonderful experience and a great day out in the Los Angeles area. I have rarely seen a place so beautifully planned and maintained. It seems as if the view from any point on the entire grounds was planned to be spectacular. Be sure to allow several hours so you can take it all in.",Nativa505
40,A fun day out,Once a month the library offers a limited number of free tickets. We took advantage of that and had a lovely day out. The gardens are vast to say the least so be prepared for a lot of walking. The Asian gardens are particularly amazing but all of it is great. We tend to enjoy the gardens more than the library but the library is also quite amazing with its documents on display. I enjoyed the new American art pavilion as well. Definitely can plan several trips over several long days here if you are interested as there is a lot to see and do here.We have always brought a picnic lunch so I am not sure how the cafeteria is on site. There are lots of lovely places to sit down and have a picnic lunch there and the weather in Southern California is almost always comfortable for that. Well worth a day if you are in the area and enjoy large gardens and some amazing art in expansive grounds.,DaQi
50,"It's hard to imagine how the super-wealty railroad barons lived, but here's an opportunity to see, with added artworks.","So, we all enjoy watching Downton Abbey on PBS...but here's your opportunity to enjoy walking beautiful gardens and touring an amazing mansion built by Cyrus Huntington, an American Railroad Baron, a veritable billionaire of his time! Plus, the place also includes the most amazing artworks, manuscripts, etc., and a lovely cafe. It's an American treasure. There aren't many around. Especially on a nice day.",vinojeff
50,World class gardens,"This is one of the tourist gems of Southern California. Tucked away in suburban San Marino/South Pasadena, the Huntington is both museum and botanical garden. The art collection is interesting enough, but the real delight (for us at least) were the beautifully laid out and planted gardens. The succulent section alone is worth a trip to visit. A must see if you're in the LA area for a few days.",BlueNWashington
50,Absolutely Spectacular!,"I have visited the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens many times. It is one of my favorite places to take visitors. The spectacular beauty of the grounds, the magnificent mansion and the outstanding art collections make this a ""must see"" destination.",Dyanne2014
40,"Beautiful, but lacking adequate signage/directions","We are nature and art lovers, so this sight delights all the senses! The European Exhibits are my favorites, and there are many, many portraits of the well-heeled and elites of the times! The Asian and Sculpture gardens are beautiful as well. We were there Martin Luther King Day so they were very busy at that time. It was wonderful to see so many children exposed to the arts in this venue! We ate in the pricey Chinese Gardens. The food is so-so but adequate, as many others have commented here, seating ranges from hard-to-impossible to find and thus awkward as you are holding your trays of food. Better signage would be my vote. The Exhibits are spaced some distance from one another, and are marked once you are close by, but the Exit (when you're exhausted) is a bit harder to locate, in my opinion. Larger signs that could be seen from a distance might be helpful.",TravelerSophia
50,Absolutely the best!,"A wide variety of attractions, including Japanese garden, Chinese garden, Museum, Art gallery, cafe. Easily spend the morning or afternoon.",nepenthium
50,"Awesome Art, Gardens and Food.","I am from Oregon and my friends own an annual membership to the foundation. As A Guest I was amazed and in awe of the variety of gardens and size of the Huntington Home that required a staff of 11 to run it. Remembering the home was built for only TWO people....now as Jackie Kennedy would say, that is real money.Those were my thoughts too, as I consumed caviar in the English Tea House. Our server, Kimberly was the absolute best. Make reservations or you'll not be getting a table.For an adult, this place is an adult Disneyland.The Blue boy painting is not to be missed, nor the painting of George Washington that is printed on our one dollar bills.Go early and stay late. Enjoy. I did.",BobR2012
50,Allow a couple of days to explore properly,"I was only here for the day and barely scratched the surface. The themes gardens are stunning and the statutes, art galleries are just dotted in and around the gardens. Would recommend this for parties of any age but there is a lot of walking.",jlogan1302
50,Wonderful place to visit for a relaxing day!,"I went with a friend over a long holiday weekend and the place wasn't crowded at all. I took a special, private tour of the Huntington Estate for $40 (which also included general admission to the Library and Gardens), but this was about 2 hours BEFORE the place opened to the public. The private tour was well worth it as the docent Ron was very knowledgeable, friendly, organized and knew so much history about the Estate. There were about 13 people in the group, ages ranged from mid 20s to early 70s. No need to worry if you have mobility issues as the tour was very slow paced and even the older folks in their 70s kept up with the docent. Just wear comfy shoes, bring sunscreen (if it's a sunny day) and a bottled water and you will be fine. The Chinese and Japanese Gardens were very zen and beautiful and a great place to relax. We spent the whole day there walking leisurely around to the different buildings. I found their main website to be extremely informative of what the exhibits would show (ie Guttenberg Bible, Canterbury Tales, Abraham Lincoln's works, etc). No extra food or drinks are allowed on the grounds so you can't bring anything extra into the facilities. There are water fountains scattered through out the 207 acre property, but I drink a lot of water, so I brought a bottle and tucked it safely in my big purse. There's free parking and a nice gift shop to buy souvenirs.At the Allen Gate, there's also a coffee shop that sells yogurt and pastries that opens at 10am. It's kind of like a small Starbucks where you can get your AM coffee fix before you spend the day at the estate and the surrounding botanical gardens. This place was HUGE! It's a great place for families as well since the kids can learn a bit about American/European culture and the arts. I had a huge yogurt parfait from the coffee shop at 10am which lasted me the whole day until dinner time. The Library and Gardens closed at 4pm but I left at 3pm to beat traffic home. All the staff members including the security guards were very friendly and cordial. I was allowed to take pics of the Guttenberg Bible and works by Abe Lincoln with my Iphone, WITHOUT flash. They came out pretty nice!Being a total museum nerd, I had a great time. I've lived in LA all of my life, but this was my very first visit! Go figure. I'm glad that even as a Los Angeles native, I was able to explore this place of a gem!Pointers: 1) Go early in the AM when they open to beat the crowds, or join a private tour which opens before the public gates are opened.2) Bring water3) Bring sunscreen or a big hat/visor as Pasadena can get hot on very sunny days4) Wear comfy shoes. It's a casual place so jeans/tshirts are acceptable. I prob wouldn't wear short booty shorts or tube tops or anything like that. You still want to maintain some class!5) Bring small bills ($1, $5, $10) as sometimes if you buy something small at the cafe, they can't break large bills.6) Bring a positive attitude! There's something for everyone here whether you like paintings, pictures, trees/gardens, cacti, roses, sculptures/statues, water fountains, kid's play area, etc.Just remember where you park!!!! I had to walk/roam about for 20 mins. trying to find my car. Write down where you parked to save you time. :) Enjoy this jewel in Pasadena!",Jennifer S
50,Superb. Must be seen,"I spent there about 6 hours. But cost see a small part of it. The best way is to be hired as a caretaker and enjoy the chance to learn.It's huge, fantastic, vivid, educational. You move from a flora to flora, region to region, continent to contnent. You see orange trees, then bottle trees, then you go to the humid jungle with its plants, explore plants under microscope, smell aromas, guess the fragrances.You move from Europe to Asia, see Chinese, then Japanese houses, bonsai.You leave the garden exhausted but happy.",Kamo P
50,And there's Art too...,"There's more than a days worth of things to see, but for my 2-cents I can recommend the American Art building ... Nice ambience and layout and some nice pieces to see. If you're at the Huntington give the American Art collection at least a ""walk around"".",LeonVanSteen
50,A Marvel,"The gardens are an endless series of wonders. Do plan a full day and choose a sunny one to get full enjoyment. The Chinese and Japanese gardens are simply amazing but every section is great. If you go with children, the children's garden is great as well.",Asterix
50,must see and put aside 4-5 hours for your visit,"this place is great. it is a must see and experience. the gardens are incredible , where else can you be in the middle of japan, china and Australia . the desert garden was a highlight. the museums were not overcrowded and feature high quality pieces. worth every penny",pathman98
50,SPECIAL TREAT WITH MEMORIES OF AN ERA PAST!,"Wealthy families lived in luxurious quarters on fabulous grounds with superb gardens and this family also collected art with their almost unlimited resources. We are now the lucky ones to be able to visit and experience, imagining how life was for this elite set but even more to be able to view their collections. The memorable visual experiences were not matched by the cafe on the premises but that is less important. It would take a couple of days to digest the two museums and many gardens but we tried to cram much into one available day and enjoyed every minute of it!",Lois C
50,Unequalled,The gardens are fabulous and it is complemented by several art museums on the grounds. It cannot all be enjoyed in one visit.,Bill W
50,This place is magical.,"The first time I visited, I was a child and I have been enchanted by this place ever since. The gardens are spectacular, the art is amazing and the architecture is breathtaking. Plan to spend your whole day here. You will not be disappointed.",Claire M
30,Tea Time,This is a great place to visit and walk around and the tea was really good but the average rating is because the price is very high. Totally worth it for a special occasion.,Sharon S
50,A memorable visit,"On a friend's recommendation we visited this fabulous museum and garden. The Japanese Garden was wonderful, with bridges and pavements laid out in stone patterns. Everywhere were flowering camellias. The Bonsai section was very interesting too. We had lunch at the Japanese tea house where we had the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. As time was short ( the museum only opens at 12) we went to the European gallery. My granddaughters loved the portrait gallery and the comments made by the curator describing the sitters. I hope one dsy to return to see the American gallery and the rest of the garden!",Hilma13
40,Sadly not as kid friendly,"Apparently due to a Frisbee being thrown inside the gardens, hitting another visitor who sued the Huntington no longer allows even the most soft small ball to be taken in. We meet friends at The Huntington thinking we could balance viewing with some play on the lawns using some small pre school balls. Nope.We get it, but it is sad.",Behrenscomments
50,Incredible Gardens,"The Huntington Library and Gardens were incredible. Way too many things to see & do. We started with the Rose Garden Tea Room – High Tea service. Very delicious and elegant adventure. Variety of tea’s (and coffee too), scones, buffet of fruits, cheese, finger sandwiches, desserts. Make sure to walk through & enjoy the rose garden outside the Tea Room.The Japanese Gardens were very pretty. Many opportunities for great photos with drum bridge, tea garden, zen garden, lakes. The gardens are very beautiful and expansive. Really enjoyed the desert garden. It has many many types & species of desert plants. Took many photos as there are landscaped beds displaying the very pretty plants.Need to really plan a full day to all the gardens, exhibits and museum.",631kirbyf
50,do not miss this Pasadena gem,"This is a huge place. We had a rainy day, so spent time inside the museums seeing the impressive art and history collections.

40,Huntington gardens & library is a great place to take your out of town guests for a visit.,"Huntington gardens & library is an interesting and beautiful place to spend a day. The garden tours are very informative and interesting with a knowledgeable docent leading them. You can do your own tour without a docent, but can learn a lot with a good one. The Library has quite a collection of artwork worth viewing as well. My favorite part is having tea time in the tea room which you need to make advance reservations for. Fun experience!",Pam T
50,Expectations fulfilled,Everything about this museum the arts the food the grounds were excellent. This place needs more marketing so more people especially the underprivileged can see and appreciate,Larry M
40,Something for Everyone,"We were in Pasadena for the Rose Parade and decided to spend a day at this close-by attraction. (Note: check the website for special operating days during this time period.) Good choice. This large former estate features beautiful gardens, art, and historical documents. Our favorite sections were the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Best we have experienced in the United States. The art galleries included interesting British art and European tapestries. The world-class library featured many, many, interesting historical documents including a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible. We spent 3.5 hours here and did not see everything. I highly recommend this attraction as a nice, quiet, peaceful alternative in the LA area. If the roses had been in full bloom I probably would have given this place the full five stars. A brand new visitor center is set to open in January 2015.",msipple919
50,Beautiful Gardens,If you want to relax in a beautiful outdoor area this is it. The gardens are breathtaking. Museum pieces are fantastic. Japanese garden is a must see. The price is a little high. Just plan on spending the day. Food was also good and reasonable .,Mmcbreen
50,"Beautiful, serene, peaceful","Just a short drive out of LA, this is a must visit destination for anyone LA! We had an absolutely wonderful day exploring the gardens and art galleries and collections here. Walking through the grounds is a beauty in itself- perfectly manicured lawns, tall trees, the botanical gardens and numerous other gardens (rose, jungle, desert, herb and Japanese and Chinese gardens). Everything is so beautiful, picturesque and serene- incredibly peaceful! Highly recommend a trip here. Can't wait to go back to explore more!",clpgreen
50,Great museum and gardens,"Get ready for a lot of walking to really see the gardens (I believe they have a shuttle, but we didn't use it). Desert garden was spectacular. Main residence was also great. Neat to see the residence itself, but the artwork was equally fascinating.",tcwMissouri
50,A beautiful place to spend the day.,"Gardens were simply lovely, I especially enjoyed the galleries, resplendent with superb works by Gainsborough and other notable artists, lily ponds and Japanese garden. Its expansive and well manicured landscape is perfect for a leisurely morning or afternoon stroll. Family friendly, safe and memorable. Loved the special rock exhibit and gift shop.",Diedre C
50,The must beautiful real fairy tale place,"A most when you are in LA county. Not just the gardens are gorgeous, but their art collection, the all wooden library, the main residence, its just unbelievable.

I never thought was going to be so much fun for them.",SparkHuerta

It was raining on the day of our visit (rare), so we did not see the gardens this time around but did see the Gainsboroughs and the Lelys - I saw my absolute favorite painting of Samuel Johnson, so my day was complete. Will be visiting again to see the Chaucer on our next SoCal visit. Go, you'll love it.",Goldenspring
50,See the Blue Boy and Pinky,What a wonderful experience. An awesome collection of paintings and art. The house is incredible! Free audio guides give you great insight into the art and the house.,Ralph L

We walked over three miles and I don't think we saw everything! There are so many serene spots here, if I lived closer this would be a regular spot to sit and spend time. Would love to go back in the Spring or Fall when the temps are a bit lower. Amazing.",urban_girlie

50,Why no 2014 Certificate of Excellence?,"The Huntington has been my favorite So-Cal destination for decades. I have now just become a member as much a tribute to the outstanding care devoted to the various magnificent Gardens as the number of times I expect to visit during the year.A recent visit with a friend on a busy day, the day after Thanksgiving, led to my first tour (free) of the Gardens by a lady who had decided at a senior age to learn Mandarin. She is now fluent in Mandarin. Amazing! This lady displayed a detailed and informative knowledge about the history of the Gardens and individual plants. She was kind and patient while answering questions. The Huntington Gardens could not have a better ambassador.The Library and Art Gallery are fascinating and first-rate.I often see the label, Certificate of Excellence (2014) for lesser places. Having just had a dispiriting visit to the California Science Center (Pompeii) and endless lines and crowds so thick you couldn't even see the modest exhibits, I just wonder about the significance/relevance of that label not given to the Huntington. Preposterous...Some folks complain here about the food, but we enjoyed ours (at reasonable prices), didn't wait long for it, and enjoyed it outdoors café style. For foodies, Pasadena offers tons of excellent dining establishments nearby. I am also a happy member of the Norton Simon and the lunch food there is pleasant enough but will never compete with a regular restaurant.My one recommendation for folks is to try the Huntington during the off-season when the temperature is moderate, and, if possible on a weekday, when the Huntington is less crowded.And by all means take a free scheduled tour of the Gardens. If you are lucky you will be led by the gal who speaks Mandarin!",Marcopolonian
40,Open 4 Hours...Not enough time.,"The Huntigton Library and Gardens in Pasadena is an incredible 200+ acre site. Several exhibit buildings with European and American art, plus Rose, Japanese, Chinese and other gardens, a conservatory and more.We arrived at the noon opening time and were processed quickly through ticketing. The walk from entry to the original mansion took about 5 minutes. This expansive building with European art takes at least 2 hours to see...and there in lies the problem.If you proceed to the gardens and tour each of them, you'll spend another hour and a half...minimum.So, with a 4:30pm closing time.. You now have 1 hour left and you'll need to choose... We selected the American art building which was incredible...But with only 4 1/2 open hours Monday to Friday...you can not see this place in one day. Saturday offers a 6 1/2 hour day which would still be a push.Admission for adults is $20, seniors are $15...students $13...We are not from LA so we did not look into a Membership..however...if you want to see this magnificent place that's probably the way to go.And be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.",OREAZ
50,Beautiful Place,Everything is so beautiful and peaceful. I love the children's garden it's so cute! The grounds were very well kept. It reminded me of Chastworth House in England.,Berna H

50,A full day trip required to do this place justice,"Wonderful combination of gardens, landscape, historic buildings, libraries and museums. Choices of things to do here are overwhelming. Food offering is probably the only weak point. The main food area is in a lovely cottage with outdoor dining options in surrounding gardens but it proved to be quite crowded and with a limited selection of poor quality food. This is a great attraction nevertheless and certainly worth a visit.",683denisd
50,Time travel in Pasadena,I love this place! The vast ground is adorned with many interesting plants and flowers. The museums house beautiful arts and books. Themed gardens are such a joy to visit. I can't help but imagine what it was like to live here ages ago. Little big slice of heaven and culture in San Marino.,Trang F
50,Beautiful Garden,"Very beautiful garden. Beware it is BIG and covers a lot of ground. My best advice is visit early in the day to be able to see all that the museum has to offer. I was able to see the Rose Garden which has very little roses this time of year, same goes for the Shakespeare Garden. The Dessert Garden is in full bloom right now. It is huge, so big I got confused traveling its path. We were able to see the Lilly ponds as well which were nice, I liked the big fish swimming in them. The Japanese and Chinese gardens were both so pretty and worth taking a lot of pictures in . The conservatory was awesome very interactive and informative. Overall great experience. I got a little lost at first when reading the map. but we quickly caught on. I would just advise bring good walking shoes, water, and begin your visit early to see everything. I didn't get a chance to see any galleries, because I was so busy seeing the gardens , but next time I go I will definitely check those out.Entrance is pricey luckily we got free tickets from family so our trip cost us zero dollars and we had a nice Saturday trip.",Liz C
50,Become A Member,"Art, Science and beautiful gardens. There is just too much to see in one visit. If you are a couple entry is $40 on weekdays and $46 on weekends. We decided to become members. They were running a promotion so by paying $200 my son and his wife became contributor members and we got a sustaining membership free. We visited thrice on this trip and saw all the gardens and museums. We can visit for a full year free.For those of you who cannot visit more than once I would suggest that you should visit the Huntington House. the desert garden, lily ponds, rose carden and the Japanese garden.Be there as soon as it opens and leave when it closes. We really liked the way these 207 acres have been developed and maintained. The trustees are doing a marvelous job of encouraging membership.A great place to visit and to me a great example for other cities and countries to learn on how to create, maintain and monetize a true gem.",Sanjay B

The Desert Garden was so beautiful with raindrops on the plants; and we were surprised to see so many roses this time of year! The camellias are just starting to bloom - and the Japanese Garden was fabulous, as always. Don't miss the ikebana plants behind the Zen garden.It was also a pleasure to visit the Audubon display, and learn more about George Washington, and also to read about how terrible the American Indians were treated. Next time we'll plan to spend the whole day there.",simivalley1699
40,"Very enjoyable, despite the warm day and under construction",Gardens were well maintained and displays were full of interesting information. Unfortunately it was very warm the day we were there and long lines for food and drink. The construction areas were segregated from most of the exhibit area and didn't directly impact the displays.,John G
50,Stunning,"So many beautiful gardens to wander through. My favourites were the Rose Garden and the breathtaking Chinese garden. Family friendly also, as there is a Children's garden. There was so much to see, and massive area to see also. We couldn't see everything and we were there for nearly 3 hours. We only went to the library and art gallery's for 10-15 minutes as we were short on time, but they were also amazing. A must see!",Alana M

50,One of my favorite places in LA,"Huntington Library and Gardens is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles which I try to visit every time when I am in LA. They operate by schedule, so check the time when they are open. If you arrive early, they will let you in the parking grounds, but you will have to wait till the “open” time to get in. There is so much to see there, does not matter if your interest lays in art, or nature, or architecture, or altogether. I would recommend the audio tour for the Art Gallery and Huntington’s house. Desert Garden always puts me on “another planet”. Chinese Garden fills me with a sense of serenity.",Yelena Z
50,Spend the day,There is so much to see that one day is really not enough. Walking through the gardens is like traveling through different climates. The cactus and succulent gardens should inspire some drought landscaping! A restored Japanese Tea House overlooks a huge koi pond with huge beautiful fish. The newer Chinese Garden and lake are a must see and a great spot for a dim sum lunch. Take your children or grandchildren and don't miss the fabulous children's garden with delightful water play. The Library and Art Gallery contain world class collections. Exhibits change periodically and focus on different historic periods. The Museum Store is being expanded and promises to be filled with unusual and beautiful items. It is worth getting a membership so you can just drop in to be rejuvenated!,WendyCob
40,A Wonderful Place to Visit,"The Huntington Library includes many buildings, galleries and gardens.

Even children love to explore the premise and play in the Children's garden and at the maze.,CaliforniaViv

50,It's bigger than ever,"You cannot do it all in one day. That's the sad part for tourists. You cannot see all the art and walk all the grounds to see the plants and flowers. So you must choose. They now have three buildings full of art. You could just hurry right through, but why?There is the Japanese tea house. And the glass garden building with humidity controls. My favorite is the desert garden. Walk for a minute or three and you are surrounded by a desert in the middle of the city.The new Chinese garden has been redone. Why? It isn't five years old.The tea room High Tea is expensive, but you get to help yourself and eat plenty. Reservations are needed for the busy hours.Admission is cheaper Tuesday-Friday. Closed Mondays.",Andrew H

50,Greater Pasadena site not to be missed!!!!,The Huntington Gardens is the number one stop for our of town guests. It has tremendous diversity from it's recently completed Chinese gardens to the fabulous cacti and succulent area.

50,Perfect for the Holidays,"The Huntington is the most beautiful place and ever changing. Whether you want nature, art or culture you will not be disappointed.

There is Blueboy, Washington's presidential dinning hall with portraits, letters of correspondence between dignitaries and most pleasant of all: complete rose garden with tea room. Easy location, easy parking and admission. Great on specific interests, and also serves whole-day and return-again visitors who want to see it all.",760kathy117
40,Magnificent!,"The Huntington is a ""must see"" when visiting Southern California. The grounds are perfectly kept up, the buildings contain a variety of art, photography, sculptures, and even furniture (especially wonderful if you're a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright. There are a variety of gardens: desert, Japanese, Rose Garden, and a great children's garden -- something for everyone at this oasis in the midst of the city.Hints: Admission, in my opinion, is pricey -- I think it's now $23 for adults. However, if you download the free Pasadena app, you can get $2 per admission (at least it's something). Re dining, they added a new (to me) casual dining restaurant with an assortment of sandwiches, burgers, panini, salads, hot dogs, etc. We had a great BBQ brisket sandwich that came topped with cole slaw and onion strings and was served with kettle chips and a pickle. Price: $8. If you want to spend more and give the kids in your life a special treat, try the tea room (but reservations are probably required). The Japanese gardens also have a restaurant that's very good. All in all, a wonderful way to spend the day.",HendixMom12
50,a great place to visit in any season!,"we have been there numerous times, and it's just such a great treat to walk thru the beautiful gardens, as well as the nice museums - they have a very nice art gallery as well as another beautiful space ( Mr Huntington's home) to use for exhibitions.",BK122
50,Plan to spend the day!,You can spend a day just in the gardens. Then there is the library. Scheduled events. A great garden designed for children to have fun. Japanese garden complete with dining options. Definitely not a place for just one visit. A repeat visit is a must.,Pamela S
40,"Large garden, allow time","It was a beautiful day in early November. Upon arrival I felt as though I had entered a theme park with all of the visitors, ticket lines and gate security. Tickets to the garden were quite pricey. A gift shop was crowded with visitors. We arrived at lunchtime, so we followed our noses to where burgers and dogs were being grilled outside one of the dining spots. What a nice treat--thanks for having that!! (unexpected for a botanical garden). The grounds are quite large and spread out and naturally I hadn't budgeted enough time to study everything, so we walked at a pace to get a general feel for the grounds without really studying much (I'm a horticulturist). I was particularly interested in the palms collection and the succulents collection. It's all quite beautiful but better to allot ample time to soak in design and to be able to sit on a bench and rest. The rose garden was super considering it was November. My compliments to the staff who keep the garden so well maintained!Be aware that I noticed signage stating that the entire grounds is a non-smoking facility.",Gartenkerl
50,Adequate Gallery - Beautiful Gardens,"We didn't have time to visit the library, but we did see the main gallery. There were loads of portraits, including Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Joshua Reynolds and JMW Turner.But the grounds are what make this place worth the visit. Huge Japanese and Chinese gardens, a rose garden and and a slew of other environs than we never made it to including an Australian garden, whatever that is (Vegemite Bushes?).We will go back some time in the future.",Jim C

40,We Needed More Time!,"I had no idea how much there was to see at this place, and sadly the hours we had simply weren't enough. (We were there from 11:30 AM until closing.) I could have spent hours in just the desert garden alone! We never even made it to the roses, and had to breeze through other places as well. If we lived nearby I'd be purchasing a membership so I could spend as much time as I wanted in the gardens.We visited the house as well, and while we puzzled over the opulence and the need for such a place to live, having it now as a public museum was wonderful to display the art. We had no time to visit the library. There was a photography exhibit we also perused and enjoyed.We ate a light meal in the Chinese Garden area. The food is rather overpriced, and I can't say it was an epicurean's delight, but I suppose they have to keep the grounds tended by over charging for things such as that.I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area. It's well worth the entrance fee.",PATTY M
50,Blue Boy and Pinky,"Well worth a full day visit. Grandmother had a copy on the wall of her house when I was a child and when I worked in England,I thought I could see the original... but alas! - the Art Gallery in London said this famous Gainsborough was privately owned in the USA. A 50 quest ended when I finally got to see it. Bonsai Gardens were magnificent and a new photography exhibit was opened for the first time on my visit. Gift shop was good and gardens were beautiful and manicured .. Excellent place to visit..",Hansgeiger

50,Very nice!,"A Must if you are in the LA area for the weekend. The gardens, the roses, the Japonese & Chinese gardens are quite beautiful and only take about 90 minutes to walk around.

50,Spend a Day,"The Huntington mansion (Library) has the original ""Pinkie"" and ""Blue Boy"" portraits, plus many other fine works of art; these two have been my favorites for a lifetime, particularly Pinkie. The gardens are very large and gorgeous -- we only had time for the succulent garden and the Japanese and rose gardens. We had a reservation for lunch at the Tea Room, but you can be perfectly happy with the unstructured food and tables outside and adjacent to it. It is almost impossible to see everything in one visit, so choose your favorites!",Alice G
50,My Brother Was Correct,"I asked my brother if there were any attractions I could visit on my way to Palm Springs from Cambria, Ca. He said not to miss the Huntington Gardens and boy he was right on. We took a tour with one of their tour guides and I am sure glad we did that. She showed us through the gardens, the cactus area was amazing and then the Chinese Gardens very special. They had a nice rose garden too. Did not see the historical books but did see much of the artwork which was special. Don't miss this place if you are in the Pasadena, Ca area.",Debbie A
50,Visit the library first,"This was our first trip to the area, and had no idea what to expect. We went to walk through the gardens as a suggestion from a relative. The gardens are expansive and very accessible. Unfortunately we had to leave before we could travel through any of the several museums on site.This is worth a second tip, we'll just be sure to visit the library before we walk through the gardens.",4mike22
50,Girgeous,"Most beautiful gardens in all of California. Wonderful art also in some of the attached buildings. Only thing is, I wish there was a great restaurant",Julian S
50,Fantastic Botanical gardens and stunning historical books and art.,"This is a real find! The gardens are extensive and encompass at least a dozen different gardens. There is a desert garden, rose garden, Australian garden and tropical gardens to name but a few. The best in my view are the Japanese and Chinese gardens which are absolutely stunning. These have fantastic bridges, traditional Japanese house, Chinese pavilions, lakes, and the largest collection of Bonsai trees I've ever seen. Throughout the garden there are wonders around every corner, waterfalls, cacti, lily ponds, sculptures and art installations. For me, the crowning glory was in one of the Library buildings.There is a collection of rare manuscripts and books written by major scientific figures such as the great Astronomers Johannes Kepler and Edwin Hubble, also Copernicus and even details of Ptolemy's theories! There is a replica of Galileo's telescope and the opportunity to look through it and see the moon as he did. If you are interested in natural history, medicine and the human body and the science of light then you will be blown away by the exhibits.Add to all this galleries with art, silverware, and antique furniture and you can see this is well worth the entrance fee. We had 4 hours there and didn't see everything.",the_flying_goose

It has a very large beautiful garden with variety of plants, including tropical, cactus garden, ponds, Japanese, and Chinese garden and a lovely English type Tea Room. But the the high light for art lover's are several museums, each superb, with rare books and many artifacts. The painting, ""Blue Boy"" and ""Pinkie"", paired by Thomas Gingsborogh, and Thomas Lawrence, respectively. Take pictures as a souvenir.This garden is beautiful at any season.",Shahla M
50,Well worth a visit,"It has the largest collection of Gainsborogh's I have seen, including the famous 'Blue Boy' it was the family home and estate of the prestigious Huntington Family and was left in trust to the state by the family and is in-tact as the family left it.",Sandra B

50,This spot on the planet goes right in to the 'very special places' category,"So - we had me, my wife, and 2 children to entertain (11 and 13).It might just be my children - but 'a trip to a gardens' met with some scepticism being of the real rather than virtual type of interaction. The hours drive to pasadena and the refusal to allow picnics in also deepened my sense of day trip doom. Scarfing a foot long sandwich down in the car park with pitying looks from the antique volunteers / stasi was a bad start.However, these gardens are a pean of botanical beauty. Open spaces, hidden spaces, colour, smell, landscape, and lovely ice-cream to revive us on a very hot day. We journeyed from area to area taking in the range of different plant life and styles (japanese gardens through to cactus desert), we rolled in the grass on a lush lawn and found our way round.We had a super day - it was almost romantic. The kids confessed to enjoying it, and coupled with a stroll around pasadena was a sublime day out.Do it.",simon t
50,Too much to see in one day!,So many beautiful artifacts and pictures and artwork. The grounds are huge and spacious and you can't see everything in one day. Cant recommend the Chinese Garden restaurant for food. It is a spectacular place worth seeing.,Jalses

40,"When in LA, You Must See this Incredible Japanese Garden","There is much to see in the Huntington (much more than you can see in one day), but this review only addresses the Japanese Garden there.The garden goes back to 1912, and was a Meiji Period garden. This is one of the oldest public Japanese gardens in North America. It was renovated in 2011/2012 and was improved somewhat, but it still has some Meiji Period characteristics. On the other hand, there are aspects of the garden which represent the Muromachi/Momoyama Periods. So this garden is a mixture of various things you might see in Japan, but not thrown together in one place like this. With 6.5 acres and seemingly unlimited resources, this is a magnificent Japanese garden in spite of its many flaws.One of the newly added features is a splendid 16th century style tea house surrounded by a traditional tea garden. Unfortunately, it is completely fenced off so that the visitors can only see it from a distance.There are several waterfalls and ponds, and the topology has significant changes in elevation, a very nice effect for this garden. The pond are old-fashioned, with cement shorelines and few stones. In fact, what is notable throughout this garden is the dearth of stones.........unusual and detrimental for a Japanese garden.Typical of a Meiji Period garden is an absurd collection of kitsch (pagodas, Jeso statues, moon bridges, etc.) randomly scattered throughout the garden, which really detracts from the mode of the garden. The pines are well pruned, and there are some amazing specimens of red and black pines to view. However, the rest of the plants are not properly pruned and cared for, not in keeping with the tradition of Japanese garden craftsmanship. The tamamono shrubs were shabby and not properly shaped/sheared. I found the large expanses of English lawns inappropriate for a traditional Japanese garden.The dry landscape garden (karasansui) is an oddity, not only for its poor design, but also due to its improper integration into the garden. This dry stone garden is located off by itself surrounded by walls, something that is not done in Japan. As the sign in the dry stone garden states, these type of gardens are viewed from inside, or adjacent to, a building. But where is the building in this case? A poorly integrated, disjoint design. The stone layout is inappropriate and does not provide the insightful, relaxing mood that such gardens should provide.Adjacent to the karasansui is a delightful display of bonsai, where the visitor should pause and fully take in the charm and craftsmanship of these treasures.Unlike any other Japanese garden I have visited, there are ""minders"" constantly standing watch over the visitors, to the point of being intrusive. Japanese gardens should provide intimate moments and peaceful time to contemplate nature, but this is hard to do under the continuous glare of the ever-present minders.As a garden reviewer, it is my job to be critical. But rest assured that this garden is a treasure to be enjoyed, and you will be amazed when you visit. Of note is the fact that this Japanese garden is adjacent to one of the finest Chinese gardens I have ever seen. I don't know anywhere else where you can see both a high-quality Japanese garden and a high-quality Chinese garden adjacent to each other. Do NOT miss this!",pontevecchio56
50,Great day to tour,We went to the library to see the gardens but were wowed by the art and the books. We spent 3 hours at the place and only saw a little bit of the place.

This beautiful sprawling estate has expansive gardens of all sorts - a Japanese Garden, Zen Garden, desert garden, bamboo garden, rose garden, etc., a tea house for a civilized snack, an impressive art museum, and a collection of historical books. It's a wonderful outing on a nice weather day, and with changing exhibitions, is always worth a revisit.",reeshot

First i turned right and walked along the grassy areas, gazebos, then to the rainforests, it's pretty cool, they spray mist inside to keep the humidity high. then we walked to the chinese garden. the iced tea was expensive! $3.89. dimsum there is pricey! tourist trap! haha. but it's a nice area to sit and eat. the chinese garden wasn't as pretty as i hoped it would be, but it's still pretty nice. and the only one around socal i think? onto the japanese garden. i liked the japanese garden more. i wish you could go on the bridge! nice stroll. the end the garden also has a waterfall, and it was very soothing.then the jungle and the desert. the jungle is pretty cool too. but i wish the flowers were blooming.overall, it's well worth the price especially if you're a student! a lot of people, but wasn't as bad as i expected because this place is huge! i didn't have time to check out the library and art collection, i went from 1ish-4.30 which is when they closed.their gift store is really cool too! a lot of cute stuff =)tips: student discount!favourites: huge! the japanese garden and chinese are must goes.do not want: should have put in more time, wanna check out the lily pond and rose conservatory. a lotta flowers aren't blooming yettttlast words: definitely coming again. very soothing place to spend a day at!",Celine L

There is a lot of construction, but once you het through the entrance, you are in another world. The grounds are immaculately manicured. The scent of roses was delightful. We toured the Scott Gallery and the glass house this time. Although it is an art museum, this is also a fantastic place to bring children. They can run wild through the gardens and there is even a special children's garden and interesting hands-on science exhibits in the conservatory. There are lots of inviting benches. There is a fancy tea room and a small deli. During the week, they do not open till noon. That gives you time to try an interesting local restaurant in the area and tour the gardens.",Barbara F

They have a guided tour by this elderly gentleman who was very informative and he gave many interesting facts about the plants.

Check out my photos.Tickets are expensive: $20 weekdays, $23 weekends for adults.Full-time students with ID $12 weekday, $13 weekends. Their hours are also limited 12-4.30pm. You need multiple visits to see all the different sections of the garden.The library itself would take up hours.",3Kells
50,Worthwhile visit,"The Huntington is worth visiting for the gardens alone, but there is so much more to see! The art collection includes several original Gainsborough paintings, priceless tapestries, silver, porcelain, and other objects galore. There is a Japanese tea garden, a Chinese garden, an Australian garden, and even a lily pond. The library itself includes some original manuscripts by Mark Twain, Chaucer, Jack London, and even an original Gutenberg printing press bible. For those that live nearby, a membership would be beneficial as there is simply no way to really see everything this museum has to offer in one day.A word of advice to parents of small children. Your children may enjoy the gardens, but the library and art collections are probably too advanced for them.

50,120 Acres of Botanical Beauty,"A visit to Pasadena is not complete without a full day exploring the expanses of the Huntington Library and Gardens founded in 1919 by visionary Henry Huntington. The art and manuscripts are valued at billions of dollars. The home in which he and his wife Arabella resided is elegant with views of the gardens from every room. But what inspired me most were the acres of gardens arranged in themes: Chinese, Japanese, Rose, Desert, Tropical, Sub Tropical, Australian, Herb, Palm, and even a charming children’s garden. Streams, ponds, and waterfalls offer a cooling pause on a warm day. A glass conservatory showcases rain forest specimens including numerous teaching displays. Of all the beautiful grounds, it was the desert garden that most amazed me. It is considered one of the largest and most important collections of cacti and succulents in the world with over 5000 species in 60 landscaped beds. The Rose Garden was my second favorite with its 1400 different roses, a sight and smell extravaganza. Two tea rooms dot the property. The Rose Garden Tea Room features a buffet style high tea with fresh scones, open-faced sandwiches, fruit, salads, desserts, and pots of unique black teas.

It was very interesting to see all the various different plants, and flowers along the pathways through to the different gardens.I visited the Desert, Japanese, and Chinese Gardens. Desert Garden was loaded with all kinds of succulents, and cacti all around the pathways. Going to the Japanese Garden, there was a Japanese house and bridge along a stream with fish in the stream. From there to the Chinese Garden were many different garden structures or buildings to look around.Also, I visited briefly the Garden of statues, the Rose Garden, and the main Art gallery.

We were grateful for the staff person who suggested we visit the Japanese and Chinese gardens...they had more shade! They were both spectacular with authentic buildings that complimented the fine gardens. This was worth the visit alone. I have to be honest and say that coming from Tucson, Arizona we did not really need to visit the cactus/succulent area, though I am sure it was wonderful if a bit hot on our day there.The grounds were all beautiful and going through the library and mansion was quite impressive not only for the history of Henry Huntington but also for the extensive art collection. It is nicely organized, not crowded and well run.We also had a wonderful and somewhat different kind of lunch there at the rose garden cafe, which I would also highly recommend. Please see my review.",saintjack
50,A visual feast,"Huntington Gardens has everything for a fun and fulfilling day of vacation. The library has fantastic art pieces including the original Boy in Blue. The library also has historical souvenirs from the days of Henry Huntington's railroad activities and the early oil prospecting and industrialization of the region. The gardens are an even greater visual feast. There is a dense desert garden, a spacious Japanese garden that has recently been upgraded, and a giant rose garden in the center of the park. My only complaint about the garden is that it is a bit artificial, crowding too many flower patches too close together. The County Arboretum in Arcadia is a better place for just communing with nature.",Marc B
50,"Lovely gardens, art, manuscripts and tea",Such a variety of flora deserves a day to explore. But so much more is available.

50,Without Compare,"We were members of the gardens for years before we moved out of the area. It is really a joy to wander about through the different types of gardens.

50,Absolutely lovely afternoon,"We visited in late summer - the grounds were just breathtaking. Honestly, my favorite part was the plant lab, to the right inside the jungle conservatory. I learned so much!! Leaves have little mouths called stomata to take in moisture! Moss are a single cell thick! But I won't spoil it all for you. The Chinese Gardens weren't completed when we were there, but were still gorgeous. We didn't visit the museum, but we did go to the library exhibition hall and saw the Gutenberg Bible! My other favorite site, besides the barrel cactus in the desert garden, was the original Audubon copper plate from which he made his prints. Breathtaking.",Heron G

Every time is terrific. Take a walk the garden with a docent. It is an education and a treat to be with someone who also loves this place. The Art gallery rivals world famous museums. Use the audio tour to fully enjoy the collection.The mansion is a wonderful experience and the Library is unique. It is easy to spend an entire day here and well worth it!",travelingrm
50,Lovely quiet spot in LA,"This centre requires quite a bit of time to see everything, we only saw part of the gardens, which were beautiful.The library and other galleries are spectacular, very European in style. Amazing manuscripts in the library and lots of porcelain, pottery and glass in the gallery.Lunch in the tearoom was lovely, much nicer than the alternative café. Robert, the manager was very attentive. The salads were fresh and delicious. It is a buffet style lunch, with scones with jam and cream. The scones were not quite what I expected, with fruit in them and very small and quite hard! The tea was lovely and there was a good variety of fruit and herbal teas. Overall a very pleasant day.",Maryanne D
50,One stop viewing for gardens & art.,"With a facility as well endowed as the Huntington, one should expect an excellent experience, and one does. The gardens are very good and offer a range from Chinese & Japanese through roses & herbs to desert. The art is outstanding with examples from some of America's and Europe's (especially England) best painters. It also has a fine collection of documents. Besides, how can one go wrong - It has one of the few Corpse Flowers in the USA.",Eulir1201
50,Amazing place - beautiful gardens,"We only had two hours to spend here as we didn't realise how big and beautiful this place was.The gardens are beautiful, and as we are not from the US, it was really interesting seeing such different plants there. We even got to see two hummingbirds, which was really cool for us! I would really highly recommend this - we were very pleasantly surprised.",Katherine K
50,Awesome,We went here to see the beautiful garden and were amazed at how beautiful it is. Husband had a scooter and was able to go everywhere. If you walk please wear good walking shoes because you will do plenty of that. Oriental garden are so peaceful. The Bonsai garden is fascinating. So many wonderful examples of this art. We only saw half of the gardens after 3 hours. We also went inside and saw Blue Boy and Pinkie. There are also so many other impressive pieces of art. Will go back to see the rest of the grounds.,meam54
50,Which Comes First? Library or Gardens?,"I'm sure many people have passed up visiting the Huntington because they think it is a library. What a shame as my wife and I spent over 4 hours exploring the many gardens and browsing through the library and art collection. I'd say I was most impressed with the gardens. They alone are worth a visit to the Huntington. The Japanese Tea Garden is a gem and genuinely captures the feeling of a zen garden. With such a quiet and uncrowded setting, you can truly appreciate the beauty of this garden as it was intended for the viewer. There is also an excellent bonsai collection exhibited adjoining the garden. Even if you aren't a bonsai fan, you will marvel at the beautiful work produced by the bonsai artisans who patiently shaped their plantings over decades of their lives. Don't rush through the gardens when you visit. One should truly take a leisurely stroll and enjoy the artful manner in which the gardens have been designed and laid out. If you do, you will leave with truly a feeling of having had a small but genuine communion with nature.",IslandGuy2014

50,Amazing!,"Being a fan of Gainsborough, I could not be in LA and not go see the ""Boy in a blue suit"" at the Huntington Library. What a discovery that was. What an amazing place! Not only for the art but the gardens. We had scheduled 1 hour and ended up spending 4. It was not enough. One of the highlight of our trip to LA.",Pomerols
50,WOW! If you like flowers and plants this if for you!,Parking was easy and free. Senior admission was much reduced from the higher admission fee. We took a guided tour and it was really the best. The guide talked about the history of the gardens and all the plants. He was very knowledgeable.,swnicholson
50,An Absolute Must See!!!,This place is great for people of all ages. Walking the gardens or checking out the art here is a great way to spend a few hours.,ConstanTraveler77
50,Wonderful gardens and a lovely place to spend a sunny afternoon,"I am very lucky to have relatives in Pasadena, so every time I visit LA, I make sure to spend an afternoon here.The Huntington Library and Gardens is a great place to spend an afternoon to chill out and walk though the beautiful gardens and see the art gallery. A great break from the hustle and bustle of downtown LA.Bring your sunglasses, hat, a bottle of water and wear some comfortable walking shoes.",heliKwokter
40,Beautiful Gem in the middle of the city,"Wow! This place is a wonderful detour from the traffic and noise of the city. The gardens are divided into sections, based on native plants etc from that particular area. One just has to wind their way through the acres of landscape to see tons of beauty from Mother Nature. My favorite was the desert gardens. I was astonished that so many of the cacti were flowering at this time. Spending months in Big Bend Texas made me think I was familiar with a lot of desert fauna but boy was I amazed to see so many varieties that I had no idea existed. Very well kept gardens.My only gripe was that the maps were not very accurate. I typically have no problem whatsoever with reading a map but this one had me baffled. Maybe better signage within the gardens would provide a less stressful stroll. All in all this was a great stop though.",plbbob
50,Amazing,"An amazing collection - art, decorative arts, garden and library - - - certainly much of a days worth of things to enjoy.",architect1961
50,What a Library!!,"Living in Los Angeles for 31 years and I didn't even know it was here. We saw a Very Rare Guttenburg Bible, pieces from various Dead Sea Scrolls, other rare manuscripts. Then we went into the Decorative Arts building and saw Tableware, Linens and furniture. After we spent almost 3.5 hours we went to where the Gardens were but had quick glance because of the late hour.Well worth the afternoon!",robert l
50,Worth a visit,A real gem in Pasadena. Well worth the trip from anywhere in southern California. The gardens are a delight on a typically gorgeous day and the museum and library offer iconic treasures such as Blueboy and other artistic marvels. The special exhibits in the Library are a particular delight.,Jeff44022
50,I Will Be back!,"Every year during the summer time I make a field trip to this wonderful heaven like gardens. It is a wonderful place to take your family to enjoy fine art, beautiful and exotic gardens and animals.I will be back soon,MD",MichaelDergar
40,Very good place for pictures.,This place is a photography Heaven. So much beautiful scenery to take in and to add to the photo collection. Gardens from all over the World and libraries from France and England are on display here. I especially loved the Chinese/Japanese gardens and buildings. Be prepared to do a lot of walking though so you have to make sure to pick the right days. Coming here during the hottest days of Summer is not a good idea. I suggest coming here in October and November/December. Will be the best combination of exercise and sight seeing.,Berginyon X
40,"Lovely house, world-class collection of rare manuscripts and beautiful gardens","I have rambled through the gardens may times. There are areas of giant cacti larger than anything you can see in the wild, eucalyptus groves that smell lovely after a rain, classic formal flower gardens with palms and beautiful urns. If you are lucky to be there when the air is clear the gardens have stunning vistas of the snow capped mountains in Angeles National Forest.Don't miss the rare book collection in the lower level of the house, it is one of the best 4 in the world. See a Caxton Bible, illustrated manuscripts and many rare editions.The walking mall in the city of old Pasadena is a great place to have lunch.",ChristineMargaret
50,A day in Paradise,"Let me start by saying: ""An afternoon at the Huntington is NOT enough time!"". The gardens are expansive; only made it to the Chinese and Desert gardens and they were breathtaking. Very well maintained...easily could have spent entire day just at gardens. Took the audio tour of the Huntington Art Gallery, housed in the original family home. Many British portraiture pieces ('Blue Boy', being the most iconic), with some furniture, home decor and decorative pieces, too. Nicely done and the scale is manageable. Had lunch at the Rose Garden Tea Room, which was convenient and fun ('tea' menu: buffet of finger sandwiches, salads and desserts and choice of a variety of hot teas). Sprinted through the Library, which surely did not do it justice. Parking was free (unbelievable in LA) and the staff were friendly/helpful. If you're looking for a respite from the hustle and bustle of LA, restore your equilibrium at the Huntington.",awatson
50,Gardens,"These Gardens were amazing, excellent for a family, Couples or just anyone wanting to escape the Busy City of LA. We trained from LA and got a Taxi to the Gardens from Pasadena which was a lovely place to explore. Allow a Day because this is worth a visit cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.. And I could not believe there was not a Tour advertising this place, we just learnt from word of mouth. Enjoy",sal12
50,Beautiful and Peaceful,We had a great time admiring the art and beautiful gardens at The Huntington Library. One can spend hours walking through the different gardens and art exhibitions as well as just having some peaceful time at the Japanese garden. My 8 year old daughter found the Children's Garden to be fun and really enjoyed the Plant Experiment section as it was a hands on experience.,adriana2travel
50,Amazing place - a must visit,"Image gardens of over 200 acres. My favorite was the breathtaking Chinese Garden, the largest one outside of China. We went on a walking tour. If you want to know about the history of the Huntington's and lots of interesting stories, then this free tour is for you.The rare book room artfully displays the Gutenberg Bible, originals and first editions of Shakespeare, Chaucer, writings of Susan B Anthony and so much more.There's the art gallery, which used to be the Huntington's home. In the walking tour, you'll hear the story of the 30 year attempt to buy the Blue Boy.Currently, there's an exhibit of World War l posters that you'll really like. We hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did and take lots of pictures.We were there 3 hours and didn't see everything.",SuzieeQ
50,Enjoyed the day,"All the gardens are beautiful. Especially the Zen garden, but don't missing the Japanese garden. Make a day out of it.",PPIEW7
50,"Outstanding, not nearly as well known as it should be...","This place is huge, and the art is amazing but the gardens even more so. We spent almost 5 1/2 hours here last week, including about an hour in the tea room (make reservations - they're required for the tea room but very worth it), and I think we only saw perhaps 1/4 of the whole thing.The Japanese garden is by far the best one I have ever seen, and features a very large huge arching wooden bridge, and a tremendous collection of Bonsai trees, which are actually works of art as gardeners use metal wires and frames to restrict their growth.The Chinese garden is said to be the largest outside of China and is absolutely gorgeous, dominated by a huge pond with bridges and cut out windows in the walls of the structures - it looks like something that could have come straight out of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""The Rose Garden is fabulous - I had no idea that there are so many variety of roses, and against a backdrop of huge, weeping willow trees and copula's with statues, its fantastic.The art is fabulous as well but perhaps not quite as good as some of our other major museums in the LA area. Huntington's old house houses a collection of furniture, silver, and mostly many different paintings (including the famous Blue Boy) - the downside to me was that all most all of the paintings were simply portraits - very few fantasy / religious scenes or anything else. A second building had more modern art, including a very interesting exhibit on craftsman style houses which Pasadena is known for - this exhibit was tucked away and easily missed, so if that interests you be on the lookout for it. I didn't find the modern art here to be as compelling as what's on display usually at LACMA (LA County Museum of Art) but it was good.Like I said, we only saw perhaps 1/4 of the place - we missed the cactus gardens, the lilly ponds, the Australian gardens among other things, all of which I am told are equally spectacular to what we saw, so will certainly be returning in the near future to see more.",MachThree
50,"Amazing Mansion, Art Galleries and Gardens","The Huntington Library is an amazing place to visit.In regards to the library piece, the Huntington Library has over 67,000 rare books. There are also historic maps, and more.There is also an amazing art gallery. The Blue Boy and Pinkie are two of the most known pieces of art in this large collection.The mansion is open for visiting and shows the decadent life style that was enjoyed by entrepreneur and railroad man Henry Huntington and his wife. The mansion has many treasures and it is a delight to wander from room to room.Then comes the amazing gardens. The three gardens I like the most are the Japanese Garden, the cactus garden, and the sculpture garden. When the camelia garden is in bloom I too delight in visiting it. The grounds are impressively large; with an outstanding variety of plants. In the Japanese garden, one of the favorite things I always enjoy doing is to ring the large Japanese gong bell. All the gardens are amazingly beautiful and a photographer's dream to photograph.We have also enjoyed tea while visiting Huntington Library.There is also an impressive gift store. We have purchased items to give as gifts or to enjoy ourselves.We have visited Huntington Library and Gardens multiple times and never grow tired of it.Do check the hours when the library is open. as they do vary sometimes by season.The place never ceases to amaze me when we visit.",mini

50,Pinkie and the Brain? (no Blue Boy),Well out of the way on my California vacation I had to trek to the Huntington Library to see the art collection including the famous Blue Boy and Pinkie. This huge campus with multiple building and gardens exceeding my expectations. Well worth facing the California freeways.,nonskim
50,Go Early,"Be there soon after opening to get a good parking spot. I would also bring my own sandwich next time as the food choice is very limited and geared toward the ""fast"" variety. Also bring water if you go in the summer as it gets very hot strolling around the beautiful gardens.I think this is a must see in the Los Angeles area if you like museums. The portrait gallery in the main house of the estate is world class. There's Pinky and Blue Boy of course but also many other spectacular portraits, sculptures, porcelain from the great porcelain makers of the world and paintings. The Huntingtons were an interesting couple, definitely read up on them and they collected some very choice items for their home and library. Well worth a day or half a day if that's all you have.",seattlefamilyoffive
50,Plan on Spending the Entire Day,"There is so much to see and do here. The Main Exhibition Hall is in the original home. That's where you will find the English painters--Turner, Gainsborough, Lawrence. In the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art there are paintings as well as ceramics and sculptures. An entire room is devoted to Greene and Greene with other examples throughout the gallery. The Botanical Gardens are beautiful even in the summer. The roses were a bit past their prime but the Japanese Garden is so tranquil. Don't miss the bonsai. I didn't even get to many of the other gardens. Right now there is construction going on--a new gift shop, etc. but it shouldn't interfere with your visit.",Jema_T_12
50,Beautiful inside and out!,"Spent hours in the gardens, rushed through the mansion and art museum. Didn't even have time to check out the library during our single day visit. Definitely worth the 3,000 mile trip to see it!",Potso
50,If you like old things and nice gardens,"Good for a relaxing day of rest or walking around the grounds. These grounds are a bit more ""planned"" the Descanso Gardens in La Canada. Come by and take a look. Nothing quick, come by and walk the grounds or tour the buildings but never in a rush.",Robert L
50,Magnificent gardens of every type,"Wear your walking shoes,a hat and sunscreen. Bring water. It is a glorious day outdoors in gardens of every variety. You will want your camera to record the plants and their names. My friend and I spent 2 hours in the succulent/cactus gardens and then ran out of time to see everything else before we had to leave. The Japanese garden and the Chinese Garden (so new it is not even on the map) are spectacular. There were so many areas that we did not have time to see: the conservatory, the rose garden, the herb garden, the library, the art collection, etc. They will have to be for another trip.This is my fourth trip to the Huntington and I still have not seen it all. I have been in beautiful gardens in many other places, but none has the breadth of collection like the Huntington.Definitely worth the trip, but allow enough time to see it all. Stay until closing and eat dinner in Pasadena to avoid rush hour traffic. Yes, the cafe has a long line, but you can go around the hot food line if you only want a sandwich or salad. Or you can pay $29.00 per person and dine in the Tea Room.The first Thursday each month is free, but requires advance reservations and is limited to only those persons with reservations. Even if you pay, it is well worth the price!",Lyn K
50,Gardens Everywhere,"The first thing we did was take a walking tour with a docent. It was unusually hot but our docent tried to keep us in the shade most of the times. Japanese and Chinese gardens were marvelous. We were delighted to have lunch in the teahouse. The rose garden was breathtaking. It takes 60 plus gardeners to maintain all the gardens. To cool off we went inside to ""The Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art."" Quoting from their colorful brochure, ""The collection presently occupies 21,000 square feet..this collection has grown to include 12,000 paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, drawings, prints and photographs."" The famous ""Blue Boy"" and the famous ""Pinkie"" are housed in this gallery. Plan to spend at least one whole day! I'll go back again the next time I'm in Southern California.",GrammyJ43

50,"Amazing Art & Sculptures, Elegant Buildings, Outstanding Gardens","We wanted to visit some place unique and not often talked about in the Los Angeles area. It w The Huntington Library, Art Collection and Gardens was a suggestion from a libarian colleague and friend. It proved to us to be an outstanding choice and is a world class attraction.This institution is located in San Marino, California and was established by Henry Edward Huntington, a landowner, art collector, businessman and visionary. It is a collections based, educational and research facility. Henry Huntington played a major role in the development of southern California. He was the nephew and heir of Collis P. Huntington, one of the Big Four railroad tycoons of 19th century California.Huntington's former home, is the Huntington Art Gallery. It has British and French artworks from the 17th and 18th centuries. When we stepped in the gallery we were told we had a guide to explain the various artworks for 40 minutes to us and a handful of others--what a treat of insightful knowledge and insight!We saw Thomas Gainborough's, ""The Blue Boy"". The gallery also carries 17th through 20th century American art. We saw Mary Cassatt's, ""Breakfast in Bed"".The Huntington Library has a collection of rare books, first editions and manuscripts. We saw for example, Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" and Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"".We saw several mythological statues lined up on either side of a vast lawn as a run-up to the art gallery. There are variously themed gardens on 120 acres. We experienced the Shakespeare Garden with the bust of Shakespeare and a variety of roses. The Rose Hill Foundation Conservatory was warm and humid when we entered it and contains various tropical plants like orchids, banana trees and huge palms.If you are ever in the Los Angeles area or in the close by communities of Monrovia, Arcadia and Pasadena do make a stop at The Huntington, you'll be thoroughly amazed at the wealth of art, beauty, vastness of the place and you'll leave impressed and educated.",docevida_5
50,Just about every plant on the planet,"OK, there couldn't be every single type of plant on the planet, but it's probably about as close as possible. If you love landscaping and growy things, you must visit here. It is organized into climates and/or countries, and then displayed beautifully. I have yet to visit a ""cactus"" display anywhere else like the Huntington's. There is plenty of signage to figure out what is what. If you're really into horticulture, plan to spend the day. There are some popular areas (like the Asian gardens areas and rose gardens) that get crowded, but there are plenty of other areas where there won't be anybody. Don't eat at the on-site cafe because the wait is long, and you burn your time waiting in line. The entrance fee, in my opinion, is totally worth it.",juliethefirehorse
50,Excellent experience,"Spend all day there. They have a nice cafeteria as well. We only had time to visit the art portion and a bit of a new exhibition within the library, but it was very good, educational, and well presented. The gardens are particularly beautiful, but it will take a lot of time to see them all, so plan your visit well. Be prepared for a lot of walking, just as if you were shopping in a mall.",TonyD44

50,What the Good LIfe was Like,"If you want to have a leisurely walk around a tranquil, bucolic landscape setting in the middle of suburban environment, this will be a rewarding time well-spent. As a ""plus"" you will be able to view the home of one of California's 4 ""robber barons"", Henry Huntington. It's a magnificent home and grounds that has also been turned into a world-class art museum, too. The garden itself is one of the world's gem, having plantings and flowers from all the continents and a huge glass house for tropical plants. Recently millions upon millions of dollars have been poured into a Chinese garden made by experienced gardeners imported, yes, imported from China for authenticity purposes. A smaller similar Japanese garden exists. I don't like to spend too much time at these kinds of places but this one is worth 2-4 hours of,roaming about or easily 4-6 hours if interested in the art hanging in the library, itself. Really, should be called a museum. There is another world-class art museum in Pasadena, the Norton Simon Museum..Reservations are required the first Thursday of the month because no admission is charged. You need to reserve a month ahead of time. All other days no reservations needed. Closed Tuesdays Open from 10:30 am to 4:30 pm, some days noon to 4:30 pm. This library is located in one of the high-toney neighborhoods of the Pasadena area and worth a 10-15 minute self-tour of some of its exquisite homes and similar homes in the southern part of Pasadena.

The gardens are kept up and vary from southwest to Japanese to Chinese.My brother and his family were with us -- they decided to become members so they could come back monthly or more frequently.The staff and docents are cordial and even spent extra time telling us which paintings and sculptures might appeal to our 5 year old.Make certain you see the library building and one of 24 vellum Gutenberg Bibles in existence.We got there when they opened and left at closing but will be back any time we visit my brother who lives nearby.,JamesJOceanside_CA
50,Lots to see- indoors and out,"We were here on a very hot day. The desert garden is great, and the plants fit the weather perfectly.

There is so much to see and explore here. I wish we could have spent more time, but we were in Pasadena for a wedding and could not see it all. I would enjoy visiting this place again. There is also a lovely gift shop. The food at the cafe was pretty good and there was variety to choose from. The admission price is hefty at this place, but it was well worth it.",Jennifer D

50,Beautiful oasis,"We visited the Huntington Botanical Gardens and Art Collection on a lovely, relatively cool July day, which made touring the gardens in particular much more pleasant than is usually the case in the middle of the summer. The gardens are spectacular--more than a hundred acres that include everything from a jungle garden to desert garden to rose garden to lily ponds with koi. There are extensive perfectly manicured lawns as well surrounding the art museum, originally the Huntington house, which rises on a hill and has wonderful views of the LA skyline to the south. One can spend hours in the gardens--we spent nearly two--and then take in the art collections, which skew towards portraiture (think Romney, Gainesborough, and Lawrence). There are landscapes as well, and one in particular, by Constant Troyon, ""Sunshine and Shadow,"" was stunning in its use of light to evoke a sense of place and time. The Huntington is a gem, well worth spending several hours of your California trip.",Leslie W

We were there for more than four hours, yet I wished I had another three hours there at the very least. They have worked hard to make the gardens more accessible for wheelchairs so some of the paths are easier to walk than others. We went on a Monday when museums are closed in the city of Los Angeles. SO very glad we made the trip. Well worth the admission fee.",misskathi

North America too. The ones at Huntington are extensive and among the best in North America. The Chinese one is Suzhou inspired and the Japanese one is a bit more eclectic. Both feature impressive and lovely ponds and water elements. I've been several times, and would go more often if it wasn't so far from where I live. Allow plenty of time to explore and hang out. The grounds include a number of other botanical gardens as well as the library itself. One note about food. Avoid the cafe which has very ordinary (and unhealthy) food and eat at the dining area in the Chinese garden where the food is prepared to order and there's a fairly decent choice of food and beverage.",CrisPopenoe
50,Beautiful and fascinating,The grounds are huge and their is a large variety of plants and trees. We spent 3 hours there and could have stayed longer had we planned for more time. My favorite was the desert garden. It was a hot day but there were plenty of shaded areas to remain cool. They offer a student discount.,LauraV9132013
50,It's more than a garden,We had a morning entry. The environment was so relaxing and the decoration was so detailed. I heard that the garden was even nicer in spring with blossom.,katikaty

Historical exhibits! Summer concerts! An absolute must see when you are in the San Gabriel Valley area!",ChaplainDan
40,Quick Trip to Huntington Library & Gardens,"We only had 2 hours to see and definitely needed two more hours. The grounds/gardens were beautiful. The art was beautiful, however we ran out of time to see both art buildings.",skminn
40,Exhausting,"Very difficult to get to by public transport, so only go if you have a car. Once there, though a very impressive set of pavilions devoted to a eclectic mix of interests. Best was the Library, with its First Folio Shakespeare, Gothenburg Bible, Ellesmere Chaucer and so on, but the mansion was also good, including the Blue Boy taken from Britain with much furore in the 1920s and other Gainsborough's. American pavilion of less interest, except the furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright. Outside gardens very good, especially the Japanese garden. You need a full day to get around here!",HerculePiorot
50,What a Wonderful Place to Stroll,"Whether you leisurely stroll around the grounds. Take in one of the exhibits, dine in one of the high restaurants (my favorite was the high tea room, worth the price and such fun, nice break in the middle if the day) or go for a lecture! Go!",Holly K
50,Beautiful cactus and succulent garden.,There is a lot of construction going on right now as they are building a new entrance pavilion. The gardens are beautiful and they have new things to see. There is a new waterfall and pavilion in the Chinese garden. The museum contains a great art collection with works of art you will recognize. I enjoy the gardens frequently. It is great for photography.,Bakeries
50,Outstanding,"Aside from being a beautiful place to visit, they also have a great collection of art as well as old manuscripts and books which includes a Gutenberg Bible (on vellum). The many and varied gardens are a marvel, especially the Asian gardens. First Thursdays of the month are free, but you have to get your tickets in advance the month prior. However, the price of regular admission is worth it. Arrive early, because the place closes at 4:30pm, and you will be sad to leave if you haven't at least walked all the gardens once.",AZdesert-rat
50,A pure jewel.,"Always fascinating to visit this place: we can profit by the beautiful and original gardens from the Japanese one to the subtropical; two main buildings are dedicated to sculptures and paintings: my preferred which was Huntington personal dwelling displays on the first floor most of the famous English painters from Reynolds, Hobarth, Romney to Turner and Constable and we are always fascinated by the great Gainsbourough masterpieces as this Boy in blue inspired by Van Dyck. With the second floor, a lot of great European painters will be admired: Canaletto, Guardi, two Ghirlandajo (so rare!), and others: Italian, Flemish and Dutch...",t0up0ul0u
50,Fabulous art - wonderful gardens,"We planned to visit with our group from 11 am - 4 pm - which seemed like a long time. It wasn't enough! There is so much to see that we could have spent another couple of days. From Pinky and Blue Boy to a children's splash garden to a Japanese sand garden to roses.We had a rather ordinary lunch at the sandwich bar and sat outside in the shade. There is a more formal sit-down restaurant in the Chinese garden section.The gift shop has an interesting variety of items with a smart selection of gifts.I'd advise you to go, plan to stay, and take a hat and sunscreen!Enjoy!",ndegan
50,Beautiful relaxing palce,A great garden with museum buildings housing excellent display of art and furniture.I little expensive at $24 per person.,DAVID D
40,Plan sufficient time as there is a lot to see,"What an amazing place to visit! Our 10 year old was only able to manage a couple of hours, but I could have stayed all day and then some. The art collections are very impressive, the grounds are beautiful, and the library is filled with many exquisite displays, one of which is a Gutenberg bible, very old and very beautiful. My suggestion would be to either plan a series of short, selective visits for children under 12 or 14, or just make other arrangements for them if you really want to see what is there. Even then, you will need to plan several hours and probably one day inside and one day outside. I am looking forward to going back after the construction in order to see so much of what was missed the first time.",smjustus
50,Huntington Library,"Loved the grounds, the painting "" Blue boy and Pinkie"" wonderful. Especially loved the french impressionist. The grounds were beautiful and the Japanese gardens stupendous.

50,Top Destination in Pasadena,"This facility combines a large botanical garden with a world-class museum and library.The 120 acre garden is spectacularly lovely. Our favorites were the large succulents in the desert garden and the rows of beauty and fragrance in the rose garden. There was also a lovely pond full of water lilies. Too many lovely scenes to mention them all.The European art collection was such a pleasure to vewi. It includes the famous Blue Boy and Pinky but there were many more. The American collection, while smaller, was nevertheless impressive.Finally, the Library: what an impressive collection of manuscripts and documents spanning a millennium. The Gutenberg Bible and early Canterbury Tales displays were my favorites, but the more contemporary documents were also impressive.If I lived anywhere near this place, I would purchase a membership!",sanantoniojoan
50,Something for almost everyone,"We visited the Huntington this past weekend for a graduation celebration. We did a private garden tour and had Michael was our guide. Very knowledgeable. Did you know that until Disneyland opened it was the most popular SoCal destination? There is too much to see in one day, but it is a place that has beautiful grounds and gardens, a library like no other, and art collections that are worth a day trip even without all the rest.",Kim J
50,Serene and Lovely,"I regret that I only had an hour and a half to savor the beauty of the Huntington Botanical Gardens. I headed for the Japanese gardens and the beauty and symmetry of the moon bridge was where I sat to meditate and pray. I couldn't have picked a better spot. Even in February the garden looked lovely and despite construction at the entrance of the Huntington and the admission price, it was worth the trip.",Marcia2424
50,A Top Attraction for the Los Angeles Area,"The Huntington Library offers an assortment of rich gardens and a beautiful collection of artwork and literature. Without going into much detail, I would say the grounds and grandeur of the Huntington Library is the closest one might come to experiencing something like a European castle while in California. (I would rate Hearst Castle in San Simeon a close second.) A day's visit here is a day well spent.",humu1
50,Great place to visit,"Huntington Library & Gardens is a beautiful place to visit. The library is impressive: Gutenburg Bible, letters from Abraham Lincoln, letters to George Washington, etc. The gardens are amazing. I particularly loved the Japanese & Chinese Gardens. The art collection is nice, but if you have limited time, skip it. It isn't as impressive as the Art Institute of Chicago. Spend your time in the library and the gardens.",Buffy24
50,botanical paradise,"Like the Chinese garden 流芳园，it has a rich collection of trees, flowers and plants. Various kinds of roses are really beautiful. They have different flowers for different seasons. Art collections are also good.",reacher527
50,Great way to spend a day or more,"A fascinating place for art, books and gardens. What a great legacy Mr. Huntington left. You will be amazed at the book collection and the art.",truckee07
50,Something for everyone,"This complex has a little bit of everything. The library has a number of rare books, although I didn't actually to into it. The art gallery has a number of paintings, ceramics, antiquities etc. In a room reminiscent of the Frick Museum in NYC is the original ""Blue Boy"" by Gainsborough. The grounds include numerous flowers, an entire field of different types of roses, flowering trees and scuptures. There is also an Japanese garden, a Chinese garden with buildings, water features and sculptures. I went with a friend who had been there many times before, so could help me navigate. It is a place you could visit many times and still not see it all.",Joan S
50,One of Los Angeles museums not to miss,"Great way to spend the day roaming the gardens and admiring the art, books and manuscripts going back 100s of years.",RL18
50,Plant lover's dream!,"I've been to this place three times and each time there are different things to see. First of all, I came here mainly for the gardens and not for the art galleries. So I can not contribute much regarding arts and paintings. The many acres of gardens are well maintained and themed into different types. My favorite by far is the Desert garden. Here, you can stroll for hours looking at all the fascinating cacti and succulents from around the world. It is one of the best in the world and perhaps the best known. Another one that I like is the Chinese garden. It is fairly new and is still being expanded. In the future it will be even more impressive. Very well made to look like an ancient Chinese garden. The Japanese garden is also well kept. Plenty of bonsai and a tea house. If you like roses, there's a nice rose garden there also. There's also a large conservatory with exotic tropical plants, and of course, there are a dozen other gardens on the property.One day is really not enough to walk through the whole place, and I'm talking about just the gardens. The best advice I would give is to go as early as possible (they open at 10:30 AM weekdays for the summer hours and closed on Tuesdays) and plan your routes carefully. There is a lot of walking involved as the place is huge. Work around your favorite gardens to ensure you get enough time for them. For me, I start from the Desert garden and spend a couple of hours there. Then I crossed over to the lily ponds and made my way to the Japanese garden. Then a short detour to the rose garden before heading to the Chinese garden. Then ended up on the conservatory which is close to the current entrance. By the time we left the conservatory, it was 4 PM and they closed at 4:30 PM. Be sure to save time for photos. There are plenty of restrooms and drinking fountains through out the gardens. Also, remember to wear a hat and sunscreen, and good walking shoes. I got a mild sunburn there. Finally, some of the gardens, like the Japanese garden, were built on hilly areas so there will be plenty of steps and uphill climbing. Consider your's or your companion's walking abilities.The gift shop near the entrance was a bit disappointing. I wish they have more choice on souvenir items. Most items are either generic or related to art only. All I want is a pen, postcards, or magnets that says ""Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens."" None to be found!Overall, I love this place and would come back anytime. In case you don't know. There is a free admission on the first Thursday of each month. You can get tickets on their website and you have to get it on the first of each month for the Thursday of the proceeding month. For example, if you want to go to the free Thursday of August, you have to get the tickets on July 1st. Hope this helps.",RainbowCowboy
50,A work of art,I just went to the gardens. The gardens where magnificent. They well organised. The Chinese garden made me like I was china. In the Chinese they have Chinese restaurant.,Daniel L
50,Beautiful Grounds,Went here for the first time and was very impressed with the size of the grounds and the various sections. Did a docent lead tour that was very informative and gave a nice overview of the grounds. Will definitely need to come back and spend a bit more time and go at different times of the year so that I can see the various plants in bloom!,Fechef
50,Go see the new Chinese garden!,We haven't been since the Chinese garden opened so we had a pleasant surprise. It still isn't complete but what is done is jaw droppingly gorgeous. We walked the gardens for 2 hours and could've spent the whole day outside but we didn't want to miss the art and collections. Bring the kids for a fun day too.,Monica W
40,Fun For Grownups And Kids!,"This place is great. It's a 120 acre house formally owned by a couple who lived in the early 1900's and who liked gardening, art, and rare books. I went with my girlfriend and her 9yo son and my 7 and 10yo sons.There's several themed gardens. The boys loved the children's garden. It had some pretty innovative features: a rock with nails sticking out of it that sounded like a wind chime when you dropped rocks into it. Metal sand that was magnetic, so it did all sorts of funky stuff when you put it on a metal pipe, and a tunnel with a prism in the middle that showed the color spectrum in a pretty snail-like swirl. Hard to describe, but beautiful. Tee pees were there made out of plants.We didn't get to all of the themed gardens, but we walked through the rose garden, the Japanese garden (kids had fun messing with the Koi), the Lily Ponds (there were turtles, Koi, and a family of ducks walking by), the subtropical garden, a bog, and a jungle garden. There were a few open fields that the boys had fun running, rolling and hiding in. We didn't get to the Chinese garden, the desert garden, the herb garden, and more.We went into the house, which was huge, and looked at all of the paintings, sculptures, vases, and other art work. There was a whole other building that we didn't get to.We didn't get to everything, so I will bring the kids back. It's also a place I can see myself going to to connect with nature and have some solitude.The only reason my review is not 5 stars is the fact that you can't bring food or drink into the facility. With young kids, that's always a factor. There were a couple of places inside to buy food, but I didn't see them. Also, the price is a little steep: $20 for adults during the week, and $23 on the weekends, $8 for youth. They do give an amount of free tickets one day per month, which is how we came this time. I plan to buy a membership so that we can go back again.Overall, lots to do and see, a great way to entertain the kids and renew yourself.",Anissa D
50,Great walks,This is a must if you are in Pasadena. The outdoor gardens are just a great places to lose yourself for a couple of hours. It's fun to see the freaky plants and share the names with the kids. More cactus and rose plants than you knew existed.,fpk932
50,After 3 visits I want to see more,"On this trip we spent some time on a docent lead tour. I had previously enjoyed wandering through the many features of this fantastic place, but learned and saw so many more things during our tour.On this trip I particularly enjoyed the rain forest plants in the Conservatory and the Chinese and Japanese gardens, as well as the rose garden.We were alerted to the Archimedes Palimpsest by our tour guide and were fascinated by the exhibit and by the information that we learned.We saw some of the art in what was the mansion which was beautiful, but overwhelming.Look forward to many future visits",Linda O

50,Truly Amazing - but Set Aside a Full Day!,"Whether you live in the greater L.A. area or are just visiting, and if you think nothing can match or exceed the famous Getty Villa in Malibu and the great Getty Museum in L.A., be prepared to be surprised and amazed: The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens is the most amazing place one could imagine considering its combination of the world's finest library, incredible art galleries (yes, that's plural), and 120 acres (!) of multiple gardens, including the most exquisite Japanese garden that people from that country actually cross the Pacific to experience firsthand. My wife and I spent 3+ hours walking the place and completely exhausted we recommend this for others contemplating a visit: it is not possible in any way to take everything in during a single visit - you need to focus on either the library and art collections, or spend the day wandering the gardens. Fortunately for us we live only two hours away in San Diego so we can come back without too much trouble, and we will for sure.The place is astonishingly beautiful while also set in an affluent area that many will not have heard of: San Marino, with the most astonishing, old-money mansions (and fueled, no doubt, by a lot of ""not-so-old-money"" from Hollywood), which makes Beverly Hills look like an average neighborhood.Of course, if staying overnight, you could enjoy the one-of-a-kind Langham Huntington Pasadena, if you feel like splurging more than just a little bit. An old-money place that happily accepts not-so-old-money ;-)",TraderBo
50,Huntington Gardens,"So much more than a garden. Just wandering the many areas can take all afternoon. My personal favorite is the desert area. Every time of year there is something different blooming there. Go inside one of the exhibit areas for whatever exhibits may be there during your visit. Be sure to visit the library for its amazing collection from The Canterbury Tales to Abraham Lincoln documents and many more. Plan to spend many hours at the Huntington, although it is only open 12 to 4 and 10:30 to 4 in the summer.",1Barb65

40,Longer hours would be nice,"At $23 a pop to get in, this place isn't cheap and they close at 4:30. Sure, winter hours maybe, but in the summer when the sun goes down later? Why can't they extend the hours?The grounds are beautiful. We arrived around 11:00 am, and left when the gates closed at 4:30 and covered maybe 70% of the Huntington, and still left the library and art collection.Someone said you can picnic? I thought I saw a sign that said no outside food. If so, that would be an added bonus, as the food inside here is PRICY! The cafe prices were not cheap, and neither was the Chinese cafe.We scored a 3:15 reservation for the Huntington Tea Room, but that wasn't cheap either at $29 a person... but its all you can eat, so that made it less painful.Overall a lovely place. I'd try to take advantage of the free Thursdays, and save yourself money. Parking is free, plenty of disabled parking, and they are disable friendly (for the most part).Not advisable for kids who have attention problems. Please leave your cute, but annoying kids at home if they don't like looking at plants or fine art work.",callmemochelle

I'm sure there is more to see but we covered the highlights in that amount of time, thanks to the docent who guided us for the first hour. The Chinese and Japanese gardens are lovely, built with materials and by artisans from their respective countries. I personally loved the herb garden, where we could not break off a leaf but were able to rub them to smell the remarkable variety of scents. We went to to the American art museum and to see the Huntington family's art collection in their magnificent mansion. It was all remarkable, but my personal favorite of the museum portion was in the library, which housed first editions of treasured printings such as a Guttenberg bible, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and many other treasured documents including the sciences. I highly recommend this experience!",edyrp

Make sure you get there early because there is so much to see and the time is limited because they open at noon and closr at 4:30, except on certain days.

50,"Corpse Flower, a Gutenberg bible and Blue Boy","Unfortunately we did not get to see the corpse flower bloom since it averages 13 years between blooms.We *did* get to see Blue Boy and a lot of other great works of art, including some 15th century religious icons.The library is amazing. You will see one of the few complete vellum copies of the Gutenberg Bible that remain, as well as a hand illuminated Canterbury Tales, a First Folio and so much more!We were there pretty much from open to close and didn't even get into the American Art portion and probably only saw a third of the gardens. You will most likely need two days to see it all.One of my new favorite places on Earth!",LMStaton
50,An ideal day for those of all ages,"This was our favorite stop in our just completed trip to LA. While the library and the art galleries were our primary targets, our memories of the visit will long be dominated by the breathtaking gardens. Of particular note is the desert garden, the largest of its kind I have ever seen. The fascinating cacti, desert tree, shrubs and flowers seem like creations out of a Dr. Seuss book. Nearby the cacti garden, which we noticed kids enjoying as much as adults, was the lily pond, which captivated even the youngest visitors. The ponds, geese, ducks and turtles provided a kaleidescope of colors and movement that were worthy of the Monet and the other impressionists in the art galleries.In addition, currently running at The Huntington is a special exhibit about Archimedes. We reached there after 5 hours of enjoying the gardens and galleries. We were totally spent, but we lingered for yet another hour at this exhibition because it was like nothing we had ever encountered.To come to LA and miss The Huntington would be a real loss for the visitor.",Anthony-Susan
50,Something For Everyone,If you’re looking to spend the day in a fabulous garden this is it. The cactus garden is my personal favourite and it’s amazing for adults and kids alike. Each garden has a theme and are remarkable. The library is absolutely a must see- Seeing the Gutenberg Bible was truly special and I’ll talk about it for a long time. It also contains an amazing collection of art including a Mary Cassatt and The Blue Boy and Pinky. This can either be an academic tour or one just for pleasure- so feel free to take your most varied group of friends or family.,Lio-et-Ben

When I come here, it never gets too crowded (probably because I manage to come here on weekdays).If you are looking for some great shots, dust off that dslr sitting in the garage, corner of your room or desk and bring it to Huntington.My personal favorite is the Japanese / Chinese gardens and rose garden.",monica k

The kids area with the fountains is SUPER cute (though I was worried about the amount of bees flying around there).Also had tea here. That did not leave me thrilled. It was not cheap (not crazy expensive either) but the quality really didn't seem to live up to what I expected. The food was ok but the tea and coffee did not seem good quality (esp the coffee, yuck).Overall it is just so beautiful I would come back for sure. Just don't eat here...",OlgaRonis
50,Great experience,"The minute you walk into the museum you already know that the works of art you see will be in your head will captivate you for a long time after you leave. Well organized, good dining area, great for tourists, but if you are looking for a gift shop, go somewhere else. Random items that have nothing to do with the museum and very expensive works of art are all you will find there",max m

50,More to See Than Just Beautiful Gardens,"We spent several hours here on a beautiful and sunny Saturday afternoon and tried to see as much as possible. Not only are there many amazing gardens to visit, but there are also two small art collections and a library, with rare books and historical documents on display, which I thoroughly enjoyed. it seems like the admission cost is high until you realize all there is to see. The rose and Japanese gardens were my favorites, but the rest of the family liked the huge desert garden collection, which had some pretty wild cactus varieties. Having come from the very cold Midwest, it was quite a treat to walk among so many beautiful flowers on such a warm day. We ate lunch at the outdoor grill, which was very crowded, but the food was surprisingly good. I certainly would visit again the next time I am in Los Angeles.",poem19girl
50,A Gem in Southern California,"To walk the gardens, the various halls, it's taking a step back in time. The Japanese Garden, Rose Gardens, the Children's Garden and the new Chinese Garden are all so amazing and breath taking. But don't forget to visit Blue Boy and Pinky!! The only set back is the $20.00 price tag to get in, so get there early to get your monies worth as they close at 4:30pm prompt! Also try to get reservations at the Tea Room. This needs to be done a month ahead at least, there are NO walk-ins. The buffet is worth every penny!!! It's one of my favorite things to do. Enjoy!!",PineappleShagette

50,Bring Your Walking Shoes,"There's so much to see at The Huntington that I only managed to knock off visiting about 3-4 attractions (out of the list of 22 or so?) before I got too tired to continue. The giant lawn lined with Greek-style statues in front of the Library itself is truly a sight to see. I just wanted to roll around on there!!!The Huntington has a serious varieties of plants in themed gardens, multiple museum/art exhibits, and beautiful scenery overall. It makes for a fun and potentially educational day trip. I visited the rose garden, Japanese garden, Chinese garden, and got lost through some exhibits. The Chinese garden has a mini-tea shop/snack shop serving various ""Chinese"" dishes, but it was very crowded with a long line, so I just passed on by.I'm not sure if my short (2hr) visit was worth the $23 adult weekend admission, but it was definitely worth the $13 student discount price. I hope to return very soon to see the subtropical and jungle gardens.",Jennifer T

In the 4.5 hours I spent here I was amazed with the library with a Gutenberg Bible, a copy of The Canerbury Tales from 1380, a hand written copy of Jack London's ""White Fang,"" and handwritten letters from Isaac Newton and John Muir. I also visited the European Art Collection and saw ""The Blue Boy"" and 'Pinkie"" among others. Then I visited the Chinese, Japanese and desert gardens (all amazing).

And so many different types of cacti, it is impossible to keep track. It is also a scenic place for a wedding. There is plenty of parking. And it is close to downtown Pasadena. So if the snack bar doesn't float your boat,head back on the main road for lunch. B sure to look for the fork in the road.",Kathy S
50,A wonderland of beauty.,"So gorgeous. You can easily spend the day wandering from one spectacular garden to another. In the spring, the desert garden was an unexpected delight.

50,beautiful gardens,"I love visiting the Huntington, especially the desert garden, which was the first one developed. But the newest, the Chinese garden, is also spectacular; it has been recently expanded, too. And who does not enjoy seeing the wonderful art. including famous portraits like ""The Blue Boy"" and ""Pinkie"" but also the collection of special objects and small paintings put together by Henry Huntington in honor of his wife Arabella, now displayed together? This is a great place to spend a day. Eat at the restaurant in the Chinese Garden if you can, or have a formal, delicious tea (reservations are best) in the tea room rather than simply visiting the small cafe/cafeteria.",NYscholar2
50,Plan to stay the entire day,"Famous, luxurious, offering gardens, art exhibitions and the permanent collections of European and American art as well as the famed library, the Huntington Library and Gardens is spectacular. Go early to avoid crowds. You can rent the audio guides but there is plenty of information about each painting written by the painting or sculpture as well. There are a few cafes that we found crowded, but we waited in line at the Chinese garden. I suggest you go early to avoid the lunch crowds.",suzanochka
50,Huntington always awesome,"Especially with the newly renovated gardens open ... this is a fantastic day experience. It's pricier than some things in Pasadena, but this keeps the crowd levels down.",DougSilton
50,Huntington Library in Pasadena-vast botanical garden & art collection,"I have visited here since I was a child and it never gets old. The botanical gardens are breathtaking covering 120 acres and including the Desert Garden, Japanese Garden, Chinese and Rose Gardens. The camellia collection is the largest in the USA. They are closed on Tuesdays and open at noon during the week; at 10:30 on Saturdays and Sundays. They always close at 4:30 p.m. so it's best to arrive when they open to try and see everything. No picnics allowed on the premises but there is a tea room. There is a lot of walking involved so bring comfortable walking shoes, a hat and sunglasses.",George B
50,"One of my favorite urban parks, with a great museum to boot!","Sometimes I visit and never step inside, just wander though the various sections of gardens...Japanese, Rose, desert, kitchen...they are all wonderful!

Sometimes on a cold or very hot day, we spend the entire visit inside there is so much to enjoy.",TulsaDale
50,Amazing!,"The gardens are superb. I especially like the rose garden in bloom and the herb garden. I feel like those are things I can replicate in my own garden. But I also enjoy seeing the spectacular cactus, Chinese and Japanese gardens. The red-whispered bulbul, which is an exotic bird, hangs out there too and they are so pretty, even tho they are not native I still love seeing them.",MySeaBiscuit13

50,Not to be Missed!,"We live close and visit often. Always a must when we have visitors. If it's nice outside, go for a walk through the very extensive gardens (Chinese, Japanese, lily pond, succulent -best in December when all is in bloom, rose garden, herb garden is a must). Stop for traditional English tea in the tea house then see a museum. The main house holds Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Lawrence's Pinkie. There is also a copy of Gutenburg Bible in the library. Lots to see.",Poomela

And that's just the gardens! The art galleries house a large portrait collection by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Lawrence, Copley, as well as the famous ""Pinky"" and ""Blue Boy."" The American gallery has a memorable Cassatt and several marble sculptures by the noted American sculptor Harriet Hosmer.

50,Wonderful Day At the Gardens,"We spent five, but could have spent many more hours, here yesterday, with our cousins who are members. From the tropical gardens, to the rose gardens, to the bonsai gardens, to the desert gardens, and the multitude of pavilions and exhibitions to see, it was an unexpectedly busy and awe inspiring day, with much more still to see. It was topped off with a late buffet lunch at the Japanese Tea Garden, $30, but worth the money later in the day when it was less busy.",bbilmer

Highly recommend this beautiful and unique treasure.",BathMonkey

50,What a Wonderful day out!,"I visited the Huntington Library and Gardens (for the 3rd time) last Saturday and was happy to see the place was still maintaining its high standards. The gardens were exquisite and at a wonderful, fragrant and colorful time of the year. Even though the car park was almost full once inside there was plenty of room for everyone with no undue noise or crowding. The small outside eatery was clean, with a fun atmosphere and good value salads, sandwiches and snacks,. There was even an outside Bar b q for burgers and hotdogs.amidst this tranquil setting is one of the finest collections of historical books and manuscripts anywhere and the art collection is superb with a huge number of Reynolds and Gainsborough paintings housed in the large and beautiful house itself. The 'Blue Boy' by Gainsborough is in pride of place at the end of the long gallery.This is a great day out for families as well as art enthusiasts, the Japanese and Desert Gardens are spectacular.I will definitely be making another visit soon!",14ukjenny
50,"Early Spring 2014 Visit [actually in San Marino, CA]","We walked through the grounds and the various garden areas. We also completed a self-guided tour of the Archimedes Exhibition.

50,Wonderful afternoon,"Had a wonderful afternoon here with my significant other, so much so that their parents got us annual memberships. Although we only got to see the outdoors areas (i.e. not the library), I would recommend the Desert Garden area, and the Chinese & Japanese Gardens. Absolutely beautiful.

Crowds were streaming in on a beautiful Sunday afternoon to the Huntington Botanical Gardens. Very well maintained and a delightful afternoon. The Japanese Gardens, including the fascinating Bansai collection, was not to be missed. The art museum is mainly a 19th Century portrait show, which is somewhat boring.",pflagdad
40,"Flowers, art and old books","We had a guest from out of state who likes art and gardens so we took her to the Huntington on a Sunday. It opens on the weekend at 10:30 and closes at 4:30 pm. We arrived around 1 pm and parking was close to full. Once you are in the place is so large crowds are not a problem. We saw a great library exhibit. If you likes seeing the history of the world via old original books this is the place. We then walked the vast gardens. The Japanese gardens is also a must see for its beauty and peacefulness. After a small bite to eat at the ""cafe"" we explored the herbs and then the large rose exhibit. At 4:30 we began the exit. This was a very bad idea. Exiting the parking area takes forever since everyone else was trying to jockey from several lanes into one lane. People were generally polite but without someone directing the flow it took forever. The lesson leave before closing and enjoy the place much earlier. There are not lots of bathrooms so when you are near one use it.",Burnie D
10,Nice gardens pity about the rest,"Have visited the Huntington Library and Art Gallery twice in the past two years. I had hoped that the second visit would be an improvement on the first - it was not! The gardens that are complete are beautiful as is the house and art galleries. Unfortunately they do not make up for the staff and catering facilities.The staff are sullen, unhelpful, poorly informed and slovenly looking. Trying to find one particular exhibit took 5 lots of enquires, despite it being in the gallery being visited. The staff were off hand and less than helpful. They really need training in customer care and knowledge of what is displayed in their areas. It would also help if they had the means to keep themselves smart and tidy!The catering is appalling! Over priced, greasy fast food. NO! Not fast food slow would be a better description. There are always long queues and the food is slopped on the plates. The chefs do not seem able to even get the orders right. The tables are not cleared or cleaned properly. When staff are asked to wipe the tables they do so with very bad grace. It is as though it is to much bother. As a result the actual eating area looks disgusting and unhygienic.I know that there are a number of building projects going on at the moment but the situation is the same as when there are none.Will I return there in the future? As things are at the moment I very much doubt it.",Ann W
50,Disneyland for art and nature lovers,"A spring Saturday brought us up the 5 from San Diego to spend a day exploring the marvels of the Huntington Library. Sunny and warm with gentle breezes, the day was filled to overflowing with pleasant surprises. The visitors: polite, friendly, not too noisy in the galleries, awed by the gardens, and best of all, not overwhelming in numbers. The staff: polite, friendly, helpful, efficient. The weather: perfect. The property: magnificent. The collections: splendid. The food service: tasty, reasonably priced, and with plenty of comfortable seating. Admission: $23, worth it. The buildings themselves and the glimpse at life within those walls: major treat.We began in the museums because we like to view art in as quiet and uncrowded settings as possible. Even when groups of talkers were present in galleries, we could explore one room and visit the next as it was vacated. We spent the first half of the day in the buildings and at lunch. We spent the second half of the day walking the dozen or so major garden areas, and it was hard going by about three o'clock. We ended with a visit to the library itself, with its Gutenberg Bible, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, other original manuscripts and tomes, and some very welcome air conditioning.In addition to fabulous collections and amazing grounds, there were hummingbirds and lizards galore, both of which we enjoy in our backyard. As we staggered back from our sojourns in the tropical and desert gardens, we reached the Chinese garden with its recent addition of a rock grotto. It ended up being the finishing touch on a day full of delightful discovery.The freeway was fairly rough going in both directions that day. If we lived closer we would become members and visit the Huntington often.",LJHSViking
50,Do yourself a favor and go here,"We thought we'd spend a couple of hours. Ended up spending the day and wishing we had more time.

I can't wait to go back!",Russell H

50,Amazing Botanical Gardens,"I didn't go into the Library or Art Collection but the Gardens are incredible. I was not expecting gardens so extensive. They have it divided roughly by biosphere/continent-- a chinese garden, japanese, rose, cactus, outback. Amazing to walk through on a sunny afternoon. Definitely worth a visit-- bring your camera.",ldeimos
30,"Had to go for the art, parking an issue and high cost","Had to go see Pinkie and Blue Boy. There were a few other notable works. Cost was quite high for a garden/museum combo. Gardens were average to below-average. Maybe it was the time of year. Parking was abysmal. Go early in the day to avoid that mess. We ended up all the way in the very back, and felt lucky to score a space at all. Hard to believe the place could be that full at the high entrance cost! We learned that weekends in LA are difficult for site seeing and parking. Just too many people trying to see the same things. But now I can check Pinkie and Blue Boy off the list.",Lola2104
50,Beautiful,"The libraries and galleries are incredible; the gardens are some of the best on the west coast, and the tea room offers a special experience for a group that will appreciate it. The gift shop has many wonderful titles, as well as lots of other great stuff- again, one of the best in SoCal, in my experience. The Huntington is great all year round. One of my favorite times to go is in February, when the camelias bloom. Enjoy!",Marianne_joy
50,We Are Members And Never Tire Of Visiting!,"We are blessed to call this our ""back yard"" as it is only about a mile from our home so we visit regularly. I travel the globe constantly with my job but I always consider the Huntington to have one of the best collections of Gainsborough paintings, including the original Blue Boy! As I am also half Japanese and have lived in Japan, any time I feel ""homesick"" for Japan, a quick visit to the gardens gives me a sense of peace and contentment. The ever expanding Chinese garden is also worth a visit in itself. I am always shocked how many locals have never visited! Pasadena is a must for any art lover's visit to SoCal! Between the Huntington and Norton Simon Museum, the visit will rival any major city's collection of fine art.",GolfguyVivigirl
50,Expanded Chinese Garden,"A new section of the Chinese Garden had opened the week before and we were here for a preview of the temporary exhibit, Lost and Found: The Secrets of Archimedes. After visiting these two, we continued on to the recently restored Huntington Art Gallery which displays the traditional art.The new entrance is about one quarter built so for a few years, visitor are using a temporary entrance.We have a membership so enjoy only a small part of the extensive gardens and galleries with each visit.",Kenneth L
40,Searching for Accessibility,"We always visit gardens with a certain amount of trepidation. Although our aunt is in heaven when she visits, we are the ones doing the pushing in a rented wheelchair. Recently we visited on a weekend when the temperatures approached the ninety degree mark, something we easterners hadn't seen in quite some time. Wheelchairs were easily available and there was no additional cost to get one. What we determined later was that at least for two of the buildings that we entered, accessibility meant entering and exiting by the same door. For some of the walkways, it also meant patio stones which are not the most easily navigated with a wheel chair. It was a little early in the gardening season so we didn't expect to see too much. Also, the main entrance to the gardens was closed and construction was taking place at the other entrance. My husband and I actually wanted to see the new Archimedes exhibit. Unfortunately, our aunt figured that after seeing Blue Boy and Pinky, we should spend our time in the outdoors, and that quickly wore us out.My husband and I would love to go back and see the exhibit at our own pace. We did enjoy seeing the paintings in the building that houses the Blue Boy. They are almost exclusively portraits, but interesting nonetheless. We liked the tapestries and vintage furniture that adorned the large rooms. It gave more the allure of a family house as opposed to a museum.We'll return at some point, but now we are more aware of the limitations of wheelchairs and gardens.",VEC24
30,What an Awesome Find!,"I was the guest of a business contact at the Huntington Library and Gardens. Unfortunately, we did not have time to have lunch at the tea house. I highly recommend this museum/home for the art and the gardens. I felt like my business contact treated me to a wonderful find in San Marino area. I would not have had the pleasure of visiting this awesome find had I not been invited by a local resident. How lucky was I? Go see this lovely venue, and I hope the weather is a beautiful day so you can see it all and enjoy!",loist51

50,Beautiful gardens,"We came here so that the two little girls could enjoy the Children's Garden and we weren't disappointed. There was so much for them to do amongst the flowers and the topiary. The designers have built in so many natural play features in what is also a beautiful enclave.After a nice lunch in the cafe where the service was cheerful and unflustered we explored the rest of the gardens the highlight being the Japanese garden with cherry, almond, wisteria and azalea providing a colourful background to the water features.The only negative was that the gardens do not open until 12.00 so that our time was limited and the $20 entrance fee seemed relatively expensive (we heard that on the first Thursday of each month entry is free on pre booking). We also only had a very short time to spare for the galleries so this will have to be a venue to which we return.",GeoffGuiseley

One thing to remember is that the parking is free so that's included in the price of admission. The library will blow your mind with all of the classics that they have. So many orginal first edition books that its priceless. The botanical garden is impressive and everyone really enjoyed it. I was just with my wife but all of the kids were having a blast in the childrens garden. Next to the Japanese garden there's a nice cafe to grab a snack. The succulent garden is the best I've ever seen. Surprises around every corner. Enjoy!,Lumerian

50,We just keep coming back,"We've thought about a membership, but we only plan to visit the LA area once or twice a year and the math doesn't work out. Best Chinese garden we've seen in the USA, top US Japanese garden with spectacular bonsai exhibit. Also best succulent garden we've ever seen anywhere. And the roses!!! This garden has been featured on Garden Smart, but that program did not do it justice.And then there is the art. There are better private collections but this is worth a good part of a day on it's own. The special exhibits have been good, too.Did I mention the tea. Buffet style is a little unusual, but the tea is good, as is the service. Food is very good and unlimited. You should have a reservation for this. Sometimes there is no wait, but often you can't get in without one.And then there is the library. We've only visited as tourists, so we see what the staff has placed on exhibit with each visit. I understand the library is available for researchers.Public hours are limited. Plan your visit to be there for every hour they are open. It is often busy and crowded, and there are a lot of school visits which make it more so, but they usualy take place before the gardens open to the public. Wheelchairs can be arranged for those who need them. Docent led tours are also available. We've only eavesdropped, but they sound good.We've had to go back the next day more than once, just to take it all in. After half a dozen visits over the past 6 years, we finally thought we were done, but writing this, I already want to go back. Work continues on the Asian gardens and I want to see what they will do next.",David_Jones2014
50,Never Disappoints,"You must visit. The grounds are beautiful any time of the year, but check the website for what will be in bloom when you plan to visit. There are many sculptures that grace the grounds and little pathways and alcoves to discover. The art galleries are fantastic! And outstanding collection that is displayed beautifully. The library is also outstanding and often has interesting exhibits offered in addition to the permanent collection.There is a little café where you can get beverages, sandwiches, and that sort of fare, however I like to enjoy a leisurely tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room. (This can be considered a little pricey, but the little buffet of finger sandwiches, salads, desserts, and fruit is well stocked and very fresh and tasty. Delicious mini scones arrive at your table and pots of your choice of teas are delivered via server - all of whom have been very pleasant.) You'll want to make reservations in advance as it will fill up quickly. I've had luck calling the morning of my visit, but I have had to be flexible on the time I wish to dine (which is never a problem with so many lovely places to wander) - but do try to make your reservations well in advance if you have a tight schedule.They have a lovely gift/book shop where I always find something interesting. Currently there is some construction going on, so the entrance is rerouted and there is a temporary gift shop, but the beauty of the balance of the property is not diminished by this.I used to be local, but even now that I live in New York, I just became a member again. It makes me very happy to know that I will visit again during the year. Just writing this review has afforded me, via memory, a short visit to the Huntington.",NYArtistGirl
50,AMAZING!!!!,You need a whole day there! I wish the were open longer hours. We mostly saw the gardens and a teeny bit of the Library itself. We tried to cram too much into our day. The gardens alone were worth it! Words cannot describe the beauty and care they take to amaze us.,Joyava
30,"Wonderful Gardens, The Rest Just OK","We visited the Huntington Library & Gardens on January 2, 2014 as part of our Rose Parade tour group. We were generally impressed with the many gardens, and we especially enjoyed the Oriental garden and house. But we were a little surprised that the grass in certain areas was a little unkempt and had many weeds in it. We were less enthralled with the library and museum, primarily because such attractions don't generally interest us, and this was the case for us here. Thus, we will allow other reviewers to give their opinion of the library and museum.",bills47
50,"gardens and library, gift shop and overall experience amazing","Hopefully you can split your visit into two sections---the gardens for at least two hours, and the library and museums for at least four hours! The immense value of the gift of the Huntington can never be calculated, when you take into account the loving care of the treasures all housed there, the collections and the ever growing garden and landscape examples. Not to be missed, and hopefully something the visitor can allow time for, or return to, again and again.",elisaGlenEllen

There are gardens, Chinese, Japanese, that will thrill the soul. The layout of these is so stimulating that I can't wait to see the area in two years when more areas will be developed. The maps are generally informative but you really have to align yourself directionally to avoid getting lost. The acreage is that great. The property is extensive and every view is entrancing. There's a children's garden near the tropical forest building that is activity-driven and friendly, as are all the venues. Even the gift shop is exceptional. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as the area is widespread. If you are in Pasadena, this museum is a must. February 8, I saw a camellia exhibition that was truly wonderful. Check their schedules for coming attractions.",Laura H
50,A Very Special Place,"First two warnings:1. Watch opening times, mostly quite short apart from weekends (though if planned some time beforehand you can buy tours that get you in much earlier).2. Completely echo comments by others about the food experience here being rubbishThat said .......WoW!The library did a fantastic job in showing off its very many treasures (not so easy with books) - a lot of thought has gone into how to make this a really interesting and enthralling experienceIt was so nice to go to a gallery in the States dedicated to home grown art - some wonderful things to see, modern furniture was a feature and some insight into the artistic and design development of the USA.That said, as someone else commented, the Gainsboroughs and Reynolds (full length portraits of rich and powerful women + the Blue Boy) in the European Gallery were really special, and quite magnificent; even if like us that 18th C stuff is not quite your thing.......and then there are the gardens,..... again WoW!If you like desert plants, their desert garden was not just the best that we have ever seen, it was many times better than anything we have seen before. Diversity of plants, beauty and imagination in planting, scale and setting...all just great.Japanese garden - Stunning, huge, diverse, etc, etcChinese garden - Still a work in progress, but even incomplete (....sorry but) Wow! The buildings, features and hard landscape are of breathtaking scale, variety and beauty....we can't wait to see how the planting develops in the future.Other gardens were also lovely and were filled with birds and butterflies.All in all so good, and so much there that we have changed our plans and will be visiting again on this trip.",M&G_OnTheRoadAgain

Tastefully laid out and big enough to wander for quite some time.The European gallery was heavy on portraiture and with the exception of one room, was displayed in what was their home, which had a lot of windows which was wonderful to experience the space, but created a lot of glare on the paintings.The American collection had a sculpture section that had so much light, I couldn't see a thing, but the paintings were in a well laid out and illuminated set of galleries.",newmarket2
50,Blockbuster attraction just south of downtown Pasadena!!!,"I have been visiting this property for over 20+ years and the excitement and the top notch world class facility is a must see.The gardens year-round are worth a stroll no matter what time of day; cover everything from the conservatory, to the lilly ponds, to the desert to the bamboo forest to the japanese bridge.The house, the library, the art gallery - all worth your time and energy. Spend the day and pace yourself; there is alot to see. Currently, the front entrance is under construction; new learning center and admissions office is in the process of being constructed, but it is a tiny fraction of the grounds.",chicago90Phoenix
10,Outrageously priced,"First, the admission charge is a small fortune. And then they had the nerve to charge $3.59 for an ice cream drumstick (you know, one of those old-fashioned pre-made individually packaged single scoop cones dipped in chocolate with peanuts on top). You can buy a box with a dozen of these for $9 from Costco, but here they charge $3.59 apiece. For shame. This ruined my trip to the gardens.",Yoritomo
50,Wow,"Myself and a friend visited the botanical gardens and were slightly unprepared by the sheer variety of species present from across the globe. I've been to many botanical gardens and nothing compares to this in terms of both variety and beauty. We took all day just getting around and could easily have filled another day.We also had afternoon tea in the tea rooms. Just delicious, unlimited food and the tea was comparable to what you can get in England.We are so glad we came here as it isn't (in our opinion, as international tourists) heavily advertised and we could have easily overlooked it. I would recommend to anyone.",Charlotte H
50,Much more than a library!,"This was our second visit, and here’s a secret: it’s not really about the library! The grounds are fantastic, with a rose garden, herb garden, desert gardens, tea house, Chinese and Japanese buildings. Don’t miss the giant greenhouse with unusual plants and great interactive displays. You can easily spend most of the day just strolling around the lovely grounds.",Rick_in_San_Diego
50,A lot to see but worth it!,"The outside gardens are amazing! They will take you through different ""climate"" and the plants that are indigenous to their specific climate. Visit the desert, the rainforest, the tropics, etc.Inside you will see some very famous pieces including Pinkie and Blue Boy.Huntington's story is pretty fascinating, and the grounds are just endless!!! He and his wife are actually buried there!",bfigueroa18
50,Worth a membership!,"The best gardens I've been to, and I've been to many. The best display of the history of scientific thought (astronomy, evolution, microscopy) that I've seen. I don't like the art as much because there are some horrible paintings mixed in with The Blue Boy and others that are worth seeing.",Wanda W
50,A variety of lovely experiences – a beautiful day away from the city,"We could not see all the Huntington has to offer in one day; we had to return for a second wonderful day. Be sure to get a map when you buy your entry ticket. The gardens are so extensive and varied that you will have to choose which to see. Try to see at least the Japanese gardens and the desert gardens, and take a stroll around the lake in the Chinese gardens. The time we spent in the tranquility of these gardens made us feel as if we were on vacation from the city. The Library displays some of their fragile treasures opened so that you can see inside the Shakespeare First Folio, the illuminated 15th century Chaucer and the Gutenberg Bible. The Huntington Art Gallery houses Gainsborough’s Blue Boy and Lawrence’s Pinky along with other masterpieces of British portrait art. See the rest of the building for other fine European art and objets d’art. The Huntingtons actually lived here among these treasures. American art is found in another building. There is an educational building for children that is also interesting to adults. The English Tea House has a lovely, if expensive, tea (lunch) for which one should make reservations in advance. The more affordable Café has cold salads, etc, or you can wait in line for hot gourmet cafeteria items. We enjoyed our meal outside in the lovely garden. Since first visiting the Huntington years ago, it has been my favorite tourist site in the US.",oldtravelady
40,Never made it inside,"I wasn't too enthusiastic about the prospect of visiting a Library, but as it turns out, we never went into the library, only the botanical gardens.Now, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the prospect of visiting a botanical gardens......but as it turns out, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Not exactly high-octane thrills and excitement, but a few hours' worth of leisurely strolling through beautiful surroundings was probably what we needed after being in the midst of too many baying tourists, and stuck on far too many highways.The gardens occupy a huge area, which is loosely divided into themed areas; Oriental Garden, Desert Garden, African Garden, etc. The weather was excellent, and we found it interesting, relaxing, and educational. I know... it sounds like something that would be better suited to.. ""older"".. folk, but I can't explain it. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend to anybody who has a few hours to kill in the area.Price maybe a bit steep, but perhaps exploring the library would eke out that VFM quotient.Only one negative point - gift shop was poor. They need to change their stock, and get somebody in who has a knowledge of marketing. It doesn't have to look like some bizarre English tea-house/china shop, where the popular items are hidden away.",Stormachtig
50,Tranquility in the City ?,"Beautiful place , amazing architecture , plenty of seating areas to sit and watch the birds, butterflies , and squirells. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful from the parking gate attendant, admission sales, and garden staff maintaining the grounds. Huntington Gardens & Library is easy",Curlychic1986
50,Amazing collection of historical books,"We spent hours wandering the gardens especially intrigued by the Chinese garden which is under construction and the Japanese garden. Really liked the Australian garden which greatly reminded us of a visit to Australia recently. Then we got to the art with not enough time so we focused on the Gainsboroughs but also liked the mansion with its library room (not The library). Then we got to The Library which was the most amazing part for me. The history of science exhibit with books from centuries ago was amazing, especially one on parchment from 1279. I especially liked that you could listen to about a minute of someone reading a translation of, was it Galileo or Copernicus, writing with feeling about his struggle understanding the orbit of Mars. Not the dry scientific writing I'm used to! It really made me curious about what else was in those books. We finished off with the desert garden which was in full bloom and rather densely planted with many kinds of aloes and other plants from arid regions. It's a place to go back to over and over in different seasons.",Jeanne J
40,Fine Gardens and a Unique Library,"The gardens are varied, beautifully designed and maintained. Lunch outside in one of the gardens is delightful. The library houses some extremely rare books such as Shakespeare's First Folio, but one sees only the two open pages of the Folio.",laurgam
50,Excellent Desert Gardens,"My wife and I just visited the Huntington Library and Gardens to enjoy the various Aloe in bloom. December is a great time to visit as the weather is great and so much is in bloom. Although a bit of a challenge for those without a car (most of California is not covered by convenient public transportation) it is definitely worth the effort.In addition to the excellent desert gardens, the Japanese and Chinese are worth a look. The Japanese garden has a beautiful Bonsai display area and the Chinese garden will be even better when it is finished.To get out of the heat, visit the ponds or enter the library.Food is available, but it is pricey and ordinary.Got a little extra time, cruise the surrounding neighborhood with its' lovely homes and gardens.",RealRoadWarrior
50,Wow!,"There is sooo much to do at just this one site. We bypassed the library, spent a fair amount of time in the art gallery, and saw part of the grounds. We didn't begin to see everything and are thinking about another trip to CA because we want to see more of the gardens. The only weakness is the Rose Garden Cafe. The food was what would be served at a high tea, but it was set up buffet style, which took away from the experience.",ChubbyElf
50,Magnificent,The Huntington Library and Gardens are exceptional. I visited there several years before the above date. Your site did not give me the option enter the correct date. The gardens are beautiful and the Library extraordinary. Driving through that section of Pasadena is like a dream about beautiful houses and gardens. Do go there.,mocheB20A
40,Loved the Japanese garden and British art museum,"The art and stories for each painting were amazing in the British art museum. I would like to go back to that one and spend more time. Original California dancing provided on the lawn that we watched and enjoyed. The Japanese Garden was gorgeous that we enjoyed, especially the Bonsai section.",TropiCAL2003
50,Take more time,"We got a taste of the library and the grounds. We concentrated on the gardeand it was great to stroll and read about the various plants. Though there were many people the afternoon we were there, however, the grounds are so huge you don't notice it. Going into the house where the art is kept is also a worthwhile event. We did not go into the library so we'll save that for our next trip.",rvtraveller_10
40,Will be back!,"Spent a few hours wandering around the place. Got stuck in the Japanese garden and bonsai collection. Took some pictures with the wife and daughter. You can pick a spot, sit in one of the multiple benches around and talk. Even with people around, you can always find a quiet spot. Have to come back and see the arts cel lecithin and library.",neborr357
50,Spend the Day - First Class,Our family of five visited New Years week - we arrived around 10:30 thinking we would spend several hours at the Huntington. Wrong. We stayed until closing at 4:30. Fortunately they have a very good cafe on premise. The property is one of a kind. The library is world class and fascinating. The home has been restored to perfection. The gardens are extensive and not to be missed. Then you have two more distinctive museums and the conservatory to explore. The Renaissance show was a delight. I wish I lived in the area so I could get an annual membership. That is the only way to fully appreciate everything the Huntington offers.,elizhoop
50,A wonderful museum with spectacular and extensive gardens.,"The art collection is varied and of high quality. The buildings and their architecture are a pleasure to the eye, and the gardens and views make a visit to the Huntington an easy and pleasant day-long adventure. The entrance fee is reasonable ($13 for a senior), and there is a well-stocked and spacious gift shop. The cafe had a good menu and outdoor seating (but the outdoor grills smoked patrons as well as meat when the wind blew the wrong way).",Hopsalong
50,Impossible to see it all in one visit,"We took our niece and nephew and their young kids here and were not disappointed. Because of the age of the kids, we spent a short amount of time in a number of areas to keep their interest up. They loved finding Pinky and Blue Boy. The Children's Garden and the Japanese Tea Garden both really peaked their interests. We stopped for a snack and (fabulous) Peet's Coffee at the cafe on the grounds. Looking forward to going back to see the exhibit on Father Junipero Serra. Definitely a five start experience!",PasadenaTess
50,A hidden jewel in San Marino,"The Huntington Library and Gardens is a peaceful respite in frenetic Southern California. With one of the finest collections of full length English portraits by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Lawrence and paintings by Constable, Cassatt, Turner, the art lover will be fulfilled. With themed gardens highlighting roses, cacti, bonsai, Chinese and Japanese traditional styles the horticulturist will be delighted. The tearoom requires reservations for the delectable buffet of goodies, while the cafe has a selection of hot and cold selections. Come early to best experience the the house and ground.",KLE2013
50,Wonderful place,"We usually visit this place about once a year and it's always wonderful. This time, w were visiting around Christmas and the desert gardens were flowering, something that we had never seen before. The size, beauty and unusual plants in that part of the garden were really terrific. We also went to the rose garden, most of which was still in bloom, also amazing, with what seemed like a hundred different kinds of roses. We didn't get to the library/museum this time, but we did see the home again, with its world-class art and decorations. There were a lot of people there, but the grounds are huge, so you don't really see that many people was you walk around. The weather is juts right in the winter, but it gets really hot and smoggy in the summer.",CaTraveler7777
50,A great day out for all ages...,"You need to get there by noon when it opens on a weekday to make the most of it because the gardens close at 4.30 p.m. Cost of entry is $20 for adults and $15 for seniors over 65. (There are different timings and prices for weekends).There is a very interesting display of plants and trees arranged in various themes - Japanese, Australian, desert, Chinese etc. I was fascinated by the bonsai collection. These were most amazing, including the usual junipers and pines as also pyracantha and olives. (I did feel however that it would have been interesting if the age of the trees was also inscribed on the signage).There is a great conservatory (shaped on the outside like the one in the Kew Gardens) which provides a humid tropical environment and within it there is a also laboratory where you can look down a microscope at algae and touch and smell leaves and plants. One of the exhibits here was a growing coconut palm and there was also on display the unusual double coconut from Seychelles.The children's garden has interesting topiary fashioned to look like teddy bear and other critters. Children were merrily splashing in the rocky pools and fountains.There are interesting artefacts and paintings in the museums. We did not get time to browse in all of them or go into all the buildings.The cafe within the grounds is adjacent to the tea rooms and both provide a good break as well as rest rooms!What is amazing of course is that all this belonged to one man and this was his vision from nearly a 100 years ago! A wonderful day out for all ages...",Imliooper
50,always fabulous,"We are contributing members of the Garden. This is a cannot miss if you love garden and cultures. The Japanese and Chinese Pavillion ar e both fabulous. The museums and library arefantastic. Go there if ever come to LA. The locals if you have not visited, you have been missing out!",fmcsbu
50,Delightful Gardens and Exhibitions,"Nicely situated and beautiful gardens even in December, in the middle of a cold snap.The museum is beautiful, with it galleries of hanging paintings and rooms. It is tastefully done and well worth the time and money to visit.",Frank A
50,Love those Gardens,"I have been at the Huntington Library many times over the years but this time of year is especially nice, minus the sweltering summer heat the gardens can be really enjoyed especially those Camilla's that burst into winter blooms with a vengeance of all colors and various hybrids with double and even triple blossoms. In size this grand library is one of the few Gutenberg Bibles in existence and can be viewed as it is covered in glass with controlled conditions to preserve this ancient hand written Bible, also housed in the library are the original copy of the Blue Boy and Pinkie. My very favorite part of these splendid gardens s the cactus and succulent that flower and are quite large and diverse. Also if one check the Huntington Library's schedule I know there is a get in for free day once and month well worth the trouble to spend a relaxing day touring the beautiful grounds.",April D
50,Elegance and beauty of a bygone era,"We like attractions that feature the beauty of nature combined with man made works of art and this place has that in abundance! The extensive gardens are diverse and beautiful anytime of year. We enjoyed touring the grand house with its furnishings and paintings. The library featured many well executed exhibits which were very interesting. We splurged on the afternoon tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room in lovely setting with a buffet of delicious choices of sandwiches, scones, fruit, cheese and desserts. Yummy! The gift shop has lots of fun souvenirs to choose from. There was a lot of people the day we were there but it doesn't seem crowded; they seem to have figured out traffic flow. I even remembered to use my KCET discount card! A treasure.",RetroFan
50,A treasure in Southern California,"We've been members of this amazing place for many years and it never ceases to be interesting, gardens that are always amazing, the library that is second to none and galleries of wonderful art.You need to visit here during all seasons, it is constantly changing. The gardens and exhibits",JPG1944
50,The Huntington is a little piece of Europe in Southern California.,"I grew up near the Huntington and have always loved it. Whether one wants to walk in varied palatial gardens or view exceptional art there is something to see here. My kids enjoy the children's garden, where they can explore and play in the water features. The Huntington is also a wonderful place to take out of town guests.",dana p
50,A very relaxing and wonderful visit,"This is an amazing experience visiting the Huntington. This is a historic library and art museum situated in a wonderful landscape of gardens from different places in the world with their plantings. The garden areas are very spacious so allow enough time to casually stroll through them. If you go from spring through fall, you will take a lot of wonderfully colorful and beautiful pictures. The gardens are the most beautiful in Southern California.",dpuett
30,Nice Gardens and interesting Mexican & Southern California art exhibit.,"We enjoyed a pleasant walk through the variety of gardens, which have the potential to be beautiful in season, but not much in bloom at end November.One of the art exhibits we toured was Junipero Serra, California Missions, which showed the influence of this Spanish Missionary extending their reach from Mexico into Southern California.",BogeyPeter
50,The gardens are a delightful way to pass some time,This is one of my favorite places to visit in Pasadena. The botanical gardens are exquisite. Our 2-year-old thoroughly enjoyed himself in the rose gardens - we spent a long time while he stopped to smell every rose (perhaps a reminder for all of us). The Japanese part of the gardens is unique and a delight.,Patrice518
50,World class experience that should not be missed?,"World class experience that should not be missed is available in San Marino. It is the gardens, art museum, and collection of historic documents that must be seen. Plan to spend most of the day, the Chinese Pavilion is beautiful and high tea is served in the Tea Room.The Getty gets plenty of attention by visitors to Los Angeles. The Huntington should be added to the must see list in Southern California.",Cavydad
40,Nice place to go in the fall/winter,We went in November and it was still warm and pleasant. We loved the dessert gardens and felt we should have spent more time there. The exhibits were not as impressive though and it was kind of pricy.,Bu Y
50,The best Chinese garden outside of China,"Its a great experience to visit this place, all of the materials of traditional building and garden are from China!

50,Beautiful Gardens,"The Huntington is famous for its art galleries, library, special exhibits and botanical gardens. On the day of our visit, we only toured the gardens. We spent over two hours walking through the many different gardens on this huge estate, and still didn't see them all. The Chinese and Japanese gardens are very lovely and peaceful. We also enjoyed the Australian garden and the striking and beautiful desert garden. It's a little pricey, but so much to see in this beautiful place.",GrandmaSandy
50,Spectacular!,"It takes about 2-3 days to go through the place. It is freaking HUGE! Wear comfy walking shoes. Wear sunscreen and bring a hat to avoid a sunburn when out in the gardens.One day is not enough to just see the gardens. I got lost both times I went.The art collection, furniture collection, antiques is really quite good. Pinkie and Blue Boy are not to be missed.The Children's Garden is really fun even if you are an adult. There are rain misters to walk through so you can cool off on a hot day.The tropical rain forest greenhouse is amaz-ing! I loved it.",Anja D
50,My favorite place,I love coming to the Huntington. I have been coming here since the 80s. It is such a wonderful place. One can take leisurely walks in the beautiful gardens. Love the summer events for members. I also enjoy having high tea at the Tea house in the Rose Garden. So lovely. What a great way to spend the day. I thoroughly enjoy my visits here.,Honeybunny96
50,Beautiful garden,"Wow, so much to see here! We are plant enthusiasts and absolutely loved this garden! Can take a whole day to walk around and look at everything. I have a million pics just sharing a few of them. There are museums as well.",Travel Mag
50,World class art presented in an approachable way,"Our main interest was the special exhibit examining and explaining the influence of Netherlandish painters on Italian renaisance art. The Flemish masters were some of the first to paint naturalistic man, scenery and objects. Bruges was the center before Florence ascended. The works have both interesting similiarities and differences. Great to be able to make side by side comparisons.This exhibit was well worth a few hours of exploring and the price of admission.The Huntington is large and comprises about 200 acres. For some people, it would make sense to focus on an aspect of the facility and then return another day.The temporary Serra exhibit was a disappointment compared to the Flemish/Florence exhibit.",packcal
40,it's a mix of almost everything,"to be honest, I don't think I catched a good timing for this place since it's a garden with seasonal plants, but still it's quite nice place for weekend afternoon. and it's really worth for the ticket considering the arts collection and architecture and worldwide various of gardens: Japanese/Dessert/Tropical... some part of the park is really mid eval and some is just natural. So for people efficiency-oriented, I guess it's an ideal spot to check~",Ying L
50,"Beautiful art, wonderful gardens","We have visited many times over the years and have always enjoyed it immensely. Acres and acres of gardens, pathways -- always something in bloom. Beautifully maintained. I particularly love the cactus and succulent garden, the Zen Garden and the peaceful walks around the grounds. The Huntington is a place you need to see again and again at different times of the years.This time, we went specifically for the history and the art. First, a wonderful exhibit of 15th and 16 century Flemish Portraits. Then on to the Junipero Serra exhibit which told of the legacy of the California Missions -- including Serra's life in Spain and the terrible impact of the Native American populations, their resistance and their resilience. We also enjoyed the collection of American art.",MichaelScott2013
50,Amazing Rose Garden,"We didn't expect the gardens to be at their best in early November, but this is southern California so the Rose Garden was in full bloom. And it is by far the best rose garden we have ever seen (handily outdistancing the famous one at the NY Botanical Garden). The art collection is also nice, but it is small and thin so art lovers should start at the Getty Center and the Norton Simon.The Tea Room offers a very nice break, but it's pricey and the desserts look better than they taste.",Jazzbeau1130
50,Top Los Angeles are attraction.,"An aspect of Tripadvisor, similar to the AAA Guidebook, is that an attraction is listed under the specific city. A visitor to Los Angeles would need to know that this is located in the tiny city of San Marino, in order to learn about it. That is just wrong. It should be accessible as a top Pasadena area attraction, and a top Los Angeles area attraction.This is a wonderful, beautiful place. The gardens are beautiful and botanically useful. The art gallery has many famous paintings, such as Pinky and Blue Boy. The library is a world famous research center, and has interesting items on exhibit for the public.",Shadow010
50,My favorite place to visit in California,"If you want to imagine what California was like before all of the freeways and people, visit the Huntington Library. The property and gardens are breath taking, and you would never know that it is smack in the middle of suburbia. You really need to plan to spend the day here. You could spend the entire day just walking the gardens. They also boast an incredible art collection - Pinky and Blue Boy are here. The homes and buildings are beautiful also.",07LizzyB
50,Give yourself plenty of time.,"Take time to see the beautiful gardens, have tea and then visit the galleries. I was surprised to see how many wonderful paintings there were on show and so much great British art. My disappointment was that I could have spent far more time browsing here but I hadn't allowed enough time. Don't make the same mistake.",whispycl0ud
50,Magnificent ... need I say more!,"Weather was perfect for this visit. Arrived at opening time, 12 noon, paid our admission, $20 pp ($15 seniors), and began our walk through the gardens. You will see trees and plants from all over the world, not to mention, perfectly manicured. Don't miss the cactus garden. Often, there is a music venue, so check the daily schedule. Moving right along, the art sculptures and paintings are by far, fantastic. You can see the famous painting ""Blue Boy,"" and ""Pinkie."" Huntington closes at 4:30 pm.",FLworldwanderer
50,Fabulous day out,"This is a great day's outing. We had tea/lunch at the tea room (reviewed separately), then wandered in the gardens and one museum. Our only disappointment was we had to leave a little early because they were setting up for a wedding.There are some seriously good, and important art works in the galleries, and stunningly beautiful gardens to explore.",Arncliffegirl
50,Wow wow wow,"We were absolutely bowled over by Huntington Library and Gardens. We were in LA and had done everything we wanted to there so looked a bit further a field. When we looked out our tour book, we decided to go here first because of the extensive gardens (we love gardening). We were not disappointed. It was $20 per adult to get in but really worth it. Firstly the house and the artwork was outstanding, the gainsborough, turner, reynolds, constable masterpieces were outstanding to see let alone all the collections of porcelains, etc.. The gardens are unbelievable, vast and beautiful and many different types from cactus to succulents to japanese to chinese and it goes on.... It is really hard to do it justice in a day. We loved it, it has been the highlight to our trip to LA. You must go.",kckaceykc
50,Gorgeous! And take the kids.,"We only had time for a few sections: The Childrens' Garden (which my 3 yr old grandson LOVED!), the Rainforest (which even had carnivorous plants), and the Japanese Garden (which was like being in a beautiful dream) A must see! We will definitely be back for more.",daljulie
50,Beutiful!,"We visited first the Botanical Garden, an exquisite display of superbly preserved species from many areas of the world. Then, we visited the Chinese and the Japanese Gardens. Our guide at the Chinese was excellent, she told us the complete history of this garden. At the Japanese, we had a guide that made us participate in the Tea ceremony with full details. The gardens are gorgeous!. By the time we arrived at the Art exhibits, it was after 3 PM and, since they close at 4:30 PM, we had to practically run to get a glimpse of the exhibits. Although we had arrived at Noon, just in time for the gates to open, the 4 hours were not enought. This is a two-day visit.Don't miss it!",Rgkattan
50,Worth a visit,"This place is so well done. There is a lot of walking involved, so as others have mentioned, wear good walking shoes and take along some bottled water. The gardens just kept getting better and better the more we walked. They are adding a China section that looks like it will be incredible when it is completed. The employees and docents were very friendly and helpful. We didn't have time to go into the buildings to see the artwork. We did have tea at the Tea House, which was a nice experience. You could easily spend all day here. Well worth the admission price.",Shikari
50,A hidden gem in Los Angeles!,"It was just a coincidence that my husband and I went to this place during our visit to LA. After a business lunch, our supplier suggested us to go there for the afternoon. At first we both wondered what it would be special to go to a library and even hesitated whether we shall go. Finally we arrived there and found that it is completely not just a library! It occupies a huge block of land in San Marina and consists of several buildings of art exhibits and different themed gardends. It was out of our expectation in every aspect. The quiet and clean art galary, the well designed landscape and the whole comfortable atmosphere. Pity that we arrived there too late (around 3pm) and didn't have enough time to walk around the whole place. Strongly recommend everyone who is visiting LA to go there to spend a peaceful day with art works and plants around you!",dlchocho
50,Beautiful gardens and spectacular art exhibits!,What a wonderful and relaxing way to spend a beautiful fall afternoon. The Japanese Garden is stunning. They have a large collection of bonsai on display. There is also a children's garden. We loved the exhibit of Renaissance Art. Take your time to enjoy everything there is to see. The surrounding area is also a beautiful place to drive and take in the spectacular homes and well-manicured gardens.,grandmaB47
50,A Great Day In Pasadena- Bring Good Walking Shoes!,"We drove to Huntington Gardens not knowing what was there. We started off in the art museum which has original Gainsborough paintings, including Blue Boy and Pinkie. This was a great surprise. The buildings were air conditioned,not crowded, everyone was very polite, and the paintings were a very good sample of many styles.We next went to the tea gardens, the plants of australia, rose garden, and the orchid exhibit. Just beautiful!I recommend you bring a pair of study walking shoes and a bottle of water.",Marshmallowman

50,Must see if you are in the Pasadena area,"If you want a different way to spend an afternoon in Pasadena, head over to the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens. The cactus/desert section of the gardens is nothing short of amazing. There are over 10,000 different species of cactus/succulents. There is a lot of construction going on right now in the Chinese garden section but it does not inhibit your visit that much.",swaynewilson
50,A great way to spend the day,"What else can be said that hasn't already? The grounds are fantastic, the art collection impressive, the staff friendly and helpful. Plenty of free parking on a busy Saturday, and an entrance price that should shame commercial attractions.Go here.",boojums
40,Amazing Cactus garden,"We went because we love gardens, husband wanted to go to the cactus garden first. I'm not too keen on cacti but this garden converted me, the huge variety and cacti covering a very large area, many the size of huge shrubs and trees! But we were disappointed in the rose garden supposedly showing the history of the rose. Coming from England we realised LA might not have the best conditions but we had seen a better display in downtown LA. We used the public bus system from downtown LA - it took about an hour on the bus with a simple but longish walk through a upmarket housing estate (about 25 mins) to get from the drop off stop to the garden, wished there was a stop closer so could have walked through the cactii more!",grace c
50,A great get-away,"Not a library as you think of one - this is unbelievable and extensive. Whether you live close or far away, this stop is a MUST. Plan on a couple of days if you can, as you just can't see and enjoy it all in one day, although you can pick the places you want to really see. If possible, get the free tour guide that gives you a 1-hour overview, then spend your time at the sections of your choice. The food there is also soooo good. Be sure to stop at the Japanese Gardens and sit by the stream for some relaxing meditational time - and get rid of all those bad vibes. The art work, the collections, the gardens, the food - it's all beyond imagination, and keeps growing. We have been there 2 times, and can't wait for our next visit.",JoAnn S
50,The Best attraction in LA,Despite being only 12 miles from Los Angeles the details for this fabulous attraction are listed under San Monica and not LA. We stumbled upon it by the chance reading of another review site. The gardens are magnificent as is the collection of fine art. Just a magical place and should definitely be included under the attractions for LA,Roger B
50,These gardens are amazing,"Difficult to find but outside Pasadena city is one of the best gardens I have walked around. The Japanese gardens are lovely, but the new Chinese garden (under construction) promises to be spectacular. The highlight for my husband and I was definitely the cactus garden. Never seen cacti as big as the ones we looked at. Unfortunately, unless you want to pay a small fortune for a cuppa in the tea house, the only drink are served out side the entrance. Coffee ok, but it's such a shame there are no facilities for picnic. Understandable as these garden are immaculate and free from litter. Well. Worth the visit, even if it is a little pricey, but the amount of plants and beautiful flowers,Plus a lovely gallery displaying famous blue boy painting, justifies the entrance fee. A great day out.",Jeanette M
50,A must visit,"For anyone who love art, history and gardens, this is a must see! Make sure you visit the collection of rare books. The collection of historical medical books is a treasure!The cactus and succulent garden is stunning.",Garden V
40,Enjoyable,"Exhibits were interesting and well placed. There was food for purchase, and tables were available to sit outside.",Chessie22
50,Lovely!,"This is just a beautiful lovely garden, museum & library. It's expansive and so well maintained. No matter what time of year you go, there is something in bloom. Kids love the children's area & the conservatory, which has an interactive science center. The Japanese & Chinese gardens are exquisite. And make a reservation for the afternoon tea! It's delicious. But there is also a cafeteria with good food that you can take & eat out on the patio. And don't miss the wonderful art & furniture on exhibit. Really a great place to visit.",NatAtHome
50,Dream a little dream,"Walking through San Marino you can admire the beautiful villas, which are seen only in the show, all adorned with beautiful gardens and with floral arrangements.The Huntington Library keep some beautiful masterpieces, like a copy of the Bible by Gutenberg, The Long Leg by Edward Hopper,Small Crushed Campbell's Soup Can (Beef Noodle) by Andy Warhol, and Global Loft (Spread) by Robert Rauschenberg. Wonderful pieces of furniture and old books.The gardens are divided into more than a dozen themes, including the Australian Garden, Camellia Collection, Children's Garden, Desert Garden, Herb Garden, Japanese Garden, Rose Garden, Subtropical and Jungle Garden, and the Chinese Garden.There is a large tropical plant collection, as well as a carnivorous plants wing.The Desert Garden is one of the world's largest and oldest outdoor collections of cacti and other succulents.The Camellia Collection, recognized as an International Camellia Garden of Excellence, includes nearly 80 different camellia species. The Rose Garden contains all the colours you can imagine...Beautiful is even the bookshop!",GdN80100
50,A must see if in Los Angeles,"This is truly an awesome peaceful garden and museum to visit while in the Los Angeles area. It is located in the beautiful San Marino neighborhood. The rose gardens and the different theme gardens like the cactus, Japanese gardens are not to be missed. In order to enjoy this place once must have time. You cannot rush through it. And do not miss the afternoon tea..it is really worth the money. Very good quality and service.",shay12123
50,Fabulous Place to Visit,"The grounds are spectacular, and the various gardens are a sight to behold. If you are in the Pasadena area, this is a not to miss place to visit.",LACASAZ
50,English Manor Home and Art Gallery in California,"This beautiful museum is situated in the heart of a residential neighborhood in San Merino, California (very near Pasadena, California). Here you will find several acres of magnificent gardens as well as a collection of paintings from 18th century England. Gainsborough's famous ""Blue Boy"" is here along with the equally famous ""Pinkie"" by Sir Thomas Lawrence. While looking at the art, remember to pay special attention to the furniture that is in the museum. Be careful to watch for fine inlaid desks, chests inlaid with Mother of Pearl, and furniture done in the woodworking style called ""Marquetry"" - which is the art and craft of applying pieces of veneer to a structure to form decorative patterns, designs or pictures. There are also fine Seviers vessels and urns on display. While this museum is a jewel, it isn't for everyone. You won't, for instance, find Impressionist paintings, nor 14th century Bosch, nor Picasso. However, It is a great museum for seeing how the other half lived in England in the 18th century and it does that very well. I would not recommend this museum if you are traveling with young children. If you are adults and traveling with other adults, you will find this an excellent place to spend several hours.",Myra G
50,Heaven on Earth,"This is truly one of my favorite places! I have been visiting the Huntington Library since High School. My art history took us here on a field trip, and it was love at first sight! I remember being in awe of the Japanese gardens; it felt as though I had walked on to a movie set. The rose gardens are as equally beautiful, and they hold a special memory for me. Year after year, I introduce someone new to the gardens, and I get so much joy from watching them experience it for the first time. If you are considering the Huntington Library and botanical gardens, please go. It will not disappoint!",Isunwin
40,This is a full day visit attraction,"There is so very much to see and do. Very well designed independent areas. Great for a family with energy to burn. Entertainment for toddlers and bigger kids. Lots to learn and see and touch. Lots of trails to walk and plants to identify. If you need to rest there are shady spots and lots of benches. Food is available but nothing to write home about. Arrive early for parking during the busy months. Great membership price if you live near and can visit several times a year, daily price is ok for California but anywhere else we would call it moderately high..",HaroldJ130
50,Peace and Quiet Away From It All,"The Short drive from Hollywood was easy enough for a Friday morning and when we arrived just before opening time, parking was plentiful. $40 entry fee for the two of us was a fair price but make sure you get a sticker to put on! We head off to the desert garden to begin with and very soon it is just the two of us walking around the tall palm trees in glorious sunshine and peaceful walkways. We spent most of the morning making our way over to the fantastic Japanese Garden which we both really enjoyed. For lunch we had booked afternoon tea in the Rose Garden tea room. In England afternoon tea can be a stuffy affair with an assortment of sandwiches,scones and cakes served on a cake-stand however this is a more relaxed affair with a buffet style mix of sandwiches,cakes,fruit,salad,salmon and a variety of cheeses. There was also basket of freshly baked scones with creams and preservatives as well as hot and cold drinks which were brought directly to the table. The cost for afternoon tea was $60 for the two of us and we both felt this was good value.The rest of the afternoon was spent completing our tour of the gardens. Time did not allow a visit to the museum.",Tanya-Glen
40,delightful exhibits & beautiful Botanical gardens,"The collection of historical light bulbs from 1890 - 1960s was most unusual and fascinating.Another must see at the Astronomy exhibit is a letter Einstein wrote to George Elle Hale, the director of Mt. Wilson Observatory. Who would have speculated that Einstein had beautiful pen-manship? Einstein's famous formula E=mc square.My formula is messy hair = messy hand-writing. Of course I was wrong.The main Library wing was closed for renovation or I would have revisited the exquisite artifacts there.Despite the intense sun, I went through the 10 acres Desert Garden thoroughly, marveling at all the exotic succulents. You can't cover all the grounds in one visit, with so much to see: the Australian garden, the Palm garden, the Subtropical jungle and Rose garden. I wish they open earlier in the morning, like 6am. It would be cooler then for strolling.At the Chinese Garden, we happened to see a Chinese flute performance in the Pavilion overlooking the lake. It was beautiful especially in that garden setting. The lake is stocked with Koi now and some of the lotus are in bloom. The Chinese garden still need time to mature to acquire more authentic character. It appears rather like a newly built movie set at the moment.",3Kells
40,Lovely way to spend a day.,"I've been to the Huntington several times, and I always managed to find something new! The library and musems (halls?) are filled with interesting displays, artifacts, and works of art. I strongly suggest you wear walking shoes if you plan to explore the gardens as they are expansive.My only compliant is that $23/adult is a little steep. Of course it's worth it, but I hate to think that someone wouldn't be able to experience this wonderful place due to the price. I know they have a free day each month, but I believe it's during the week.",RKSkwier
50,Well Worth It,"We were in the area for a family event and a friend suggested the Huntington Gardens and Museum. So glad we took her advice. The library was closed but there was so much else to see. We caught a guided garden tour, which I highly recommend. The Junipero Serra exhibit at one of the museums was excellent for anyone interested in the California missions. It would be a shame to be near Pasadena and not spend some time here, although you could probably spend days before you would see it all.",PMRLM
50,"Extensive, beautiful museums and gardens","The Huntington is worth several hours to see all it has to offer. There are several buildings with everything from true library treasures to beautiful paintings and exhibits in both the original family mansion and newer well-appointed galleries. I have been a handful of times over the last 25 years, visiting once every few years from the East coast. Each time the offerings increase. Right now, there is extensive work underway to add more of a visitor center and amenities. Other than reducing the size of the shop (which has always been quite good), the construction won't impact your visit much. The grounds and gardens are expansive and truly beautiful. The Chinese garden is new and quite lovely. The Japanese, rose and desert gardens also are extraordinary. Try not to go on a super hot day, as it can diminish your experience. Yes, the cost for the Huntington is high ($20 weekdays, $23 weekends) but it's a worthy investment.",TrishG87
50,"What a peaceful way to spend a day with books, art and gardens.","This estate has one of the worlds great libraries. The scientific books exhibit is worth the price of admission. There is also world class art, craftsman furniture and architecture and beautiful gardens. Spend the whole day.",Anglophiles
30,Expectations too high,"My adult son and I visited on a weekday following the monthly free day. Perhaps the timing was the reason there were so few staff. There was no one to answer questions, although the website claims there are gardeners available for questions at all times. The day was hot, admission was expensive for two adults, and our guide probably would be at home on conservative talk radio. She was so rude to the visitors from Mexico, my son and I left the tour group after only fifteen or twenty minutes. We followed the map to some gardens we were especially interested in seeing. The Desert Garden, the Water Gardens, the Australian Garden, the Chinese Garden were wonderful, but we would have enjoyed them more if there had been more than just a couple of informative signs or if there had been people to explain the plantings.",Lynn S
50,Amazing collection and Gardens,"If you have a day to spare in LA, then try to visit this wonderful place. Housing an art collection that any major city in the world would be honoured to own (including Gainsborough's 'Blue Boy'), a Gutenberg Bible and manuscripts and books, one could spend days not hours. The gardens are a joy and include a Japanese Garden, Desert Garden and a Rose Garden. There is also a nice cafe and tea rooms",RJC1951
40,A beautful place and very fulfilling,"My only problem is the hours are too short. For a place , that was free a decadge ago, I am sad to see that the foundation keeps raising its prices for admission. Only free one day a month by stipulation by the orginal mandate. Was free all the time. Keep it reasonable to everyone can go at least once.Our guide was fantastic.",Eaglepipeclub
40,excellent all day place,"this is photographer's paradise. Seeing carnivorous plants upclose is great. it is a long walk across lot of gardens, went on a very hot day, so was not the best experience weather wise.But all gardens were well maintained and were really nice.Art collection was good (Not Getty center good, but good) but you will appreciate it on hot day as AC is on. you need the entire day to see it all or take the membership for an year.",vkailash
50,Outstanding Gardens,I have been to the gardens about 3 times and every time I find it to be even more wonderful! One of the most fun places is the children's garden. They have tea in the Chinese Tea house that is so refreshing! Lots of different areas to visit reminiscent of different climates.,Meg B
50,Don't miss for LA,"Adjacent to Pasadena's grand old houses, HL is terrific. Wonderful art inside, absolutely fabulous gardens. Really enjoyed the Japanese Garden. Be sure to take walking shoes. Wonderful to spend the cooler part of the day outside, and inside for a hot day.",Stephen C
50,wonderful day,"Truly a wonderful day spent walking a unique setting. The trails display a plethora of plantings that provide both beauty,shade and water settings. The day we went to the gardens was extremely hot but there were many shade areas that provided relief from the sun. The art collection by itself is worth the trip.There are eating facilities available(a bit pricey) but reservations should be made ahead or the waiting time could be long. The grounds cover over one hundred acres so plan accordingly. If you are in the Los Angeles area it is site worth visiting.",S502VUDavidH
50,Beautiful gardens,"We spent nearly 3 hours walking the Botanical Gardens on the Library's grounds. The cactus gardens are a photographer's gold mine, as are the Japanese and Chinese gardens. And when you include the art collections, very reasonably priced. Don't miss if you are spending time in the LA area and are tired of the ""regular"" tourist trappings.",J A
50,Amazing!,"This is really an amazing place. It's huge, with a rare books library, an art museum, and beautiful botanical gardens which include a Japanese house. I especially liked the art. I loved seeing The Blue Boy by Gainsborough and Pinkie by Lawrence. Don't miss it if you're in the area!",MarriedMay18
40,Nice diversity,"It was a bit too hot on the day we were there, even though we started as early as we could. Unfotunately it only open at 10am. I was also quite a bit surprised by the continious increase in prices. My mom was there a year and a half ago, and the prices increased by $10 o.O. Otherwise it's a very nice park, botanical garden and museum. I was very much impressed by the amount of diversity that the park contained (Japanese, Chinese, Australian, Dessert, Rose garden, etc.). The museums were also a nice get-away from the heat.",napa8984
50,"Fun to explore, lovely to linger in","This is one of my favorite gardens and museums in the L.A. area. Whether your interest is gardening, history, or fine art, there's plenty to do and discover here.The well-manicured grounds are fun to explore, lovely to linger in, and educational for the botanically curious. The gardens are separated by theme (for example, the Shakespearean garden, rose garden, desert garden, and Japanese garden), and in addition to clearly labeling the plants in each garden, there are often tables with docents who can explain details about some aspect of plants or gardening particular to that area. Photo opportunities are abundant, whether you're interested in the plants themselves or beautiful floral backgrounds for photos with your friends. There are also plenty of places to sit and sketch, or even just to read. I love that the gardens are away from the noise and hubbub of L.A. traffic, and the focus can instead be on the sweet smells, the sounds of birds, and the serenity that should be found in gardens.For those who have more of an interest in history, some of the artwork is located in the former mansion of the Huntington family, an early railroad family that also gives Huntington Beach its name. Touring this building and reading the brochures offers a glimpse into the lives of the super wealthy in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Huntington Library, in yet another building, has exhibits focusing on their extensive collection of books, manuscripts, and maps, and is also a center of study and research.Art-wise, there are several galleries containing paintings, furniture, and other fine art pieces that were collected during the Huntington family's lifetime as well as newer pieces and rotating exhibits.While a one-day visit may be fine for out-of-towners, my family has opted for getting a membership in recent years. This ends up being a bargain, allowing us to visit for a few hours several times a year, and also giving a discount in the wonderful bookstore and gift shop. There are also many classes and summer camps that are offered at a discount with membership; the children's classes in particular are worth checking out and are posted on the website calendar, but tend to fill up well in advance.For a one-day visit, I would recommend choosing just one gallery (probably the Huntington Art Gallery in the former mansion, which focuses on European art and houses the collection's best-known pieces, but maybe the Virginia Steele Scott Gallery if you are more interested in American art or one of the other galleries if you're so moved), plus a couple of the gardens, whichever sound most interesting to the visitor. Allow a little time for a cold drink at the cafe (or a delicious panini if you have more time), plus some time in the gift shop. All of this will take a few hours, but will give you a nice taste of what the Huntinton has to offer, and will likely leave you more relaxed and inspired than if you try to cover it all.",Lianne58
50,Amazing Gradens and Beautiful Art,"What an incredible experience going to the Huntington Library is! Be sure to plan a full day of visiting, there is no way you will be able to see and enjoy everything if you do not. The different gardens are amazing, the art outstanding and the ancient books on display are a treasure. This is such an impressive place, I don't even know where to start! I loved the big fountain with the water lilies and the rose garden is breath taking. So many varities of roses! This is a Southern California gem. Anyone who lives in Southern California or visiting should make sure to visit the Huntington Library.",Irisheyes_777
50,Lovely gardens & grounds - great for the novice photographer!,"Every time I come here, I find another wonderous aspect of the garden that I had not noticed before! It's a great place to come to wile away the time & get back in touch with nature. The Japanese Garden is glorious all by itself, but you won't want to stop there once you see the rose garden, the desert garden, and the sculpture garden to name a few! There are many opportunities for photography here for free novices only; there is a fee for professional photography here. While there is an entrance fee, it is minimal in comparison to the experience you will have!",Mystica33
50,Beautiful Gardens and Art,"I take my out of town guests here, because the gardens are beautiful and it also has many art displays that will impress. If the weather is too hot or rainy you can always go in and see the art. There are so many gardens to explore, the Japanese garden, the Chinese garden, the cactus gardens, the rose garden and the herb garden, something for everyone. There is also a tea house for tea and tea accompaniments, the tea experience is a little pricey, but there is also a more reasonable cafe next door or the cafe in the Chinese garden for something not so expensive.",MySeaBiscuit13
50,Do NOT miss this and Plan for a full day!,"It has been years since our first visit to the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens - OMG, this is an incredible experience. If you have only one day, then get there early. However, if you have the time during your visit, I would recommend taking two days in order to experience both the art collections and the vast gardens.Be sure to take the garden tour, this would provide some history of the library and gardens! We elected to take the ""shorten version"" of the Japanese garden tour and regretted that decision.Also take the time for tea! That just adds to the experience.",tayloryen
50,"An oasis of botanical, artistic, and historic wonder","Okay, I know what you're thinking. ""A library? Really? On my vacation?""But this is no ordinary library, nor is it just a library alone. The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens is a tranquil and cultured array of great lawns, groves of exotic trees from around the planet, massive koi ponds, a huge cactus garden, a Chinese Garden, a Japanese Zen rock garden and teahouse, a Shakespeare garden, and of course the collections. Fine art; literary and historic manuscripts, antiquarian books, paintings, sculptures, silverwork, and furniture.An adequate visit encompasses a 2-3 hour stroll through the grounds, enough time to go into the main residence (now a gallery), and the library itself, while still having time to marvel at the gardens.Many visitors to Los Angeles miss the Huntington (the former home of one of Southern California's first railroad barons, for which it is named), because of its location, in the super-affluent area of San Marino, just a mile from Cal Tech in Pasadena. If you want a quiet, cultured, and beautiful 3-4 hours in the San Gabriel Valley (only 20 minutes from downtown L.A.), and marvel at the botanical wonders from around the world, visit this place.",BTuckG
50,Beautiful Botanical Gardens,"Due to time limitations (thank you, I-5 construction), we had the opportunity to visit only the botanical gardens on our day trip. They are not to be missed. The Rose Garden, the Shakespeare Garden, the Japanese Garden, the Desert Garden.....and of all, my favorite was the Lily Pond with its fantastically huge Koi, (overly) friendly duck, spectacular water flowers. The entire property including the gardens, library and art collections would easily fill an entire day. Well worth the trip.",Sharlene B

50,A Great Place to Spend Your Day,"We spent a wonderful day at this fabulous attraction just outside of Los Angeles in San Marino. The Huntington consists of the library (with exhibit), the mansion (tour the rooms and enjoy the artwork), the art gallery, several places to eat, gift shop and the magnificent gardens. Bring your camera – there is so much that you’ll want to enjoy after you return home. The art collection includes Gainsborough’s “Blue Boy” and Lawrence’s “Pinkie” housed together in the Thornton Portrait Gallery. The gift shop has an excellent collection of books and calendars in addition to toys, jewelry, and other gift items. A truly enjoyable way to spend your day!",Cleomissy
50,Wonderful day trip,"This place is great I loved it all the cactus garden, Chinese Gardens, art galleries. As others have said plan to spend at least 1/2 a day longer if you want to linger. It's close to LA and Hollywood so when you need a break from the hectic place this is where to relax. My teen didn't love it as much as I did but there are nice places to sit with a book or iphone and veg.",budget_travel_buff

A person can not capture every thing in one visit so please do notattempt to do it. I have been a visitor for many years and always look forward to my next adventure in the gardens. My favorites are the cactus garden, Japanese, and now the newChinese garden.",caartgal

50,A beautiful place to visit..,"Absolutely beautiful grounds such as the Japanese Gardens, Chinese Gardens, and overall..Main Library housed Gainsbourgh's Blue Boy and other beautiful artworks..Surprisingly the quality of artworks in the Library is very good; usually found in major museums, from Cassatt to Sargent..Beautiful furnitures by American artists and craftsmen, a must visit..",Molly C
50,"First class plants, pretty set pieces, good views and decent food make for success",Visited for the first time during January and was mightily pleased by the gardens though did not have time to sample the library's interior. Japanese (what else?) styled buildings and water features are added attractions where pleasing sounds accentuate beautiful visions. Took in an exhibit of Civil War photographs that was novel as well as informative. The San Bernardino Mountains provide a magnificent distant backdrop. The size of this place merits at least a full day's outing and legs can get tired by the distances to be covered. But the effort is well worthwhile.,Taughboyne
40,Lovely visit on a sunny day,"This was my second visit to the Huntington Library & Gardens. My first visit I had tea in the Tea Room. Having tea in the quaint (but small) Tea Room was a treat so this time I wanted to spend more time in the gardens & art area. It was a lovely sunny day & this visit was on their Free Day (first Thur. of every month but need tickets). We arrived in the morning & wandered around the gardens before the noon sun got too hot. We visited the Chinese & Japanese Gardens which were so serene & beautiful. We rested on the grassy hill overlooking the bridge & gardens. I enjoyed the art rooms & esp. ""The Blue Boy"" room with all the floor to ceiling paintings. Wear comfortable shoes, sunscreen & hat. It was a nice way to spend an afternoon. I would recommend trying to go on Free Day as admission is $20 otherwise.",Annew1217
50,Huntington Library,"I visited the Hungtingon Library in late June this year and it was such a gem to visit. All the flowers were blooming. If you enjoy art collections and botantical gardens; you would find a lot to do here. The cactus garden has a big selection of desert plants and I was very impressed. Since there is so much to see, plan on spending a full day there. It was also a great experience to enjoy tea in the tea house and try out the pastries buffet after strolling through the beautiful Shakesphere Garden. In the afternoon when it was really hot, go to the museum to escape the heat or visit the green house. I will definitely return to Huntington Library and may be I will visit there during Spring; summer may be too hot!",DDC_NJ
50,Many picture perfect spots,"We've visited the Huntington during July 4th weekend and it wasn't crowded. We've been here a few times before and it's always a delight to return. We come an average of once a year with the plan of taking a nice family photo.At this place, you can't take a bad picture. The settings and colors are beautiful. There are art galleries to view the wonderful collections. Plus, it's where you can seek refuge from the hot weather.I'm not really a plant lover, but I do love all the gardens here. The place is immense that you can't cover it all in 2-3 hours. The walks are great as long as you don't rush to see it all. Wear comfortable shoes, bring water and wear sunscreen. You'll be outdoor most of the time. Make sure to check the weather before heading to the Huntington so you can dress appropriately.Many places to take that family photo. I suggest you bring a tripod if you intend to take a family photo. Otherwise, you'll need to ask someone to take it. Also, plan ahead and take that photo as soon as you get there. If you have young kids, they may not be picture-perfect after 2 hours of walking.",AsianVista2
50,Wowed!,"This was our first visit and it was fabulous. Our favorite was the Chinese Garden which was so beautiful. My pictures look like postcards. Couldn't believe the quality of the art in the 3 galleries, the highlight of which was Gainsborough's Blue Boy. We spent 5 hours here and didn't get to see it all. Definitely worthwhile. The outdoor cafeteria was a welcome addition and the food was quite good for a cafeteria.",wanderer31310
50,Incredible gardens,"So much to see and appreciate - 3 hrs wasn't enough time! Manicured Japanese and Chinese Gardens, plus an absolutely incredible Desert Garden - literally thousands of species there! Plus rose, herb, Australian, and palm gardens - Heaven for plant-lovers! Beyond that we only had time to visit one art gallery inside (the American Collection - quite well done), because we bumped into the one downside - why did it have to close at 4;30pm on a Saturday in June? If we get down there again, we'll have to start much earlier in the day!",Ned K

If you plan on going, and don't mind spending extra cash, make reservations for the Tea Room located in the rose garden. You have to make reservations by calling 626-683-8131.

50,Passionate gardeners will also love the nearby Descanso Gardens,We enjoyed both the exhibits and gardens at Huntington. The cacti gardens are extensive and extraordinary. I am a passionate gardener and would recommend keen gardeners go to the nearby Descanso Gardens. They don't show up on Pasadena garden lists because they are technically in La Canada Flintridge but this is only a ten minute drive away. The drive through the surrounding La Canada Flintridge neighbourhood surrounding Descanso also has gorgeous homes and gardens.,LoveWailea
50,A great way to spend your day,"This place is amazing. It's a science center, an arts museum, and huge outdoor botanical garden all rolled into one. You can definitely spend an entire day here.It seems the most popular features here are the masterfully crafted landscapes and gardens. The grounds are zoned off and categorized. You have the Chinese Gardens, Australian Grounds, Rose Gardens, etc. Each area is transformed into the fauna and flora of that region. For example, in the Japanese Gardens, there are rows of Banzai trees and full-scale pagodas surrounded by bamboo. Or if you wander into the Jungle Garden, you'll be enveloped by tropical plants and palm fronds as you watch the resident geese walk by.They also have large grassy areas filled with beautiful plants and full-size statues. Of note is the front of the European Art building- a long grassy field with hedges, a central fountain, and is bordered by European sculptures.Their museums of private collections are also quite impressive. Multiple buildings are spread throughout the property, each housing different arts and/or sciences. World-famous paintings adorn every wall, and there are dozens of exhibits tucked around corners that beg to be explored and appreciated.My advice for first time visitors: Arrive early, because you will probably spend the better part of of the day there. The property is a lot bigger than it seems! Also, avoid hot days: All of the time you spend appreciating the grounds is time spent outside in the sun.Overall, this is undoubtedly one of the most unique visits in all of Southern California.",asianguitarguy
40,Free Day?,"I love this place. It's well worth the price of admission. Their free day however is impossible. Plan your trip, pick you time, pay the price and enjoy.I'm so frustrated with their promotion for free day that litterally sells out in seconds. It leaves me with the distinct impression that all the tickets are predesignated to sponsors of the library, friends and relatives. It so smacks of plagerism that it diminishes the fine experience of a great place. Their site has no place for comments or feedback - sorry to make it public.Love this place - Give free day back to the little people or end it.",Tim F
50,"Art, Gardens, and More","I've been to the Huntington many times, but never see it all in one visit. Today we arrived later in the afternoon and had time for only the Boone and Scott Galleries, and a little of the gardens. The Boone is a newer gallery and had an interesting exhibit on artwork of California wildflowers which we would have liked to see again, but it's about to close. A few years ago the Scott was expanded, about doubled in size, and is dedicated to American Art.The last five or ten years has seen much new construction and it's not finished. Today we had to enter through a temporary entrance because the entire entry area that we've used as long as I can remember, was fenced off and undergoing a upgrade. I explored the area around the entry construction site which I hadn't before at the north end of the Desert Garden and Jungle Garden.",Kenneth L
50,Spectacular Place.,"The Huntington Library and Gardens are well worth the visit. I was there for the first time in many years last week and enjoyed it as much as I remembered. The galleries are filled with amazing works of art...several you might recognize from various 'art history' text books. Blue Boy, Pinky, Gilbert Stuart's George Washington are among the most famous. Spend some time walking the exquisite gardens. I've always been partial to the desert garden where there are some very mature and very large cacti. Check out the Rose Garden and see various hybrids named for many famous actors. Cafe on site is more than decent. Nice gift shop.",Nancy D
50,Always a beautiful place to visit.,"We enjoyed our roaming along the grounds. If you can, take more than one day! Spend some time at the exhibits, peruse the gardens, do like my daughter does and bring a sketch pad! On Wednesdays, listen to the free live Chinese music in the Chinese garden. Make sure you take it all in leisurely, though! It's more fun if it's not rushed!",Gina V
50,Take your time!,"There is a lot to see in the library and art collections, but especially in the botanical gardens. This will definitely not be a quick trip! We took the free tour of the gardens, about an hour and a half with no breaks, which was not only extremely interesting and informative but a great way to see as much of the different gardens without getting lost!",Victoria
50,"Art, Gardens, Textiles and More","There are many types of gardens such as a rain forrest, children's garden,Chinese, Japanese, desert, etc.Wonderful collection of European art, American art, textiles, furniture, manuscripts, special temporary exibitions and so much more-a gem of a place to visit!",like2Ctheworld
40,Summer get away,"Books and garden seems like a good combination to me on a summer day. Huntington library with it's unique collection of books and art work, features wonderfully nurtured gardens that will capture your imagination.Their Chinese garden, Japanese garden, Rainforest, lily and rose garden, desert plant collection are a must see. Though I have seen better rose gardens, overall I like this place and would recommend friends and family to be there. The Chinese tea house is a nice place to take a break from all the walking. Kids should like the place, as it has grass areas to play and they get to see turtles, ducks, giant dragon flies and Koi fish.Walking shoes, comfortable clothing, lots of sunscreen, caps, sun glasses etc are recommended. Packed lunch would be a good idea. Water fountains placed in different parts of the park proved very convenient. It's a great place for a quite peaceful day with the nature.The ticket rates are a bit steep at 30 dollars per person.I am not sure if this place is worth that money.But they have free entry every first thursday of the month with prior online or telephone booking. These tickets sell out very fast but is totally worth getting.",anupama a
40,Probably not great for children,"This is a great place if you have lots of time and enjoy beautiful gardens and art. It is a bit 'stuffy' in that despite all the lovely places, you can't have a picnic. Surely designated places could have been provided for this so that you are not forced to eat standard American calorific fare. Picnic tables and rubbish bins would have been perfect.Make sure you go at 10.30 opening to make the most of the day, the entrance is $20 per adult.The Children's Garden is unfortunately the most uptight part! Although it has been designed well for children to enjoy themselves, the notice states, no strollers, no food, shoes must be worn at all times (why??) no climbing, and staff walk round patrolling this. How lovely if it was the one place where children could really splash about the water features and climb on the frames.Having said that, the conservatory is great with excellent educational exhibits for children of all ages. Our 4 year was intrigued by everything.",Karen B
50,A special place,"The Huntington is one of our favorite day trips. The expansive gardens are spectacular, and representative of different types of gardens - desert, Japanese, Chinese, the Rose Garden, the Rain Forest in the Conservatory, the wonderful hands-on Children's Garden - we love them all. A walk around the beautiful grounds are worth the trip, and we even love the art collection in the old Huntington mansion, also on the grounds. I have to admit that we've never made it to the Library, there are too many things to enjoy outside! Pasadena can get very hot in the summer, winter/spring are perfect. Definitely worth a trip when camellias are in season!",drivingmisssarah
50,Gorgeous place to visit-A must see!,"The Huntington Gardens and museum are a wonderful place to visit. I make a point to go every year. I find the best time is aroud Easter, as it is not as hot and the gardens are in gorgeous bloom. There is always something new at the art gallery, and they have very pleasant doscents that are very friendly and knowledgeble. Not to say the least at their summer nights concerts at the Loggia. For a beautiful romantic summer evening, have dinner there and enjoy music under the stars!!-Here is a tip-you can visit the park for free on the first Thursday of each month, just order your free tickets a month ahead. Check the website for info.",Esther r
50,Sublime - the highpoint of our visit to LA,"The unexpected highpoint of our holiday to LA was a trip to the suburb of San Marino, where you will find the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical gardens. The collections were amassed by a railway magnate who stipulated that after his death they be made available for the pleasure and education of the public. When we visited, the library hall was undergoing refurbishment, which meant we didn't get to see the ""Gutenberg Bible"", or the illuminated ""Canterbury Tales"" by Chaucer, but there is so much else to see that didn't matter at all. The gardens are some of the most beautiful anywhere in the world I have seen. The Japanese Garden, in particular, is breathtakingly beautiful, as is the Desert Garden, which we almost decided to ignore, but I'm so glad we didn't. The enormous cacti displays are weirdly spectacular, and as most visitors stayed away from this area, we had this exotic, other-worldly landscape completely to ourselves (unless you count the beautiful humming birds that flew all around us). There are other gardens too, like the Rose Garden and Chinese Garden, as well as a fine collection of 18th and 19th century paintings, ceramics and furniture. Other highlights for me, included Gainsborough's ""The Blue Boy"", and Lawrence's ""Pinkie"", both displayed in the same gallery, at opposite ends so they complement each other. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful throughout our visit and made us feel very welcome. Car parking was easy (and free) and we also had a good lunch there. Of all the places we visited in and around LA, the Huntington was by far the nicest and well worth the $20 weekday entrance fee (this goes up to $23 at weekends, when it may also be more crowded). Recommended and we're definitely going back next time!",Diesel B
50,Great gardens,"We spent 3.5 hours. The art collection is not the thing, can Easley skip it. The desert garden is fabulous. The Japanese garden is so beautiful. Not to miss the bonsai section which is inspiring.try to come at 10 o'clock to spend full time there. Take in consideration it's hot in summer. Must have hayd and water. We did not have time to visit the library, just hope to have another chance",shein97
50,Best Gardens and Paintings on West COast of California,"Memories to last a lifetime. Thoroughly enjoyed the library, its art and the structure of the building. The best came when one entered the gardens. My family's favourite place in California..well, in the greater LA area.",JaneSpotting
50,Absolutely Gorgeous--Worth Your Time,"We were awestruck by this stunningly beautiful place. Unfortunately, we had a short time to spend, and we hope to go back when we can take everything in at our leisure. The gardens are fabulous; the buildings lovely; the art collection worthy of our attention--along with an original Gutenberg Bible on display. It's expensive to get in, but it's worth both the time and the cost.",Grmpmbl
50,Lovely Gardens,"There was so very much to see and we had only a couple of hours to spend. We went to the Japanese, Chinese and Children's Gardens for our visit.The Japanese Gardens were incredibly beautiful with many architectural features, including a bridge over the water, a Zen garden, a number of bonsai specimens, a typical home, and lovely plantings. There were waterfalls in the midst of the paths that added to the beauty and tranquility of the area.The Chinese Gardens were lovely as well. A small cafe is available for light meals, snacks, and drinks that overlooks a water feature.The Children's Garden was excellent as we were there with three young boys. The entrance is much like a door leading into Alice in Wonderland. There were water features, a maze, places for the children to run through tunnels. We even saw a dove nesting. It was wonderful for exploring.A small feature, in the desert area of the children's garden, is what appears to be many metal projections between two cement walls. When pebbles are dropped down through the metal pins, lovely sounds are projected.The weather was perfect for our visit. All in all, there was just not enough time to see all of the lovely gardens. It would likely take a full day to see everything this location has to offer. It is well worth the visit.",lunanegra5
50,orld Class,"This is simply one of my favorite places. The art, gardens and exhibits are world class. The collection of books is extraordinary including a Gutenberg Bible and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The Japanese garden is recently renovated and the new Chinese garden is great. This is a must see when you are in the Pasadena area.",lharns
50,Beautiful Gardens and an amazing art collection,"This is a great place where you could easily spend most of a day. The variety of gardens is astounding, our favorite was the Japanese Garden and house but they were all magnificent. In the Chinese garden there is a little food place that serves a variety of Chinese items with outdoor seating near a small lake. The art collection is absoloutely first class and part is located in the Mansion which houses Gainsborough's famous ""Blue Boy"" painting. If you like gardens or art this place is a must see.",Michael M
50,Explore the Grounds and Buildings,"This is one of the nicest botanical gardens in Los Angeles, and you could spend a whole day here. If you are able have lunch in the tea garden, and don't miss the incredible Japanese garden. There are also buildings to explore which are air-conditioned, which is a good break on a hot day. If you are a researcher, they have an incredible archive collection, but it is by appointment.",mswsteve
50,Nature at its best!,"My daughter's in-laws were gracious enough to treat me to a trip to California, after coming from LV and Arizona. I had a nice time meeting their friends and relatives, attending their parties, reunions, among others. A special treat was when we went to Huntington Botanical Gardens. Being a garden enthusiast myself, I had a nice time, , I simply forgot my arthritic knees and feet, and I leveled my pace with them in going around, taking pictures, enjoying the bountiful beauty provided by nature, preserved in beautiful landscaped grounds. I was amazed at the big collection of cacti at the Cactus Garden, all sorts, shapes and sizes, marvelous!. The Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden, the English Garden, the Rose Garden, so astounding. I also saw during that time the world's stinkiest flower, the ""Titan Arum"", but during that time, it was close, so we did not have the chance to smell how it really was. And my, the large and tall trees, make you feel so small. I did not see the whole garden, but I was already satisfied! And I desire to be back next time I'll be in California!",Ester Coraza-Juliano

50,"Gardens, Art, and Science and All In One Place!","The Huntington Gardens in San Marino (LA COUNTY) has got to be one of the most beautiful places in Southern California.

Then there is the Huntington Home filled with priceless art treasures including the original BLUEBOY and PINKIE. There is over 100 acres of libraries, art, gardens, conservatories.

There are many benches to sit for awhile and enjoy the views.I would visit this Botanical Garden and Art Collection on a monthly basis if I lived nearby. There is so much to see, and we were unable to see it all. Next time I want to see the desert garden.The volunteers tending the roses were very generous and shared their knowledge when we asked!",CelticGinger
40,Allow plenty of time,"This is not advertised as much as it should be - there is SO much to see and the cactus are fantastic! There's also a Japanese and Chinese garden, herb garden, and other things to see. There's lots of walking but also lots of shade and benches for rests. We didn't even get to the library or art collection and spent at least 2 hrs just in the various gardens. It may be a little long for kids or seniors but what you have energy to see will be well worth the trip.",B G

50,Multiple featured garden areas include Chinese gardens & lake,"This is a beautiful Library/Museum and I've been coming to the gardens since childhood. This time I came on a Friday and the gardens openned at noon, so it was pretty hot walking through the enormous grounds, and I spent a considerable time in two areas, the succulents & cactus gardens- most of which were in full flower (late April)- and the Chinese gardens and restaurant. The gardens seem to be ever changing and alive, with hummingbirds, newly developed areas, and special exhibits -like the one on California wildflowers currently featured. The gardens also feature a beautiful rose garden and tea room (it is excellent a decent value), Japanese garden which has been used for several movies (including Memoirs of a Geisha) and features wonderful Bonsai and classic tea room, as well as a pretty lily pond where there are iris, koi and geese. The Chinese restaurant features a nice selection of teas and classic chinese dishes -I enjoyed the most delicious scallops w/delicate sauce and perfect rice, plus great iced tea. Eating at a shaded table as I looked out on the willow trees surrounding the pretty lake with carved wood ornamentation and stunning Chinese architecture was relaxing and delightful. Be sure to get a map and arrive as early as possible because there really is alot of ground to cover. On one side of the gardens it says they have a shuttle, but perhaps it only runs on weekends or at limited times because I didn't see it. There is a great children's garden and recreational areas for kids to play and learn. It's a little pricy but absolutely worth the admission--or go on the free day(s) monthly.",socaltravelmom_fun
50,Wanting something to do on a cloudy/rainy day!?,This is the most awesome place to spend a free day.... I was very sorry we arrived at 11:15a as it opens at 10:30a they were escorting us out a 4:30p and we had so much more to see! A deal of the $120 annual membership is a wise drop of funds to get back into this wonderful garden... To see the different seasons if blooming and having a tea in a premodern tea garden is an experience I could handle at least once a month! Yes... It's that great! Plenty of kinetic activities for the keiki!,OmaReading2Me
50,"""The Rose Garden Tea Room at Huntington Library""","Many previous reviewers emphasized the beauty and wonder of the Huntington Library, so I will concentrate on, specifically, the Rose Garden Tea Room.As the name suggests, it is located in the gorgeous and expansive rose garden.Once seated, you are served a delicious assortment of tiny scones and offered hot tea, iced tea or lemonade. I chose a refreshing iced tea, with a hint of raspberry, because it was a very warm spring day.The food is served buffet-style, all you can eat. The assortment was amazing. There were at least six kinds of finger sandwiches, salmon canapés, cheese and crackers, fresh fruits, salads, and even caviar (first time trying it, don't care for it, but at least now I know)! And the dessert selection was wonderful...tiny shortbread cookies and meringue cookies, tarts and bar cookies. It is literally a feast, one tiny bite at a time!It is a bit pricey...$29.50 for adults, plus admission to the Huntington Library (another $20) and the hours are limited, so check on the hours before you go. Also, we were there on a weekday and the tea room was full almost the entire time, so reservations are recommended! They recommend making your reservations at least two weeks in advance. Reservations can be made by calling or online (www.huntington.org).",travelingrandma91355
50,Must see if you love gardens,"This is a wonderful museum, especially if you love the outdoors. The gardens are huge, and can easily take multiple hours to peruse. The house and museum are very good, if you like European art (Blue Boy and Pinky are here) but not the major draw. Note that the hours are short, so be sure to go",Cruise_Ship_Tony

50,Natural beauty in LA,"Although I travel to LA a lot, I had not been to Huntington Gardens again until this March. What an amazing, gorgeous, life-affirming place! Neither my friend nor my daughter nor I could get enough of it. The gardens were spectacular - natural, beautifully kept, and varied. My breath was taken away by the desert garden and the Japanese garden looked like something out of a movie. I took dozens of photographs. This is something you must see if you are a photographer. We were so enthralled by the gardens that we did not have time for the library and museum. You could spend a couple of days here. The last time I was here we also had a special tea in a charming room, but again not enough time this last visit. (And the gift shop is pretty special too.)",Katalin G
50,LOVELY,"This is a MUST SEE destination for anyone craving some beauty and relaxation. I have nice memories of strolling around this place and entering it's gift shop. If I can remember anything, it must be wonderful. I remember statues worth photographing and a special locket I had wanted to buy at their pretty gift shop. Lots of trees and plants, lots of green, lots of walking, a great respite from hectic city life.",mermaidsylvia
40,Best for British Portraits,"It seems like they almost have a monopoly on British portraits by Gainsborough, Romney, Reynolds and others. Sadly the grounds seems to be needing some serious work. It is worth a few hours but does not need a full day to see the best of what they have.",legaldale
50,Just AMAZING complex and gardens,"One of the best places to visit in LA. I have now been twice and find the Huntington a real gem. The permanent exhibitions are excellent (the books are fantastic and the art collection counts a few masterpieces of American art, notably a wonderful sailboat by Hopper). The mansion is good, but the real jewels are the gardens. Just unbelievable Japanese, Chinese and desert garden.It opens from 10 -4.30 on weekdays and that leaves just enough time to see everything and have a bite (weekend hours are a little longer). The only disappointment are the refreshments. The cafe food is rather sub-standard, although it has nice seating outside and the tea house is overpriced and you HAVE to seat inside, which is a pity in such an idyllic setting.",remopigl
50,Another Must!,"The name...Huntington Library does not sound too exciting......but what a rewarding experience!I visited on a warm, sunny day....which was a plus.It is surprising how enormous the entire property is, so the recommendation is to get there when it opens so that you can take your time to view the gardens and some of the art.There are rose gardens, Chinese and Japanese inspired gardens, fountains, desert gardens.....the list goes on! Plus..there is the amazing mansion that the family spent some time in.So.......go early and enjoy enjoy! (but don't expect to see everything up close....plan accordingly)",Dave R
50,Wonderful gardens,"We recently visited The Huntington on a whim and did not have any idea what awaited us. All I can so is wow! The 3 1/2 hours we spent there were worth every cent. We arrived shortly before eleven A M and immediately latched on to a just beginning garden tour. This, in our opinion, is a must. the guide was friendly, informative and funny. We learned a lot and it added to our enjoyment. We especially enjoyed the Chinese garde, Japanese garden and Cactus garden. We did not spend nearly enough time there. Have to go back. Just visited the art collection briefly. Every one of the staff that we came into contact with was very cordial and eager to help.",mda49

50,"World Class Library, Museum and Gardens","We expected to spend a couple of hours at the Huntington and ended up spending six hours and that was not enough to see and appreciate everything. The gardens, library and museum are each outstanding.Unfortunately, the Huntington Library was being renovated but the highlights of the collection were in the American Art Building. Enjoyed seeing a Gutenberg Bible, early editions of Chaucer and Shakespeare, Auduban’s Birds of America (double elephant folio), letters and manuscripts by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln and etc etc. Quite amazing.The Huntington Art Gallery has a spectacular collection of European art – British portraits, miniatures, 18th-century French tapestries, porcelain, and furniture. Some of the best known works are The Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough, Pinkie by Thomas Lawrence, and Madonna and Child by Rogier van der Weyden. Again, quite amazing.Where to start with the gardens?? We visited the Rose Garden, Shakespeare Garden, Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Passed by the Australian Garden and spent some time in the Desert Garden. The Chinese Garden is still being developed but is very nice, built round a lake with a tea house. The Japanese Garden is outstanding and quite relaxing – built on the hillside with a house with ceremonial tea room, stream with moon bridge and a Zen Garden. The Desert Garden has a huge selection of mature succulents and covers several acres – amazing to see.We did not have time to see all the gardens, the Conservatory, American Art. You could easily spend a day or two here, especially to explore the gardens. Well worth a visit and highly recommended if you are in the Los Angeles area. We will be back next time we are in Los Angeles.",Whistledown
50,Highlight of our Trip,"First of all, let me say the half day we gave this attraction did not give it justice by any means. The grounds are huge at 225 acres (maybe it was 250) and one cannot possibly take in the gardens, library and art museum without spending several days. Passing through from out of state did not give us this luxury. Tours are given by volunteers and we were fortunate to walk in as one was just starting. That was 2 hours well worth our time. Another tour was just starting in the art museum as we entered. The Huntington volunteers are well versed in their subjects and give a worthwhile overview of their subject matter. The gardens are magnificent and the history behind the ""estate"" fascinating as well. Be sure to take the stroll to the Huntington Mausoleum.",Barbara R

50,Spring is blooming!,"This is a must visit, off the tourist trap map, when in Southern California. Weather you are a local or visitor this is a beautiful place to spend a few hours or the entire day. Expansive gardens, art collection, antique furnishings and housewares. Best time to visit is during the spring, everything is in bloom, from the cactus to the roses. Great place for any age, bring the kids and grandparents. Several choices for food, cafe, English style tea house ( make reservations), and Asian style offerings in the Chinese garden. If you are on a budget, free admittance on the third Thursday of every month with advance reservations. Make sure you use the GPS, not easy to find nestled in a very upscale residential neighborhood. Enjoy!",aslHelen
50,Wonderful way to spend a spring afternoon--art and gardens,"We hadn't been to the Huntington Library and Gardens for twenty years, and I regret not going back sooner. We picked a beautiful April Saturday for our visit. We got a late start but you could arrive at opening and leave at closing and still not see everything. We arrived at noon and headed straight for the Japanese Garden. The azaleas were fully in bloom, bushes completely covered with perfect blossoms. The wisteria was also in full bloom and amazing. There's a photo op at every turn. Don't miss the bonsai and Zen gardens. From there we headed for the Chinese Gardens through the blooming camellias. There was a gorgeous peony in the courtyard, along with lovely structures and bridges. We stopped for lunch at the Liu Fang Yuan Tea House. Beware, they are understaffed so the line can be long, as is the wait for your food (mostly fried) to be delivered. Sit outside if you can for the exquisite view--inside the structure can be noisy. The Chinese Garden has many benches and spots to sit and relax to enjoy the views. We then did a quick tour of the Conservatory, which was hot and humid, but had amazing orchids. Turning our attention to art, we did a quick run through of the Scott Gallery (American), (make sure to see the Greene and Greene exhibit) and the Huntington Art Gallery (European) which was the Huntington's home, where Blue Boy and Pinkie rule at opposite ends of gallery 11. We didn't have time for the Jungle Garden or the Desert Garden, so we'll need to go back. Even though you are in the midst of Pasadena and not far from LA, it feels like you are a world away. When the museum closes at 4:30, head to Old Town Pasadena for an early dinner and great people watching.",TooMuch2Do
50,Amazing on All Levels,"Whether your interest is in art, plants, or more, the Huntington has something for everyone. Personally, I find the gardens the most intriguing -- the lushness of the rose garden, the sculptural almost Martian-like succulent gardens, the tranquility of the Japanese and Chinese gardens. There's also plenty of interactive activities for the children in the greenhouses (including carnivorous plants) and the tea is excellent.",KrMcC
50,BEAUTIFUL!!!,Remember to take water and a hat with you as well as a camera - you'll want to remember this visit. The grounds are beautiful with every possible kind of plant imaginable as well as gardens that have been prepared as if you are in that specific country. The only disappointment was that they did not mention there were NO roses blooming at all during our visit and we made a special effort to find our way to that area thinking we'd missed it. Give yourself plenty of time to leisurely tour the grounds. Definitely a place to visit if you are in the area.,Garri R

50,Immaculate Spectacular,"This is probably one of the best public buildings and gardens I have ever seen. It will appeal to a number of different people, including those interested in art, gardens or something to eat in pleasant surroundings in the tea rooms. There are a large number of volunteers who can help with any questions you have in both the public buildings and gardens. For those into art there is the ""Blue Boy"" and ""Pink Lady"" among many other works of art. The gardens are split into different areas ie Australia garden, desert garden, rose garden, herb garden, Chinese and Japanese gardens. All of which are immaculately tended and will have many different attractions depending upon the time of year. This place is well worth a visit and there are plenty of photographic opportunities. I was very taken by the Japanese garden and the attached photographs show what is on offer.",Donk1
50,The gift that keeps on giving.,"I like this place so much that I purchased a membership. The gardens are magnificent and change with the seasons. Given its So Cal location winters and early spring may be one of the best times for viewing, especially the succulents and cacti. The Chinese garden, which is still a work in progress is authentic recreation of the UNESCO World Heritage gardens I was lucky enough to view last year in Suzhou, China. If you are a history buff, you'll love the library, which includes the world's first movable type printed book - the Guttenberg Bible. The art collection is good and on a hot day offers a respite from the sun drenched gardens. The only time you might consider avoiding the Huntington is during the hottest days of August, September, and October - head towards the beach instead.",820KurtB
50,Absolutely Gorgeous!!!,"This was my first visit and now I am wondering why I have never been before!! The grounds are stunning and amazingly well kept up. There are several different ""gardens"" to stroll through...you could easily spend the whole day here!",PatriceD97341
50,"Stunning, memorable and breathtaking gardens","My husband and I visited several botanical gardens in Southern California on a recent trip and the Huntington stood out as The Best. The gardens are exceptional, in particular the Japanese garden and its extensive bonsai collection as well as the Chinese garden. We had visited the Huntington many years before and because of limited time this trip we did not go into the museums, satisfying ourselves with gardens. I would return in a heartbeat if I lived nearer. Highly recommended. If you only have time to visit one garden in Southern California, be sure it is the Huntington.",SuzanneGrecophile
50,A jewel in San Marino,"I lived in California for over 25 years and never visited the library, but was invited to see the library on a recent visit from Tucson. The library is a wonder, beautiful and engaging. The gardens are diverse, well laid out, easy to traverse. The Japanese gardens are beautiful, they will transport you to kyoto. Inside the library you'll find rare 18Th. century French furniture and tapestry, and Gainsborough paintings including the Blue Boy.",LXGent
50,A Not-to-Miss Experience,"The gardens, as well as the Exhibits, Paintings etc, have to be seen.

Today I was here with two grandsons who loved the desert garden and the hands on activities in the glass conservatories and the Japanese and Chinese gardens. We had a nice lunch on the Chinese gardens overlooking the water.I have taken docent led tours in the past and have spent time in the amazing library and art galleries. This is equal to Longwood gardens in Pennsylvania and Butchart Gardens in Canada.",travelingrm

50,World treasures in an immense beautiful garden setting,"This huge impressive Botanical Garden has several museum buildings housing priceless books, including the Gutenburg Bible and famous art works, including Blue Boy and Pinkie and Audubon prints and books.The setting is the spacious quiet Botanical Garden with its impressive newly restored Japanese garden and bonsai collection and the recently developed Chinese garden, and the conservatory having excellent educational material, and a childrens play garden, and also the large cacti and succulent collections. An excellent botanical tour which includes an Australian and New Zealand section. All areas are well marked with good identification signs and the camellia collection has a long spring blooming time.There is an excellent Tea House in the center of the garden which features impressive cuisine and several other food services are available on the grounds also.The Botanical Garden will need at least a full day to enjoy all areas and will require considerable walking. An excellent opportunity to get acquainted with the unique outstanding collections and to have a quiet retreat with nature which is most attractively displayed and one will benefit with having excellent exerciseRepeat visits are necessary to keep enjoying and learning about the many treasures in the outstanding collections and garden.",764pwa

20,Poor parking control,"I hadn't been for many, many years, and wanted to show the museum and grounds to my wife during a recent visit to the area. A guard, and San Marino policeman standing with him, watched as cars entered to park, and, further in, a man at a guard gate waved us in, pointing us towards the parking lots. Which were completely filled (this was on a warm February Sunday, with, I believe, Chinese New Year festivities). After circling a couple of times, we gave up. No street parking. We we left, we drove by another entrance, which did have a ""parking full"" sign. Wish the folks at theother entrance had been clued in.",Sutter
50,Another Wonderful Retreat in the San Gabriel Valley,"For those of us living in Pasadena and the San Gabriel Valley, the Huntington is one of the three crown jewels of arboreta we have at our fingertips. When one adds in the art collections, the place becomes the center shining diamond of the three. It is easy to spend most of the day there, but if one lives locally, I'd suggest breaking up the visit: One day the Japanese gardens and something else; another day the Chinese gardens and something else; another day a hike around the perimeter; another day the galleries. Lunch is available and afternoon tea is served (with reservations) in a room adjacent to the rose garden. There is so much to see and do that a year's membership is an excellent value if you live in the area.",Waldorf2012
50,Go here - seriously. Lovely,"My only regret is that we could only be here three hours so we missed the library and art collection. We spent the whole time wandering around the wonderful gardens. Lots to look at, very informative and down right beautiful and relaxing. The funny thing is that we are not gardeners, or really plant people.",Thunder_s_Person

50,Gorgeous!,"I have been visiting the Huntington grounds for years. The first time was over 20 years ago with my parents. We walked around the gardens and were entranced by all the different regions: desert, Japanese, tropical, Australian, Roman, rose garden, herb garden, and many others. My second visit was with my 10th grade English class. We visited the Blue Boy in the Art Collections. Many years went by without a visit. Then about 10 years ago, I found out about the Rose Tearoom on the grounds and have visited once a year ever since. I have been to a handful of tea rooms in southern CA, but the Rose Tea Room has the most decadent low tea spread I have ever seen. I highly recommend making reservations, especially for popular weekends like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. You can either call or making reservations online. You walk in and first they take your tea orders (each person can make a different choice). The 4 choices of teas were apricot decaf, berry herbal, Earl Grey, and one more tea flavor I cannot remember; you can also have coffee. They then bring you a basket of warm little scones (chocolate chip, raisin, maple bacon). On the table was homemade marmalade, a berry jam, regular butter, clotted cream, white and brown sugar lumps, and cream. Then you go the buffet which has a beautiful flower spray over it. At the all you can eat buffet, the choices are sandwiches (egg salad, tuna, chicken tarragon, carrot ginger, cucumber), salads (bok choi, artichoke, chicken salad, arugula), deserts (pecan pie, lemon bar, black berry and rasberry tart, chocolate cup with whipped cream, tea cookies), fresh fruit (honey dew melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, blue berry, pineapple, strawberry) and others (including caviar, crackers, hummus, olives). The tea room is not cheap (about $25 for adults and $15 for kids, plus the admission to Huntington Gardens of $23 for adults and $8 for youth), but it's the absolute best in terms of food and scenery (right in front of the rose garden).After stuffing ourselves (I now go with my spouse and daughters), we walk off a fraction of the calories by visiting the beautiful gardens. This time we started in the Japanese garden with beautiful arching bridges over shimmering pond filled koi, bon sai, and traditional house with a tea display. Then we wandered through the shady bamboo forest over into the Chinese garden which was really festive because it will be Chinese New Year next week. In the midst of waterfalls, traditional Chinese architecture, more bridges over more water were beautiful pink apricot trees in bloom. There is a tea house where one can sit down, drink some tea, and have some Chinese food.When we went, the camellias were starting to bloom, and it was so delightful to see the pink and white hues of the blooming flowers. The camellia festival will be in 2 weeks when they are in full bloom. Next we visited the tropical greenhouse which housed beautiful orchid, banana trees, and cocoa plants from which chocolate is made. Then, our kids ran through the children's garden which has small cute versions of water fountains, tunnels, houses, hedges shaped like animals, and a set of musical nails where kids can drop rocks and hear music notes. Lastly, we walked through the desert region. This was my favorite with succulents that look like flowers and huge saguaro cacti and colors everywhere. The kids liked the scurrying lizard, squirrels, and buzzing bees. We were too tired by this time to visit the other regions. The grounds are too gorgeous to describe with words or even photos! We will definitely be back again.",Matthew J
50,A Quick Escape From L.A.,"A wonderful and relaxing day walking around the gardens. We unfortunately did not get to see the Japanese Gardens, as they were closed for renovation. We recommend having lunch at the tea room, a fitting experience though a little overpriced.",ThierryAndSandra
50,Can't beat these grounds,"The only thing better than the library are the grounds. Plan your tour around the season and the plants blooms. They often change the subject plantings ie: Zen, Desert, Floral...find your niche and visit accordingly..",dbajet
50,Incomparable beauty and serenity!,"This is a place I love to go just to get away from the hustle and bustle of life's demands. With deadlines, stress and client demands wearing on me day after day, this is where I go to breath, to relax and to bask in the beauty of these gardens. My comment to my friends and family is that this is where I go to add the years back to my life that the daily routine takes away.This is a collection of gardens from desert to forest to Australian to Japanese to Chinese and more. Walking through the 30-foot tall bamboo forest while the wind is gently rustling thought the leaves and stopping to soak in the scenery is beyond a human's ability to properly describe. In indescribable is a word that truly defines every vista, every sensation, everything.In addition to the glorious gardens, there is a garden café located right by the rose gardens. The food is yummy but the surroundings are breathtaking. There are also a couple of museums and a library that is wonderful.The library is an incredible place! The dim light in the library with its carefully controlled atmosphere makes you realize that you are in the presence of priceless treasures. Books hand written and illustrated, documents that defined their time and affected ours, manuscripts that date back so far it is hard to believe that they survived to this day, and even an original book by Audubon's (Birds of America), with each page measuring a huge 26"" wide x 39"" high. In the hushed, dimly lit environment, people whisper as they enjoy these treasures and walk through the collection with an air of reverence, knowing that those who created all these things were the ones who shaped the world we live in today.If there is one place that I believe is the true treasure of Southern California, it is The Huntington Library and Gardens. If you live here, you should visit several times a year, in the winter to see the most amazing sights in the desert garden, in the spring to see all the gorgeous flowering trees, and in the fall to take in all the color as plants and trees prepare to sleep for the winter. If you are visiting, do not miss this attraction!I have lived and visited many places in the US and in the world. I have never found its equal! Don't miss The Huntington Library and Gardens...and plan to be here for at least 4 hours so you can slowing meander and take your time!",Susan D
50,This place is out of this world...,"I really don't know where to begin. I came here last week and was amazed at how beautiful the botanical gardens. The person I went with was on crutches so we only saw part of the grounds. We had the garlic shrimp spring rolls (for a quick snack) from a little cafe in the Japanese Garden, I must say they were quite delicious. From there we worked are way back towards the tea house and took some time to see the rose garden. It was nice, but I would like to see it in the spring when everything is in full bloom. We had the Tea setting ($29 per person) and the food was quite delicious, not to mention all you can eat. They had warm scones with bacon in them that were to die for.They have an awesome art collection in one of the buildings and there is a science building that we never made it into. Realistically you need to make multiple visits here, at different times of the year, to truly get the most out of it. I plan on visiting these grounds many more times during my life. I hope whoever owns it continues to preserve its beauty while allowing the public to come and visit.Also, adult admission is $23 per person, but I think it is well worth the cost. If I didn't live over an hour away I would purchase a membership and visit a couple of times a month. Please visit and enjoy!!!",FMK1035
40,Enjoy the gardens!,"While the art collection is spectacular, the real attraction for us was the beautiful gardens and taking a cool stroll on a sunny day in Southern Cali! The Japanese Gardens and waterfalls are not to be missed. The Civil War photo exhibit was extra special. Love the way the photos were displayed, with quotes posted on the walls.",Jeanann J
50,Enjoy a day like no other!,"I had heard about the Huntington Library through friends that new I enjoyed shooting photography of flowers. They told me it would be worth the trip and it certainly was! My only regret is that I didn't have the entire day to spend there as I went in the afternoon.There is so MUCH to see that I suggest you put on your best walking shoes, go when they open and plan on enjoying the entire day. Don't forget to enjoy a hot tea while you are there!",BJLee399
50,"Breathtaking, do not miss!","Oh my, the home and furnishings, the art, the grounds, the setting...are all so beautiful, tranquil, and inspiring, that if you are in the L.A. area, you should not miss visiting here.

50,Beautiful gardens year-round and fantastic museums,"Our favorite museums and our favorite gardens in California are on the same gorgeous estate. We take all our guests from San Diego to San Marino to see the huge, other-worldly cactus garden, the exquisitely terraced Japanese garden, the citrus laden tropical garden, and the lovely, relaxing Chinese garden. We also enjoy the Australian garden and the formal English garden. Midway during our walk, we always have lunch consisting of a variety of teas, salads, finger sandwiches and desserts in the pretty tearoom situated in the rose garden. (I make reservations well in advance). My guests always like the orchids at the Arboretum, and their children especially enjoy the display of insecting eating plants. The museums are among the best in the country containing fine European works of art and American modern and western art. It's the library of rare books that I enjoy the most -- the handscribed and hand-illustrated Bibles are beautiful. The books that came off the first printing presses impress everyone. The estate takes at least two days to see without rushing. My guests always list their visit to the Huntington gardens and museums as their favorite excursion in Southern CA.",Linda M
50,L.A. at it's Best.,"I used to call the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens the best kept secret in L.A. but I think over the years it has become more well known to tourists but still nowhere near as popular as Hollywood, thank God! The Art and Furniture collection is of course marvellous but as a European used to such collections, my chief interest lies in the magnificent gardens, as one other contributor said they certainly can rival any in the world. I could spend hours just wandering around here,it's so beautiful. - the ""desert"" garden, as I call it, is absolutely fascinating and stunningly beautiful. The residential areas of San Marino and adjacent Pasadena are far superior to Beverley Hills which has been subjected in recent decades to some really kitch infringements, whereas these areas contain the best examples of L.A. domestic architecture. Well worth a visit, but only for the discerning, not the Universal Studios type visitor, I feel.",rc51
50,A Hidden Gem of Los Angeles-Unbelievable Beauty and History,"Many people tell me that they hate Los Angeles, it's too busy, smoggy, large, confusing...you get the picture, but it's my home and there are SO many wonderful things about LA that many visitors do not know about. They miss the hidden gems like The Huntington because they've decided to spend their time walking down Hollywood Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. Don't get me wrong, everyone wants to see the tourist places too, but places like the Huntington do not compare.I cannot even begin to tell you all the amazing gardens, plants, flowers and trees you'll see here. Not to mention the architecture, historical artifacts, art, and more! You will not be able to see everything in one day, and truly have taken time to enjoy everything that the Huntington has to offer.Go during spring, summer, autumn and winter and you will see different plants and flowers blooming. They also have a tearoom, which I went to many years ago, but haven't been lately, so I won't comment on it.If you are able to visit Los Angeles, do yourself a favor and go to the Huntington. I can almost guarantee you won't regret it (oh, they have a kids' garden area too, and my kids used to LOVE to run on the expansive lawns when they were little!) Some of my favorite photos of my children were taken at the Huntington.",christinascucina
50,Maybe the Best Botanical Garden Worldwide,"Say what you want about the ultra-wealthy and how they disrupt capital flows that should be going to the working class -- and you'd have me 99 times out of 100 on that argument -- but what Mr Huntington did something here with his cash is really something to behold. This site is stunning in every way.Getting into this jewel takes a little magic of your own; you'll need to reserve tickets long before you arrive which grants you an arrival time. The place is only open for about 5-6 hours a day, so grab the earliest slot you can stand. You will want as much time as you can get here. Bring a picnic basket or some sandwiches for lunch, the grounds were built for such activities.Upon arrival, you will be greeted with a Victorian-like gate that shrouds a massive parking lot, but this is LA so that's just the price to play. Behind the asphalt plain lies a series of gardens I dare say are likely the best you will ever see anywhere in the world. The garden is really a 3-4 part series of gardens, ranging from a simply ridiculous collection of cacti/succulents, a greenhouse rain forest, a Japanese bonsai collection / bamboo forest / tea house complete with waterfall and finally a Chinese reflecting pool. There was also an illusive lily pond I never tracked down. The whole thing looks surreal and could serve as an international seed bank if pressed into duty.To top this whole thing off is a series of buildings which have been converted into museums in the center of the complex. One of them does rotation collections while the main house is more of a portrait gallery. Both as sideshows to the garden in my opinion but the Civil War photography collection was worth seeing for 15-20 minutes (if it's there when you are), while the main house deserves maybe a similar chunk of time just to orient yourself to the times in which this man lived.All in all, this is a hidden gem you would be wise to add onto your itinerary if you can get tickets procured ahead of time.",staypuftman

The Library was closed for renovations when we were there. We went to look at the new Chinese garden which is not finished yet but looks like it will be very lovely when it is.

We mainly listened to the child's version (designated with a picture of a family that could have been any combination of genders), which held our kid's attention. Impressed by both the architecture and the art. The children's garden was the best we have seen, although apparently it was to have been closed so we and several others were unceremonially chased out. It explored all the senses and, according to our kids, had awesome hideouts. They also liked the small child's size entry gate. The special exhibits, the Discoveries in Science and the two Civil War exhibits were well done also. Both the Japanese and Chinese gardens were impressive, also. The Rose Garden tea was delicious also. The observatory had great displays. Clean restrooms and drinking fountains abounded. Even in the rain, we spent most of the day there and still did not see it all.",vkbrennan

The rose gardens are especially wonderful in the spring when they are filled with vibrant roses. The library itself consists of a few buildings containing lots of pieces of history and art. It's very interesting to see and is a change from the massive gardens. If you visit, don't miss the newly remodeled Japanese garden.

It WILL take more than a few hours to see most of it as you'll become lost in the beauty wherever you start. The main house holds a nearly unparalleled art collection, Pinkie and Blue Boy reside there, as well as many Reynolds and Romeny paintings. Pick up your FREE audio works to tour.The restaurant on site is small and quite good; mainly sandwiches, but freshly done to order.The gardens are arranged by themes such as Japanese and Chinese, rose garden, etc. Amazingly, in early November (2012) many flowering plants were in bloom although usually passed their time (Azaleas, roses, lilies, Paperwhites). There are courtesy trams for those needing a break from the lovely pathways. The drivers are quite knowledgeable as are the docents.This location is San Marino, also known as south Pasadena of Rose Parade fame, and is dead center in the middle of residential properties....rather like stumbling on a diamond while strolling through the middle of town!

50,One of the most amazing places I've had the privilege to visit,"We recently had the opportunity to visit The Huntingdon. What a jewel -- it completely blew me away. I had been to The Getty 3 times previously, but on this trip, a friend recommended this as another option. Here's the key difference in the way that I would describe the Huntingdon collections vs. the Getty: The Getty is an investment collection and the Huntingdon is a collection of love. Although both are incredible, the feeling between the two is totally different. The Huntingdon gardens are beautiful and expansive, yet personal. The newly-reopened Japanese garden was sublime. The books and documents are amazing -- the copy of the 13th amendement to the Constitution -- the newly-acquired ciphered telegrams from Lincoln during the Civil War, the Gutenberg Bible, documents surrounding Galileo's theories, unbelieveable. The artworks are varied and interesting, and I really enjoyed seeing Remington's Bronco Buster sculpture. I could have spent days there. I was absolutely be returning.The only thing I could think of to improve the experience would be to improve the map of the complex. But getting lost was a good way to see move of this amazing place.",laminpa

I particularly liked the new Chinese garden.The range of books in the library is spectacular, and the art and furniture collections wide-ranging and extremely well displayed. There's the unexpected too - this time I happened upon the Huntington's collection of early light bulbs.",Andrew B
50,Truly impressive,"One of the most beautiful gardens in the world! The building that houses the art collection is very interesting and the art collection, more specifically the 'Portrait Gallery', is worth the detour. The overall feeling is of a ""Frick Collection"", with the added attraction of outstanding scenery.",Cocolo47
50,"Art,gardens and PEACE","I attended the Southern California Orchid Society Show at the Library. This vast garden with multiple buildings provided an extraordinaire adventure. Easily found off CA 210, you will find the original ""Blue Boy"" painting plus numerous other wonderful works of art. Then spend time wandering around the grounds that include,trees, flowers and a wonderful collection of succulents and a special oriental garden area. Enjoy a great meal at the small cafe. A day well spent.",101NDtraveler
50,Fantastic,"Beautiful gardens! It's a huge estate. You can either ""tourist"" it and walk around most of a day seeing the different gardens or spend any amount of time relaxing on benches or lawns. The Chinese and Japanese Gardens are my favorite- just breathtaking! It's a very peaceful place. Very well kept up.",Rosie S
50,For all ages,"This reminds me of Longwood Gardens in the East but with year-round access to the lovely gardens! Be prepared to walk, walk, walk but worth the effort to see the beautiful grounds. Our grandkids loved the children's garden with all the fountains, maze, and special entrance. Must be one of the most extensive and varied art collections in the country. I would love to visit at different times of the year to see the wide array of flower gardens. The Chinese Garden landscaping was superb!",prindy52
50,Huntington Library,"Knowing that we were traveling to LA, friends of ours gave us tickets to the Huntington Library in San Marino. I must say, that this would never have been on our radar, since it is not the usual tourist activity. It was amazing. We took the complimentary tour of the beautiful themed gardens and our docent was extremely well informed and so pleasant. Our only complaint is that we wished that there was more time, since the hours are only from 12- 4:30pm.We also made a reservation for tea. Everything was fresh was delicious. It was a very hot day, so we opted for iced tea, which was refilled constantly. They even gave us a cellophane bag (and satin ribbon, to tie it with) for the basket of scones that are placed on the table, since with so much other food, we just couldn't eat them.I would definitely put this on your go to list if you are going to be in the area!",EasternPATraveler
50,Just Fantastic,A little pricey especially for families but they have so much history and just unbelievable walking gardens.,kevin p
50,Wonderful Oasis of Art and Gardens,"I was first introduced to the Huntington Library over 25 years ago and, since then, have returned for several repeat visits. The library is easily found in San Marino. The library contains three appealing attractions, the library itself, the art collection, and a variety of botanical gardens. Admission is $20 weekdays and $23 on weekends. This is a one-of-a-kind attraction and is well worth the admission cost.Once thru admissions, you'll walk by the Library. The library houses an appealing collection of manuscripts and rare books, including a Gutenberg Bible. The collection is so rare and vast that many come to the library to conduct research. On each of my visits it seems I'm easily able to spend 30-60 minutes here. When you leave the library, you'll see the mansion a short walk away. The mansion houses a vast array of sculpture, other unique artifacts, and an outstanding collection of paintings. British portraits are displayed throughout and a large hall houses some of the best portraiture you'll ever see. I'm fond of Gainsborough's work and you'll be entertained with what is displayed here. But the two paintings you cannot miss when going to the Huntington are ""Pinkie"" and ""Blueboy"", hung opposite one another in the mansion hall. Thankfully, this hall has several sofas for those who want to sit and fully take in the art in this room.The gardens on the property are worthy of full exploration. Covering all of them can be tiring but there are many benches to sit on and rest your feet. I wouldn't recommend a pathway to follow but rather suggest you merely stroll thru and enjoy stops in the Chinese garden, the Japanese garden, Rose garden, Elizabethan garden, and the Desert garden. I'm particularly fond of the Japanese garden. It speaks tranquility. The Desert garden has more varieties of cactus than I ever imagined.The admissions building also houses a museum giftshop/bookstore and restrooms. I don't remember it having a restaurant but do remember vendor carts for sodas and some eatable items.Visiting the Huntington Library is a treat, not only for the art and the gardens but also for the opportunity that is yours to step back from the rush-rush life outside the gates and exchange it for a relaxing few hours.I'll go back and back and back again.",fallfan54
40,"Gardens and Art, a perfect combination","We became members on our first visit. We will definitely return because there is too much to see in one day. The extensive art collection, presented in beautifully furnished rooms by the Huntingtons, can be fully enjoyed by taking advantage of the free headsets provided at the mansion's entrance. The renovated Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden are spectacular. A nice lunch of fish tacos and a panini sandwich prepared on the grill at the terrace cafe provided a nice break before enjoying the temporary exhibit on the Civil War.",dkayrenick
50,"Huntington Library, Botanical Gardens","This is the second time I've been here and my favorite part of the garden is the desert garden. Different species of cacti, big and beautiful. It's like seeing big sea anemones in the sea except they're big cacti but in land! Visitors need a day to see and admire everything. It's worth the visit and I would like to go again!",Places2Cee
50,"Beautiful & varied gardens, good bargain","Truly underrated, and a little out of the way, but worth the trip. The gardens rival (or arguably, exceed) other famous gardens in the US (like the Biltmore Gardens in North Carolina), but the price of admission o the Huntington Library is significantly lower. Do not miss the desert garden, Japanese Garden, and Chinese Garden. Plan to spend at least 3 hours there.",JRHCalifornia
50,Amazing!!!,"What a gorgeous place to come and be in nature and enjoy quiet. Vast gardens with different themes (rose, Chinese, Japanese,etc..), this is a special experience.",L2Connelly
50,Absolutely Gorgeous,We had a few hours to kill on our last day in L. A. and a friend suggested Huntington Gardens. We had no idea how much we would love the place! We strolled through the gardens for hours. We particularly loved the desert section and Japanese gardens. The galleries and historical buildings were also nice. Our 1 or 2 hour excursion lasted all day until they kicked us out as closing time. We could have stayed much longer. I recommend it to everyone--it's not just for people who like horticulture.,lizardtiff
50,Perfect Mother's Day present!,The Huntington grounds is humongous and provides plenty of scenery. There are special exhibits which change every so often and of course the seasons will depict the plant life also. I have been here several times and my mother and grandmother have spent many Mother's Days here. I highly recommend the Tea House. The buffet is delicious and the teas and pastry are equally enticing!,CaliforniaGirl22
50,So Peaceful You Won't Want to Leave,"Wonderful place to walk, sit or just read a book. Very peaceful and serene. Beautiful scenery and artwork.",KatPlay
50,Must See Garden!,"I have been to this garden many times and finally had the chance to bring my bf to see it. He is a huge bonsai fan and the botanical garden boasts a beautiful bonsai collection. My bf was so impressed by the collection and the set up. The estate is so massive and beautiful, there are all sorts of different things here. An english rose garden, a tea house, a Japanese style garden, Chinese style etc. Families, couples, or even friends can come here just to view the garden. I would suggest people bring some small snacks and water to drink as you can easily spend a few hours here looking at the different designs and elements of each garden. We went on a really hot day in the summer and we were so tired after 3 hrs. Try to take breaks on the benches because you can't just power through the gardens. Also try to stop by the library and view the art collections. Those are just as beautiful and the stories behind each painting is amazing. Lots of people come here to take engagement/wedding photos at the gardens too, and once you go there, you'll see why. The backdrop is beautiful in pictures. You don't see many animals here other than the fish in the ponds. Entrance fee isn't terribly expensive considering what this place has to offer. If you have a student ID card, use it because you can get a discount. And it's always cheaper to go visit on a weekday.",MsSusannaS
50,Beautiful gardens and nice art.,"My wife and I visited the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens around the end of September. The gardens are big and the day we visited was very hot. Therefore we only saw the section for cacti and succulent plants. The varieties were endless and all the specimens were beautiful. We were unable to see the Chinese garden, Japanese garden and the rest because of excessive heat. Mr. and Mrs. Huntington collected European and American fine art, These are displayed in 2-3 buildings. The art is very impressive for a personal collection of a wealthy couple. The buildings have a nice architecture. The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens should be a must see attraction for people who visit Pasadena or Los Angeles.",Farhad A
50,Gorgeous gardens and something for almost everyone,"My husband and I are fans of the Huntington. We go to botanical gardens fairly frequently, and this one stands out to us. There is a little bit of everything. There is a cafeteria, and a tea house (with a very good tea service) there is the house, and the library, with lots of interesting art, and even some science exhibits. The gardens themselves are very extensive, and well kept.Keep in mind Pasadena is pretty much in the desert and the temperatures in summer months range from the high 80s to the 100s. Bring comfortable shoes, water, sun protection, and lots of energy. Particularly fun is the succulent sale which happens one weekend in the summer. Check out their site for upcoming events.",SionnanH
50,Stately and beautiful Gardens and Library,"We are so fortunate to have so many really worldclass gardens near Los Angeles and this is one of the very best. You can visit a number of times and still not have seen it all. The paintings of Pinkie and the Blue Boy are here and worth a trip all by themselves. But the Gardens!! Oh, the Gardens! Be sure to take your camera.",Puttermutt17
50,Huntington Library,A beautiful place to spend a few hours or most of a day. Gorgeous grounds with the various themed gardens and of course the exhibits of art and historical documents are excellent and fascinating.,Karenina_12
50,Great Place For Family & Friends,"Visited The Huntington Library with friends several times now. It just never gets old. There seems to be new discoveries every time I step into the gates. The gardens are separated into several theme sections. Take your time and look at all the details. You will realize just how wonderful and amazing this place truly are. My personal favorites includes the Chinese Garden and newly renovated Japanese Garden (they are totally different). Also, there is a seclusive area that has several small ponds with ducks and birds. I am looking forward to go back soon. Don't forget to bring your camera & lens. Plan to stay there the whole day or maybe two days.. you will need it. Oh.. I almost forgot, there is several exhibits and galleries. But, I can not say much about it since I have not spend any time in there because I've been busy just staying outside.",Tony S
50,"Art, Both Natural and Created","I have visited the Huntington Library and Gardens dozens of times. It's always beautiful. In recent years, several of the buildings and gardens have been restored. Others have been added, such as the first phase of the four phase Chinese garden. Former utilitarian buildings have been converted to galleries. The Japanese garden has been refurbished and expanded. Many pieces of fine art and historic books and papers round out the collection.Four members summer evenings events allow visiting the gardens in the cool of a summer evening with lawn picnics accompanied by music.",Kenneth L
50,Take a whole day. you'll need it.,"What a fantastic experience the Huntington Library is. There are so many wonderful works of art, manuscripts and other treasures to see. The Huntington is set up so that you can enjoy a cerebral indoor experience, then move to the outside and enjoy the beauty and fresh air of one of the magnificent gardens, then move back inside, and so on.The beauty of the Huntington mansion is a wonderful setting for the art works collected there. There are many treasures spread among the buildings at the Huntington, particularly among the books and manuscripts. The American art is housed in its own building and is great to visit. There are free lockers and audio guides in the two art collections. The large glass house and the adjacent children's garden are full of interesting features. I saw my first wild humming bird near the children's garden.I walked up the hill at the back of the children's garden to look at the mausoleum. You're not meant to do it that way, but it is certainly easier.Be prepared to take many photos in the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Everywhere you turn is a new and perfect vista. It is like the walk of a thousand postcards. Don't miss the collection of bonsai beside the Japanese garden.The desert garden is huge and stunning, but be careful not to get lost.I think the best way to approach the Huntington is as follows:First the Mansion then through the rose garden to the Japanese Garden and Bonsai then along the back path through the camellias to Chinese garden. After the Chinese garden back to the American collection and treasures, then over to glass house, children's garden and mausoleum. Then to the science collection and over to the desert garden then the lilly ponds and finally the Australian garden. See if you can catch a lift back to the main gate with the shuttle that runs around the garden every half hour for those needing assistance (it's often empty). This itinerary breaks up the indoor with the outdoor and covers everything.",Nomad65843395326

50,Must see if you're in LA,"This was our second trip to LA and we were looking thru Trip Advisor for things to do that we hadn't done on our first trip. The Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens was highly rated so we put it on our schedule to check out. Wow! What an amazing place. The desert garden just blew us away! I've never seen so many different types of mature cactus, aloe, agave, and other succulents in one place before. The Camelia collection was stunning. Seeing a vellum copy of the Guttenburg Bible was awesome. The art collection was impressive. Beautiful architecture to the buildings. Can't say enough nice things about the experience. One note: it does got hot on the grounds so bringing an umbrella to shade yourself is highly recommended. Enjoy!",WSD526

The variety of plants was amazing. We then treated ourselves to afternoon tea (a very civilized way to spend an hour). On our last trip, we shared the experience with a close friend. We were anxious to show her the desert gardens and then wandered through the Japanese and Chinese areas. We were pleased to see the many changes and updates. We just had enough time to check out some of the art and the architecture.",LandM

50,"Phenomenal gardens, could easily spend a week here.","We had a very short amount of time to visit the Huntington, so I researched before we went and decided what we would most like to see. We focused our time on the botanical gardens--specifically the Desert Garden (WOW) and the Chinese Garden. The Desert Garden blew my mind. It was nicely planted, designed, and labeled. It was hard to move on to the Chinese garden, I could have perused the Desert all day. The Chinese Garden appears to be a fairly new installation. The plantings have not had time yet to fully mature, but when they grow in a bit more, it will be breathtaking. The structures in this part of the garden were beautiful. I want to go back and see the whole thing!",Leslie S
50,Plan to spend a whole day,"We thought four hours would be enough to wander around the gardens and museum. Wrong! So glad we went in the morning so we had the afternoon to scrap our original plans and stay at Huntington! This place is phenomenal. Every type of garden excellent for walking/strolling (we covered 7.5 miles according to our GPS). When you want a break from the gorgeous weather, step into the mansion to view incredible art and collectibles. We ate snacks from our cooler outside the gate, which is also lined with lots of benches and designed gardens.",UnsheepishlySeattle

The rose garden is really lovely, and there are so many other gardens to see, as well: the desert garden, Chinese gardens, Japanese gardens, herb gardens, sculpture garden, lily ponds, etc. You could spend days there just exploring outside.There are a number of museums and galleries to visit, as well as the main house and library. The art exhibits are a lot of fun to see, and I love the old and rare books on display. The museum also has temporary exhibits that they change out frequently, so there is always something new to see. There are also classes and lectures.

We ate Chinese overlook the serene Jade Lake filled with koi and lovely birds. There is also a quaint tea house with sandwiches and desserts.Very romantic for a couple but there is also an amazing Children’s Garden for families to enjoy. I highly recommend this as a must see.

We returned with our now 4 and 2 year olds for a day in the Botanical Gardens and had a great time.Our kids loved the desert garden and seeing all the cactuses. From there it was nice to find some open space and grass to let the kids run around for a while. We had to watch our kids a little more closely in the desert garden but once we got to the Lilly Ponds we felt really relaxed and the kids had so much fun watching the coy fish. There was also a great big turtle lounging in a little pool of water and we spotted a few catfish.The hardest part of the day was getting from one section to another. Kids obviously not interested in traversing the trails as exploring along the way. Found some great puddles along the way for them to run and jump in though!unfortunately we were a bit rushed for time and were not able to go to the japanese tea garden which I think the kids would have loved. They did love the rose gardens.The tears came when we opted not to pay for the quite elegant tea hour in the tea house. Our kids would have loved it but it just was not in our budget that day. We went next door to the cafe. The service was painfully slow but the food was delicious and we got a ton of food for a pretty good price.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE The Huntington.

There is no wrong choice. If you live in the area, be sure to stop by for the special exhibitions in the Boone gallery. In the summertime there are a variety of concerts on Saturday evenings that appeal to different musical tastes.There are ongoing classes, lectures, and other special events.

Since we were in the vicinity, we decided to stop by Huntington Library, which I had not visited in at least 10 years. I was pleased to find many additions since I was there last. We enjoyed the elaborate Chinese garden and the recently renovated Japanese garden. The rainforest exhibit was also amazing, and my boys were intrigued by all of the hands-on activities in the building. The children's garden, meanwhile, was an expansive area for little ones to frolick about.The beautiful grounds kept us entertained for several hours.

50,A gorgeous way to spend a day,"My mother and I took a weeklong trip to LA over my spring break in March. I wanted to take a day to give her a breather from all the manic studio touring/aquarium visiting/food eating/Hollywood cruising I wanted to do. So I read about the Huntington in the LA Frommer's guide and thought it sounded like a perfect fit for both of our interests.She's a terrific gardener, lover of pretty things, and has prints of Pinkie and Blue Boy in her bedroom. Convenient much? I'm a graduate student in English.This place was gorgeous, as was our cruise through surrounding San Marino. The grounds were just impeccable, the employees serious but helpful. The gift shop I managed to get lost in for a while, sort of wanting to buy everything. (We got my mom an adorable T-shirt with roses on it and three little flowery notebooks for me).We spent most of our time in the gardens, but also loved the house and the beautiful art collections. At the recommendation of the Frommer's guide, we had afternoon ""tea"" in the Rose Garden Tea Room at 3pm, which was a welcome break in the day. Delicious unlimited sandwiches, salads, fruit, caviar, pastries, tea (iced or hot--and we are a classy iced tea people), and fabulous scones. Pricey, but considering this is much more than ""tea,"" and adorable, completely worth it. We made reservations, and I know they are recommended!Altogether, a lovely day and a nice change of pace from your prototypical LA touristy fare.Also, as we were there basically from opening to closing and barely able to cover it all, I would recommend you taking at least one full day so that you won't feel like you missed out anything!",Edna M

We started in the desert garden, which I thought would be boring, but I've never seen so many different types of cacti. There were little hummingbirds flitting around too. The Japanese gardens are awesome. We ate lunch at the cafeteria and they were nice enough to prepare a fresh salad without cheese for us.

Some of us went on up to the Tea House, which has been refurbished and is splendid to see. Oh, a very good rose garden, too, and a fascinating garden featuring culinary herbs. You really could spend all day here -- and have lunch outdoors, or (with reservations) indoors in the tea room.",srca
50,"If You Love Books, Paintings, and Gardens...","…then the Huntington is a must-see if you’re in LA. The Huntington is a showcase of high culture, featuring a world class book collection, art galleries, and beautiful grounds. Those who have visited England may be reminded of the great country estates, now open to the public, that house the art collections acquired by families over several generations. The same pattern is found here – a mansion decorated with 18th and 19th century European art and furnishings, a lot of land, and lovely gardens. The size and scope of the property mean that there’s plenty to see in one day. We came for two or three hours on successive days and didn’t come close to seeing everything. Highlights are the European and American art collections (two different galleries), the gardens, and the library exhibits.A word on the “library” element of the Huntington – it is a research library, and the general public is not permitted to browse through the stacks! However, there’s a large exhibit hall where you can see many of the highlights of the collection, including the only Gutenberg Bible on the west coast. You can also see (in the current special exhibit) first editions of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. If you love rare books, the experience is breathtaking.Be warned that there are crowds on weekends. There is a café, but when we were there it was so crowded that we decided to leave the property for lunch and come back later (We ended up finding a great little diner in Pasadena called Pie 'n Burger). Your pass is good all day, and parking is plentiful, so no problems there. Make time at the end of the day for a visit to the excellent gift shop.",FourthBear
40,Don't miss this..,"This is quite an amazing place to visit. We enjoyed the gardens hugely. you don't have to be a garden enthusiast to enjoy the grounds, they are just outstanding. We especially liked the cactus garden and our hosts spent an hour with their 4 year old in the children's garden while we visited the art gallery. That alone is worth the 20 dollar fee,with a wonderful display of late c.19 th and c.20 th American art and design in particular. We had time to see only a little of the gallery but it was wonderful. We also had lunch there which was great. The only apparent issue was that it was a very warm day when we visited and the children's garden seems to have very little shelter in the afternoon heat.",Liege-Bastogne-Liege
50,Amazing gardens- so worth it when visiting LA area,"I had read a review on another site and thought we were going to be visiting some nice small gardens. Then when we saw the sign that the parking lot was full and got in a long line for the $20 admission, I realized that this might be bigger and better than I had expected. We were there for almost 2 hours until they closed and wished we had gotten there earlier. We did not even get to see all the gardens and never made it inside to see the art. We only got to see the jungle, desert, rose, Japanese and Chinese gardens and were impressed with all of them. We would definitely go back.",skupie
50,A must see!,Beautiful and sprawling. Be sure to see Blue Boy and Pinkie.,RobboLA818
40,Not your typical library,"it is a collection, but it is a collection of artwork, historical books, and beautiful gardens. There are also events that you can find like small concerts and events for visitors and family where you can lay a blanket and a picnic basket while you enjoy the surrounding beauty. Plenty to walk and see, so bring some comfortable shoes and maybe a light sweater if you stay",Tamale624
50,Fabulous Art and Awesome Gardens!,"The problem with the Huntington Library is to figure out what you want to do in the time you have to spend. The art is wonderful, the gardens extraordinary. No way to do it all in a day. I can't wait for to see the newly refurbished Japanese Garden. Take some time to have tea there, too. A wonderful way to spend the day, a week or,,,",JSW842

50,Lovely place to visit,"One of my fav places to visit. Took my English cousins a few years ago and they commented that's where all the English paintings are. I love Pinkie, Blue Boy, and Mrs Siddons, Constables, etc.. My friends especially love the minature portraits. So many beautiful items to see in the houses but the gardens are so special.Come early since there's never enough time to see it all. I like to come when the roses are blooming but lately found the conservatory is a great hot house for all to enjoy. Sign up for the free tickets for the 1st Thurs of the month. You have to apply on the 1st previous month before all are taken. Hint - ask the information desk. I and others turned in our extra tickets there.",Snapshotgalaxian

The gardens are incredible, esp. the desert garden and the Japanese garden. But the mansion is very interesting too, with the Blue Boy by Gainsborough and a view of Venise by Turner. Special exhibitations. We were there in late April with all the roses in full bloom! This place is also world famous for the Library and the Gutenberg Bible. But this side is more suited for the specialists. Very large parkings. Very helpfull staff.",akhenaton2
50,Beautiful Gardens and more!,"Wonderful place to take the whole family on a spring or summer day. There's a huge grassy area on the lower grounds to lounge or play frisbee. The rose gardens are stunning when in bloom. Take a walk through the original main house which is now an art gallery and also contains some of the original furnishings. The tea room is the perfect place for a little celebration with your girlfriends...or to bring your mom. If you live in the area, I highly recommend becoming a member. You then get to go to member only summer concert nights where you can pack a picnic and enjoy the live music and warm Pasadena nights.",sacredmusic04
50,Extraordinary gardens and great art,"The gardens are wonderful - deserts, jungles, trees, flowers, Japanese, Chinese, lakes and streams. A great day out. The art is terrific (especially if you like British art of the 18th and 19th centuries) but the gardens are worth the day alone.",AndrewMNY
50,"Spectacular gardens, rare books and art.","Spectacular site!! I wish it were open for longer hours. We arrived at opening (noon) and were ""kicked out"" at 4:30 - closing time.I have never seen such a beautiful combination of gardens: cactus, rose, Chinese, Japanese, etc. While I have seen better Japanese gardens (San Francisco and Portland) and rose gardens (Portland), I have never seen such an amazing diversity of gardens in one location. The cactus garden was astonishing in its variety. Be sure to take the docent tour of the gardens for a great overview.It was humbling to see a Gutenberg Bible and an early edition of Chaucer. The art collection was surprisingly good. (At the Hearst Castle I could imagine a compulsive collector. Here, I thought I could discern someone who prized art and learning.)",Yankeeinexile

50,VERY highly recommended,"My family had a wonderful time visiting the Huntington Gardens in mid-Apr. The advent of Spring and the vibrant colors of the flowers and foliage were evident in the very well laid out Gardens. Though it is a relatively large and sometimes undulating terrain, it was a very pleasant and easy walk to all the major attractions. We just focused on the Gardens on this trip and spent the whole day there. The must see Gardens are the Chinese, Japanese, Shakespeare and Desert Gardens (see attached photos). The Herb and Rose Gardens are also worth a stop. The Lily Ponds were slightly disappointing. Since picnics are not allowed in the park, we enjoyed our picnic lunch in the parking lot. You probably want to come early to get a good parking spot with some greenery/space near your vehicle for this purpose. A tip for those requiring wheelchair access - there are two ways to get into the Japanese Gardens in a wheelchair. The one on the left through the Bamboo Garden is quite steep uphill. The alternative route through the Chinese Gardens is much easier. This path starts from the Chinese Gardens restrooms just to the rear left of the restaurant. I strongly recommend this attraction for a relaxing and enjoyable trip for both family and friends.",ckyip
50,Beautiful gardens!,Great for a date or family outing. You can spend hours walking through the gardens or browsing through the art & architecture. If you're a Jane Austen fan you would love this place. I felt like I was a guest at Pemberly LOL,zenprincess
50,It's worth the trip to Pasadena,"Along with the Norton Simon Museum, the Huntington is a must see when coming to Pasadena. It's a library (Gutenberg bible), a magnificent art collection (Blue Boy and Pinkie) and botanical gardens. If you go, plan to spend the whole day here. You cannot picnic on the grounds, but there are several cafes where you can have food and the food we had was pretty good. There is extensive walking involved to see the gardens but there are Special Assistance Vehicles that you can access with no extra cost. Do not miss the Japanese gardens with the bonsai collection and the Chinese garden (The Garden os Flowing Fragrance). Coming from our home where nothing is blooming yet then being in the gardens was such a treat. The magnolias in town were blooming and the camelias in the gardens along with roses of every kind were in full bloom. Loved it!",cwaunita
50,dont miss it,"If you have a day to spend, do it here.The gardens and mansion are very nice. Be sure to use the free headphones in the mansion and in the art gallery so you won't miss a thing and get the full story.Roses are beautiful",drinkmilkCa
50,Even a short visit is worth it.,"We only had a couple hours but making a visit was well worth it. After entering the garden (Adult $15), we headed to the left and got a big dose of desert. Wow, in May plenty of blooms on the cactus. Butterflies seem to like this part of the garden. Some of the trees/plants are huge and look right out of Dr. Seuss.We then looped around the bottom of the garden to head over to the Japanese area. Bonsai trees, waterfalls, ponds, bamboo groves and a rock garden provide a contrast to the earlier desert landscape. Are some of the Bonsai trees really 300 years old? That's the rumor.Running out of time we finished up by cutting through the rose garden. Amazing variety of colors and everything was in bloom. We didn't even get to the Chinese portion of the garden which is a highlight for many.If i lived in the area i would want to be a member so that i could visit all year round.",Arch C
50,Garden Oasis,"Stunning gardens of all varieties from succulents to roses. I especially loved the Japanese and Chinese Gardens. Wonderful statuary and fountains. Unfortunately, we got a late start and did not get into the house or library, and I am so sorry. So allocate a whole afternoon or more. A lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and stroll to your heart's content. Maybe take a blanket to spread out and soak in some sunshine. Just go and enjoy. It is so beautiful you couldn't regret it. And check out the gift shop - wonderful books, teas, etc.",annhhowell
50,An enchanted place full of fragrance and history,"You will especially enjoy the books on exhibit, the garden statuary and the paintings.

50,Perfect!,"We were in for quite a surprise with this place. The grounds and gardens are breathtaking and huge. It contains several gardens, including: A Japanese Garden, Chinese Garden, Desert Garden, Rose Garden, etc...The 18th century art collection is impressive as is the rare books collection. They have the Guttenberg Bible on display, though not a first print, it still is great to see along with some books By Shakespeare, Galileo Galilei and Charles Darwin to name a few.The only problem is that they are only open in the afternoon and although, we got there right when they opened, we didn't have enough time to see it all.",MonaLisa1506

50,A favorite place in southern California!,"We recently had a group outing to the Huntington Library and Gardens, and we all truly enjoyed our visit. We had a smart, engaging tour guide whose enthusiasm for the Huntington was infectious. The Gardens are breathtaking, the art collections stunning, and the tearoom was delightful. Such an extraordinary collection of beauty in one place. If you are looking for a truly great outing for your group, I highly recommend a trip to the Huntington Library & Gardens!",Teri W
50,Wonderful place to spend the day,"For many people in Southern California the color green can be taken for granted. It seems to be everywhere that is unless you live in the desert. So, for my wife and I making a 75 mile drive from the high desert to see not only green but also the many colors in this garden is a wonderful chance of scenery. The spring time colors were over overwhelming, the many roses, the many different plants can give a delight to any one’s eyes.We arrived on a day in which there was a plant sale. If you attend the plant sale be sure to bring a cart to haul the plants to your car. Also parking can be hard to find on a plant sale day, on other days parking is very easy. Parking is always free. As for me the plant sale was too busy and the rows of vendors were too close together. Still, that did not take away the joy that most people had in the sale area, I chose to move on to the main entrance.My last visit to the Huntington Library was in the fall, so I want to see the flowers in the spring time. Both seasons can bring an enjoyable day as the grounds are very well kept. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as walks can be long. In the spring and summer a hat is a good idea as well as water. No food is allowed, but water can be taken in, there is also water that can be purchase.Be sure to visit the indoor art galleries and exhibits.",Mou2
50,Just beautiful,"The ticket to enter is worth every penny. They have free docent tours, but it is just as easy to navigate the grounds on your own. My favorites are the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Great places to eat: China Pavilion or the Garden Cafe. Allow at least three-four hours.This is not a great place for someone with mobility issues. However, there are paved paths if you have a scooter.",CATravelBug411
50,No end of Beauty,"Who knew there were so many different kinds of roses, each with its own individual scent? The endless gardens could take days to explore. We visited the day the Japanese Gardens reopened. Enjoyed the extensive display of Bonsai. The Chinese Gardens very restful. Docents extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. Arrive early--there's lots to see!",Mac-and-Tosh
50,"A ""must see"" if you are only in town for a short time! Don't miss it!","There is SO much to see at the Huntington! The gardens alone could take days to actually see everything, then there's the library with the exhibitions which are constantly changing. Then there's the house/mansion to view, not to mention Blue Boy and Pink Lady. If you are lucky enough to live nearby, it's wonderful to be able to go during different times of the year as different plants and flowers are blooming.Cannot overstress how wonderful it is to spend a few hours at the Huntington!",christinascucina

The fountains were just their size to enjoy with lots of areas to run around. Bring a change of clothes! They will get wet and dirty. Tis area is part of the regular admission",travelshooter71
50,My special LA place,"I try to visit the Huntington Gardens each time I visit LA. No matter the season, there is always something new to see. When the gardens are in bloom,you will have still an extra treat. The Japanese Garden has recently re-opened, but at this writing is still incomplete, with a new teahouse to be built. There are new touch rocks and bridges as well as new plantings. The bonsai dispalys and meditation garden are remarkable.I always love the desert garden too and seeing it in bloom is special. This trip the roses were in full bloom and the colors and aromas completed the experience.My grandchildren have become quite adept at photographing blooms and exploring all that is new each visit.The tearoom is special for lunch and reservations are required, but it is a bit pricey. It's a buffet with wonderful choices including tea sandwiches (including smoked salmon and caviar), salads, hummus, fruit, and deserts, The scones that are brought to the table can be taken home if there are any left. If you walk around the structure outside you can see and smell where they grow their own herbs that are incorporated into the menu.The cafe is another option for simpler fare-salads, burgers, sandwiches, deserts.Check their web site and calendar for the twice/year plant sales, with docents to help with the choices at reasonable prices.If your feet hold out you can visit the museum and the book store, or keep these for yet another visit.",CarolB770
50,Beautiful gardens,"While not being very impressed by garden tours, a tour of the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens changed my mind. While the art collection is interesting, with the original Blue Boy and Pink Lady, the gardens are stunning. The recently renovated Japanese gardens are beautiful but I think the highlight was the extraordinary cactus garden with possibly hundreds of varieties of cacti in every size, shape and color. The location is in San Marino, a tiny community tucked near Pasadena. Doors opened at 12:00 pm.",bumihills2016
50,Perfect for a beautiful day of gardens and art,"If you want a break from the hustle and bustle of the city then this is your place. Plan to spend the whole day here as the gardens are extensive (the Japanese, Chinese, and desert gardens are especially enjoyable) There are several buildings on the property that house the library and art collections, not to be missed is the restored Beaux-Arts mansion of the Huntington's which contains an impressive collection of European art and furnishings. The Library collection (in the main exhibition hall) includes a Gutenberg Bible, Audubon's ""Bird's of America"" and other treasures.There are a few choices for eating here, but the best (and also the priciest) is the Rose Garden Tea Room. With its endless buffet of tea sandwiches, salads, cheeses, and desserts you can enjoy as much as you want while you take in the view of the rose garden. This is a popular lunch spot so it is good to make reservations. I would also suggest that you request the room at the back of the restaurant as it tends to be quieter than the room at the front (both rooms have their own buffet set-up so you don't have to jostle for food)Admission is $15 on weekdays, $20 on weekends and Mondays that fall on holidays, and free on the first Thursday of every month (but you have to make an advance reservation for that deal) They are closed on Tuesdays.",travellinjenna
50,Beautiful and serene,"I try to go here at least once a year to forget I am in Southern California. A fantastic garden with a Japanese style section which I particularly enjoy, but in general, it is big, spacious, lots of plants landscaped very artistically, and quiet! You can forget about traffic, freeways, noise, etc that come with living in Cali.",Finnagain57
40,Its worth the trip,The Garden is 2 hours away from where we stayed at but it was all worth the effort. The garden is serene with very nice landscape.

40,Has to be one of the top botanical gardens in the US,"A great place for nature and flower lovers. With the million dollar establishment of the new Chinese garden, it should make into one of the top gardens in the world. While its claims of fame were the Japanese garden, the Romanesque rose garden, and the desert garden, but it also has a nice indoor conservatory with all kinds of different climate plants (checking out the carnivorous plants using a magnifying glass is pretty interesting) and a museum with paintings and sculptures. Overall a top destination in LA.",gl0baltr0tter
50,Beauty and fine art surround you as you tour the gardens and museum!,"Between the diverse and exquisite gardens filling the grounds and the fine art and historical material inside the library, you could easily spend an entire day and not see it all! Must-haves: a good camera with extra batteries and a pair of comfortable walking shoes! We went on a Saturday and it was pretty crowded, especially in the restaurant at lunch time. Everyone was friendly and polite, though, so we didn't mind the wait. The Huntington is one of the Los Angeles area's treasures!",Lakemoosecap
40,Beautiful and Peaceful,I love the lush green gardens which is a great contrast to most of the dryer environments of Southern California. It is also a very intimate and quite place.

50,One of my favorites,"The Huntington Library is an Oasis of Art, Culture, Beautu and History. My favorite thing about the Huntington are the gardens. The gardens are divided into different sections by style and type. The garden, lawn and views from the terrace of the house make you feel like you have been transprted to a different more elegant time. Although the land falls gently before you there are no visible building in the view due to all the trees in San Marino / Pasadena so there is no reminder of the outside world while still seeing far in the distance. The new Chinese Garden is beautiful with many great little places to sit, talk and enjoy. The Japanese Garden is AMAZING! and will be reopened after a renovation. Many of the grounds may seem familiar because there has been a lot of filming there. I could write a lot more, it is an absolute gem and worth a full days visit. Plus the house and library contain the largest collection of English art outside of England including a very impressive full body life size portrait gallery featuring Gainsborough, Romney with the most famouse pieces being Blue Boy and Pinky.

50,Stunning Gardens and Art Collection,"The Huntington Library, Art Collection and Gardens receives star billing in my Dorling Kindersley and Fodor's Guide Books and it deserves it. We were one of the first through the door and one of the last to leave. We drove from Santa Monica and found the directions easy to follow. Parking was readily available and there was a short queue to get in. We planned what we wanted to visit in advance because there is a lot to see and it is all worthwhile.We visited the Library first and then the art galleries. The library has a world-class display of manuscripts and books and the most famous and interesting are well displayed. I was also fascinated by the Art Gallery. As a child I had an art book with pictures of ""The Blue Boy"" and ""Pinkie"" in it. I fulfilled a long-held ambition to see the original paintings at the Huntington gallery. This was worth the trip alone. However, the gardens here are fantastic too. As we are from England, a cactus garden is a gem only to be seen abroad. This one does not disappoint. It must be ten acres of varied cactus planting with paths through so you can appreciate the different vistas. Probably best to keep out of the midday heat here in the summer! There were also ponds, sweeping lawns with mature trees, a Japanese Garden (closed at the moment), a Chinese Garden and other well-kept areas. The huge greenhouse, full of wonderful plants, was also a highlight. The was lots of information in the greenhouse and, when we visited, children and families were enjoying the information provided here. The Huntington Collection is well-visited so it seems odd it has so few comments on Trip Advisor. We thought it was one of the best places to visit in the vicinity of LA and recommend it very highly.The only downside was the cafe. Cheap, largely unhealthy, fast food. This should be of a much higher standard. The Tea Room was fully booked and presumably booking in advance is best. This looks the best food option.The Gift shop and bookstore is also very good and staff are very helpful throughout the whole property.",BindiB
50,THIS IS AN ATTRACTION YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS WHILE YOU ARE IN LA!,"The Huntington Library in San Marino, CA (near Pasadena) has a wonderful collection of noteworthy manuscripts and artwork. The facilities of the former home of the Huntington family are as beautiful and alluring as the artwork. The Huntington's lived in the grand style of English Nobles and those former industrialists that built the ""Cottages"" in Newport, Rhode Island. Some of the rooms in the main mansion are larger than your average sized home.The Mansion and library facilities are surrounded by beautiful botanical gardens with many different themes. The gardens themselves are situated on more than a 100 acres. We spent a good hour viewing the gardens.Among the famous works on the property is BLUE BOY, widely recognized as Thomas Gainborough's greatest masterpiece. We spent almost one half hour just looking at this painting along with many other Gainsborough's. Also in the room is ""Pinkie"" by Thomas Lawrence. Unfortunately, my Blue Boy pictures could not be attached to this review.Check out photos of Blue Boy under Google Images.Other items of note include the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a copy of the Gutenberg Bible and numerous other folios and manuscripts.Come early, we did not allow ourselves enough time to see the entire property",cmschw@comcast.net
50,Absolutely delightful!,"We visited Huntington and found it to be so worthwhile! An oasis of peace yet full of interest. We really enjoyed the Cactus garden - the Japanese garden is currently closed for renovation but judging by the activity it will look stunning when finished, Allow yourself at least three hours to appreciate the gardens and exhibits. The interactive botanical displays are fun for all ages! The library and art galleries are also well laid out and informative. Don't miss this gem.",southerncrossscout
50,Loved it and plan to go again!,"I was on a two week business trip and several recommended that I go there. I met my cousin Becky and ... I loved it. I'm from Georgia so this was a perfect place to go and see plants that I'd have to drive hours to see.The gardens are endless and diverse (desert, Japanese, Chinese, rose garden, rain forest etc).My suggestons are the desert, rain forrest, Japanese. The library has original manuscripts including a Gutenberg Bible, Poe, Shakespeare, Dickens, Audubon. Onsite restaurant was moderately priced and tasty.Also, got to see the Blue Boy and The Pinkie and some ... somewhat hilarious famly art with poofy hats and odd expressions.",Jaime W
50,I love everything about this place...,"The gardens are endless and diverse (desert, Japanese, Chinese, rose garden, rain forest etc) the library has original manuscripts and letters you won't believe (Gutenberg Bible, illuminated manuscripts, Civil War docs, Shakespeare, Thoreau, Dickens, Audubon, Poe, and so much more), there's a main house displaying art, a garden conservatory with carnivorous plants, a children's garden that's something to see even for adults and, if you make reservations ahead, an all-you-can-eat tea. If you don't make reservations ahead, you can still buy pretty decent food either right behind the tea room or in the Chinese garden. There are also evening concerts and events from time to time and lectures during the day. One of the best we went to was a series of Edgar Allen Poe readings or scenes staged all over the garden at night for Halloween. We walked between them with flashlights. The head botanist also gave a talk about pumpkins which, believe it or not, ended up stealing the show. (It involved a chainsaw...)My only complaint is that I didn't learn until recently just how important their book restoration work is. There are many floors of temperature-controlled vaults underground filled with collections of rare books and art as well as the personal libraries of well-known people like the explorer Sir Richard Burton. It would be great if they occasionally offered tours of these floors...Anyway, you get the picture. You can go for tea, for a walk in some beautiful gardens, for a look at some extraordinary and rare printed material and paintings or furnishings.We first went there when our sons were little. Now that they are in college, this is the one place they still ask to go with us when they come home.",PhillyKid

Make sure to dress comfortably and wear very comfortable shoes because there is lots of walking but its at your pace. We went on a Monday (avoiding the weekend crowds) and it was well worth it. Stopped at different alcoves, pergolas & shaded benches just to reflect and take it all in. The mansions & buildings are now galleries (art, exhibits) of one kind or other. We were hoping to try the tea room that I had heard so much about but the wait (short staffed) was just too long & missed seeing the library & the rotunda - my reason to do a return trip! The staff & curators are just wonderful - very attentive and ready to answer all questions/inquiries. All in all it was a wonderful day - left there feeling serene & relaxed.",FayRayInlandEmpire

50,A mesmerizing experience,"Maybe it's because I am from cold and barren Michigan, but the gardens at the Huntington Library are simply beautiful. They have such a wide variety of species and micro-climates that the hours I spent there felt too short. I must admit that I was less exposed to the art and library collection since I enjoyed the garden too much.",Ckickert
50,A gem of a museum!,"From the library's Gutenberg Bible to the gorgeous camellias growing in abundance, this beautiful estate-turned-museum/library/gardens is well worth a daylong visit. I initially thought the $20 weekend admission fee was steep, but after a few hours on the grounds, I realized it was well worth every penny as I discovered one delight after another: a breathtaking folio edition of Audubon's ""Birds of America,"" vanilla, cinnamon and orchids growing in the conservatory, and Turner's ""Grand Canal"" in Venice. Set aside a day and go. You won't be disappointed.",christine1354
40,Hidden gem in LA,"I have discovered Huntington Library while staying in Pasadena, and got back again later.It's an amazing place, with many different green areas from all over the world. Possibly the most interesting is the cactus greenhouse, with many species you on't get to know easily. Not many people around (unlike Disneyland), definitely worth a visit",RC1Roma
50,"Beautiful Gardens, beautiful buildings and books.","What's not to like, the koi, the teahouse, the statue of Diana, the Colonial Furniture, Blue Boy and Pinky. I could go on and on, suffice to say, the succulent garden is just amazing.",CarpBooksFan
50,"Beautiful grounds, awesome collection... so many things to see","We have been coming here for years and it remains one of our favorite places in L.A. There are so many things to see it's hard to cover it in one day. There are many gardens with different themes. Chinese, Japanese, Children's, Rose, Desert gardens and the Tropical conservatory to name a few.... all amazing. We love to come here to see the different flowers as the seasons change. The permanent art collections and rare books/texts are outstanding. And then there are ever changing exhibits throughout the year. If you have time, come hungry and come for the afternoon tea in tea room by the rose garden. The all-you-can-eat/buffet style spread is quite delectable. FYI, in L.A., if hot tea is too much in our hot weather, you can always request iced tea with your afternoon tea. Reservation is highly recommended. At the end, don't forget to stop by the gift shop because it's full of pretty things. Definitely a highly recommended place to visit.",vacay2vacay
50,Spectacular garden and world class collection of ancient manuscripts,"I visit this garden as often as I can which was quite frequently when I lived in Los Angeles. Built with a railroad barons fortune in this elegant area of Pasadena, the mature gardens have a magnificant view of the snow capped San Bernadino Mountains on a clear day. You will never see such a perfect collection of cacti in the wild. After a rain storm the air in the Eucalyptus grove is transporting. The house is a classic robber barons palace with conservative but world reknown art. But the most important collection housed here is the library which has a Caxton bible amongst other rare texts. Lunch in the walking mall area of Pasadena is very pleasant.",ChristineMargaret
50,"An art gallery, library with many important texts, and beautiful gardens.","One of my favorite places to visit. From the beautiful gardens to the artwork and architecture, to the books in the library (which incudes many historically significant antique texts) this place has it all. Don't miss the new Chinese garden, the workers who built it and even the stones used in it were brought from China to keep everything authentic.",Slim S
50,One of the best venues I've seen in LA,This was such a surprise and a treat. The grounds are lovely and art collection is amazing. The library and museum don't open until 12:30 and they close at 4:30. We didn't get to see everything before it closed.We did make reservations for their afternoon tea. We scheduled 2:00 p.m. tea and if I had to do it over again I would've done it either closer to 12:30 (lunch) or 4:30 (dinner). It's $30/per person so for both of us it was $60 w/o the tip. I felt like we ate more than we really wanted because it was so expensive. I do recommend reservations.I wouldn't mind going back to the Huntington again to see what we missed.,Madelynn W
50,Absolute Beauty,"Want to take a stroll with that special someone? Bring her/him/it/they to the Huntington Library. Highly recommend getting there early and if you plan on going on a weekday just a heads up, lots of kids go here on field trips",Six_Finger_Deal
30,Not So Inexpensive,"Although the gardens and museums are beautiful, I find that the prices keep increasing.... I remember when it was free to get in and now it is is $15 for an adult on Weekday and $20 on a Weekend & Holiday.The food here is not inexpensive either and not very high quality.The gardens are beautiful, except where people have vandalized the cactus & bamboo by carving their names, initials, etc. in them.The paintings in the museum are world famous and recognizable.... Really wonderful art collection.....I know I won't be going there again any time soon unless I have someone visiting from out of state who is really interested in culture.... but then again I might take them to the L.A. County Arboretum or Descanso Gardens and the L.A. County Museum of Art instead.",Auntie-Nanuuq
50,Beautiful and relaxing,"I love coming to the Huntington Library with my wife and son. The gardens are beautiful and the fact that there are so many birds and squirrels makes for an interesting trip with my son. If you have children, the children’s garden is the place to be. It’s so interactive and really gives children the right start on learning about plants and their environment. Although there really isn’t a bad time to go, I would avoid going on the free day because it gets too crowded and you won’t enjoy the tranquility of the gardens. We have been going for many years and enjoy the staff as well. Joe, the security guard, is the best!! He always remembers our names and is one of the true gems of the park. We tell my son, “Lets get ready and go see Joe.” And he starts smiling. If you want to do something outside of the normal “LA” scene, this is the perfect place to come.",L V

The Japanese garden is NOT TO BE MISSED, and the various indoor gardens are remarkable. An hour or so will get you through the gorgeous Huntington home (library/museum) and then if you are really well-prepared, you will have made reservations at the tea-house for some great food (high priced but fun!) There is also a buffet around the corner of the tea house which does not need reservations but it can be VERY crowded, and has limited outdoor seating only. Perhaps not the best place for a day with children, but a lovely way to spend the day with a well-loved friend.",TamSelz

50,Wow!,I was overwhelmed by the largest collection of cacti that I have ever seen. It was incredibly beautiful. We had a docent who was very knowledgeable which enhanced our visit. A major wind storm a few weeks ago had caused great devastation. Sadly many large trees had been blown over and the remnants of several were still visible. The beautiful camellias were in bloom near the Chinese garden. We were able to buy Chinese food there and eat outside overlooking the pond on a warm afternoon in December. A perfect day!,passionate-gardener

Definitely wear walking shoes. It is a lot of ground to cover.",ldavis_65

Pick a nice sunny day in the spring: the gardens are just beautiful. Do not miss the Blue Boy painting.. it is just beautiful. If you do not have time.. skip the library section. Do not miss the rose gardens. The sculpture garden is also nice to see. Check their website to see what is blooming prior to your visit. The museum has an excellent website. Finally... check the museum store: I have found very interesting books: art, science... just a nice selection on these days that bookstores are dying away.",Luis R
50,Spectacular,"The gardens were an unknown for me, yet we have visited gardens all over US, BC and Europe. Beautiful gardens and excellent collections.

50,"Relaxation, education or entertainment",This place is amazing. I've had a membership there for some years (not any more) and have gone to several events from painting to gardening to performances and loved them all. They have a children's area now and the kids even loved the gardens. I wish they allowed picnics on the lawns but I understand that not everyone picks up after themselvs. With some planing one can organize fun activities for children - simple things like giving them the map to decide where to go or more involved things like having them find specific flowers/plants/statues or bringing their art books to draw. They have an excelent tea room (I'm not into that but it is worthwhile for those who are) and their museums are interesting and don't overload people. They also open their place free of charge to the public on specific dates. They definitely are part of the community.,alimariew

50,Cactus Garden is worth the visit,"The Huntington Library's cactus garden is worth the visit by itself. It has an amazing collection of cactuses and succulent plants. In addition there are an Australian garden (largely trees), a rose garden, and a Chinese garden. A Japanese garden was closed when we visited. There are lots of good walks and a variety of indoor exhibits. We enjoyed an exhibit of Sam Maloof furniture on a recent visit. Definitely worth a full day.",areview28
50,Amazing and Gracious - pretend you lived there.,"the staggering array of gardens at the Huntingdon - from the Shakespeare herb garden to the Victorian rain forest to the Prehistoric garden, the Japanese garden and the new Chinese pavilion are things that should take all day. But top it off with the library displays in the most complete library of American history there is, the American wing of Paintings, furniture and crafts, and the special exhibitions, the lectures and the concerts, the Huntingdon is a treasure of Pasadena. Go and join it if you can, because the privileges of membership are many. Go and have High Tea. Tour the porcelins if that's your thing. Go and have a chinese meal at lakeside. Just go when the rose garden is in bloom. It's a retreat into beauty and culture., and once it was built for a private owner. Just imagine that. If it was in Italy, it would be a Palazzo. If it was England it would be a stately country home of a Duke. In America, it's a nonprofit and open to the public.",Sharon D

50,Will go back for more,"The Huntington is a hidden treasure well worth a day visit. There is more to see than I anticipated. The grounds are beautiful and will be even better when the Japanese garden re-opens. Had a super informative tour (free) which is worth taking because there is so much to see. There are tours for both the garden and the house available although when I bought the entry ticket, these weren't mentioned. Just happened to get lucky and meet one of the guides (Big Ed) waiting to start a group. Wonderful landscaping for the garden lover and the art in not only the main house, but the U.S. building was uncrowded and displayed nicely. Interesting permanent collection is shown in the Library of scientific books as well as other famous works. The new Chinese garden is not to be missed. All in all a very special place worth the $20.00 weekend price of admission. Lovely gift shop. Didn't have time to enjoy tea unfortunately!",mary92651

Don't forget to take a gander at the Gutenberg Bible and all the other gorgeous rare books on display at the library!Once a month there is a free day (first Thursday of the month), but the tickets go the day that they open up.

That said, we will return to the Huntington for beautiful experience it was.",ZoeCostaMesa

30,"Lovely gardens, but the main attraction was closed for renovation.","I had an enjoyable time at the Huntington Library in May 2011. The grounds are lovely and well-kept and it was nice to be able to walk around on the grass - you don't find that in too many places in S. California. The desert succulent garden was huge and had a nice collection of plants. The library and European art gallery were very nice and I wish that the grounds were open longer to really be able to explore everything.I was really disappointed that the Japanese Garden is closed for renovations until 2012 and that part of the Chinese Garden is under renovation. When I originally researched our trip to the Huntington Library a few months ago, this information was not prominent on their website (but I do see that is now is posted on the front page). I was not aware of the garden closure until we stood in line to pay for the tickets. I guess they figure if you've made the effort at that point you'll pay to go in anyway . . . highly disappointing, especially because there is no price reduction for admission.",JTK_SD

50,"Botanical Gardens, an exquisite library & art collections, all in one beautiful place.","The Huntington is a fascinating place to spend a day, even if you don’t see everything it offers, the gardens alone will delight your soul. Picnics are not permitted, understandably, but the café serves light meals and drinks and I heard that there is a nice time-honoured tradition: English tea served in the Rose Garden Room, but I think reservations might be necessary for that treat. The art collections include American, British and French art and the library has about four million rare manuscripts and books. So for anyone who wants to see the gardens, the art collections and the library treasures, or some of each, I suggest you get there early and spend the day. It’s a magnificent place, beautiful relaxing parks, a recreation to the eyes, whatever part you decide to see.The library houses a rare 1410 manuscript of Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Canterbury Tales”, also known as “The Ellesmere Manuscript” after its former owner the Earl of Ellesmere. This work is complete and filled with luminous illustrations. It also houses the “Gutenberg Bible”, a 1455 Bible, apparently one of only 12 surviving copies printed on vellum by Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, who was the inventor of movable type. The chapter headings and colourful decorations were done by hand. We thoroughly enjoyed it.",Sylvia S

50,"Granny, this was better than Magic Mountain!","I visited the Huntington with my two granddaughters, ages 6 & 4 a day after we had been to Magic Mountain. They were enthralled as we walked down the shaded path to the Children's Garden-cavorting squirrels,flitting bird, floating butterflies. Then they went thru the child sized blue door into a watery heaven. Places to splash, to stand under cool mists, child sized mazes covered in beautiful vines & flowers-also a learning center w/just the right balance of science & hands on exploring. We had a treat at the cafe's shaded outside tables, then went thru a giant bamboo forest into the beautiful Japanese garden. We didn't have time to visit any of the museum exhibitions & at their age they probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much anyway, but we all absolutely loved exploring the grounds. If you are tired of hitting the tourist attractions and would like some peace and quiet and lots of room to roam and work off excess energy, this is the place! And the parking is free!",zasucon

We walked all over the gardens. They loved, as did I, the bamboo forest and waterfalls, the Chinese Gardens, the conservatory and the Children's Garden. Unfortunatly, the Japanese Gardens were closed when we visited. This is a beautiful area, well worth the cost. If I lived closer to the area I would get a membership and come weekly. There was so much to see and all so beautiful. My grandchildren loved all of the huge koi and the many bridges.

50,Splendid day trip,"A star attraction. The Huntington is a must-see in the LA/San Gabriel area. Now that they've finished the Chinese garden and the children's garden, it should draw more families.

If you have small kids, don't miss the childrens' garden - great topiaries and fountains!If you have school-age kids on up, reserve in advance for the English Tea. An all-you-can- eat buffet of lovely tea sandwiches and salads, and dazzling desserts, Ana Maria, our waitress, was very kind and made the whole experience even more special.The galleries and the library are of course world-class, and the gift shop is excellent.",gail r
50,Plan this for two days at least. Awesome grounds and museum!,"We came here on Wed, Dec 29, while on vacation in the LA area. We love this place so much that we are coming back for a 2nd day to see more what we did not see. We went to the Getty Villa, and I guess we got spoiled here and decided to come back here again. The staff is very helpful, and courteous. There was also a rock museum which is displayed for only that week, which we were very lucky to see. Very interesting, lots of history, beautiful gardens. Highly recommend this place.",kcbauman
50,Books and Botanicals,"If ever in So Cal, the Huntington is definitely worth your day. The botanical garden is extensive with very grand regional pantings. Cactus, Jungle, Chinese, Japanese, Australian, English and Water gardens each on a grand scale make up the grounds. I spent half the day in the gardens before even entering the Library and the Galleries. Definitely Dim Sum for lunch in the Chinese garden overlooking the lake. The Galleries and architecture although significant was a bit over the top with an emphasis on European Masters works and Early California works...the Crocker Museum in Sacramento has a much larger and defined collection of these works so the Huntington did not impress. However, the Library is amazing with works from the 1400's that catalog the evolution of thought in sciences, medicine, astronomy, botanica etc. These works were profound and awe inspiring...with equal illustration. I would go back and spend half a day in the Library, skip the galleries and see the gardens again.....maybe in Spring.",FastEddieBikeTours
50,Great collection of art and stunning gardens,I really enjoyed the collection of British portraiture and the ambiance that the house gave to the gallery. The gardens are well-kept and diverse. I really enjoyed my visit. Didn't get to see everything. I would spend a good 3-4 hours here.,jeffsmith09
50,Great Place for Toddlers,"My little one likes to wander around the Chinese pavillion and especially likes the children's garden. Bring a change of clothes as there is water here (wonderful on a hot day) and a child might come out soaking wet from playing in the fountains in the child's garden. The Chinese pavillion is beautiful, but looks kind of 1/2 finished (I think there are expansion plans in the works) My son also likes the ducks and koi fish that hang out in the Japanese pavillion.Especially wanted to write about the cafeteria. The food is pretty good...not great...good beef brisket sandwich and grilled chicken quesadillas. My son loves the corndog and cupcakes. Service is superb. I was having a hard time navigating my son, the food tray, and the stroller. The staff helped us to our table, helped us find a high chair, and replaced my son's cupcake when it fell on the floor. Eating outside on the patio, under the trees, is nice. The grill can get a bit backed up at 12:30.. Come earlier or later if you want to eat something from the grill. The menu has substantially improved over the last year. Management should be proud of how helpful the staff is here.",gretayesinia
50,Astonishing variety and depth in gardens and buildings.,"We loved the jungle garden with a small waterfall, the lily pond, and the impressive desert garden. And this was just one corner of the grounds and collections! The shop is also filled with a large and varied selection of quality books and objects. The cafe building could use some improvement, although the seating area under the trees was quite pleasant.",Lorinda S
50,A hidden gem with an amazing world class art collection and gardens,"The Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens is truly a hidden gem, located next to Pasadena in Los Angeles County, stay at the near by Langham Hotel which is lovely and very convenient.The gardens are lush and extensive, planted in different micro-climate zones, featuring plants and flowers from climates, such as the desert garden with cactus, tropical jungle, temperate zone, rose garden, superb Japanese and Chinese gardens etc. Superb, you can spend almost a whole day in the gardens alone.The Huntington Library is also amazing, one of the earliest editions of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, The Gutenburg Bible and countless examples of some of the most important works in the English language, with charming and very helpful volunteers on hand to explain items in more detail - fascinating. Adacent, there is an exhibition of science, with excellent interactive tools for kids to enjoy.Then, the highlight, the former home of Henry Huntington, now stuffed full of his private art collection, some of the best (mainly English) art I have seen in a single venue, utterly astounding. Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Canaletto, Wedgewood, Majolica, French Porcelin, it's awe-inspiring. Leave at least 2-3 hours to see it all. There are other galleries in the grounds too with visiting exhibitions.There is a self-serve cafe for a basic sandwich lunch and a tea room. Parking is free and easy.You must go, it's a wonderful day out.",JerseyBean007
50,"Incredible collections, spectacular grounds. Something for everyone!","Went to Huntington on a whim based on glowing recommendations by two of my friends who live in Pasadena. Little did I know that this place would be the highlight of my entire trip! The art, decor, sculpture, architecture, rare manuscripts, archives and gardens were amazing. What I appreciate it you don't get weary of looking at your 145th painting of the day. The way the property is broken up, you spend a little time in a variety of areas as you tour the grounds keeping things moving along. Yes, admission may be a little steep, but worth it, in my opinion.",AZExplorer2010
50,Wake up and smell the Magnolias,"They have a FREE day on the first Thursday of the month, but you have to get reservations the previous month which start being distributed on the first day of the month at 9am. They usually distribute quickly so you have to be on time. Then they will mail you the tickets. All for FREE. Parking is FREE too. You can get up to 5 tickets (children don't need one)I take my 2 year old almost every month (sometimes I don't luck out). We usually go see the Japanese Garden and he loves to look at the fish and ducks. Then we make our way to the Children's Garden. Kind of hard to find. It is behind the Rain Forest Building (you can go through it). Bring swimsuit for kids and shoes that can get wet. They have small water fountains that the kids can play with. He also loves the rainbow tunnel and the musical rocks.",socalpcktmemories
50,Spectacular,"My daughter and husband took me for my birthday. We had the ""high tea"" buffet at the rose garden. Pricey but delicious!The gardens are absolutely beautiful, and I just wish we'd had more time. We saw most of the gardens, and also the library (really fascinating) I wish we were able to visit the art collection, but not enough time.The next time we go out to visit our daughter in LA, we'll make a return visit to the Huntington!",Mindymorr
50,"lots of books, including science and art exhibits, beautful gardens","although it's 20 clams, it's a nice place,and plan 4-6 hours easy to see everything.if you go to the Getty go here the next day.",kbrown154
40,A true gem!,"The Huntington provides a perfect setting for the extensive art an historical collections. The botanical gardens are truly amazing, and are as beautiful as the art available to view. Great for families, and the staff was very gracious and accommodating.",UtahTravelsLite
50,Wish I lived here !!!,"This is worthy of an all-day visit. The collection of Art and old books is fabulous! But to me, the gardens are the high point of Huntington. I think its the largest, most comprehensive botanical I've ever visited. The gardens are in themes: Japanese, Camellia, Rose, Shakespeare, Herb, Tropical, and so forth. Ponds brimming with beautiful Koi, arched bridges, shade & sun, desert or jungle plants, its all here!! I liked especially the Sculpture Garden with its life size statuary of god, warriors, mythical beasts. I go to Huntington at least once a year, there is always something new.",sandytravelbug
50,Would go back everyday!,"One day is not enough. Whether you have any botanical background or not, it is an amazing place. During the week it is only open from noon until 4:30, but on the weekends it is open from 10am to 4:30. Different times of the year bring different exciting exhibits. The volunteers are helpful and will answer any questions you have. I just can't speak high enough of Huntington's!",jwh223
50,Favorite attraction in Pasadena,"This is a popular stop for a good reason. The grounds are lovely, and the exhibits are interesting. We really enjoyed our day there.",ATourist6
50,"A beautiful, relaxing, educational place","We visit South Pasadena a couple of times a year, and this is our favorite place to take our grandgirl and to go just by ourselves. There is a children's garden she enjoys; we enjoy the art. The Japanese Garden is world class; the new Chinese Garden is as well, though the plantings are not yet mature. We take care of quite a bit of Christmas shopping at the gift shop--excellent quality, variety. One trip there is not enough for us: get a membership if you are going to be in or near San Marino for a few weeks. The docents are knowledgeable; ask questions.",HondaDriver007
50,Plan a Full Day and Bring Comfortable Shoes...,"...there is a lot to see here and you'll miss much if you just take a tram tour.This multiple attraction contains both gardens and museums, the latter focusing on British Art (the famous ""Blue Boy"" lives here). The gardens are absolutely wonderful, the highlights being the exquisite Japanese garden and spectacular collection of cacti and desert plants.You probably will not be able to take it in in a single visit. This is, or should be, one of the top attractions in the LA area.",JohnTheBear
50,Love this place!,"I was born and raised in southern california and come to the huntington library about twice a year and will continue to do so! I love it here! The grounds are amazing, especially in the spring time. The art, plants, books and museums are wonderful also.I have been to the tea room buffet several times and have not been disappointed. The tea is great and the buffet is perfect for lunch. Although it does seem pricey....i think it is well worth the cost.Also as a person who loves digital photography, this is the perfect place to get some great shots!!",PearlCrystal
40,Gardens are magnificent,"This is a triad of: botanical gardens, library, and art galleries. I note that all the art galleries (I'm not sure about the European art gallery, though) were closed at the time for renovation until sometime in 2009, according to the signs. The library is separated into an exhibit (of Darwin, Shakespeare, and others) as well as another section for scholarly researchers only.However, this tourist locale is all about the botanical gardens. The Chinese garden is magnificent. Very large in scale, it is hidden behind the walls of what seems to be a Chinese styled building. Once inside, there is an intricate network of bridges and sitting areas surrounding a large pond. Also nice was a Japanese bamboo forest leading one down the steps of a pagoda.Desert botanical gardens tend to be my least favorite types of gardens; I just don't find desert life particularly interesting. However, this garden is truly the exception. Although I didn't prefer it to the Chinese garden or the waterlily ponds, I thought the variety of desert life was absolutely exceptional and stunning. I don't remember all the names of the various species there, but you really have to treat yourself to see some of the largest desert life exhibited anywhere. The Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona, which I visited a few weeks back, was very poor in terms of showing anything beyond the same varieties of cacti again and again.Overall a very refreshing visit to a beautiful set of gardens. I still think the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens are the finest I have visited, but they obviously didn't even have a desert garden, so if that's something you're interested in, consider coming here.Parking may be a bit of a challenge. The parking lot was relatively small and I came on a non-free admission day. The gardens offer free admission on a certain weekday in the first week of each month, to which you are required to obtain tickets and which are usually always sold out. I can't imagine what the parking situation must be like then. I think it's better to just pay the $15 admission fee than deal with hassles associated with free admission day.",san367
50,"beautiful gardens, nice tea room","My best friend (who I have known for 35+ years) was visiting from Georgia and I decided to surprise her with a visit to the Huntington Gardens and tea at the Rose Garden Tea Room. I looked at a lot of reviews before I decided on the Huntington Gardens.We visited on July 2, 2008 and I will say the day was very hot, I’m guessing around 90 or above. The gardens were beautiful. Our reservations at the Rose Garden Tea Room were for 12:45. About 10 minutes prior to our reservations, we went inside and asked if our table was ready. Even though there were empty tables, the hostess said we would need to return in 10 minutes to be seated. We went back outside (in the heat) and waited the 10 minutes. Upon returning there were now two hostesses. We were told we had to wait outside another 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Again there were empty tables in the dining room. I have to say that by now I was hot and tired. I looked at the hostess that had initially sent us back outside and said, “ No, it’s hot outside. You told me to come back in 10 minutes and we’re back.” Of course we did have to go outside and wait in the heat again, but were seated within 5 minutes.Once seated the experience was very enjoyable. Our server was great! She immediately came to the table and informed us of the daily tea selections. We made our selection (Strawberry Kiwi). She was prompt with the tea and the scones (cranberry and chocolate chip). While the scones were about two bites each, they were delicious, as was the tea. She made sure our pot of tea was always full.The tea buffet was excellent. There was a variety of sandwiches (cucumber, watercress, tarragon chicken salad, egg salad, smoked salmon, prosciutto with pear). There was also a pasta salad and a green salad. The buffet included pita bread, hummus, crackers, caviar, olives, an assortment of imported cheeses and fresh fruits. There were also sweets. Mini bites of lemon bars, pecan pie bars, brownie bites, chocolate mousse cups, fruit tarts and several varieties of cake/loaf breads.When our server asked if we wanted more scones, I remarked that only if we could take them with us. She returned with a basket of scones and a bag to take them home in. When I mentioned that I wanted to see if they had a particular flavor of decaf tea, she went and searched through all the pre-packaged bags to find the tea I wanted.They do allow children. There was a table behind us with three to four small children (I’d say between 6 to 12). The girls were very loud and did not use their indoor voices. At one point my friend and I turned around and looked at the mother. She finally got the hint and asked the girls to be quieter, unfortunately that did not last very long. Parents should remember that while exposing their children to new experiences, they should also remind their children of proper dining etiquette.Overall the experience was great and I would return. The hostesses are young, and I mean young (neither one looked over 18). They need more experience and charm so they do not “turn off” their guests before they are seated. The tea is a little pricey as you must pay admission to the gardens ($15 per person) in order to get to the Rose Garden Tea Room. The price of the buffet was about $25, added to the $15 admission makes for an expensive tea, but if you enjoy the gardens it’s a bargain.",SoCalCamarillo_CA
40,"Huge grounds, lots of walking with beautiful exhibits","Bring your walking shoes for this one, lots of ground to cover. The area is beautiful and lush with wonderful vegitation, historic statues and amazing architecture. The new asian gardens are masterfully built with intricate detail. Lots to see as long as you're into appreciating the beauty of nature and history.",youngster1979
50,GREAT Children's Garden,"We visited Huntington Gardens in February 2006 when the Garden was not yet fully installed. My sons (then 6 and 10) didn't want to leave. If you google ""Huntington Gardens Children's Garden CA"" you will find a page describing the garden. That page describes four elements around which the garden is designed: Air, Water, Fire and Earth. What I remember most is the Fog Grotto (part of the ""Air"" element). Fog, generated by misting sprinklers, fills a semi-enclosed areas so that you can't see, and then dissipates. My kids kept going in and out, over and over again. There were also pebble chimes, which occupied them for a long time making different sounds, and magnetic sand, from which you can make great shapes. I was intrigued by all the interesting plant shapes. This is a great garden. I've never been anyplace quite like it, and my boys didn't want to leave. We did walk around the rest of the Gardens. The highlights for the kids were spotting geckos/salamanders and the cactus area; for the grownups it was the Japanese Tea Garden.",Claire W
50,Beautiful gardens!,"This is a true gem -- the buildings are gorgeous, and the gardens even more so, and the space is designed in a way so that crowds really aren't much of a problem.Given that it is a garden, keep the weather under consideration for your visit: when we went, the winds were pretty high, so some gardens were actually closed off for special protection from the elements. The compound is quite big, so if you're traveling with kids or the elderly, it may also be helpful to prioritize what you want to see first.There's a really great special garden for kids, with plenty of things for kids to touch and play with, although there are several exhibits throughout the space that are also kid friendly.",lntrullin
40,Amazing Place to Visit,"Visited the beautiful Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical garden at San Marino, CA on May 27, 2007. There are different type of Gardens like Chinese garden, Japanese garden, French garden, Desert garden, Children's garden, Rose garden, Desert garden, Herb garden and lots more. There is also a free tour of the garden.The most I liked in this place is the Japanese garden and the Rose garden. The Chinese garden is still under construction and is expected to open up for public around mid 2008.Over all it is an one day event and beautiful place for people who appreciate nature. I have uploaded some beautiful pictures in my blog.http://picturewizard.blogspot.com/2007/05/huntington-library-pictures.html",srid123
50,Amidst Splendid Vegetation,"Amidst splendid vegetation,I enjoyed this less visited Southern California attraction. This art museum is very special-it specializes in British Portraiture-Gainesborough,Ramsay.Romney,and Reynolds. It also has fine Baroque paintings,delightful English landscapes(Constable),excellent American paintings,and a small,but fine collection of Italian Renaissance paintings.My personal favorites were;Gainesborough's""Blue Boy"",George Lambert's""Southeast View of Kirkstall"",Bonnington's""Venice"",Louis Gabriel Moreau's""View in Park of Saint Cleric"",Edward Hopper's""Long Leg"",and Master of Castello Nativity''s""Madonna and Child with Saint John,So by all means,come on out and enjoy this special place.",margatemensch2016
50,Beautiful grounds and a great museum,"My husband and I visited the Huntington Library in February 2007. There were some special activities going on to celebrate Chinese New Year, and we got to see the Lion Dance which was a treat.We went with a friend who has two children, so we spent a good bit of time in the Children's Garden, which they enjoyed. We also walked through the Japanese Garden and the cactus area.As difficult as it can be to tear yourself away from the gardens, the museum is definitely worth a visit too.",Kirkland_Traveller
40,Beautiful botanical garden,"I enjoyed my time at the Huntington Botanical Gardens. I went in February, and it was warm and sunny. There's free parking, but I advise to get there early; we got there at 11:15 and found parking no problem. The place is divided into different areas, and you can take your time strolling through them. It's not a wild garden, meaning everything is organized and sometimes cornered off and you can't walk through. In that sense, it's like a museum. There's no food allowed, but they have a tea restaurant and cafe. You have to make reservations for the tea, but the cafe is open to all. We ate at noon, which was perfect timing, as soon after that there were long lines and not enough tables for other people. Great place to spend a few hours, and even go to the galleries and library (but we just stuck to the gardens).",typome
50,Make Time for This,"The gardens are huge. The entrance fee is not cheap; so, this is a ""good weather"" trip for which you should allow an absolute minimum of two and a half hours.",HaveANiceStay
50,Even more to come,"Yes, everything in the review below is still true and there is more. First I want to mention the library exhibition hall which is my favorite: The library displays have been improved over the years, an original Gutenberg Bible (one of about 50 in the world) is still one of the highlights of the collection. You will find first edition Shakespeare, one of kind letters of famous Americans, etc. Don't forget to take a peak at the huge vault to see the size of the collection that is not on display.The unique thing about the Huntington is its combination of art, historic library collections, and the beautiful gardens. Currently under construction is a Chinese Garden which looks to be a bigger undertaking than the already existing and beautiful Japanese Garden.Insiders tips: Free on the first Thursday of the month (very crowded on the free day however). Although it is primarily an adult attraction, there is an excellent Childrens' Garden, and there are activities for Children. There is a cafeteria style ""Cafe"" and a reservations only ""Tea Room."" A typical museum gift shop and knowledgeable staff and docents throughout.",fromdelmar
50,"Amazing Mansion Home, Cactus Gardens, Rose and Japanese Gardens","Huntington Library is an amazing place for both those who love to wander through estate homes and libraries - amazing pieces of art including Gainsborough's Blue Boy and Pinky. You could spend hours enjoying the art collection; the mansion home furnishings....But there is so much more. The Japanese Gardens are one of the best -if not the best in the US - with its temple bell, the moon bridge and reflecting ponds with koi, the canyons with spring-flowering trees, stone lanterns and pagodas, and the Japanese house on the hillside across the lake. The Japanese house exhibits elements of traditional Japanese life.There are 150 acres and other spectacular gardens are the cactus gardens, jungle gardens, chinese gardens, Childrens Gardens, desert gardens, rose gardens, Shakespeare gardens (with great sculptures), and others.My personal favorites are the Japanese Gardens, Cactus Gardens, and Shakespeare Gardens.If you're lucky to get reservations (you need to reserve in advance) you can enjoy an all you can eat tea. Well worth it if you want to combine this delightful tour with a tea.The museum store is also quite good. All in all Huntington Library is well worth a visit. Its by the Pasadena/San Marino area. Its a place locals do repeat visits once they find the place.",mini
