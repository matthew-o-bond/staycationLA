40,Great Sunday am walk,"Walked up Westridge from Mandeville Canyon Trailhead and then back down via Sullivan Canyon. Total distance covered was 11mi.The trail is easy to follow - either via the fire road (25 up and 26 down in my case) or via trails that run up in parallel but more difficult terrain.I went up early on a Sunday AM. I got there via Uber but already hikers, dog walkers and trail riders had filled the parking. If you are driving - be prepared for this and perhapa parking some way off.The trail up was about 3.5mi. There were restrooms and a functioning water fountain at the ranger station at the top (a former Nike guided missile radar site from the cold war).I took the Sullivan canyon route down. One could have taken the Sullivan ridge route. This was 7 mi or so - the catching an Uber home.Trails are clear and not difficult - but proper should should be worn. There is no real shade so take water, hat etc.Great views and lots of (bird, lizard) wildlife for someone like me who is not from SoCal. So peaceful most of the time - path is shared with cyclists who were considerate and dog walkers.On the latter - we have the peculiar trend of bagging up dog waste and leaving it by the side of the trail. I cannot understand the logic of this but unfortunately it now blights so many trails near urban areas. Totally mad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmews
50,Great hike,It's definitely one of those hikes that you're safe to do it alone too. The views are amazing all around you and the hike can go on around Santa Monica mountains where you have the view of the ocean as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
40,Nice hike,"An old fire road that's an ideal place to stretch the legs (both human and canine). Just keep an eye on dogs (and them on a leash) especially at dusk as there are stories of coyotes that like to snack on small dogs. It's got a mild grade, so bring water, and hold onto your hat as it gets windy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552randys
40,Great Hiking (and Cold War History) Just Above Los Angeles,"Really nice place for a hike. The address on Mulholland Drive brings you to a gravel fire road that goes up to the Nike Tower at San Vicente Park. The road is wide, so there is plenty of parking, but you can just continue driving all the way up to the base of the Nike Tower. The tower is now a public park but was used as a radar station in the Cold War. From here you can hike or bike the trail or fire road about a mile or so and get terrific views of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean. When I was there on Saturday, there were only a few dozen other people. The silence on the trail is amazing. Trails are well maintained and easy for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princeton_Man
40,Best legally off-leash trail in LA,"I'm always trying to find ways to give my dog a good run. So hard to do in L A where we have very few options- Booh! - unlike Santa Barbara or Orange County.Anyhow, when I want my guy to get a good workout, I take him to the Westridge Trail in Brentwood. We usually start from the bottom of the trail, not the Mulholland side. That way, the return is all downhill. You can do all 4 miles each way or stop whenever it fees like you've had enough. It's lovely this time of the year when it's cool and green and the views are great.The only reason why I don't give it full 5 stars is because there is no shade to speak of and gets very hot in the summer. if you want to do the hike in the summer and you want to make sure your dog doesn't overheat, I suggest you take him at the crack of dawn or after sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathykE5358AC
40,Mountain biking or hiking,This is an excellent area for mountain biking. There are very wide trails for groups or single tracking for more experienced riders. Use google maps to pick the best path. The same for hikers. These are very easy to moderate trails with great views if you take the path going south west.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denandren
40,Great for off-leash hiking with canine companions!,"The trail head can be a little hard to find at the very end of Mandeville Cyn, weekdays and mornings are the quietest times. You can choose your level of exercise between walking the dirt fire road that more or less goes around the mountains, or the mountaintop hiking trails that will give you a serious workout. I recommend taking the hiking trails up and the fire road back to your car. Great public park that's dog friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattm54
30,Dog friendly and an easy hike for families etc.,"Don't leave your bag of dog poop along the trail---It's in a bag so please pack it out!It's one of the very few off-leash hikes anywhere in Los Angeles. Let's not wreck it.My dog and I hike this easy 7.8 mile firewood each week.Not much elevation and it's a fire road so any sorta walking shoes will work.It's one of the very few off-leash hikes anywhere in Los Angeles. Let's not wreck it.HIkers/walkers/runners, dogs on and off leash and trail-bikers all out getting exercise and enjoying nature. Good for solo, groups and families. Gets crowded like all LA trails on the weekends...We always hike during the week. Parking is easy although crowded on weekend.Other trails are closeby including sullivan as well as mullholland that leads allover the place!Lets keep our trails beautiful and pick up trash if we see it/walk by itEnjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,awesome hike at Westridge-Canyonback Wilderness Park,"We hiked Westridge-Canyonback Wilderness Park with family and their 2 dogs over the weekend.The trails ranged from moderate to steep and challenging and the views were spectacular, you can see 360 degrees of the Los Angeles area.There are lots and lots of families and dogs and the mountain biking looked awesome.You can go almost 8 miles I believe....we opted for 2 in and 2 back.I would recommend a hike here for views alone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJohnson97
