50,"UNIQUE, THATS IT","The LAX Theme Building was built in 1961. I've been in lots of airports, but none is as recognizable as LAX because of this building. Eat there and watch Southern California rotate before you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdroad
40,Rendezvous with my wife,"Walking of my United flight at gate 74 walking towards baggage looks way different, newly remodeled since my last visit. Some new restaurants and some old familiar ones remodeled as well.At this point you just want to get your bags and get going. Itâ€™s been a while since my last visit here and it was still under construction.The United Club had moved, different location and up higher as well I am told.Baggage Claim (BC) is closer now with a more direct route walking above over looking the new remodel ticket counters and security level below. No more security up by the bridge to parking lot.And Baggage Claim is modern after all these years and you do not mind waiting for your bags as much. The employees must really like to work there now. It use to be a hectic mess, I sure the still have their challenges as there still a little construction going on.LAX still send you out into two lane of arrival pick up and a small narrow island to stand for shuttle, buses, and vans and four or five lanes of exiting airport traffic.We all are all looking left for our small letters signs van to arrive peering around the large in the way pillars. And watching behind and in front of you so we or anyone else gets run over.All and all an easier way to arrive in LAX, thank you United. Look forward to your finished product.Now, I am watching for the van to meet my wife at the Marriott hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bcooking
