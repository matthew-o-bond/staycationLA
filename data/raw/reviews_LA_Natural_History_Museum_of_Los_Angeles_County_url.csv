40,Great place for dinosaur lovers.,"If you ever thought that dinosaurs did not exist, this is an ideal museum to visit with the family and you can find real bones of dinosaurs, reptiles, and many more animals! The cost of entry is very accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianasmith
40,Great museum for dinosaurs,We went during the Easter Holidays so it was very busy. The exhibits were very interesting and the highlight was the dinosaur room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
50,Very Educational,"There are a lot of interesting stuffs, including many dinosaurs' bones. I can spend a whole day here without boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suda-sir
50,So many interesting things to see.,"The story of Los Angeles exhibit is amazing, very informative. The animal dioramas are classic and the gem room is always fun. The dinosaur displays are terrific. Discovered the outdoor botanic garden I'd never seen before. Just a great day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean92802
40,Very good natural history museum,"I visited the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County with my husband and my brother during our visit to LA this past week. My husband is a big fan of natural history museums (rock nerd), but they're not always my thing. I found this natural history museum much more interesting than the average! Yes, it has all the normal stuff (dinosaur bones, rocks/gems, animal diorama halls), but it had some surprises, too! There are nature gardens! When we visited (February 2020), there was a VERY small exhibit called ""Natural History of Horror: The Science of Scary"" that explored the inspiration for some of Hollywood's classic horror/sci-fi movies (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Creature from the Black Lagoon) - small but so interesting and fun (through April 19, 2020). I also LOVED their permanent exhibit ""Becoming Los Angeles,"" which explored LA's history. As someone visiting LA, I loved this exhibit - but I think it would really appeal to locals, too! Definitely the highlight of the visit for me! We parked in the parking garage near the California Science Center (about $12, I think) and admission to the museum (without any IMAX movies) was $15 per adult. I enjoyed this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
40,You feel you are onset from movie,"Huge many children on weekends, so much to see, on train line.beautiful building, not just dinosaur bones much social history of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmic01
40,Very worthwhile!,Spent a very interesting 3 hours in the museum. It was well laid out with informative displays. Really enjoyed the outside garden area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyMaclure
50,Great museum,"We had a fantastic time here at the museum! The exhibits were awesome! There is so much to see. They charge admission plus $12 for parking. You also have to pay extra for certain exhibits. Food is pricy, there are also vendors outside that sell mexican corn, hotdogs, chips and ice cream. The entire museum is well maintained(clean) both inside and outside. They have FREE museum day, check their website for more info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcT3983ND
50,This is a great museum,"We spent a few hours here investigating, and this museum is really good for its size. The displays are put together really well, and it’s appealing to all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570nickm
30,Good way to spend a day,"Good way to spend a day 3-5 hours, especially for the kids. The building itself has a beautiful domed stain glasses window. Exhibits included dinosaurs, animals, the Lab (see rats, snakes etc), two movies on the ocean and dinosaurs (pay extra) and how Los Angeles developed thru time (which was interesting). There is a cafe but as expected you can’t eat/drink in the movies or exhibit. If you have a late flight out and are looking for a way to spend a few hours, this is a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rikmak
40,Pretty good for what it is,"I've been to many natural history museums and this one is not bad at all. Of course the dinosaur fossils are the ""stars"" here but the exhibition about the history of LA was also quite interesting. There was a long line at the door so it's a good idea to have some kind of advance ticket before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Birthday afternoon,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday! Yes, we are in our late 30s but we had so much fun here. I would recommend it for kids as well for adults. We spent here about 3 hours wandering around and seeing so many great things! You learn so much about the earth! Go visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinbR3840WS
50,Best day of fun for the entire family.,We have season passes and go a ton when the butterfly exhibt comes to town from March to Sept.. The events for the kids are wonderful. They have live animals for the kids to see and some times touch with a guide present. Lots of learning and fun place and its next to the Science Center that has Imax theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreanicu
40,Decent trip.,I enjoyed my trip to the natural history museum. There was lots to look at we hardly got to it all. It was a little hard to move about the museum though. Not much direction and you seem to be going back and forth to get to different areas. Needs a better flow I guess. Still very cool and the kids enjoyed it. The price is great and you'll even find good deals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
40,Interesting history of L.A.,We went to this museum and enjoyed this experience in about 5 hours. My daughter enjoyed the dinosaurs as well as the other animal displays. The gems were quite a specimen as well. Worth the money to see the exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reezerrandy
50,Informative and interesting Museum,Very interesting and informative the history of LA exhibit was wonderful!!! Also the staff was friendly I left my phone in the bathroom and a security guard found it he was very helpful! We enjoyed our visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertapH7459ZZ
50,The genealogy of species...,The most impressive thing about the NHMoLA’s approach to presenting its analysis to a layman audience like myself is it’s genealogical approach. How Michel Foucault would have been proud. The museum perfectly charts the seismic temporal events (man made or otherwise) of the United States and its territory and its impact on fauna and flora. The avian collection is surely amongst the best in the world. With USC just over the road and a fantastic public transport system all around: if I were a local Los Angeleno kid I would be filled with hope by this space. I actually visited before heading to the Memorial Coliseum next door to watch the Rams v Ravens. Since I first visited America 15 years ago I’ve always felt a strange feeling - probably as many Geordies do - that I never really need a map to guide me around this country. It was a day that was an exemplification of that very feeling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,Brilliant dioramas,"The Antarctica dinosaurs exhibition was interesting and informative, opening up a continent that we hadn’t associated with dinosaurs and their discovery therein.Next up was the Hall of African Mammals and here began the striking dioramas that exhibited the great animals in their natural environments.This continued with the fascinating American exemplars. Grizzly bears, grey wolves, moose, bison and musk ox were shown to fine effect.American big cats were tremendous. Cougar, lynx, bobcat and jaguar stood out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Great place to keep children occupied,This is an amazing place to keep children occupied. A lot to do and to see. My kids 3 and 6 year old loved it and did not want to leave. The outside area is also nice. They have an affordable place to eat offering good choices of food including organic.Make sure to stop at lab in the garage level. They also have lots of different exhibits you can purchase separately but even if you do not buy them there is a lot to do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katriel_D2014
50,Great museum,Exceptional exhibits. Definitely worth it. Great learning opportunity about the earth and its past wonders,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medefrank
40,Great stop.,A great stop for a educational and relaxing walking around. Many different exhibits.Cafe had the best pizza in town!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medhat100
50,Great place,"I went with my son, who is 7, and he loved it here. There are a tons of things to see and explore and a tons of dinosaurs bones. If you are into dinos this is the place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
50,Excellent place to keep the children entertain.,My kids had a great time with all the exhibits. Full of information they learn a lot about dinosaurs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/138adrianam
50,Great place for dinosaurs fans,Very good collection of dinosaurs bones. There is animal encounter at the basement which is a bonus and is excellent for kids. Don’t expect the 3D movie will be of very high visual quality but it’s educational. Highly recommend you to join the guided tour. Good food served in the cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AYKLeung
50,We went for the 3D movie about the oceans and the exhibit on exploring Antarctica and the dinosours discovered there.,"The museum is a gem. It is in a vintage building that has been totally modernized. We were especially interested in the Antarctic exhibit and the interactive parts, as well as the dinosaurs discovered there, how they are excavated, what life is like on an Antarctic station, etc. The exhibit is suitable for all ages, with interactive components. It is on the same museum campus as the Science Museum, but is less crowded. We were able to take our time and enjoy the exhibits. I would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royalp2014
50,Truly worth having a membership,Visited with my daughter and her children. They went off to exhibits that interested them while I was busy with an exhibition on the history of LA which in itself was worth the visit. Afterwards had a break for a cuppa in the ground level cafe. Then together we took in a 3D film on the oceans before having a picnic lunch in the museum's courtyard. A visit to the Lab could have gone on for hours. The kids were entranced. Finished off at the museum shop which was a bit heavy on dinosaurs and kids' stuff and weak on adult fare. But what the heck. I didn't come to shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
50,A very classic worthwhile museum to visit,"What a classically beautiful museum to visit, truly a place for people of all ages.The building itself is solidly spectacular.Easy parking, although you do have to pay for it separately from your admission ticket.Amazing dinosaur exhibits with detailed, thoughtful and engaging written explanations.The minerals and gemstone collections from all over the world were beautiful and nicely displayed.Loved the old fashioned, remarkably detailed animal dioramas.We went to a 3D movie about the oceans and sea life. Beautiful but kinda short movie for the price of the extra ticket. Be aware, especially as a parent if you are with little kids, the movies are not included in the general admission ticket and they cost extra.We had a snack in the cafeteria that was a pleasant break. The cafe was clean and spacious. The food was good and seemed fairly priced.Lovely outdoor gardens to stroll around. There was space outside for kids to run around and blow off some steam.Several well placed gift shops that had some pretty sweet museum inspired merchandise especially their amazing collection of dinosaur stuff!Really a lovely place for people of all ages to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieo593
50,Dinos,"very educational experience for everyone, kids especially. We went in with great expectations after scouting their website and they were exceeded. Many great exposition pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rory_KR
40,Great Natural History Museum,"I visited this summer (August 17) and again today, October 5 - the first time with family/kids, the second time alone. I really enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit (standard, not antarctic- will see another time), the wildlife in LA exhibit (check out the cute rats!), the history of LA exhibit (great succinct captions), and the outdoor gardens (the kids dipped their feet in the water features). Today I paid an additional $5 to experience the spider exhibit (limited number of people are authorized entry and can experience a small area with plants and spiders- which are out in the open). When I visited with kids, we ate in the cafe (pretty standard/ok museum food options- I had a veggie burger). I enjoy the museum and plan on visiting again in November. I'd recommend allotting at least a few hours for your visit and if you've got the energy for it, visit the neighboring California Science Center (free!) afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cocotastic8888
50,I could have stayed longer,What an outstanding museum with history of evolution in general and also of Los Angeles. I truly appreciated the outdoor garden with numerous plant types including an edible garden! Reasonable price and so much to see and learn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulacV8645CP
50,Very nice !,"The first Tuesday of every month and every Tuesday of September are free entry. You will have to pay for parking, which if I remember correctly, was $12 . This place has AC and was a great break from the summer heat in LA. There is so much to see , so go early. If you’re rocking prescription sunglasses, bring your regular glasses, because some exhibit rooms are really dark. Exhibits included dinosaurs, birds, a room for Mayan, Aztec, and Incan artifacts, regional mammalian rooms, and a wonderful gemstone exhibit. Highly recommend this spot for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrignardRxn
40,Exploring Natural History,"This is a well laid out museum which has all the basics : dinosaurs, wild animal models from different geographical locales. We were there with our grandchildren and they had fun in the hands-on sections. The price of admission was a lot when you do all the exhibits. The butterfly exhibit was an extra premium as was the exhibit on dinosaurs in Antarctica. Expect to spend about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorR
40,Nice way to spend an evening,"I went to the NHM looking to scape from LA’s hot weather and it was one of the best decisions I made, there are a lot of things to learn about dinosaurs and animals in general, and the food inside wasn’t bad either. There are included guides with your general ticket and the staff is kind and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieavilar
30,Expensive for what it is,"Disappointed considering the amount paid to park and the entrance fees ($24 adult, $12 child and $12 parking so was $132 For 4 adults 2 children).Paid to include the Antarctic dinosaurs.So there were a lot of dinosaurs and good displays of fossils. Not overly 'wowwed' by the mammals. Found the L.A. history interesting.Minerals and gems - very good display.Spent about two and half hours there.Scope to spend more if adults only but kids had enough by then.Disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardBSutton
40,Wonderful museum!,"Stopped by as I promised my kids to show them dinosaur bones and they were not dissappointed! Lovely museum and not overly busy when we went. Educational which was great for the kids amd a couple of interactive areas for the kids to draw, dig for dino bones etc. They also had a butterfly pavillion when we went, had to pay extra nd you only get 1/2 hour in there, but was a nice visit for the kids. If i am in the area would visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family8travels
40,Very good exhibits,"My wife and I were here on a weekend, specifically coming for the Antarctic Dinosaurs Special Exhibit. I had never seen an exhibit of these dinosaurs so was very curious as I do enjoy reading and viewing dinosaurs since I was a little kid.We had not been to this museum in about 30+ years.First, when we arrived at the 'normal' parking area for the Museum, it was full, so we had to drive a bit before we found another Museum parking lot. Since it's in the USC and Coliseum area, it was quite busy and understandably about the parking situation. We were a bit surprised by the $12 CASH parking fee. We then had to walk about 4 blocks to the Museum itself.The exterior building itself wasn't anything outstanding. We then paid the $9 special exhibit fee (@ $9.00 each) in addition to the admission (@ $15.00 each). There were NO senior or Veteran discount.We optd not to see any of the other 'cost' exhibits as we had pretty much seen these in other museums. (We have been to Chicago's Field Museum many times, as well as NYC's American Museum - both of which I thought were much better), as well as other museums including Berlin.The Dinosaur exhibit was excellent. I would highly recommend it. It had a lot of detailed explanations of the various exhibits and displays. We spent the most time here.We also saw the minerals exhibit as well as the Birds exhibit. Both were interesting but the areas for these exhibits seemed small.After that, we primarily wandered around the African and North American Mammals exhibits. It really wasn't anything extraordinary, but it was good.After the Mammals exhibit, we then felt we had seen enough and wanted to leave to avoid the rush hour.All in all, I would recommend this Museum, esp. the Antarctic Dinosaur exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8522EAleec
50,A great museum with a nice mix,I am a big fan of natural history museums. So I was very happy to have a chance to visit the one in Los Angeles. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.There is a nice mixture of traditional displays as well as some very interesting educational areas. We truly loved the traditional taxidermy displays showing wildlife in very realistic settings.At the same time the lower level education center had a wonderful mixture of displays including live animals. The spider cages were unique and fascinating. The building itself is grand and the museum is very large. From dinosaurs to less visited bird displays a bit off the beaten track there was plenty to see and the crowds were modest in many areas.Overall a great visit for those interested in science and a chance to visit one of the exceptional museums in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
30,Not to bad,I won't say it's bad but compared to the Museums in DC I was pretty disappointed. Guess all places can't be Smithsonian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josigoes
50,Excellent Museum,Spent another day at Expo park visiting the Natural History Museum. This museum has something for everybody and is an excellent day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8357ECalang
50,Classic Museum!,Have been coming here for years and really recommend it if you want to learn more about LA and California. I can spend hours here and I love the special exhibits they have sometimes. It's not too expensive and good for people of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRamos904
50,Loved their dinosaur bones collection,"They have a nice collection of dinosaur bones inside. Base on what I saw or know about this place, I was targetting their Antarctic Dinosaur exhibit because I wasn't sure what else to see. But you can see lots of other exhibits (dinosaur, animals, gems, history of LA, and other interesting mammals) even without paying for their special Antarctic dinosaur exhibit.Also, take note that even though NHMLA is right beside California Science Center, they have different parking areas. Both of which charges USD12/day. We were planning on doing 2 museums in one day, but we ran out of time, and the parking areas are actually far apart.We spent only about 1.5 hours here, but could easily spend more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyeson
50,Nice place,"Were here with friends and totally liked the place . Worth a visit just to know everything about LA , and spend a good time !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaDavidova
50,"Big, interesting, many dinosaurs","Big, interesting, many dinosaurs.Kids liked it.Dinosaurs show.Lots of walking.Other interesting areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamonFP1
50,After 12 years!,"After 10 long years, I finally decided to come visit again.A few tips:1. Parking is $122. Free for la residents between 3pm to 5pm3. Would suggest bringing a sweater, some sections are cold.4. Would suggest skipping out on the 3D films, not worth the money5. Bring a water bottle. They have special sections to fill em up with water.6. Expect to be here at least 5 hours.7. Would suggest bringing either a charger or preferably, a portable charger as there are sections where you won't get service and battery will begin to drain mad fast unless you choose airplane modeExperience:I had a really really wonderful time. The customer service here is phenomenal and kind. They actually made me smile many times and genuinely sought to help out for your best interest. Would highly suggest the butterfly exhibition, that was freakin awesome! This place is a MUST for dinosaur and animal lovers. It had some interesting pieces on culture and humanity as well so it definitely has expanded quite a bit. Will most definitely return, I can't wait!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight
50,Dinosaurs !!,I took my students on a field trip this spring. They loved the exhibit on city wild life. They were fascinated by the mineral and dinosaurs too. They couldn’t get over how big the bears really were either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,Beautiful,"Can't stress it enough how amazing this place is. This is our cultural treasure and we should cherish it. If you haven't been or haven't been since those middle school field trips, then take a trip to remind yourself of the wonders that the museum holds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReecoFire
50,A bit of history,A very large museum take you all day to see around it lots to see and do there is a small restaurant in side for a spot of lunch .They also have a butterfly part where you can see them flying around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404
40,Great way to beat the heat!,"Lots of cool things on display, and loved that they have the animals in displays that replicate their ecosystems. I’ve been here before with my friend and we somehow missed 1/4 of the museum (the birds, shells, and dinoLab) so be sure to use the map they provide on entrance. I do wish that there was more on marine life (especially considering that over 50% of life is found in the ocean) but overall a nice day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiasharks
30,3D short films,"I went with my daughter on a Saturday, of curse, she went like, I already came here in my school trip. 🤦‍♂️ for her and my ticket was like $42 with 1 entry for a 3d short film. I was planing to bring my son in another weekend and that is why I got the 1 year membership. $ 125 for 1 year includes 2 adults and 4 kids. unlocks all the activities in the museum, but you need to ask for tickets at the entry. it includes La Brea Tar Pits and Museum too. if you are planing to go with 2 adults and 2 kids to at least 2 museums is better to buy the membership. that is my recommendation. oh! and since my daughter knew the place already, she was more entertain with the 3d short films. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noemorales
40,Great bug fair was surprisingly different.,"I went for the Bug Fair which while it had some expected moments like face painting, it also had some really fun moments like insect chef lectures and live specimens for sale. I was actually impressed. I would recommend it as something really different to see and experience.They also had their traveling exhibit Antarctic dinosaurs open. I am sad to report that this wasn’t nearly as good as their permanent installations. And wasn’t worth the extra $9.Some of the newer exhibits like nature lab are delightful and beautifully designed. Make sure you don’t miss that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redurne
50,Yes!,"Be sure and spend some time seeing the whole museum and whatever special exhibits they have at the time. (The butterfly pavilion is awesome.) The whole family will love this place, and if you have time left in the day, go next door to the Californian Science Center and see the space shuttle Endeavor!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless730216
50,Great time in Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.,The museum has very nice and interesting exhibition of dinosaurs and various animals. There are 3D movies and a lot of permanent exhibits with lots things to see. We had a great time. It's great for all ages. The building itself is a “work of art” in amazing park and gardens. Don't miss spectacular Butterly Pavilion with tons of different species. I can highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdenek2013
20,Some rude employees,"I don’t normally give reviews but I have to give one now. Overall it’s a beautiful place. Very educational, both of my children loved it. But what I did not like was the rudeness of a good number of employees that work here. It’s almost as if they’re tired of having to deal with the general public, especially little kids. One snapped at my ten year old because he held up a ticket to her. This was the entrance To the Arctic dinosaur exhibit. I really wanted to say something. But I did not want to exacerbate the situation or make my children uncomfortable. These people need more training , or a more thorough screening process during the hiring. They need to love children in order to work here, or at least pretend to like them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdZ161UW
50,Educational day,"I loved going to this museum. I only added one of the special exhibits but it was well worth it. You learn a lot about how L.A has changed over time and awesome dinosaurs as well. Can't pass that up at all. Great for all ages,groups, or just a solo day on the town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiesadventures86
50,Great fossils,"Cool and informative paleontology exhibits. I learned lots about T. rex, and the dinosaur eggs and fossils of skin impressions are interesting and unusual. I peeked in on the Becoming Los Angeles exhibit (more history than science) and the North American Mammals exhibit (boring dioramas). The Antarctic Dinosaurs special exhibit was OK—some cool fossils but mostly about how explorers get to and work in that environment and with a lot of kid-focused stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcm7r
30,"If you can't get to the NHM in NYC, then worth a look","Spend an hour and 1/2 here. Expected to see more, having been to the Natural History Museum in New York. Worth a visit unless you plan on NYC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAKL
30,A little bit boring,"We visited this museum with high expectations, but we went home with a stange feeling. We payed 15 dollars for the entrance, but three times in the museum we had to pay 6 to 9 dollars to see individual exhibits. If we wanted to see the dinosaur exhibition, we had to pay 6 dollars more, if we wanted to see the butterflies, we had to pay 9 dollars more and if we wanted to see the 3D movie, we had to pay 6 dollars more...We didn't got a chance to buy tickets to all three exhibitions when we bought the admittance tickets, that was not acceptable. The exhibitions we saw were fine, but we wanted to see the rest - but to pay 15 dollars for the entrance and then 21 dollars more for just three exhibitions? no way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina-Magling
40,Dinosaurs rule,"The Dinosaur exhibition rooms range from very good to the truly very excellent. The science of life and then extinction is well explained and the all-important exhibits - the fossil skeletons made from fossils of multiple animals - for once show you things you've always wondered about. There are dino activity rooms for younger children, and interactive areas for older children. Another absolute highlight was the Butterfly Pavilion. The butterflies are utterly charming, and the attendants quite knowledgeable. Lots of photo opportunities! More disappointing was the African Mammals room. While the exhibits of the animals themselves are excellent, with each type placed in a natural setting based on a real place (eg Tanzania waterhole) the explanations always focused on the male of the species (except for the lion) and with little overall information about the animal or the context of its life. This is an older exhibition and it shows in how it communicates to the visitor. The cafe - please, install an espresso machine! The other aspect of the visit that was good, is the building - doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside the original and very historic marble and stone rooms with their soaring ceilings and tall windows and brass fittings are impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outstealinghorsesJM
50,Fantastic Visit,We spent quite a few hours looking around the museum which was wonderful. The staff were helpful if you asked them anything. We also saw the Live Butterfly Santuary. Really enjoyable time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsJC2013
50,Highlights are dinosaurs and African and North American wildlife.,It’s a big museum with plenty of animal dioramas and prehistoric skeletons! Two halls are dedicated to North American wildlife and one to African wildlife. Traveling exhibits and another highlight!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4stevemandy
40,History Lights Up,"My family and I enjoyed our visit to the museum. The exhibitions were astounding,especially the dinosaurs. We walked away from the experience with more knowledge and respect for all the work that goes on behind the scenes. I was led to believe that the admission was free from a website regarding the museum, but found out that it was not true. The cost for one adult is $15, while children and students are $12. That was the only negative aspect of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilhF1299SI
50,Great Experience,My kids loved walking around looking at everything- lots of information in a very child friendly format. We were able to use our passes from a different/affiliate science center to get in.Lunch in the cafe was good but pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quixb
40,A Great Day Out,"I visited the Natural History Museum with my two Daughters in February 2019 on a rainy day during our 10 day holiday. I was shocked how expensive it is to get in, compared to our Natural History Museum in London which is free (and much more to see). Nevertheless, it was a great way of spending the afternoon, with lots to see. I especially enjoyed the section on P22, the mountain lion roaming the Hollywood Hills a few years back, as well as the live animals at the end of the exhibition and the 3D films (which we paid extra for). The cafe was pretty good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jalapenojo
50,"Great collection of dinosaur bones, taxidermy critters, gem stones!","This place is huge and has so much it's hard to recap it all. Amazing dinosaur bones, the hall of North American and African mammals was amazing. The mammal skeletons were amazing. I highly recommend this. Buy tix online before you go, it's less expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathert612
50,For 3 people it is like $50,"Best natural history and science museum and a great experience, very informative, and interesting. It's a huge museum of like alot levels of artifacts, animals, art, photography, and information on all prehistoric and living species, and vintage items too. They have little interactive things you can do might cost alittle but worth the experience and It's definitely worth the price and they even have food and drinks to eat there as well. Great for kids and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belliago37
20,Meh,"This museum is pretty small. We enjoyed the movie about the oceans. They have displays on dinosaurs, geology, some stuffed animals and one on Los Angeles itself. They even have a few live animals in the basement.It’s located in downtown LA in an area with a bunch of other museums/attractions so you might drop by this one while in the area but you won’t be missing much if you skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,A real cheetah from Africa?,"For my 72nd birthday on Winter Solstice, my 5-year-old granddaughter & I went to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. We saw the giant dinosaur skeletons, the dioramas of wild animals and she even got to touch a REAL cheetah from Africa! There was a 3-D movie on the oceans which was beautifully photographed, as well as, informative. A cafe on the ground level has a variety of food choices, the cheese pizza was her favorite. There’s an outdoor area where children may explore, located near the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
50,"Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs",We went for the dinosaurs and stayed for the gems and mammals. Great displays and well designed exhibits. Food at the cafe was good with outdoor seating available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarylandNana4
40,Stuffed Animals!,"This is a pretty decent museum, until I got to the Mammals of Africa hall. Amazing! Taxidermied animals in natural-setting dioramas! So much detail, too. There is also a Mammals of North America hall but half of the displays were blocked off due to setting up for a special event, which was a bummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mddavisx
50,Great displays and a great facility,"The architecture alone is worth a visit, but there is something for just about everyone here. The dioramas of animals amaze much as much as they did when I was a kid. The dinosaur exhibits are both educational and interesting. Part of the year, they have a butterfly pavilion, and part of the year, it's a spider pavilion. Yes, you will like it! It's not expensive to visit, but consider a membership. It doesn't cost much and gets you access to many special programs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3718TTbarryw
40,Interesting,"The museum is well laid out and very child friendly, the halls have super exhibits I especially enjoyed the seeing the wonderful jewellery on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/libby990
50,OUTSTANDING,"Great for family when the weather is not good !! Many dinosaurs, including the world’s only Tyrannosaurus rex growth series. You get the behind- the- scenes look at how scientists work on fossils at their Dino Lab. Over 200 specimens, including skeletons from mastodons to whales, animal dioramas from North American and Africa, and more. Fully recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9176ZLcarld
50,Amazing!,"I have always wanted to visit this place and it was as great as I imagine! My mom didn`t wanted to go so we schedule only 2 hours for our visit... and definitely we needed more time :( it`s so interesting every single room in there, you feel like you are in a movie all the time, it`s surreal!... we will be back for sure!Note: we visited de Natural History Museum of NY a couple of months ago and we have this big expectation after visiting de LA`s.... and what a disappointing it was :( we got out (in New York) with the feeling that we had wasted a day in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NataliaSantillana
40,Great Museum,"This museum has a wide variety of exhibits. It is good for people who line dinosaurs or prehistoric eras.There are also large grounds to walk around in if the weather permits. There is easy access by the subway, which has a stop about 1/4 mile away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taiowaw
50,Natural (and social) history of Los Angeles,"The natural history exhibitions were good with a lot of dinosaurs, fossils, mammals etc. Gemstone and mineral collections were nice (a lot of gold and very good facts about how to classify minerals and their flourenscence). The live animals we saw were snake, insects and arachnoids. The best part in my opinion was the part on the history of LA itself as a city, and a video on how many cultures can unite in their traditions and values as to making shrines. There is a nice cafe (bit pricey!) and gardens. Parking at the museum lot is 12 dollars if i am not mistaken, but there is also street parking by the university for much less if you are ok with a short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ewatte
50,Very good museum,I have been to a few museums and even though you have to pay for this museum it was worth it. Its clean and looked after and the building internally is spotless. There are a varied amount of areas covering different subjects but I was impressed. If your visiting the area check this and the science museum out as they are next to eachotherYou will not be dissapointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanessex2018
40,Worth a visit,"Went on a rainy Saturday...plenty to see and definitely worth a visit. Crowded, with lots of screaming kids, but that’s to be expected. Would go again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam2417
50,Loved it,This is such a fun place to go! The megalodon exhibit was really fun...the kids area is super fun as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Campos1234
50,Special Museum for all ages,"The NHMLA is a special place. This museum is filled with art, history, science, and something for everyone to enjoy. One of the best things I like about this museum is that it’s perfect for any age. It’s great for families and a lot of fun for a date night. The exhibits are always interesting. You add on the special events and you’ll be surprised how much time you will spend having fun in this magical place. This is definitely one of my top museums to visit in Los Angeles because there is so much to check out and the diversity of exhibits.Pro Tip; this is located near USC and there are fun surrounding museums and sights to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamcjjohnsonjr
50,Kid Friendly,The museum has changed over time from a self guided tour to a kid focused experience. There are a number of children interactive activities at the lower level entrance and puppeteers with flying dinosaurs and people offering to take family pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6211QDsteveb
50,Beautiful setting and interior packed with bones! Displays are well explained and the layout is helpful,"This is of interest to any age, filled with great dioramas and explanations for the dinosaurs, and all exhibits. I liked the gems display and many others.Downstairs, you will find a large Lego installation of the Jurassic Park jeep and a dinosaur standing in vegetation---all made of hundreds of Legos. While 1-2 hours will do it, what a good way to learn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judybookdoc
40,Great Rainy Day thing to do- actually Always Soooo Much FUN!,"it was a terrific place to visit when the Kids were little,.... recently had the opportunity with some friends to go there, as a Rainy Day thing to do- Soooo Interesting, and Fun, and Enlightening, and people watching, and had Lunch there and it was Good- Sometimes I forget about how great Museums can be for all ages, and how far we(our Science) has progressed in such a relatively short time- How interesting Science is as a subject and intertwined into our everyday lives-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
50,Excellent for Dinosaurs,"The museum is a spacious and well presented exhibit of various animals and dinosaurs. Of note is the excellent dinosaur exhibit, which is highlighted by the t-rex. For younger members, there is a 'live' dinosaur encounter where you learn about triceratops. Two 3d movies are well done and require supplemental tickets. Overall, a well done exhibition that is worth the visit.Total time is between 2-5 hours depending upon your interests. Arrrive early before the crowds as entrance lines can occur during peak times. Parking is available in the area, but becomes difficult if there are other events at the Coluseum. The interior food court is good, but a priced on the higher side. The nearby rose garden is good place to relax for picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/capriskman
40,A bit boring for younger visitors.,"We had a day to spare in LA, and so decided to venture to the Natural History Museum + California Science Center. We thought it might be interesting for the whole family (2 adults and 2 kids, aged 5 and 9). Unfortunately there wasn’t much to engage the kids, and so we had to do the Museum at a bored child’s pace. Overall, not bad, but could do better to make it a bit more interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973sharynw
50,Very educational and fun,Went there during Christmas break which was a good time to go - easy parking and the museum was not too crowded. You could easily spend a full day here. We went specifically for the National Geographic Photography exhibit. Amazing photographs. Becoming LA was really cool. Had a few photos of the exact same places taken years apart. So interesting to compare. Saw the North American Mammals and Gems and Minerals. We were there for a good 4 hours. There was so much more were weren't able to get to. Definitely worth the visit. The only negative was that it is very cold in there. I would recommend a sweater or jacket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeyDog
50,Lots to see and do,"Haven’t been for about a year and I must say the upgrades are awesome ! So much to learn and do now . Great for all ages ! If you are a member they have a members only lounge with coffee,tea and water for free. Also the 3d movies are free for members. Parking is $12 and they have lots of food options for sale here . Always clean and they have so many people that are around to answer any questions you may have .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
40,Great time,"We had a great time. The kids enjoyed the activity room where they could actually touch things! lolIt's a good location, parking is available, lots to see, new exhibits, interesting stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navyxman
50,Its the building from Bones TV show.,There was a wildlife photography exhibit and the art of the jewel. There are 3D movies and permanent exhibits. A very nice museum with lots to see. We will go again to see other special exhibits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatCincinnati
50,A hit with dinosaur lovers,The museum has an extensive exhibition of dinosaurs and a real hit with kids who love dinosaurs. It took us a few hours to see the exhibits.The building is beautiful and the light rail stops across the road.Great way to fill half a day in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorerGabor
50,This is one of those places that you can learn & enjoy the day.,We started going to the Natural History Museum when I was a kid and then as an adult taking our children both as escorts with the School on field trips and especially when Loved ones come to town. Theirs also A wonderful Naturallighted outside Butterfly Display. The Butterfly’s land right on you all times Of the year. All different types of species to see as you take a little break from being indoors. Get a little fresh air and go back inside and see those things again that were most satisfying. My favorite memory was a Chocolate exhibit that explored the days when Cocoa beans were actually a form of currency. Plus dark Chocolate is good for your brain. That was just an added part they had on display. Enjoy your self and share the gift of Art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SolarTonyV64
40,Better for older kids,We took our toddler and it was a little tough. He didn't care for much of the museum but they do have a small section of hands on stuff for young kids. This place would be perfect for kids 5 and older. Lots of cool stuff to see and I remember visiting as a school aged kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168brianv
50,Fossils Galore,"Took a tour of the museum and all the various exhibits from the age of the dinosaurs to present day Africa and wonderful gem and photography exhibits.This is a must see place to visit if you have children and the time. There is so much to learn, you could not possibly fit it all into one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillR703
50,Come here for the dinosaur bones!,Came here to see real dinosaur bones! Been wanting to see dinosaur bones since i was a kid and finally managed to see them up close and personal. The exhibit was quite big and they have a couple of T-Rex bones here. Good to spend around 45 to 60 mins here if you are just interested in dinosaurs... Otherwise you can go on for a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edomon
50,Excellent,"Be prepared for several hours of excellent exhibits if you want to see this museum in its entirety. Easy access for folk with disabilities as ramps and internal elevators are clearly identifiable. There is a cafe and gift shop. The building is rather rambling so the map you receive at the admission desk is very handy. There are a number of dynamic displays that will cost you entrance . We chose the 3D cinema showing ""Oceans"". Very good for $6.00 per person entrance fee.Overall a fascinating display of ancient and modern fossils and artefacts. Easy to walk around with lots of space between displays.Highly recommended .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT652
40,Nice Family Visit,"Seven members of my family recently visited this museum and had a pleasant visit. We enjoyed the permanent collection, most notably the dinosaurs, and the Los Angeles exhibits. The absolute highlight, however, were the nature photography photos, both winners and finalist, that were superb. Some of them just simply took your breathe away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irawine
50,Superb museum experience,"We were in L.A. and recently and took our four young grandkids to this museum -- it is really a fine experience for both adults and kids. Not only are dinosaurs remarkable, but the exhibits of other animals are well worth a visit as well. Even more, we took advantage of three special exhibits -- a 3-D film on the oceans, a variety of spiders (outside the main building) and a history of Los Angeles. All were worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trup
40,Great dinosaurs and animal exhibits,"We returned to the museum this year and enjoyed all the halls, specially the large dinosaur displays! We ventured in the spider exhibit, liked it but felt underwhelmed; small pavilion, spiders were not numerous and varied enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hey888
50,Great day out,Great Museum very friendly staff great displays awesome experience Dinosaur display was awesome .Good café great food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885laurencec
40,A great day at the Museum.,"This is a nice sized, well curated museum for students and young families. It has the best of everything and just enough of it. Dinosaurs bones? check! Mammal dioramas? check! Kid Friendly interactive lab? check! Outdoor exhibits? Check! Free range Spiders? Check! An amazing gemstone exhibit? check! I purchased tickets for three special exhibits for the day and with parking it was an expensive trip. The museum is part of Exposition park, near USC which holds the Science Center and the Colosseum. If you want to miss mass crowds and parking confusion, check the Colosseum schedule for events and avoid them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142lp
40,Family visit,Lots to see in this very well laid out museum. A bit pricy with parking charged separately from from the entry fee. Still recommend it though. Highlight was the collection of dinosaur bones and the information on how fossils are excavated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCDC
50,My favorite place to nerd out,"This museum is my favorite place to play tourist in my hometown. It is so multi-faceted: family-friendly, but also hosts late night events for adults. Since becoming a member, I've enjoyed a breakfast at the museum with early access to a new exhibit. The garden with native plants and edible garden is a relaxing place to hang out. The spider pavilion (formerly the butterfly pavilion) was quite fascinating and there are knowledgeablestaff to explain all about the spiders. The museum is easy to get to by public transportation if you'd like to go car-free for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatgirl77
50,"Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, dinosaurs...","If you love dinosaurs, you have to go! My husband just loved it! Yes, there are lots of other things, but dinosaurs are the best :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jofee14
40,With teens what can expect!,"Lots of things to see for free it can take a couple of hours. If you want to see a movie, King Tut (29.00) or the Challenger that will cost you extra.I think having international students can be challenging since they are still kids but take away the phones! I know never going to happen. Managed to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pat-artesia
50,Dinosaurs! And lots of other cool stuff :),"Amazing museum with a diverse collection ranging from gigantic ice aged dinosaurs to a cool hall educating about the history of LA. It's a large museum so give yourself several hours to check it all out. (Apparently, we missed the entire top floor with an amazing bird exhibit!). We went in the summer and there was a spectacular Butterly Pavilion with tons of different species. That was the highlight of the visit, next to the Dinosaur Hall :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OGTracyW
40,One time worth visit,If you are local in LA better go after 3 pm on Friday. The kids will definitely like it and the artificial zoo is very spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WantTravelAtBest
50,"World Class Animal, Fossil & Environment Museum","This Museum has beautiful and irreplaceable natural setting displays of North American & African animals along with world class displays of dinosaur fossils, birds, minerals/gems, insects/butterflies and urban animals and plants. The building itself is a “work of art” that would never be duplicated. This museum, the rose garden to the side of it and the California Science center and IMAX theater kitty corner to it make for a great day with kids young to teen or even for an adult day long date. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howarde2001
40,First Class Exhibits!,I went to the tattoo exhibit in spring of 2018; it was beautifully presented and very interesting. Artifacts from history as well as various cultures were presented. Very informative!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruce855
40,Interesting,It’s a small place compared to other museums but the exhibitions are really good. The dinosaur exhibition is great. There is also an exhibit of the history of Los Angeles which I wasn’t expecting and was nice to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinaalb
40,Best Dino Collection in the West,"My son love dinos and we don't have any museums with good dino exhibits (real fossils) in Bay Area. He was thrilled by this visit(so was I). T rex growth series, Triceratops, Stegosauraus , Mosasaurus, Pleisosaur - You name it.There are other exhibits as well but worth going for the dinosaur collection aloneThis musuem is next to Califorina Science Center . So, plan to visit both when visiting with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidhdas
50,Roaringly good time,"We loved the museum. A fantastic dinosaur exhibit including three T Rex of various ages. The gemstone collection was also a fave, as was the family zone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rollagirl
50,Dinosaur heaven,"We loved our time at this museum. There is so much to look at!We started with a tour of the Spider Pavilion which was an extra $5 to see. This was pretty good - we did think it would be more interactive (as in you could touch spiders etc) but it really was just a walk around the spiders’ homes and see them in their natural habitat. There were so many to see however it is hard to take pictures of them as they are so small phone cameras tend to not focus correctly on them.The dinosaur hall was the best for me as I am a closet Dino-fan. There were so many fossils on display with so much interesting information for all the pieces.The next best thing was the mammal halls - there are three in total. All feature different mammals and are all worth a visit.There is a nice outdoor area as well which is cute, you learn about plants and insects/bees which was nice and it’s a good walk.It’s also good for children as there are a lot of interactive and hands on learning activities for all ages.If you’re super into Gems/Gold then the gem hall would be awesome to visit.Highlights: dinosaur and mammal halls.Lowlights: the bird hall was so dim we could barely see anything when we walked though, admission AND parking fees.I would go again for sure - if only just to see the dinosaur and mammal halls again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb
40,Quite an experience,"Havent been to the museums in many years, and it was such a great experience. They did have some exhibits closed, but still enjoyed all it had to offer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryW202
50,Great to Explore Alone,"I came here yesterday and it was great after a weekend of just fun and excitement from the nights before to just come and relax and get in touch with my nerdy self. It's really great to just come and explore on your own because you are on your own time to see everything here.I love the ocean and some of the really cool things was the oarfish and the widemouth. It was nice to see that since I've never seen a oarfish in person before. The staff there were nice and helpful although it did seem like some would turn the corner when I walked in to maybe avoid answering questions.... I don't know... I just found it a little odd.Parking is easy to find and easy to get into the museum since there are different ways to enter. I really like seeing all the different gems and the Photographers of the Year photos! At one moment in the photos, I had to really stop and just give a moment to the beautiful photos.I must give one shoutout to Steven at the ticketing window. He was very helpful when I came to check in to get my ticket and to get my ticket to both the museum and the photos exhibit. Thank you to Steven for a great interaction at the ticketing window and thank you to the museum for showcasing such awesomeness in the way you do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andycU5648AB
50,A must see place in Los Angeles,The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is the largest natural and historical museum in the western United States. Its collections include nearly 35 million specimens and artifacts and cover 4.5 billion years of history.One of the best museums that i ever visited! 10/10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833igorb
50,Something for everyone,This museum is located in a gorgeous building and surrounded by lovely flower gardens. It is convenient to the interstate and you can easily park close by. There are a lot of exhibits with various themes to interest everyone. The staff is all very friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFowler
30,Kind of a Downer,"If you have been to other world-class natural history museums, you may want to skip this one. Overall, the place seems tired and lacks energy. Some of it is like a throw back to museums of old.The building has some beautiful spaces but they aren't featured. The entrance itself is on a modest facade of the structure. Once you pay the admission (not cheap), you can wander through many exhibits. I thought the discovering LA exhibit was quite interesting but belongs in a LA history museum. The African and North American animal halls are just like the ones I recall from 40-50 years ago -- taxidermied animals in dioramas. For a generation that is used to 3D special effects, I think these are outdated.The bird areas are dark and depressing -- perhaps even a bit scary for younger visitors. There is some great information there but also cases of stuffed birds -- one after another without any interpretation. The dinosaur hall is fine but hardly among the best in the U.S.For a school trip, this would make a fine destination but for a general LA visitor, there are many more great places to spend the time and money (including with children).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDreamin
50,Wildlife Photographer of the Year is a show everyone should see!,"I went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit and it was phenomenal. The exhibit was well curated and broken into digestible segments (portrait, environment, etc). There was ample way-finding and signage that oriented you at all times. The photographs and the blurbs were thought provoking and emotionally stimulating. My friend and I both left in a state of awe for the natural world as well as at the grit and skill of the photographers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessdarke
50,Great for kids,"Nice big museum with clean bathrooms. Our three year old loved it. We were there for almost four hours and didn't see everything. Our kids loved watching the paleontologist work. The cafe is pretty expensive, but had a nice selection of snack foods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sruthp
50,Excellent exhibits,"This museum is not too big but the exhibits are sufficient to capture your attention for a sufficient amount of time.I highly recommend the African mammals section with life size exhibits, makes you feel like you are on a safari. I also liked the birds section which has pretty much any bird you can think of. I think the gems section is a nice addition/break once you have seen enough mammals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eve212015
40,Interesting but avoid “Summer Nights”,"We came for the “Summer Nights” program and arrived early to have time to stroll through the exhibits. In a sense, if you have been to one Natural History museum, you’ve been to them all. Requisite displays of dinosaur bones including several T-Rex skeletons, etc.But there are also numerous exhibits of other aspects of nature. All are well laid out and the associated explanations are clear and easy to read. I personally liked the exhibits that told the story of finding “Thomas” the museum’s prized T-Rex skeleton.I dropped the rating a star on this review, because the “Summer Nights” event isn’t for senior citizens like moi. The DJ playing Techno at 150db is just too much throbbing on ears already compromised by too much rock ‘n roll. The Food Trucks were interesting and we had some innovative cuisine for dinner but having to show your hand-stamp every time you leave the event area to get food is just dumb. And, except for the area immediately around the DJ, there is no place to sit and you can not hold a conversation with the horrendously loud music in the sitting areas. The event is free and a nice idea but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.Go for the Museum, take an L.A. resident for better pricing, and avoid the once a month after hours festival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110AlR
40,Awesome Dinosaur exhibit!,"The dinosaur exhibit was quite extensive and informativeThe mammal exhibit was quite good as it displayed the different type of African and North American mammals, the displays were good indications of what the animals look in real life.GA tickets were $15 USD, and the options to pay for for different exhibits, such a butterfly and tattoo (which were on display at the time of our visit).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohankapila
30,Ok but too expensive,The main arts are free but the Egyptian visiting fee is too expensive. I do not know if it is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epycpa
50,Dino bones for days,"It's been years since the last time I went to the Natural History Museum, so I was really looking forward to it. I was not disappointed - they have tons of new stuff! I was excited to revisit the giant t-rex skull, although bummed to discover you can no longer stand behind the glass display and take a pic looking like you're inside the dino's mouth. I was, however, totally amazed by a new exhibit featuring t-rex bones from 3 different phases of life - basically baby, teen, and adult. Very cool to see how their bodies not only grow, but also change shape as they age. The museum has also added a lot of educational, interactive displays that kids will love.The dioramas of large mammals were super cool, and of course, I loved the gem section full of sparkly delights. We popped down to the cafeteria - the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about. We skipped the butterfly pavilion this trip but took a stroll around the rose garden. All in all, a glorious day, complete with some astronaut ice cream from the gift shop to try at home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xerxesthegreat

50,Fantastic museum in a gorgeous park!,"I love this museum. I love natural history museums in general, but for me, this place is second only to the NHM in London.It sits in a gorgeous park, surrounded by a couple of other museums, and a wonderful rose garden. It is a beautiful building, and contains everything from old-school wildlife dioramas to a sea of glittering gems, and of course - dinosaurs! We also popped into the butterfly tent, which was a lot of fun (if a bit overcrowded). Definitely worth a trip if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImekaSF
50,Great if you are into Dinosaurs & Minerals!,"Alas, I only had a short time in LA as I was travelling through. So I hired a private guide for places I wanted to see as I'd been to LA in the past. I'd seen enough star's homes to last me a lifetime! Anyway, one place I wanted to see was the LACM, and its Dinosaur Hall as well as the Gem & Mineral Hall. The Dinosaur Hall was brilliant and well lit, with impressive fossils. If you are into that sort of this has some great ones. The trio of T Rex's in various ages was tops. The Gem & Mineral Hall had to be one of the most impressive displays I've seen. Apart from the green diamonds on display the variety was amazing. Super!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7038UWpeterf
50,Summer at the National History Museum,"We planned the day to see both the California Science Center. It was great to see the National History Museum first time for hubby he never seems to make it here. It’s been my third visit. We enjoyed the Dinosaur exhibit, Mammals and Rocks and Minerals. There were children on field trips but plenty of space for everyone. Love exploring museums during summer time. By planning to see both museums we just paid parking once and enjoyed the rest of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brychewilliams

40,Excellent Dino exhibits,"Dinosaur hall has some terrific exhibits and is by far the best part of the museum, the rest is noting much to write home about. A couple of hours is plenty of time and make sure to do the butterfly experience.Only 10-15 mins from downtown in an uber and make a great break from the midday heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sallndmark
50,Awesome Museum,Great experience at the museum. If you are in the area a must visit. Lots of history to see and very neat location. Love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnybaca02
50,"Many things to see, get there early to avoid crowds and have enough time!","This museum has things for all ages. A few tips:1) It tends to get more crowded later in the day.2) The entrance fee is $15 for adults, less for students, free for local residents after 3 pm and for members all day;3) They close at 5 pm (depending on the time of year).4) Parking is $12 before 5 pm $15 afterwards, so uber might be better for you.5) It is almost next to the California science Center, which is free and can take another full day to see. Highly recommend you visit there too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRLieberson
50,A great place for the whole family -- including seniors.,"When we had younger children, this was a fantastic place to spend a morning or afternoon -- including a visit to see whatever was playing at the IMAX.Now, my husband and I take in the special exhibits -- currently King Tut.A plus for seniors and those with disabilities -- there are wheelchairs available free of charge at the front desk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29cindya
40,Informative and great displays,Was a great place for the family to spend an afternoon. The exhibits are well done and informative. Gemstone area was interesting but most impressive was the making of LA exhibit. The photos of then and now should be expanded on - so interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aclary
50,Walking back to early days of museum,"This is a great museum to visit and when you add in that the movie ""Night at the Museum"" was based on this museum it is busy. You can see the whole place in 3-4 hours. I recommend going later in the day after some of the kids have left. Parking can be an issue as the walk from lot to building can be long. Order you tickets online so you don't have to wait in line to purchase them. As I walked through the exhibits it is like all museums used to be. Large stuff animals from 100 years ago. Dinosaur bones, recreations and more. Fun for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjbales
50,Natural History Museum of Los Angeles,The Natural History Museum is a wonderful place for a family outing. I have been there more than once. The displays and exhibits change periodically and are always educational and fun for all ages. The museum is surrounded by other museums including many free exhibits. This is an excellent way to spend the day. I would allow at least 3 hours of your time for this extraordinary place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotel10001
50,Worth the trip,This Museum is well laid out. The displays were interesting and informative. It was a nice way to spend a few hours on a hot L.A. day. We went to the science centre first (which is next door) and free but this Museum was heaps better. Well worth the $15 entry fee. Parking was easy and cost $12 for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bwds
50,Great museum for younger kids,Went there with 5 and 9 year old. They both loved the gemstones exhibits. We also sent for the butterfly exhibit which is also very interesting and beautiful. Interesting for adults too. Agree with reviewer that some exhibits need and update. But I also appreciate the traditional museum architecture...and that smell of exhibits that never touches sunlight. Some portions are quite interactive for kids. Expect to spend about 2 to 3 hours. Lots of short stairs to watch for,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hodala802
50,"Relaxing, Informative, and Close to other museums",The museum was laid out in an easy to maneuver fashion. The displays were informative and descriptions were educating without being boring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624lisap
50,Amazing place for kids,"Great place for kids to discover and learn about Dinosaurs, gem stones, birds, history of Los Angeles and some other things. We spent there whole day and covered only the inside exhibitions. We did not have time to visit the outside garden and the butterfly pavilion.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oritv2015
40,Dino Day Out,"I took my 6 year old here, although he has been here before he was too small to remember it. I noticed that the museum has done some upgrades in the parking/ rear entry. Sadly the old layout of the California history part has been upgraded, I prefer the way it used to be they attempted to do it more modern and more urban. The way I remember it from before it was less sterile and more like walking through Los Angeles Historical time periods. It was pretty disappointing, the new look of that exhibit I feel pushes kids back a bit not like before where the displays drew you in to that time. I think they tried to copy the renovations of the Peterson they way they did away with the walking through history and changed it to the modern sterile look, in my opinion a bad and unneeded change. Aside from that the rest of the exhibits were not only informative but very well displayed such as the North American Animal and African exhibit halls. My son really liked all of the Dinosaur exhibits too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,Absolutely mind blowing!,"This was honestly one of my favorite attractions from when I visited Los Angeles. It was absolutely stunning and worth every penny to enter. They have an additional add on to go through the live butterfly exhibit, which is spectacular and whimsical. The dinosaur exhibits are mind blowing and jaw dropping. It's a true adventure of going back in time. This place is packed with gorgeous gem stones. This place is nothing shy of a treasure and an definite must visit if you're visiting Los Angeles. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ericai
50,Beautful and awe inspiring,The National Museum of History in Los Angeles is an awesome experience. So many places to explore and invest your time. The staff is very nice and the museum is very well taken care of. Definitely will go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nfarst
40,Nicely laid out and ornate.,"Enjoyed this place more than I thought, as I'm just a regular tourist and not particularly a natural history buff, but this place was well laid out, spacious and clean. Looks like it's a favourite place for small school trips too, as there were several groups of children walking around, with teachers. Not a stuffy place, at all. I enjoyed the life-size dioramas of animals in their natural habitat. The only gripe I have is that we couldn't exit the way we came in, which was via the rose garden, so we were wandering around for a bit, trying to find an exit close to where we entered, because that's the area we knew. There was no map of an alternative exit plan, which would have been handy, if it had been placed on a board by the closed exit. Instead we walked from end to end, until we finally gave in and asked an assistant in the gift shop, who was pretty useless ""just use another exit"". It made us a little later than we wanted to be for our next (timed) appointment, elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
50,Top 5 Museums to Visit in Los Angeles,"This place is awesome! Parking was easy and the Museum itself is well presented and tourist friendly. I loved the Mineral Exhibit with beautiful halls of minerals from all over the world. The dinosaur bones were also impressive as well as the outdoor gardens.There is a decent cafe within the museum to have lunch and you can head over to the bug exhibit from there. I recommend this museum to adults and kids alike, I am an adult without kids and i enjoyed this museum a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,An amazing experience.,"First off, we went for the dinosaurs and found that and so much more. Way more than you can cover in just one day. This is a well laid out and organized Museum. Pleasent and very very educational. I feel that this is a must see when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prothos49
40,Worthwhile,"While it is true that this landmark museum could use a bit of freshening-up, it is still worthwhile visiting. Many interesting and highly informative exhibits; some especially fascinating (like the gems/minerals hall). Children will especially enjoy the dinosaur and mammals/birds exhibits. The surrounding grounds of this museum could be spruced-up and better maintained. The entire area is not that inviting to the casual visitor or tourist; there are cracked sidewalks and graffiti in some areas. But we still enjoyed the overall experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
30,Seems like it is due for an upgrade,Hadn't been here since I lived in LA and attended as a kid. Seems like many of the exhibits (birds and mammals) never have been updated. We enjoyed the special limited butterfly exhibit. Good thing is that it is not as popular as the adjacent science museum so nice and quiet and empty. Could only spend about 90 minutes which is not enough. its not the Smithsonian but what is?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DT808
40,kids loved the dinosaur skeletons,"great collection of all kinds of things, dinosaurs, birds, fish, minerals, jewels. Great for the kids, keeps them interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
50,Real ancient dinosaur/ice age & cave man bones,"Real ancient dinosaur/ice age & cave man bones which I've never seen in my life. Pretty cool stuff. Price was also reasonable, very educational. My kids were impressed & I loved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarayang27
50,Amazing dinosaur skeletons greet you upon entering,"My granddaughter, her mother and I went to the Museum for their Butterfly Pavilion. Due to the overcast day, most butterflies were NOT flitting around; they want sunshine to warm them up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
30,A museum,As far as museums go this one is good. We were here during a school field trip day so we tried to go the opposite way of them. They were super loud. The exhibits are fun to see. We mostly went to stand with all the live butterflies which was fun but kind of a small space. Less people allowed in at time would be better. It probably took us an hour to do everything. We found it really hard to figure out how to have our Uber driver drop us off at the front & we could not locate the parking lot. Very poor signage & there are other buildings around but we saw nothing talking about what those were. We walked through the big rose garden which is very pretty & has a fountain in the center. There were quite a few homeless people outside of the rose park one of which got up & peed on the park wall while we were walking by. Not really a lot to do around here we did walk to a chick fil-A for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redredles
50,Great place to explore and take the kids,"The dinosaur exhibit is amazing and the highlight. But don’t forget the African and North American mammals, and interactive exhibits. Definitely great for kids young and old alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenC159
50,A walk through the past,"Parking- if you are lucky you will get it near the east entranceButterfly park - be early to have a ticket, we were unlucky with tickets being run outVegetable Garden - a good place to catch your breath and let your little ones to dip their legs in the water parkDinosaur- a lot of effort has gone in here and kids would be completely crazyGems, crystals, precious stones and much moreA return visit is on the card",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caballero500
50,DINO fun!,Great place to take the kids and see the awesome dinosaur fossil collection! The butterfly pavilion is cool too maybe you'll get lucky and one will fly onto your shoulder!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake
40,Fun museum,Fun museum to visit with lots of hands on activities for children. Love the dinosaurs. Also saw a special exhibit on until May 14 - the proclamation emancipation document one of two signed by Abraham Lincoln. Leave lots of time to visit the rest of the venues. Parking on site is convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrishS_Traveler
40,The dinosaur hall is good,"The dinosaur hall and exhibit was good. I was able to tour with a guy who presented information about the displays.I don't like the diorama displays of mounted animals, perhaps cutting edge in the 1930's but dated now.",
50,Wonderful museum,"This is a great place to spend a few hours when visiting LA. It has a really outstanding dinosaur exhibit that kids would love. They also have a great mineral and gemstone exhibit. There is an admission price to visit, but it is reasonable. For an extra few dollars you can view the butterfly pavilion also on the museums grounds. The grounds had landscaped an provide some outdoor time while visiting. The day I was there, there were elementary school field trips and all the kids were having a wonderful time. If you want to make a day of it (as I did), this museum is right next to the Science Museum, the California African American Museum and the Exposition Gardens (all of which are free admission).",
50,Wish we had more time,An excellent prehistoric collection and many other interesting exhibits. A fun way to spend the day.,
50,Excellent museum,The museum had lots to offer. The live animals section downstairs was very interesting and the staff member was very informative. We enjoyed the dinosaur show and thought the way in which the animals were displayed was beautiful. We particularly liked the dinosaur section especially as the T. rex had been given the same name as my youngest son. Well worth visiting.,
30,"Lots of good, some bad.","Folks who come from out of town and visit places like this tend to expect a good experience. However, we experienced hiccups from the start. Their parking was full so we had to park elsewhere that was blocks away...and still had to pay.As we walked up to the museum grounds, we saw trash strewn about all over. It was clear that the museum was just visited by a school and they had lunch outside...but why wasn’t there any staff assigned to empty the garbage cans to accommodate more trash so it didn’t overflow? It was absolutely disgusting to see the amount of trash and the birds it attracted to make it worse. The museum should be embarrassed. In general we found the greater LA area to be strewn with a lot of trash along street corners and highways. I guess they don’t pride themselves with cleanliness.When we finally made it to the entrance, there was a line out the door but only one cashier to take payment. After about ten minutes, a second cashier finally made it to help.Once in the museum, we were awed by many of the exhibits but disappointingly discovered that some of the exhibits had been closed early. Why? Because they were setting up for an evening event hours before closing. So, people paid to visit the museum but didn’t get to enjoy all the exhibits. It was ridiculous.But again, we were able to see many exhibits that were fascinating. I’d visit again in the future but hope the experience is a better one.",
40,First time visitor,"Great exhibitions. I’m not really interested in science or biology, but I enjoyed three hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerritP116
30,Nice place to spend some time,While in west Los Angeles stop by the Natural History Museum and view all of the interesting displays and artifacts and enjoy the building and the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Cool exhibits and beautiful area,"This museum is great. There are usually fascinating exhibits and the classic halls and dinosaurs are always entertaining. The beautiful gardens within and around the museum are perfect. It’s very easy to get to by metro, there’s loads of places in the area to add onto your visit.The only thing I’ve ever had an issue with here is their upkeep of various areas and exhibits. The gem room is grossly dusty and really takes away from what it could be. The ancient artifacts upstairs is really kind of sad how little information is given for such historical pieces.I’ve been a member here for years and will continue to be. My issues are obviously not enough to keep me from going, but I wrote them in hopes that they clean their display cases!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1608MCsarahv
40,takes forever to park,"The museums at exposition park are excellent and you can easily spend the day there. I recently went to the tattoo exhibit at the natural history museum. It was fun and informative. My main problem with this area is the parking. It takes at least 25 minutes to get into the parking area because there are only 2 entrances. I wish they'd improve this and create a larger structure with easier entry/exit. Also, bring cash to park as that's all they accept. It is however very close to a metro stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
40,A Classic Museum,"I haven't been to a natural history museum since the late 70s, and this one did not disappoint. We went on an uncrowded Saturday, and stayed the whole day, 10:00am to 5:00pm. We saw every hall and exhibit, including the Butterfly Pavilion. The ""Tatoo"" exhibit was skipped because none of my group was interested in seeing it or paying the extra price. (The Butterfly Pavilion cost extra, by the way.)The halls we spent the most time in were Dinosaur Hall and Mineral Hall. So much to see, especially the Mineral Hall, it had thousands of artifacts. We spent a lot of time in the Bird Hall as well. The African and North American Galleries had great displays, with very detailed backdrops and settings. The Hyenas were especially scary.We saw one show, ""Dino Encounters"", which was more on the entertainment side than the educational. Fun for the little ones as a giant dinosaur puppet crosses the stage and interacts with the host.The Butterfly Pavilion was neat, but it was early in the spring season, so there were only hundreds of butterflies inside instead of thousands. The docents said that they are still waiting for many more to emerge. Still, very interesting seeing them flutter all around you.I read many reviews about this place, where people said it looked old and outdated. Umm...I didn't see any of that. The museum was nice. The biggest drawback is the small and limited bathrooms. The grounds around the museum are very nice, and there is a wonderful and giant rose garden on the east end of the museum grounds. We brought a picnic lunch, and ate in their Nature Trail area, as did a number of other visitors. Parking was also abundant. We parked in the structure off of Exposition Boulevard, not the one near the California Science Center off of Figueroa Street which is much further away from the Natural History Museum. L.A. Metro Expo Line has a station right in front of the museum as well. Cost of parking is $12.This is a great and fascinating place for the whole family, and affordable too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TSharkHB
50,Great tour about LA’s history,Learned a lot about the history here and I’m surprised that some things here are well preserved and still look like new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navas2002
40,Best time to visit is after 2pm or Mon-Wed,"We went recently on Thursday at opening time of 10am. Have you ever went to a site with 10 bus loads of tourists vying to see the same thing? It is 10 time worse when the buses are loaded with unruly kids with zero social filters. They scream, they push to the very front of exhibits, and do not believe in personal space. Then their minders are constantly yelling for the hordes to stand to the left/ right, don’t climb, don’t push, etc. We only found respite in the fantastic Tattoos exhibit. I learned a lot regarding different types of tattoos (Japanese, American Classic, pinto, etc.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbackpain
40,Nice museum for every age,"This is a very nice museum for every age. The exhibitions are very nice. It will take you about 1,5 hou to visit the whole museum. Admission price is rather high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariebeukenoot
50,More than Dino bones!,"Love this Museum, ever changing exhibits mixed with the things they had in my visits as a small child! Dont miss the gems room with the Vault and diamonds and massive Gold nuggets! The outdoor exhibits with Butterflies and hummingbirds is great in the Spring, Nice kid friendly areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smsdes
50,Amazing museum! You must see it.....😀😀😀😀,"Is a huge museum....it has different showrooms!!! The first one is the history of the dinosaurs, really amazing, it has whole dinosaurs bones....big ones!!! You can read all the history of the dinosaurs until they disappeared. Another showrooms are butterflies, different kinds of animals in their own habitat, stones and gems; a lot to see it. You can be disappointed !!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioaliaga
50,Spiders,I took my grandson to see the spider exhibit at the natural history museum and we also saw the dinosaur. We had lunch and just had a wonderful day of making memories with my grandson We had the best time. Grandma and Kian time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dqueen1
40,Nice for a rainy day,"Enjoyed our rainy afternoon here, lots to see, particularly enjoyed the gem & rock displays. The museum is a little confusing so check the map",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaskaLH
50,Wonderful for Kids,"We come from the DC area, so Smithsonian is the gold standard for museums to us, and this is right up there. The dino exhibit was extensive and impressive. We were awed by the diorama displays in the several great halls displaying native animals of the Americas. We kept thinking how much our grand kids would enjoy this place. On-site parking was $12, nice cafeteria with outside seating if you wish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenlindab2016
50,The Museum has a new exhibit on Tattoos that is exceptional,"""NEW"" is not accurate but It is n'new' to me since I just visited. It is an excellentexhibit with all kinds of interviews with TATTOO artists from all over the world,plus a history of Tattoos and a section devoted to California tattoos. It isa very large exhibit and requires your full attention and energy,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
20,Not the best,"Went with my girlfriend, there wasn't much to see, the typical dinosaur and animal exhibitions,wasn't even free admission, $15 entry fee, I'll also been to the natural history of Raleigh NC which is ten times bigger than this one and soo much to see which was FREE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imaddg
50,Great for families,Science made accessible. Do you love dinosaurs? Amazing gemstones? Animals from Africa or North America presented in their natural habitats? This is the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveledfordecades
30,First Fridays,"The museum just started First Fridays, a cool event featuring a rock band and dancing. The museum also had a tattoo exhibit, which was well done.That said, I haven't seen dioramas in museums for some time. They are so dated and uninteresting.The building is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mheitner
50,Dinosaurs and Tattoos,"We originally went for the Special Tattoo exhibit. What we got was so much more. The Dinosaurs were great very lifelike. I thought the History of Los Angeles was somewhat unfinished. It could be so much more, but I learned from it. The building is open an welcoming. The dioramas need a good updating. The Tattoo exhibit was a fantastic history of tribal culture up to present day. We are all in a tribe and they have beauty and they mean something. My goal was to understand face tattoos. I was so surprised what every thing meant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saw55
50,nice for dinosaurs lovers,"i love this place, where they have a variety of nice items and fossils of stuff you can not imagine, for example they have a room full of metals shaped as stones and gems. also they have many dinasours bones and whales. going there was a very nice experience and it really makes you think of what happened on this earth through the years and how WE Humans are making many animals to be in danger, although it is fun but some how sad, but it is a good reminder for all of us that we need to take care of our planet so that , we do not face a day where all the animals we know today will be part of this museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti
20,Not as good as others I've seen,"We went to this museum in January 2018, only a month after visiting the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We felt that the Denver museum beat LA in all departments.- The animal dioramas in LA looked very old and dated here, whereas the Denver ones were extremely lifelike.- The dinosaur section in LA was good, but we had seen it all and more in Denver.- The section on the history of LA was very dull, with nothing to spark curiosity in my children.While I may have enjoyed this museum more if I had seen it first, I walked away feeling disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinker901
50,"A very nice experience, Dinosaurs are great !!!","I went there with my family, mostly interested on checking the fossils, found much more. The building itself is fantastic, offering great spaces and nice architecture. The exhibitions are great, very professionally displayed with a log of good information. Our favourite however were the dinosaurs fossils. It was a fantastic experience to see well preserved T-Rex fossils, among some other creatures. This is a great experience for a family or individuals, totally recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505walterv
50,"Positive, Educational, and Always Relevant","I came here with some friends, who were cheering me up following the initial shock of a major shift in my life. They know museums always cheer me up, and I had not been to the Natural History Museum in a long time. The visit brought back memories, but there had been additions and seasonal exhibits which provided a new ""spin"" to the museum trip. I would suggest, if you can, to take the Metro, since there's a train stop within short walking distance. There is parking, but it's kind of a pain, but if you're not knowledgeable, in regards to L.A. public transit, it's a logical, and convenient, option, although you might have to do some walking with that, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybelle08
50,Top Quality Natural History Museum,The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County compares well to some of the best natural history museums and is worth a stop. They offered special ticket pricing for military families. If you live close I would recommend getting the membership. We paid a little extra for one of the special exhibits ($5 per person) but it was probably worth it. We could have easily stayed longer than 3 or 4 hours but the kids were tired eventually. There is a basic cafe but also some restaurants within walking distance. Traffic can be messy on the weekends when there is also an event at the adjacent football stadium. Checking other events before heading out would be a good choice before heading out on a Saturday or Sunday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomD46
40,Lots of see,"I really enjoyed the museum. The mammal, bird, and dinosaur section would be great for little kids. I personally really loved the section on the history of LA and P-22 (mountain lion). The gift shop is pretty cool too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryp661
50,Awesome!!,"This was one of the highlights of our trip to LA. The dino exhibits are incredible, some of the best I have ever seen. Would recommend to all visitors to LA, families, singles and couples. We spent about four hours in total, staff was wonderful and were more than willing to answer questions. Really neat items in the gift shop, not your typical tourist stuff. Cafeteria downstairs had a good variety of snack and lunch options plus seating outside to enjoy the great weather. We will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5228NQjoyceb
40,"A good museum, worth your time",If you have time in LA then this museum is worth your time. It is not really big but perhaps it is als its advantage. If you don't have much time in LA then I would rather dedicate my time to the city (my opinion),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergioPQ
40,Good family fun!,Always a lot of fun things to do. Enjoy walking around and seeing the sites! Kids really enjoy the gem exhibit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/503peggyh
50,Stumbled Upon Some Greatness,"My Fiancé and I went to visit USC campus and as we were walking around we ended up literally stumbling upon the Natural History Museum. With nothing else to do we went in, and with the very reasonable prices of $15 for general admissions and $23 for admissions plus the Tattoo exhibit (adult), we had no other choice but to go. The Tattoo exhibit was something I thoroughly enjoyed! I am a tattoo lover myself so to be able to get history on tattooing and it's origins and meanings was something unbelievable. We even learned that people had actually travelled from all over the world to see this exhibit that we got lucky to find. If you have the chance to check it out, I would highly recommend. The museum offers even more with it's extensive dinosaur fossil collection, history about Los Angeles and Hollywood and other information exhibits. But one of my favourites was definitely the gems and minerals collection, which was far superior than any other gem and mineral collection I have seen yet. To conclude, my only complaint is I wish it was bigger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BexyTravels
50,Great family expedition,"The Natural History Museum is a great way to spend an afternoon in LA with your family. It is great for families of all ages especially children with an interest in history and anthropology. They have a special collection of historical archives about LA as well. It should relate to anyone - local travelers to even international. The outdoors area is fun for small children and the adjacent rose garden is a great opportunity to just enjoy a well manicured garden. The Coliseum being right next door, offers an even greater opportunity to spend the day in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marshcanon

The permanent exhibitions include an incredible gem and mineral area, a huge collection of fossils and several Halls of dioramas of various ecosystems throughout the world.

You can take the expo line train, there is station right in front of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souseyeh
50,Becoming Los Angeles Exhibit is AMAZING,"This review is just for the Becoming LA Exhibit, because I became too engrossed in it to see anything else. This exhibit follows Los Angeles from just before European contact until modern day. It does an excellent job of showing the contributions of different ethnic and cultural groups to shaping the city, as well as the detrimental impact that the ever-expanding population has had on the environment and natural resources. In particular, the museum made a point to acknowledge the roles of groups such as food service workers and undocumented immigrant clothing and textile workers in present-day LA--people whose contributions are often overlooked. Glad I went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209ashleyb

50,Dinosaurs the star of this kid friendly museum,"If you love dinosaurs then this museum is for you! From Pleosaurs to T-Rex relatives, to stegosaurus it's all here. The history of California is interesting, how people survived before irrigation, the gold rush and growth after. The rocks and crystals were cool too. Combine this with a trip to the Tar pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burgi_11
40,Interesting Museum and collection,"Another good Natural History Museum. Nothing more then the usual Natural Museum but well worth a visit, especially the Dinosaurs Hall and the dioramas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreBMalta
50,Great afternoon stop,"I really enjoyed the different halls on mammals, dinosaurs, gems and minerals, and LA County history. I think I ended up spending the most time in the gems and minerals hall, but of course the dinosaurs and extinct animals halls were exciting too! We were able to see the highlights in about 1.5 hours, although I could have spent much more time going more in depth. It really has something for everyone. The gift shop wasn’t to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annalida500
40,An impressive building at Exposition Park,"Near the California Science Center, this museum has an excellent dinosaur area, as well as other exhibits. When we were there there were several docents in the dinosaur area available for questions - that was great. Other areas too, we only had time to quickly go thru the American Mammal and African Mammal rooms - reminded me ot the NYC Natural History Museum. Parking nearyby, $12 cash only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
50,Fantastic Experience for Young and Old!,Space Shuttle on display...one of three in the U.S.! Aerospace history all around. Body Works now on display...awesome! All kinds of interactive exhibits and programs for kids and admission is free! Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
50,Really nice!,"I had previously been to this museum as a kid and was eager to return as an adult. I really like this museum it is spacious and not over crowded. I’ve been to some museums were it felt like things were crammed in this is not the case here.Even with groups of kids visiting you didn’t feel overwhelmed and packed in.We opted to do the spider pavilion too and that was an experience. It was a fear conquering experience,to an extent, for me. I wouldn’t say it was enjoyable but interesting.One of the most interesting areas is the gem stones. I wouldn’t miss it if you are planning a visit. There are so many colors of rocks and gems our planet has developed.There is also a large hands on type area for kids. I was quite impressed with it.As a side note parking was cash only and 12 bucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeRenee
50,Ageless museum.,"Previously, we went to a museum with children. Now we are visiting with grandchildren. Ageless museum. Absolutely all the exhibits are in excellent condition. Very informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filipp10
40,serves the purpose,I have been luckily with my son 3 of these museums including London and New York City. Out of the 3 this one was the smallest in our opinion but it had its own creative parts to explore and kids and adults with enjoy. Its worth the trip for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArzuUzel
50,"Awesome musuc, folks& food","Great place to listen to music on first Fridays while enjoying nice drinks and food. The museum is filled w various exhibits and also permanent exhibits. Fun sleakers too and at a great price. It does get busy on weekends so 1st Fridays,are also a less crowded way to see the museum exhibitions albeit special exhiits might close early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6396QMmariam
40,Worth going if you are in to dinosaurs,"I was with 2 friends and had about 2 hours to kill before going to the airport and i decided to go to this place. I guess, the best thing about this museum was the dinosaurs. Everything else was pretty okay. But then, we couldn't really explore the whole museum because we only had 2 hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/addiction4travel
50,Good visit!,This is the sister museum to the La Brea Tar Pits (according to one of the guides). Pretty common exhibits except for going through the Spider Pavillion and seeing all the orb spiders. Parking was $12.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famw2girls
40,Nice way to spend the day,"An impressive museum with lots to see, especially if you love dinosaurs and it's history.Plenty of exhibits and it looks like a lot of painstaking work was involved to ensure all the details are preserved and kept well. You would need at least 2 hours to go through the halls and kids would really enjoy the interactive ways you can learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedee
50,"T Rex, Oarfish, Gems, and Butterflies","The dinosaur rooms are amazing. The rotunda has a T Rex, and the other species of dinosaurs from the largest to tiny little animals you'd never think were dinos (but your kid would know them!) are there. Fossils, megafauna, dioramas of local wildlife in additional rooms. There are gem rooms, and during the summer, a butterfly pavillion. Worth it. The rose garden is spectacular. There is a Discovery center for the kids, and an amazing garden of indigenous plant life in the back.Your ticket will also get you into the LaBrea tar pits museum in mid-city.The California academy of science is across the mall. There is a space shuttle there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003
50,Great for kids,"This is a very nice interactive museum and a must if your todler loves dinasours. Tjey had ""real life"" dinasour that walks around the museum, my son will treasure the memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chadandlaurag2017
40,Natural History and Fun,"It's one of the older museums in Exposition Park, but has been updated and still is very interesting and educational. It's very fascinating for the young people and even for adults. It has nice exhibits that are Los Angeles centered so it puts natural history in the context of the environment we live in. There is a wealth of great exhibits, but some are getting a little dated but still interesting. The dinosaur and mammal exhibits are very good as are the gemstones. Great place to go on a hot day. Avoid going when there are football games at the Coliseum as there is no parking. However, the Metro Expo line will drop you off nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Very good museum,i came here originally just for the butterfly exhibit which was amazing in itself. but i decided to stay and look around the museum as well and it is amazing! there is so many thing to see and enjoy. it is worth the time and money. there are many new things to learn when visiting here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plusutra
40,A very good spot to explore !,"It was the first thing I visited when I landed in LA. Museum was pretty cool, lots of interesting exhibitions, from evolutionary thingies to gorgeous jewelry and minerals and super nice animals , dinosaurs. Loved spending my time there !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauruze
30,A Mixed Bag,"This museum has some really fantastic exhibits. The dinosaur halls and the gem & mineral hall are probably among the best in the world!Unfortunately, many of the other exhibits are either poorly planned or are very old, out of date, and beginning to fall apart. If you have limited time, skip the mammal halls altogether. And, don't waste your time on the marsh and rainforest portions of the bird hall.Some of the special exhibits are worthwhile even if they are a bit expensive. You'll have to make the call based on your own intellectual interests. Overall, we enjoyed the museum. But, I was disappointed that the quality of the exhibits is such a mixed bag.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDBonthemove
50,Fabulous museum,"There is so much to see and of interest to all ages. Some stunning displays that just make you think of the films 'Night at the Museum'.Jewellery vault is breathtaking. Give yourself plenty of time to go around as there is just so much to take in. Would revisit again if in LA. There was an exhibition at the time of our visit but you had to pay extra to see it, so we didn't bother but it didn't matter as just getting around the museum took us long enough. Fabulous day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ward50
50,Great Museum About Animals and Evolution,"I've lived in Los Angeles all my life and have visited the Natural History Museum over the years, once when I was in grammar school, a couple of times when I was a teenager, and a few times when I was a young adult, so I visited again this summer since a number of years have elapsed. Even though the African mammal dioramas are virtually the same since childhood, I never tire of viewing it the wondrous animals. I also enjoy the dinosaur exhibits as well as the historical artifacts related to life in Los Angeles, and there is so much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterflyedna
50,"Unique experience, full of knowledge and fun",I highly recommended parents to bring their children here for an educational experience full of fun and interactive. This place has so much history and displays that will WOW young and old. Must see the Gems and Minerals and of course Dinosaurs....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momofboys780
50,"Experience The rich culture, history and art of Los Angeles","If you are visiting LA, start at this museum and work your way through many other great ones. You will then have many many great restaurants to eat in downtown LA. Perfect for your whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Visited with 2 adults and 5 year old,Very informative and much bigger than I remembered. Exhibits inside were great.Butterfly pavilion was very good since it also had native plants that attract the butterflys and many curators to answer questions. The nature pathways was amazing too since a curator stopped and spent time with us pointing out various points of nature in such a fun way the five year old didn't even realize it was educational. Well worth the drive to LA and plan on going again to spend more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fun81
50,Fun!,I visited with my family including children ages 5 - 13. We had fun and it is a great please to visit if you are in the area. The museum is clean and well laid out. We spent about three hours in the museum and thought it was plenty to take everything in. We also did the science museum the same day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTR979
40,A great place for anyone with a thirst for knowledge,"Even though our kid is not fluent in English, all of the exhibitions were full of interactive and informative information enough for our 9 year old to have a great time with but a little help from a grownup.A great variety of displays, but the best was the interactive section in the lower level, next to the cafeteria.If you want the most out your visit, make sure you have plenty of time.My only ""negative"" remark about the museum is that it closes to early. We could have stayed a lot longer :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/513lassew
50,Awesome Experience for the kids - Dinosaurs,"This attraction is great, and fair priced as well. There is a lot of great exhibits, but the kids loved the dinosaurs most of all. A lot of great taxidermy to be seen, and multiple areas for kids to interact with exhibits. Definitely worth it for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southernoregong
40,Good Museum,Ive been coming to this museum since i was little and still love it. Not as good as New York's NHM but still worth visiting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trey991
50,A Gem of a Place (Sorry about the Pun),If you like the Earth Sciences or just want to see a first rate Museum while in LA LA land.By all means come here as you will see some fantastic stuff.Which is housed in a very classic Edwardian Era Building. (I just love their sense of style)Now for some hints.It is not in the best of neighborhoods. So leave before Sunset and lock you car and keep a weather eye on your stuff.There are panhandlers and Homeless aroundParking is easy and not too expensive.There is a lot of fast food places on Figueroa StUSC is next door.It gets very hot here during the Summer and early Fall. So dress accordingly.There is a fair amount of walking so wear comfortable shoes.When its hot make sure that you keep your fluids up. As LA has a dry heat which will suck the water out of you w/o noticing it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,A Gem of a Museum,"I recently visited the Museum with my daughter, son-in-law and 18 month old grandson. My grandson w delighted with the animal dioramas and we all enjoyed the gems, dinosaurs and special exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barniebal4
40,What a fun day.,An excellent way to beat the summer heat & enjoy family time. The virtual reality part of the museum is definitely a big hit with the teenager in the family. The animal & dinosaur exhibits are a hit with the toddlers. Do not touch the butterflies if you go to that exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224tiffanyw
40,"Sunday, June 11th visit.","I visited June 11th, arriving around noon. It was my last full day in LA and did not have anything planned. So this worked out great, using the Metro rail from my hotel near Vermont and Sunset. The Metro stops at the NHM. I bought my ticket at the small out building located between the Metro rail and the museum itself. The NHM did not seem too busy while I was there. I believe I saw everything in the museum to see that was free with your paid admission. I really enjoyed all of the Dinosaur exhibits. The Gems and Minerals exhibit was also very cool. As much as I liked those exhibits, I wasn't blown away by the museum. I grew up with the Milwaukee Public Museum and maybe its just hometown prejudice, but I love that museum a whole lot more. The cost to get in the NHM was very fair. I just do not think I would return for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia
40,Wonderful Experience!,Their dinosaur was impressive. We did not think we would enjoy it that much. What really floored with the gem and mineral display! Absolutely amazing and a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaTraveler56
30,Ok....,"There's some very good quality displays but it could be so much more interactive, especially for younger kids. Too much to read and not enough buttons to press. This isn't in the same league as somewhere like the Natural History Museum in London, or even Liverpool Museum. Personally I don't see this as a must visit unless your kids are desperate to see some dinosaurs and even then I would just plan for an hour at the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinADXB
50,"This place is great, You will learn something and the staff is nice.","Of all the Museums in the LA area I like this and the LA Brea Tar Pits, ( Like La Brea more when Will Wrights ice cream was nearby)This place is huge and easy to walk around- You will walk or if you have a wheelchair if big enough where you have alot of room. The exhibits are great and change once in a while. I used to be a member when I lived in LA. They had lots of extras when you are a member, the cost is not much, its air conditioned. Young and old enjoy this place.Lots to see and do, You can take breaks as well. parking is close. its close to a few different Museums as well. But you could spend a day in side if you take the time and read what they are telling you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsN9873OM
50,Great spot if you are into natural history - very good,"This was a surprise, it is as good in many respect as better known museums (e.g. the Smithsonian) and because it has fewer people it is more engaging. Some very good displays that are well done.A bit of a hidden gem, well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottb869
40,Fun,"This museum is super fun. So many things to see. I will start with the bad first. It was super crowded. It was a Sunday, so my own fault. I highly suggest buying tickets online. The line for tickets was about a 30 minute wait. We bought tickets online. If you do that, there is no line. You walk right up, scan your ticket, and go in. Definetly worth it. But, it ONLY let us use a mastercard online. There was no other option.Parking was 12 dollars. Yikes! I'm not sure it was part of the museum, or general parking. But we could not find any other nearby parking.That's it. No other complaints. Staff was all super friendly, and helpful.Many exhibits to see. Very interesting stuff. They have a couple exhibits you have to pay extra for, that are there limited time. We decided to do the butterfly pavillion. Only 5 extra bucks per person. SO worth it! It's magical to see and feel the butterflies all around. Some had broken wings, from rude people touching them. One landed on my purse. They have a soft paintbrush, that gently removes them. PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THEM! Amazing experience. Watch your kids. Don't ruin something beautiful.The museum has a lovely garden outside, with tons of flowers, and a beautiful little pond with a waterfall, and dozens of dragonflies all around. Pretty neat.The dinosaur bones, and all the other animal bones were amazing. Beaitiful and magestic. Very educational. There are 3 levels. They alao have elevators, for those who can't do stairs.A couple of gift shops. Kinda pricey. A water, candybar, shot glass and post card came to 19 dollars. The candy alone was 7 bucks. LolThey have a cafeteria downstairs. Lots of food and drinks. Pizza and salads. A good size menu. We just got some drinks and a bag of chips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/healonwifey
40,All about those dinosaurs!,"This is a very good natural history museum. Entrance fee was reasonable (though not free, unlike in the UK...boo!). The dinosaur section is excellent with all of the star attractions including T-Rex and Triceratops. We found the African animals section interesting too. A great way to spend a few hours in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshAFC
40,Interesting museum,"We spent a really interesting 4 hours here, but could have stayed longer.We started in the butterfly pavilion (which was an additional cost) which was OK but felt that the pavilion was not big enough for the butterflies- the ones we saw were beautiful and was given a card to identify them.The dinosaur, mammal and gem displays were really good. Although the mammal displays did remind me of the Night at the Museum😀😀There is also a nature garden where we had our packed lunch but they do have a nice cafe which had a range of food including gluten free!Worth a visit for both adults and children with plenty to do for the day and at $12 entry (without any of the extras) is good value for money.If you fancy doing a museum fest the science museum is a 5 minute walkCan be accessed on the metro - on the new expo line",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evag385
40,Pleasant few hours,The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is certainly worth a visit. Expect to invest several hours touring the mostly excellent exhibits. The Special Exhibit on Extreme Mammals is particularly interesting. The Gem & Mineral Hall is also interesting. The dioramas of North American Mammals are equal (if not superior) to those found in the American Museum of Nature History in New York City.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/121williamp
50,Love Dinosaurs?? This Is A MUST SEE!!,"Okay, we only ended up going here because our other plans got derailed, but man, oh man, I am SO THANKFUL we chose to do this! Had I known how incredible this museum is, I would have had it on our original itinerary! Dinosaurs... loads and loads of actual dino bones, skeletons, and more dino facts than you ever cared to know! Not to mention, tons of history, dioramas that rival those in New York's American Museum of Natural History!! And one of the most extensive geology and gemstone exhibits I have ever seen! We were there for three hours and didn't even see half of what this place had to offer. Believe me when I say, your kids will LOVE it. :) In fact, it's great for all ages!Oh, and they have a pretty awesome cafe inside and several gift shops with some really cool souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PopcornGirl
40,Spent four hours here with 13yo,"We spent 4 hours here and almost saw everything on exhibit...almost.There dinosaurs and the gem displays were really wonderful. Too often I find that museums never answer my questions about exhibits. Here, I found myself repeatedly asking myself a question and then turning the corner to find the answer. For example, have you ever wondered why there are no flying marsupials? Did you know that there is a striped bunny? Did you know that the original depictions of T Rexs were wrong because they have the dinos dragging their tail? Want to know how they realized this? Go to the museum!!! Have you ever wanted to touch polar bear fur? Go to the museum!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serenityseekerFL
50,Absolutely worth a visit,"This museum is located next to the Science Centre and the African American museum. It is a majestic building and although entry is not free ($12 US per adult) it is absolutely worth a visit. Dinasours, birds, mammals, gems, butterfly garden and more. Free guides tours, and super interesting. Visit al three museums in a day. A big day, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206danif
30,Great Museum for Children,"This grand dame of the Los Angeles museum scene is emerging from a long slumber and being revitalized into an impressive interactive museum space. The enormous rock and mineral, bird, and diorama collection are still there, but now they share space with a native plant garden, a hands-on dinosaur haul, and a children's interactive room filled with insects and other critters to observe. It is so refreshing to see the space getting a new lease on life. Avoid the museum during weekday morning because of thousands of school field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
50,An iconic museum well worth a long visit,"The Natural History Museum is an iconic museum well worth a long visit, built back in the days when museums were meant to inspire as well as inform -- and this one certainly does. As you go in the main entrance, almost the first thing you will see is a huge display of dinosaur skeletons, which may remind you of something you may have seen in the Jurassic Park movies. You can breeze through it if you want to, but my advice is to pay attention and allow the inspiration to sink in. Incidently, they have an on-site parking garage and a good restaurant, so you needn't worry about those things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00

50,Great,Really nice Museum. You can easily spend the entire day in it. And is not expensive at all. I would recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaSCNtraveler
30,Wonderful Garden,"We did not buy ticket for special exhibits, so this review only applies to the standard diaramas. The bird wing is very, very dark and specimens are difficult to see. The large mammal exhibits are definitely worth the trip. I wish the birds in the African mammal exhibit were also labeled, as the lighting is much better. The garden is beautiful and specimens are labeled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanellS495
40,Weekend visit,"If you are new to the LA and looking for things to see and do, then go here. Otherwise, do not waste you precious vacation time coming here. This place is not the NY Met, nor the Louvre museum.Getty museum is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
50,Worth visiting,Dinosaur hall is exciting. So much information to take in. Interested also to watch paleontologists at work in the Dino Lab.The other exhibits are very nice too. The exhibits look so real that you'd think they would move.The nature lab was also really cool. Esp if you're visiting with children.We planned to just stay for 45 mins to avoid traffic. But ended up staying for 2-1/2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquamermaid
40,Pretty Good Place to Waste a Couple of Hours,"Had some time to kill on a business trip in LA so decided to visit a museum. Since this one was open on a Monday (many are not), I opted to stop in here.The place is pretty cool. Anyone with a family would probably enjoy it more than I did, but I had a fun time. The gem collection was amazing. The history of LA section was also pretty cool and informative. The museum store was a little lacking and the price was a bit high (I am spoiled by my home town museums which are amazing with a reasonable recommended donation amount) but I would recommend stopping in if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395candicem
40,Good small museum for kids,Nice and clean. Was easy to get around on a rainy Sunday. Fair amount of exhibits but nothing to write home about. Staff was friendly and it was convenient. I would go with small children but not as an adult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4551LGrobb

I read in a book back home that a very rare megamouth shark was housed here! (60 specimens have been sighted, most were consumed.) I went solely to see him and I was not disappointed! We also very much enjoyed the gem exhibit-so beautiful!! The bird hall was totally amazing too! I got to see a pelican and penguin species I'd probably never get to see otherwise! Of course, the dinosaur fossils are always a hit. The whole area was very spacious and internal architecture was beautiful! I also really enjoyed touching some pelts that a volunteer had brought out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brattybritt92
50,Amazing Natural History Museum!,"I love natural history museums, and this one didn't disappoint. It's large, and you can easily spend the entire day there. They offer free tours that bring you around different exhibits and give you more insight. Admission isn't free, but they do offer student discounts if you're still in college. There is paid parking (it is LA after all.) Beautiful grounds that you can explore. A great place to spend a day in LA! I live in OC but my husband took me on my birthday before an Adele concert. One of the best birthdays ever! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiakoh

50,Must see those dinosaur skeletons life size!,"We stayed over in LA specifically to see the dinosaur exhibit and were not disappointed! We stayed at a hotel near the airport as we were passing through and took an $18-$28 Uber ride to the museum. It opened at 9:30 am and surprised that there were no problems with traffic getting there and back and the journey was under 45 minutes each way.It is free entry on the first Tuesday of every month. So we unexpectedly had a free entry. But to be honest it would have been better to go on a full fee day because it only costs $13 each and the place was full of school tours on the free day. However, it is a great museum and well worth the visit. You can go upstairs by elevator and see the staff working in carefully chiseling away bone from dinosaur skeletons. painstaking work with tiny pneumatic drills.While you are there visit the fantastic gem display it is really amazing. And the mammal display and the African Animals are very well presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_Evan_D

40,Impressive dinosaur and mammal displays. Reasonably priced,"My kid loves the dinosaur so we had to bring her to see the fossils.

Paid $12 for parking.The entrance cost to the museum is very reasonable.Our 6yr old thoroughly enjoyed the whole museum, for us adults we specifically enjoyed the gem n mineral exhibit.It's a great place for educational purposes for kids.

50,Wife and Son's first visit to a major museum,"It was my wife and son's first visit to a major museum and they really enjoyed themselves. It was my first visit since I was a younger child and it felt great to be like a little kid again. The gem and mineral section was huge and impressive. I couldn't believe how many samples were out on display. I bought my son his first rock collection and I hope it is the start of his interest in gems and minerals. The dinosaur section was impressive and informative. Too bad the insect section wasn't bigger, the bird section made up for it. Had a blast and it was definitely educational for my seven year old son, as well as my wife and I.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LANCEandASH
50,A gem of a find for an out of towner,This was a surprising find for us and we only found out about it because of the combo ticket deal with Aquarium of the Pacific. This was an amazing museum and made the perfect day for my marine and dinosaur obsessed son.The displays were impressive and I even enjoyed them (even though dinosaurs bore me). They have more than just dinosaurs and the building itself is impressive and a piece of stunning art.Parking is available for $12 cash (I sensed a $12 parking theme in LA).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mabg68
50,Great Museum and Beautiful Building,"If you're looking for something to do inside, this would be a great choice. It literally took us all day to visit.The dinosaur exhibit was excellent and also very informative. The gems and mineral section was my second favorite as I am a rock collector. My husband, sister, and I were able to find some minerals that were even from our home town in Michigan. The human evolution exhibit was also very very interesting. The exhibit that I was not excited about at first, but that I found to be really entertaining was the local history part. It talks about previous populations of LA, local people, etc.The museum is in an excellent location. It is within walking distance to several fast food areas and parking is right across the street. It's also right across from USCs football stadium, if you are a sports fan. There is a very nice little garden area you can walk around in. There are some lemon, lime, and orange trees that are really cool to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefee818
50,Great museum,"Love this museum! Parking is easy and just across the street ($12). The dinosaurs section is great and really thorough, as is the gemstones section. Docents are around to answer questions or elaborate more on exhibits. The mammal halls are really cool and the displays are detailed and lifelike. I also love the section where you can watch scientists working on dinosaur bones! They have boards telling what each person is doing. There weren't any places to sit down and have a coffee that I noticed, which would've been nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiscozyskull
40,"Must see, over and over again.","All interesting exhibits. Some are permanent, others change. Location is great, as can see other museums and, of course, the Rose Garden. Dinosaurs are great for the kids, Gems and Minerals for the grown ups!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreggL14
40,Great way to spend a rainy afternoon!,"My husband and I were able to get free admission tickets as they offer free admission on the first Tuesday of the month. We reserved our tickets online. Parking was available across the street. (I believe it was $12 to park.) They have a lot of displays for dinosaurs and animals that lived in California. They also have an interesting display on the early history of Los Angeles. We walked outside and looked at the gardens. There were a few flowers in bloom but I think in a couple more weeks, it would have been much more colorful. We were there about an hour and half and pretty much saw everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stjohnbeachlover
50,So much fun with a 3 year old,"Our three-year-old grandson had the day off from preschool, so we decided to go to the museum to see the dinosaurs. The museum is full of wonderful adventures and hand-on experiences for kids. He was most excited about the dinosaurs. The diaramas were also great.We also had lunch at the cafe. The only down part was the $12.00 parking. Otherwise it was fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sa-i44
40,Dinasours and other wonders of nature,"Large dinasour skeletons abound, as well as many other natural animals in exhibits. Good place to eat downstairs also. Looks like they could use some refurbishing, or more aggresive fundraising, but what is there is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyS610
40,"Fun, learning and dioramas!",The grounds are beautiful! It's easy to reach by the Expo Line train. The displays are so good! I really enjoyed the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgrimmer
50,MUST SEE,If you can't get to the one that's shown in the Night of the Museum in New York then visit this one. Great place to visit with the kids or by yourself. Learn the history of California and see some dinosaurs. I was there for the Diamond Exhibition. This was exquisite and fun to see the Gems of the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214pepef
40,LA County History Museum,Considerating the competition in Southern California this Museum is a bargain at $12. It cost us $12 just to park across the street so $24 for Los Angeles is a great price. If you wanted to look at everything close you could spend all day in the Museum. It took me and my aunt 3 hours to go thru the Museum. You could also go to the California Science Center and/or LA Coliseum in the same day if you wanted to since they are right next to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psteelerfan77
50,Primo!,"Wow! This NH museum is amazing & we were duly impressed. The Dinosaur Hall is, arguably, one of the best (if not the best) dinosaur exhibits we have ever had the pleasure of visiting. In addition to hundreds of fossils, there are 20 complete dinosaurs. The museum also contains excellent exhibits on mammals, insects, birds, geology (rocks, gems), – literally, something for everyone. Enjoyable & educational experience not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
50,Visiting Dinosaurs,Great place to take your kids. Overall the visit was great. I would say the earlier you can make it out the better. I purchased the tickets for the museum online. The cost for a family of four was just under $40. Parking outside was $12. Overall we all enjoyed the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gteanio
30,Gem and Mineral Hall makes it worthwhile,I was a little disappointed in the NHM. The exhibits are a bit boring. With exception of the gem and mineral hall - that room is amazing and made the whole trip there worth it. I much prefer the California Science Center next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/servingyoursoul
50,Very Good,"I've been to a number of Natural History Museum and this is up their with any of them. Very well put together displays, lots of variance (from the history of California, to the dinosaurs), and very helpful staff. A staff member approached me while I was perusing the dinosaur exhibit and asked me if I had any questions which I did. She was helpful and pointed out other exhibits to me that were relevant to my question.I combined this with the nearby Science Center, it's a busy day but doable (perhaps take a break between for lunch). I did this museum second and it was much quieter and more pleasant, in terms of numbers of people and school groups, though both museums are fantastic.This museum is worth the admission though to get the most out of it, I'd suggest looking into their daily schedule and taking one of the free tours offered throughout the day. My tour guide was friendly and knowledgable and made for a more sociable visit, given that I was attending on my own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yewha
50,Great place to visit,"You can learn a lot, you will spend all day here and kids will ask you to come back tomorrow... Very good exposition!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243olgat
30,Nice enough,Some of the art pieces were interesting. The place wasnt crowded also. Not that great a museum one expects.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadeshagarwal75
50,Great family activity,"We took three young children to look at the dinosaur exhibits, including an effective live show. The only difficulty was having enough time to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filminglarry
50,General Science Exhibits,An amazing day trip for students & their families! Certainly covers all areas of Science Curriculum as well as California History.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dogmom2017
50,Lovely visit,from the spiders in the greenhouse to getting to see a whole room full of precious gems then of course the dinosaurs.I'm a history and science nut so I could and did spend all day here.with the mummy exhibit we saw last time was permanent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
50,My kids loved!,"We spend all day at this museum, because my kids like so much that the day ended up and we were there yet!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulosM663YE
40,fossils coming to life,"This was a place which attracted me, maybe because I love the move ""Night at the museum"" and I must say that this was most educational visit from my time in LA.We arrived in late morning and planned only to spend about 2 hours at the museum. In the end, we spent over 3 hours at this place. We should have allocated more time for this place.First and foremost, it has an impressive collection of fossils and life size replicates of animals. This allowed us to have a better comprehension in terms of size, colours and even textures of the animals. The only way to outdo this is by going to the zoo. But with a number of these animals already extinct, this was probably the best way to get to know them.We were served by a most knowledgeable and passionate volunteer. Nothing quite beats real live narration (with a passion). I will like to thank the ""senior"" volunteers for your passionate sharing and concern shown for our environment. This set a great example for our young kids. Though some of them may be too young to fully understand the ""continental drift"" but they definitely have caught some of the passion to co-exist responsibly after these interactions.Due to time limitations, we could not spend too much time to understand about the history of the land and headed for the Gems showcase. It was an impressive and wide collection of gems from different parts of the earth. I am also ""touched"" by the few families who have ""donated"" their collections for public viewing.3 hours went by in a flash and we had to leave without visiting the other rooms.Natural History Museum, please keep up the great work and know that you have left a great impression on us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkobog
40,See the dinosaur skeletons!,My boys always have loved dinosaurs and so do I! Great to share the dinosaur memories and other great exhibitions of fauna and minerals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
40,Dinosaur bones are the things to see,"Went on Free Museum Day in January. The place was packed. Recommend going to the museum website and getting tickets in advance, whether it is a free museum day or not.The highlight is seeing the different dinosaur bones. My five year old was impressed by the size of the fossils. Also impressive were the dioramas of mammals. Some of the exhibits, particularly in the dinosaur section, now have interactive video screens for information.Also outside the museum is a nice garden to walk around.If you want to save some parking money, there is a lot for $2 per hour across from the Memorial Coliseum, adjacent to a soccer field. On the day I went, the machine only took coins. The lot is about an 8-10 minute walk from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Great Day,The kids and I had a great time at the Los Angeles Natural History Museum. More exhibits than time permits for in one day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
50,Great Museum,"Great museum, with a variety of displays. Staff were very good and full of information when asked.There is plenty to see and the dinosaur exhibit is particularily good. Great place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
50,Awesome,Well worth a visit with lots of interesting exhibits. We loved the gemstone exhibit and the layout of the animal exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulietL164
50,Just GO!,It's a fun stop for families and locals alike. Be sure to also check out the California Science Center while you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLALALocal
50,GREAT INFO AND DISPLAYS IN THE DINO HALL,We spent all our time checking out the dinosaur displays and the mammal section. Excellent presentation with some superb interactive screens. A real bonus are the great 'docents' wandering around with a ton of knowledge.Really enjoyed our time even though it was pretty busy with all the family's there on a Sunday morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Great for kids..,and adult as well :)This is a wonderful place to take in the diversity of animal life around the world and across time. We spend there all day from early morning till the Museum close the door…highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruzzni
40,It was a great visit with the Endevour being shown,"We went to visit the museum specially to see the Endevour Spaceship.It was a great decision as we had a really good time and learned a lot. The place was full of children, still we had a guide who shared lots of amazing details and facts about the exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384renatan
50,Good times at NHM-LA,"We enjoyed our visit to NHM over this past weekend. I took my 11 year old and my mom, husband & I. We all had a blast; I mostly enjoyed reminiscing from the times I had visited in my younger years. First time for my son & husband and they really wanted to see every corner, every exhibit. I would mention, we have a pass we can come back anytime. I still went along with all the exploring and got me exercise for the day too. I highly recommend this place for all ages; of you're in LA it's got a lot of history to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eph2004
50,All ages will enjoy!!!,"We had a great time! There was a school tour going on that day, but we still had a good time and the attendants were very helpful in guiding us throughout the museum. The dinosaurs exhibit was amazing!!!!!!! And of course DIAMONDS are a girls best friend:). Adults, teens and children alike will truly enjoy themselves and learn at the same time! It's a MUST!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6089DGmariak
50,Something for all ages!,I been visiting the museum off and on for 2 years I live in Fla and seems this is a must on my list. My curiosity is on a high level. The spider exhibit was interesting to see Mr.spider doing what comes natural. The diamond exhibit was disappointing just 2 pieces but yes a pink diamond are rare . But the gem collection is excellent to wonder through. The nature lab is great. I was noticing how the kids were reacting. The NHM has excellent hands on for them with plenty of staff standing by to teach and show why it happens. The Dino exhibit I got to say is one of best in country. I visited all over the country and learned so much from NHM. My favorite is a fossil of Dino skin on wall exhibit. Of course T Rex shows himself too over your shoulder.. So if your in LA don't miss this. This museum shows what our world is about old and present and a look at what maybe the future. Doesn't matter if your young or old something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/varen
40,Likewise NY Museum,"I love US museums! this is likewise NY Natural History Museum (in a smaller scale, but still worth the visit)Dinossaurs and there are scientists working on dinossaurs bones in front of you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370katiah
30,I was bored,"I love this kind of museums and try to find and visit them everywhere. So I have enough experience to compare with. Believe me, this museum is pretty good, but, frankly, I'd never call it 'must see"" place in LA. The building is beautiful, but inside you find lack of interactive exhibits and old stuffed animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag394
30,Great for dinosaurs,This is a world class museum for dinosaurs and the dioramas were amazing! The layout was somewhat confusing and hard to navigate. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenhQ2954BV
40,"Interesting, but in need of a refresh","This museum has some great exhibits, but feels a little disjointed and could do with some decorating and some maintenance on some of the exhibits.Has the potential to be great museum, as they have shown with the layout of the dinosaur exhibition which feels clean and modern. Some of the other exhibitions such as the animals of America or the Birds exhibition could really do with some cleaning and brightening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigstuw
50,Great Museum,I've been to museums across North America and this is one of the better ones. Would highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcG6497JU
30,Stale museum,"Putting a small exhibit on the history of human evolution in a corner at the back of the museum is shameful. This museum can't compare with natural history museums in Chicago, Washington DC, and New York City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidDavidDavid
40,"Fun, learning experience for 1/2 day family visit with kids","We really enjoyed our 1/2 day visit to the museum with kids. The ""stuffed"" animals were an interesting (historical) way too to learn about different animals. The exhibit on ""dinosaurs"" and ""evolution"" was great (and we adults could have spent the full day viewing all of the exhibits)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestCoastFamiles
50,Interactive amusement,I loved this museum because you can find more than history in every corner. With their interactive activities for children and grown-ups you get amazed of how much you can still learn about history. A pair of comfortable shoes and you´re on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianc94
50,Dinosaurs!,A great place to bring children. Would be great if there's an audio tour as well. We didn't stay for the guided tour at 2pm so couldn't comment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VooVoo26
50,Great museum for the whole family,"We had a wonderful morning at the Natural History Museum with our 3 kids. There was something for everyone to enjoy. The exhibits were interesting, educational and of very high quality. Perfect for dinosaur enthusiasts. Very easy to get to using the metro rail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelfromOz
40,A must see,"We had lots of fun. It was really interesting for the kids, the garden wad awesome and the butterfly pavilion wad hilarious it is worth the ticket",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nin512
40,Dinosaur-tastic,A fantastic museum for dinosaurs and fossils. The building itself is impressive and a bit of an architectural gem. The stuffed animals did however leave me cold but the dinosaurs were well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueH2000
50,Interesting and enjoyable,"Informative facts and displays for all ages. Aviation and space displays were among our favorites. Historical exhibits are also neat. Pretty hard to mess up nature and history, unless you're claiming that global warming will signal the end of the earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alantU471YN
50,Historic visit done incredibly well!,"Debated on if I wanted to visit this Museum on this trip as I had many other ""must see"" places and I am oh so glad that I put this on the list. Wonderful history presented incredibly well. Enjoyed myself and by the comments of others around me so did they. This museum has specimens that any world class museum would lust for and their collection goes on and on. You have to wonder what kind of great stuff is behind in storage? Well worth a stop and certainly worth repeat visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
50,Very Nice Museum,This museum was absolutly awsome!! The displays are breath taking and set up soo damn well! I loved this place and would gladly come back to it again!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
50,Enjoyable,We spent over four hours and really enjoyed it! We arrived immediately after they opened and found many parts of the museum all to ourselves. That seemed almost spooky but didn't see many others our entire time there. Parking was $12.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryBM53
50,Great way to spend a day in L.A.,"Many highlights including dinosuar fossils, a gem vault, local historical artifacts. Plan on spending at least three hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredInCalifornia
40,Nice short visit,My stepdad & I stopped here on our way back towards downtown LA from Santa Monica. We had gone on a short visit to the museum but I have to say there's a lot to see & it was a quiet visit. We had gone on a Thursday. Prices were fare and very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WickedCakes
40,Loved the Rose Garden,"I love visiting museums. This one in Los Angeles is okay. I thought that it was a bit on the small scale in terms of their exhibits. I enjoyed learning about the different precious and semi-precioud stones found all over the world.When I visited, it was a weekday so it wasn't as crowded. I particularly enjoyed visiting the Rose Garden. My only complaint is that, the entry to the garden wasn't clear and there was construction happening around the garden. There were also quite a few homeless people hanging out inside and around the garden. I actually saw one homeless man giving himself a 'birdbath' at one of the drinking fountains.I still have mixed feelings as to whether I will visit again or not, especially the rose garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flamenquera
50,Dinosaurs,Visited NHM and Science Center in a few hours (didn't have much time). We visited the Dinosaurs hall in the Natural and the Endeavour in the Science.If you also don't have much time. At least don't miss that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kinop2015
50,Nice day trip by public transportation.,We took the Metrolink and light rails/subways to get there. It is well worth the time and the walk. It is easy to get there and once there easy to get in. Get your tickets on-line to make it really a wonderful experience. We saw the dinosaur exhibit and many other exhibits as well. Food is available in an on site cafe with a variety of foods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretf441
50,Dinosaurs and the history of Los Angeles,If you like dinosaurs you will love this place. The skeletons are a revelation - you can even touch some of the sample bones on the exhibit explanation plaques. There is a room where you can watch the scientists working on archeological pieces. This is an excellent museum for children with lots of interactive displays. We also enjoyed the Los Angeles city history section.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918reneef
50,Excellent museum with amazing exhibits,This museum is really a gem. Several floors with wonderful exhibits that have descriptive plaques that are easy for adults and children to read and learn from. The docents are friendly and informative as well. Great areas for young children (and adults) to 'touch' and learn. Definitely a must see when in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenayK1
50,Dinosaur Central,"I spent a few delightful hours here on a week day. The animal dioramas were well done and the dinosaur exhibits were amazing. They do a great job with timelines and putting these animals into context and perspective. It's pretty cool to be able to watch scientists actually working on the bones.Don't miss the mineral, gemstones and the gem vault! The docent outside that exhibit was very enthusiastic about her interest and had good stories to tell about many of the rocks. I also enjoyed the insect room.Fun place for adults and kids. A must see for dinosaur fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atwhit
50,"""We have a T-Rex...""","Having never seen a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, this was a real treat, and they had several. This was the primary motivation for our visit - and it was completely worth it, in itself, let alone for all of the other exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
40,Good place even for teenager.,My teenager was surprised by the latest exhibition. They found it appealed to their many senses. It was enough to keep them interested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/503peggyh
50,FANTASTIC family activity for the money!,"Woolly Mammoths! Tigers! Snakes! Jungles! DINOSAURS!!!! This Museum had a lot of everything that the kids loved, and the price (especially for the LA area attractions) was very inexpensive. This is a MUST for young children in school. Our kids still talk about it. Great educational experience. Really, you can't go wrong choosing to come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulMc_Marinaca
50,Great place,Had fun looking at all the history stuff. They have a little bit if everything to look at. Great times,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729chrisn
40,Lots of interesting stuff for small children,"I regularly go with my 3 yr old granddaughter and there's lots to see that she can relate too. Dinosaurs, especially (go on Thursdays for this). When she needs to burn off energy, there are lots of stairs and wide open exhibits. The food in the basement is better than most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS42
50,Great museum!!,"This museum was great! There was a lot to see and several rooms to go into. My daughter has always been into dinosaurs so she was thrilled to see all the displays and read about all of them. They had a cute little gift shop too. The traffic in Los Angeles is awful so it was a pain to get to but other than that, really enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bctabby

From beautiful, drought resistant, child friendly gardens to gigantic dinosaur bones to delicate, living butterflies and phenomenal geological gem displays, the Natural History Museum is an all star destination!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leighlaughing
50,Amazing place,"We've been here several times with the kids. And every time it is a great family experience. All the bones and dinosaurs and animal replicas are awesome, even for me as an adult. We bought the annual membership so we can go a few times a year. And the whole family loves it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547victoru
50,Endeavor was worth the visit!,I went just to go see the space shuttle Endeavor! That was worth the trip! It cost only $2 just to that which was worth it! The museum is donation entry and is worth giving too! Great place to bring your kids to have fun for a couple of hours for sure! The parking was my only issue.. They only take CASH!! :/. Finding an ATM is rough in the area so bring cash. One of my best stops in the week to LA!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHAWNROY1
50,GREAT FACILITY THAT TAKES SEVERAL VISITSWe wenet a c,"We went a couple of times over the last two weeks and really enjoyed the diverse and well presented exhibits. I think there is something for everyone in this great facility and add to that the special displays they rotate through such as the Butterfly pavillion and the Pterasaurs. Allow at least 3-4 hours. Take a break at the cafeteria and enjoy the outside gardens.The staff are excellent, Very friendly and full of knowledge. Great for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Must visit!,"Great place to bring your family. Kids would love this place. Don't get freaked out by some of the exhibits though. Parking is a pain, but once you get inside it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymesp2016
50,A GREAT place......,We went to the museum mainly to see the space shuttle. We went on a day that they offered free admission so not sure the cost......but I'd pay next time for sure. We spent about 4 hours total walking through the museum but we spent a good amount just with the shuttle. The ship is huge and very cool to see in person. A world class place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveVWV
50,Gorgeous Space,"Now this is a classic building with beautiful architecture. If you're new to Los Angeles, check this out! The moment you walk in, you're in front of a t-rex skeleton! Such an impressive site! There's a newly constructed cafe down stairs, a lot of fun interactive displays for kids and a rose garden to stroll when you're tired. The Natural History Museum is a fun afternoon getaway from the rigors of Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow

Excellent exhibit on rocks, minerals, and Mayan and Inca treasures. Great historical look at LA. A great family activity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
50,Incredible Specimens On Display!,"My friend and I decided to visit the Natural History Museum since I had not been there since the 1980's and I must say this is the best museum in Los Angeles. If you love animals, or dinosaurs, or birds, or are curious about the flora and fauna from North America or Africa, you simply have to visit this amazing place. This is the finest collection of preserved and taxidermy specimens that you will find anywhere in the world. YES, anywhere. There is also the most stunning collection of dinosaur foils, and a collection of gems and minerals that will literally take your breath away. If you are an adult, be aware that from time to time you will encounter loud, rowdy, and excited children of various ages so be prepared for that! If you are a parent this is a great place to take your kids to show them amazing sights from the natural world. The museum is open daily from 9:00 to 5:30 pm and you will need at least four hours there to make a stab at seeing everything. There is a place to grab lunch, and various gift shops to grab some trinkets to remember your visit with. Parking near by will cost you $12.00 and admission for adults is $12.00 and small children get in free! You can take all the photos that your heart desires and you will be blown away at the amazing sights you will see at this amazing Los Angeles landmark. If you are visiting the area put this on your list of things to see and do! You will love your visit! Also if you have a background in biology, THIS IS THE PLACE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodvilencia
50,Educational and Fun for all ages,"This place is huge and has a variation of collections. There is a rose garden outside that provides a nice scene for a stroll. The exhibits are well put together and stagger the imagination.

40,A great morning,We decided to visit here when we learned that they had a big dinosaur exhibition. I had my 5 year old son and my teenage daughter. It was relatively cheap to enter and we paid extra for the pterodactyl exhibit.We really enjoyed looking at all the dinosaurs and especially the fossils. It's not the biggest museum I've ever visited but we had a great time. The cafe had a very limited choice of food.We did enjoy walking around the outside area although it's not very big.Of course no visit to a museum is without a visit to the gift shop. They had a good selection of gifts which ranged in price.I wouldn't plan on having a full day here as there's not enough to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psuki
50,Paradise for Dinosaur Lovers and Children,"My family and I visited the museum. The Museum is close approximate to California Science Center, Rose Garden and The African American Museum. There were lots of Dinosaur and other fossils. They have a very impressive collection of gems there as well. The dinosaur puppet show was one of the MUST go and watch. Kids will have a chance to see Dinosaur around their height and size. The dinosaur will play with the kids and brave kids might want to feed the dinosaur. They had an interactive game in the Pterosaur exhibition hall. Kids will love catching ""Bugs"" or ""Fishes"" for the Pterosaur there. My toddler had a great time in this museum. He kept asking questions after questions about the exhibits. We realized a day wasn't sufficient for us in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseTan
40,We love this museum,"Some amazing exhibits, including the hall of mammals, the dinosaur hall, the butterfly pavilion, bug fair, spider pavilion. The gardens are beautiful too - so much for kids to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andienarwhal
40,Lovely place to spend an afternoon,"Lovely place to spend an afternoon. If you are coming from Europe or the East Coast, do not expect this to rival with any of the big science museums you've seen before. However, it is worth a visit and the rose garden is quite pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lunamax4
40,awesome,museums are truly amusing if you actually read the information! this museum has lots of information on dinosaurs and whales and other animals. we paid extra to have access to the pterosaurs exhibition. enjoyed that the most as there are interactive activities and documentaries to watch. and the gift shop of course couldn't leave without a gorgeous golden mug!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fozb703
50,Love,"I love museums and never get tired of visiting them. I really enjoyed the different exhibits, especially the dinosaurs. I don't know why I'm so fascinated with them but I am. The garden is very relaxing. I could sit out in it, all day. I would definitely come again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615shael
50,Fantastic Museum in my own city!,"I love this place. We are members and there are tons of things to do all the time...like Dino Fest, Butterfly Pavilion, etc. The volunteers there are great and now the train stops right there so you don't even have to drive. Old school meets new fun things to do Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
50,AMAZING PLACE!,I love this museum. Have been going there since I was a child. There is so much to see and the dinosaur exhibits are extraordinary. As well as the animals and gemstones. Amazing.! One tip though. If you go in the summer it is chock full with school kids. Better and quieter to go when school is in season.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889joannem
40,Nice way to pass some time,The exhibits were interesting. I went there as I was getting bored at home. Very educational and lot of exhibits. Though I thought the natural history museum in new York was better. They had a special exhibit going on which I didn't go to though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maybelater15
50,Just beyond history; Super cool!,"Can offer gala time for any school kid and parents.Amazing collections. Especially the Dinosaur skeleton and the lot of life-like 3D display items of animals from around the globe. Would like to visit again soon,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TapanBorah
40,History museum,When in Los Angeles try to make a visit to the history museum ..it's a beautiful area ..right next to the coliseum and adjacent to the beautiful rose gardens ...spend the day learning about California history ..and walk next door to the science museum and see the space shuttle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arkitex
50,food for your mind,"The location of the place allows you enjoy the history of the country and area, welcoming staff in front desk, shop available inside, nice with kids and fruits and veg garden in the back yard open for public",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evgeniia25
50,summer nights & more,"We've been to the museum a few times this year and each visit has been a little bit different and very enriching and interesting..The latest visit was part of their free summer nights event hosted by a local radio station and featuring food trucks, music and activities for the whole family.. We had a wonderful time!Earlier this year we went as a field trip for the early education center and the children all really enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs and the halls of exhibits.And even earlier this year we went as a family and took the train from Pasadena to the museum for a day trip.Every visit has been interesting and enjoyable!Because the museums are in the same general area as USC there are some fast food restaurants in the general area. The natural history Museum has a café near the garden area which is healthy and good. You can take the metro train from Union Station and with a couple of changes you can be at the museum before you know it.There is a fee to enter but keep in mind that the science center next-door is free.Would we go back? Yes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,World Class Natural History Museum,"The Los Angeles Natural History Museum is world class. having been a member for a couple years, I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place. I enjoy the displays, and especially the special extra temporary displays. Currently about flying dinosaurs. Well done indeed.So lets take the short trip insideStarting with the bones, beautiful and displayed so well.The dioramas are incredibly realistic and you cal feel like you are thereThe bird collection is one that rivals any.The private garden in so well maintainedThe words to describe the quality are escaping me now.A wonderful asset for Los Angeles and the planet.Get the Annual pass and get into the Tar pits for a year too! Its a deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
40,One of the best Natural History Museums I have been to!,"One of the best Natural History Museums I have been to! I was always under the impression every natural (history) museum would be the same more or less. But this one is very nice. It was a broad array of animals set up in their habit, and the made it very 3D like. Dont know how else to discribe it, but it looks very real compared to other museums. Very well done. Also the gem vault is pretty awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
50,Beautiful,"The grounds are what one really come for. The surrounding rose garden the historic coliseum, the ever expanding USC campus and the Olympic swimming facility. But the inside of this museum is the true gym. If you excite over architecture this building cannot be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
50,Amazing,Perfect for my 2 granddaughters to see the actual size of those dinosaurs! And sister in law to read about the actual LA history in the city she has been living in for 15 years!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/granniedish
50,Flying Reptiles from the Age of Dinosaurs,"I have no idea how many times I've visited this museum, probably the best of this type west of Chicago. This day our main objective was to see the traveling exhibit on Pterosaurs - flying reptiles often thought to be dinosaurs but really close relatives who lived at the same time.The exhibit is a mix of full size models, some 30 feet across and some a few inches, as well and real and cast fossils, simulators, dioramas, videos, and signage to explain it all. The exhibit will only be there a few more months before traveling on.We skipped the rest of the museum having seen it all recently, but the rest includes an excellent dinosaur hall, mammal hall, a great gems and minerals hall, birds, mammal dioramas, two halls on the history of Los Angeles, Nature Lab and Gardens, and more. While a separate institution, the Space Shuttle is a few steps away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,First ime visit to the Natural History Museum of LA County,"Another name for the Natural History Museum of LA County might be Dinosaurs Galore. The large dinosaur exhibits were gigantic and simply amazing. Chatting with the knowledgeable docent enhanced our visit. In addition, the halls of vintage animal dioramas were full of artistry in scenery and taxidermy. An assortment of other natural history collections and exhibits were fascinating. Combo tickets are offered to see the NHMOLAC and La Brea Tar Pits. If visiting both, I suggest seeing the tar pits/tar pit museum as a preview before visiting the larger natural history museum. As we were short on time, we parked at the flat rate $12 parking lot across from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shewoo
50,The building of knowledge,"I as a child only visited this museum twice. Those two times stuck in my head as one of the most happy moments in my life. This was my first museum and I never knew you can get so much info from a building. Now as an adult I really appreciate the purpose as a museum, to make memories. I always recommend the Gem exhibit many gems, minerals and just about anything we dig up. Obviously the dinosaurs are what the kids come to. Also the new history of LA exhibit is full of new facts I never knew of my hometown. I can't wait to bring my children to make these awesome memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chainsawmadman
40,Natural History Museum Visit,We had a small group of relatives and friends. Age group from 10 to 50. We had a married couple and single adult as well as teens. The exhibits were very educational and interesting. We loved it and will go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simrlty
40,Nice museum,"We arrived in the afternoon about 2 1/2 hours before closing. We paid the extra charge for the special exhibit which was a good exhibit but we felt the admission was a little high for the quality of the exhibit. Unless you are really interested in Pterosaurs the exhibit is a bit over priced compared to the rest of the museum. The exhibit was full of new discoveries and theories about these flying creatures. The entire exhibit badically informed you that you were wrong about everything you thought you knew about Pterosaurs! Other than the impressive models there wasn't really much to keep younger children's (ages 3 and 4) attention. There weren't many actual fossils or artifacts to view, most of the exhits were replicas. The dinosaur gallery that is included in the general admission was really impressive and definitely worth a visit. We had enough time to explore the entire museum in the small amount of time we had. We really enjoyed the large animal galleries, the detail and design was beautiful! We also enjoyed the gems and stones gallery, in fact, it was one of the most extensive collections we had ever seen and may even rival that of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago (one of our favorites) Much to our surprise, one of our favorite galleries was the one themed to the history of LA. The museum was well laid out and very accessible. There wasn't a problem with crowds or parking. There is an additional area outside of the museum that looked like fun but we weren't able to visit that section due to time running out and the museum closing. We felt like the admission price was a good value and parking was easy and reasonably priced as well. The only thing we would have changed was to have saved the $55 it cost us to visit the Pterosaurs exhibit and spent it in the gift shop, which looked amazing but unfortunately out of our budget after spending $150 on the entire visit (admission and parking). Definitely an interesting museum if you are in LA looking for a way to spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Backsi
40,Fun museum,This museum was very expansive. It reminds me a lot of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC. My only suggestion is that they have more interactive things for kids. Downstairs there was a room where kids could see live bugs which was fun. I believe that was the only live exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515
50,Wonderful n interesting,A wonderful museum. There is always a interesting and informative museum. It is a great place to take children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/900diane
50,Dinosaurs and so much more!,"After living on the Great Plains and having numerous mammoth skeletons to peruse in my home state, I was like a kid in a candy store when I saw the T-Rex and stegosaurus in the grand entrance of the museum. I was also a bit aprehensive about visiting because I was worried the displays would only accommodate children but I was gladly mistaken. This museum has a great display of various dinosaurs, dioramas of mammals, birds, whales, insects, artifacts, and more. The information was very interesting and presented well for both young and mature viewers. I was also impressed by the wonderful architecture of the buildings that house these displays. The museum is located on the same campus as the Olympic Coliseum and Space Shuttle Endeavour. Plan to spend most of the day in this museum alone and be sure to take a break in the nice cafe with a great patio and garden. I will definitely suggest this to my friends and family when they visit Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
50,Fantastic Times with the Fam,"This is a wonderful place to take in the diversity of animal life around the world and across time. My wife and I had a great time with our 7 and 11 year old boys exploring the nooks and crannies of this place. From ancient dinosaurs to regional wildlife, this place is worth at least half a day's time. Take your family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreakDash
50,Huge Natural History Museum with so much to see,"When my family visited Los Angeles over spring break we met up my cousin and his daughter to check out the Natural History Museum of LA County. It's a huge, impressive museum with so much to see my little cousin, who is 2, got a little tuckered out and we didn't get to see all of it.This museum reciprocates membership with other science museums, including the Kansas City Science Museum so we got in free, but if you aren't members of the museum or a reciprocal the cost is Adults $12, Seniors and Students $9, Children $5. They are open every day 9:30 -5 pm except 1/1, 7/4, Thanksgiving, and 12/25. Parking nearby did cost money too and they only took cash. They have a grill if you get hungry during your visit.When we first got there we checked out the dinosaur show. A lady was a scientist and she discovered live dinosaurs (huge costumed animals) with weather effects and lighting that was fun. It was pretty crowded though. Then we started wandering the halls. Much of the museum is just for looking, not interactive until the area near the store. They were halls full of hundreds of mounted birds. There was another hall full of mammals, and then some areas with reptiles and amphibians, plus of the course the amazing bones of dinosaurs. There was also a huge room full of gems and precious metals. My son was impressed with all the gold. He thought someone might try to steal it.By the store was a discovery area. There were insects and huge blocks to make a big tower (which of course we did). The store also had some fun things. We ended up getting some dinosaur shaped cookie cutters.This museum has lots of info on their signs and the specimens seemed to be in good condition. I hadn't been since I was a kid and was impressed upon returning many years later. This is a cool natural history museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelico8
50,Amazing!!,"Great place to visit, especially if you're a dinosaur fan. There is plenty of dinosaur fossils on display enough to spend a whole day exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanm868
50,Put the smart phone down...,"And come to this magnificent place of natural history. The kids will love the different exhibits throughout the museum! From the Dinosaur exhibits to the ecosystems with its different animals of different times in the history of the earth. It can get a bit crowded here, but come early and experience it before the rush.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014
30,Heart Breaking Museum Lots of Slaughtered Animals Stuffed,"I did not appreciate how bad this place really is. It has a very good dinosaur exhibit, but then it has endless rooms of dead stuffed animals. I can't say I really liked looking at extinct animals stuffed. I would go back for the dinosaur exhibit, which my kids loved, but I wouldn't go back for anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kat2020
50,Trip down memory lane.,"My family and I took a spontaneous trip to Los Angeles. One of our stops in LA was the Natural History Museum. I grew up in Los Angeles but moved to San Diego in 1991. It has been many years since I have been to the natural history Museum. As I entered the area where the elephants are posed, it took me right back to when I was a child. At first I did not think the location was very big but we spent 4 to 5 hours looking at exhibits and I don't believe we saw at all. Everything was well organized and my family enjoy their time. Even after many years the experience was enjoyable.Enzo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21enzos
30,Huge building,"I know it is a natural museum, but way to many taxidermy specimens. After a while I felt sad for all the live lost. The archeture here is really pretty, the displays that don't contain real specimens are well put together, the jungle exhibit looks dated. I thought the feature exhibit pteranodon was not worth the price paid, 2 four minute videos that repete the same info for the most part and 4 simulators, with no lineup control, and people over extending their welcome (taking too long of a turn)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommamia04

50,Lesser known la treasure,"this is a beautiful museum to see especially early in the morning where very few people are there. It's excellent for photograph because it's garden is well care.

40,Great visit,"What a well-kept and informative museum. So much to see and absorb! The dinosaurs are so cool-well displayed! The Gem section dazzles the eyes and teaches you all about how gems are made and classified. The Bird Hall is impressive--coming face to face with the majestic Golden Eagle on display, down to a tiny Hummingbird skeleton...so well captured. I will say they close too early! I wish they had extended summer holidays or even extended nights twice a week. Too much to see even arriving at 2:30p.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7

50,Excellent Museum,"This was my first trip to this Natural History Museum. It has an awesome dinosaur exhibit that goes into what they ate, how they developed, as well as how they were found.

50,Very educational,"This is in my opinion world class. Fascinating exhibits and abundant information.

50,Old and Cool,"The Natural History Museum (near USC) is an old (1913) and a great place to visit. Take the kids and see dinosaurs and all kinds of really neat things. Parking is not a bear, but there is a fee. The price to get in is fair, ($12 and $5 for kids). They always have a new exhibit to see and the garden around the area is wonderful. It is also a great place to just take a walk (but never at night).They have a huge gem and mineral collection which is very cool. Have a great time and do not stay around too long after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,A museum for everyone,"This is a very good museum located just across the way from USC on Exposition.Having a young one with an infatuation for all things dinosaur, we ventured out to spend a few hours of our day exploring.You are greeted by the skeletal structure of a large whale as you enter and as you make your way into the center court you are met by. T-Rex and Triceratops in all their fossil glory.The fossils are amazing and include items such as a stegosaurus tail and a triceratops frill that you can touch. There are herbivores and carnivores, things that swim, things with wings and claws, it really is remarkable. There is a Dino lab where you can watch fossil prep taking place. There is just enough with there being too much.Plenty to see from tigers and okapi to gemstones, birds, quilts and the history of California.This is a a family friendly destination with an all ages appeal.Gift shops are available and a small cafe offers snacks and a break for tired little and older feet.Parking is $12 as of this writing.This is part of a LA day trip to the area or just a great 2 -3 hour learning experience.Plenty of things to see, discuss and take pictures of.Enjoy the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IEOCRealReviews

50,T Rex lives at Natural History Museum,"LA's Natural History Museum is fantastic. Being from CA, we are used to having museums that are very good, but not quite on par with New York or Chicago museums. LA's Natural History Museum is definitely world-class. The stand out is of course the dinosaur collection - great displays with a variety of animals. There are multiple T Rex skeletons that get you in the mood to watch ""Jurassic Park"". The rest of the museum is fascinating as well - the dioramas of North American mammals and the minerals collection are substantial. And the café is delicious too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej

From dinosaurs of various kinds, to seeing an archaeologist (?) actually cleaning bones. the kids section was cute and simple, and offered kids an opportunity to draw and at a certain time, met staff and a live animal - we saw a turtle.

My other favorite exhibit are the gems and minerals.

40,Good Museum,"They have a good collection of minerals, dinosaurs, and Mayan/Aztec items but that seems to be most of the focus of this museum. It's good for what it has but I've been to bigger museums that have a better collection and they would take a full day to see most of it. This museum can be done in 2-3 hours but it is annoying to deal with all of the kids screaming and running around it because I personally like being able to focus on what I'm seeing without distractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881tamarav

It's hard to beat enormous dinosaurs, butterfly pavilions, spider habitat (OK that one made me a bit nervous!), cute live animal demos, and puppet shows all in one place! Leave extra time to wander the grounds, and if you have kids with you check the schedule online for fun, educational things to do with them In the summer there's 'cocktails in the garden' evening...Fridays I think.

Yes, you have to pay to get in, but that makes it less crowded than the next door science center. They recently re-did the kids interactive area downstairs and outside and we love it. Bugs, snakes, rats, waterfalls, gardens, good design, and great information. I have always loved the drama of the charismatic mega-fauna mammal halls on the main and second floors - dark rooms with brightly lit taxidermied animal exhibits. It's just cool.The newer dino area is awesome too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teatour_karen

With a three year old fascinated by ""dragons"" (dinosaurs) and ""rocket ships"" (space shuttle), what could be better than a little family fun at the natural history museum?Being a Friday, we hoped to skip most of the crowds the weekends see and ran snack into elementary school field trips.Most were gone by noon and the museum excitement died down quite a bit.Much of it is the ""normal"" museum sort of exhibits, but they have a great California exhibit as well.We had a good time and my son had a blast.

50,Paleontologist's treasure,"I really enjoyed visiting Natural History Museum last weekend. It has tremendous collection of fossils and they did amazing job putting so many dinosaurs on display. If you have a young paleontologist in a family I would highly recommend to go see T-Rexes. They have a 25 years old male, 14 years old female and a 2 years old baby.I really like Mosasaurs above the ceiling - I wish I had one like that :)They have a display of African animals. Interesting for kids. It was an exhibition of minerals there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtRussianMom
50,"Museum of Natural History - Los Angeles, CA","I found the collection presented in a very interesting manner, every subject was clearly identified and presented in its natural habitat. From the extinct to the animals of today - every one was in its place on the eveloutionary tree.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPBarrette
50,An excellent museum.,"If one is visiting LA, this museum is a star attraction & must be visited. Excellent information for all age group especially children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swisssam27
40,"It's pretty good, but not a patch on say the New York one.",The story of LA is the best gallery I thought. LA has a fascinating history and this is a good way to get to know it. The animal displays are so so. Nothing truly interesting like the Space exhibit or the Human Evolution gallery in New York. The cafe is pretty bad. I'd go but plan to spend no more than a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highexpectations2013
50,Fantastic little musuem,A wonderfully informative musuem with some great exhibits and a lot for the younger kids to get involved in. Still astounds me being from the UK on the size of the Grizzly bear in the hall. Wow thats one big bear! If you visit on the first tuesday in the month then entry is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMole
40,Great little museum,"I don't know how often you'd visit as it seems most of the exhibits are pretty standard, but it was a great visit for Free Museum Sunday. We went with our four year old and my parents. It was a lot to see, but she was kept interested the whole time. The cafe was alright, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAdventurer42
50,"Excellent Displays, lots of great information, Friendly Staff","This is an excellent museum, there are lots of things to see. Their dinosaur exhibit is really well done, as is their exhibit on the history Los Angeles and southern California.It is quite a large museum with multiple levels. The gem and mineral collection was quite unique and impressive. Would definitely recommend for families, maybe not so much for kids under 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GEOS30
50,Impressive,We drove there from San Diego and it was WORTH IT! It's impressive and huge with lots to see! Our kids ages 14 and 7 (at the time) loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolev405
30,If you love dinosaurs...,"Must see if you love dinosaurs.... Otherwise, it's not worth the entrance fee. My son loved the Dino fossils but got bored with the rest of the exhibit. My son and I would choose the science center anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214janinat
50,"If you love, or ever loved dinosaurs-- go.","One of the best Dinosaur collections I have ever seen, well laid out and beautifully displayed. If you have kids, ever met a kid, or ever were a kid, then you should go here. If you've seen Jurassic Park, Jurassic World, or have heard the term Jurassic said by another person at least once in your life, then you my friend should also go here. If you've ever, never or sometimes thought about prehistoric life-- don't miss out on going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MykeC166
40,A good experience....,"It was easy to reach here by the Metro - just connect to the Expo Line from wherever you are and you reach the Exposition Park at no time at all. Remember to show your Metro Tap Card to get a few dollars off the Entry ticket.The Museum is nice and kids do enjoy the Dinosaur Encounter show but honestly, their various walks are not interesting at all (quite a few walked away mid-way) and the so called ""award winning"" Gallery Exploration Tour is just very average. Its not bad, but its nothing special either. The Museum is far more interesting than their walks and shows!Its an interesting Museum but I wont put it as a ""must do"" when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kent19
50,Natural and wild life !!,"Excellent museum, great place even when you take kids with you.A close view of all nature great and you need great cardio to keep peace, on week days they have special price on tickets, some time they have 2*1 on main entrance, schedule your day and have a great day knowing more about our nature and how it works.Must see on your trip to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GDSC
50,Amazing History Museum,My husband and I explored THIS GREAT History Museum with our 3 grandchildren. It was fabulous watching the faces FACES OF OUR GRAndchildren as they learned about our world. We hope to spend more time in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436hannahg

40,Don't forget about free museum day,"I visited the Natural History Museum during one of the free museum days. I got there early in anticipation of bumping into school groups and large crowds. I've been to the museum many years ago before the recent remodel. I enjoyed roaming the quiet halls of the dioramas, dinosaurs and the outdoor gardens. I loved the area where you can watch people working on the dinosaur fossils. It's neat to beagle to see the work in progress and how much work goes into preserving fossils.The best part of my day trip was being able to enjoy everything without kids and crowds around.TipsFirst Tuesday of the month free. Don't forget to check the website.Go earlier to avoid the crowds.Have cash on hand for the $10 parking.Enjoy the rose garden, since you already paid the $10 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperienceMy31
50,Excellent for students and grown ups too,"There are so many things to see and enjoy; the ""jurassic salon"" is amazing as well as the figures of the first homo sapiens that appeared on earth. Next to it, it is the museum of the US Airforce where you can see the original Endeavour Spacecraft. For food and souvenirs? don't worry, you can find almost anything, but not all the time; they close early, particularly the food court.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dino2016

50,Wonderful learning enviroment!,"We bought the season pass for our Family, and have enjoyed the benifits both here in LA, and in San Diego. The LA Natural History Museum is huge, well laid out, and a delight for kids and adults. We visit at least once a month, and always enjoy ourselves very much!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lincolnk858
40,Interesting special exhibits,I visit several times a year based on special exhibits. The Egyptian exhibit was well done and popular. Summers and weekends can be crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9551CVpamelam
50,You Could Easily Enjoy An Entire Day Here,"This museum is huge & has lots of interesting exhibits. We came specifically to see the new Dinosaur Hall which was amazing, nearly on par with Carnegie's amazing collection & better than the Smithsonian. The newish Hall Of Mammals is also great. There was also a traveling mummy exhibit open during our visit which was also very well done. The museum also has a big collection of classic taxidermy dioramas if you're in to a retro museum experience. A few of the exhibits are very old and in need of some care but in a place this huge it has to be hard to get your budget to make ends meet. This is a must see for any museum aficionados.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSpeis
30,It was ok.,"I enjoyed the museum but went because it was free. Honestly I would not pay to visit but that is just me. I am not fond of looking at dead, stuffed animals. I did enjoy the gems and dinosaur exhibit. The museum itself is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reeselmt
50,Classic Museum,This is the kind of place that one thinks of when recalling classic museums. It is very cool. The mineral collection alone is worth the visit. Beautifully presented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markian
50,Really great museum!,"What a beautiful facility. Visited with my 6 year old boys. They're not only dinosaur nuts, but anything in nature.The prehistoric mammals section was great, as were the dioramas of modern animals.We spent some time with the minerals/stones checking out meteorites, gold and more.Once we went upstairs, we discovered a great display on birds as well as paleontologists working on partially excavated fossil remains!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeH14
40,Perfect for a rainy day,"I visited on an unusually cold and wet day in Los Angeles when I still wanted to get out of the house. The natural history museum is a two floor assortment of exhibits. There's the dinosaurs, north american animals, rainforest and birds, history of LA and gems (my personal favourite).I spent a good 3 hours here and really enjoyed it. It was $16per adult and parking is a 5 minute walk away, also for $16.I'd recommend visiting the Science Center of California next door too. Together that should keep everyone busy for the entire day, and I'm sure there is something that everyone will be interested by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicao140
50,Great for everyone,"The location is great, paid $12 parking and a few museums nearby. If you plan well, you might can do 2-3 museum in a day. We went to this place during the free entrance. The line was freaking long so we bought membership instead. It was miles long of line at front, when we went for a walk at the back entrance, the line was pretty short. How to get into back entrance, I had no idea.The museum is significant bigger than I thought. Dinosaur section was cool although it wasn't as cool as Utah's. There are so many things to see here, from fossil to rocks. The cafe has more selections than usual museum's cafe. Price was reasonable although you might have a little trouble to find a table during lunch time.My child enjoyed the room with real spiders. I don't remember what it called, but it would be a great place for children. If you tired being inside, go to edible garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manau-panau
40,Natural History Museum LA,Great attraction for young & old. Lots of different exhibits - young kids (& some older 'kids') will love the Dinosaur Hall. We loved the Mummies exhibition (now finished).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwi_Flyer-BF
50,"Great Exhibits, Stunning Facility",This place is great! Being a California native I'm always looking for things to do that are fun and informative. This place delivered on all levels. The dinosaur exhibit was what I went for but I came away with learning about California and mummies as well. Their staff was really helpful and they had expert knowledge that they shared with us and it really enhances the experience. I will be heading back to take friends and family when they visit from out of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themachine306
50,Los Angeles Natural History Museum Overnight Program Awesome,"This is a Must See for anyone especially the young ones. They have impressive dinosaur bones that are beautifully displayed. My kids enjoyed the interactive games in the Dino Hall. Their lifelike animals from Africa and North America are out of this world. Their Gem and mineral collections are amazing. They have over night Dino Camps that are filled with Dino fun like fossil making using plaster, Paleontologists scavenger hunts and lessons on naming your own dinosaur. Cost $75 but memorable. Free admissions on the first Tuesday's of each month. Admission $12 adult $5 kids $9 Sr/Student. Parking $10 if you park at the LA Nhm parking lot different from the Calif Science Center/ Coliseum Parking which charges $12 now for parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33jennac
50,Great afternoon out.,Travelled on the metro from Hollywood for a few dollars on a Tap Card. Drops you about 100 metres from the museum. 12 dollars each for entry and had food in the cafe immediately - which was OK. The museum itself has the usual mix of archaeological dinosaur displays through to stuffed mammals. There were archaeologists floor walking and one spent time imparting knowledge to us (got to touch an actual dinosaur bone fragment). Really fired up interest in the whole evolutionary process again. Top staff particularly the archaeologist gentleman.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
50,Huge Museum with Lots to see,"We took our 4 year old on his first big out of state vacation. The musuem has so much to look at. Almost too much for a four year old. The mummy exhibit was great but a little spooky for our son. Lots of interactive things to do. Real bugs, things to touch, screens to learn etc. Outside has a nice play area with waterfalls. Was there for roughly 3 hours but could've spent the day if our son wasn't done. We picked snacks and had a picnic on the front steps. Go early before all the field trips get there. Great place to visit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalloryG853
50,A great afternoon spent,"Loved this place, so much information and well preserved fossils and taxidermy. Would have liked to have spent longer but we were taking too long gendering and they closed very quickly!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahns2014
50,Natural History Museum,"Who does not like to see dinosaur bones. We were also honored to see the Mummy Exhibit while it was there. This was extraordinary, a little creepy, but still extraordinary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKoreenRS37
40,Dinotastic,"You're never to old to think dinosaurs are cool, right?The first thing we saw when we entered the Museum was a bone battle between a T-Rex and a Triceratops. This stopped the kids in their tracks! Even I couldn't stop looking at the 'Dueling Dinosaur' installation. Very, very cool.In one of the dinosaur exhibitions, you can actually touch a bone. How many people can say they touched a real dinosaur!We caught one of the 'walking with dinosaur talks'. Word to the wise, make sure your kids are ready for it, as the T-Rex puppet was quite scary. I was sitting on the floor with all the children and almost ended up with several (who weren't mine) jumping on my lap.I also loved the way the two main halls presented the stuffed animals in a 'window' of their natural settings. The bison display, in particular, was astounding.Most of the content was a little over the heads of our 3.5 year old twins, but they were fascinated all the same. A great way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celeste_NZ
50,Amaze yourself,"This Museum has it all, it has lots to do and look at and can keep you busy for a couple of hours, When I went there, they had a Mummy exhibition on, which was vey informative and quite interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistic09
30,Old Time Museum Has A Face Lift,"This is a great old time natural history museum is you like dinosaur skeletons, dioramas and gem displays. The museum was supposed to get a major overhaul a few years back but chose instead to redo individual sections of the museum at a time. There is now a great fossils exhibit, a Los Angeles history section, an insect hall plus a great children's section with hands-on exhibits. Don't miss the the native plants garden with the dining terrace outside the USC entrance of the building. Caveat: avoid the museum on weekdays from opening to 3pm as every other school in LA County is there on a field trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
50,I had no idea how cool this place was...!,"Not sure why we've never gone before, but a visit that included an 8 year old inspired us to check it out. And it was a ""WOW"" experience. In fact, we got so excited we joined because we knew we'd be back - kid guests in tow or not. This museum is a wonderful mix of old school (stuff animals in fancy diorama scenes...totally 19th c and restored so they're gorgeous) and new ideas (an incredibly fun hands-on 'lab' area). Beautiful building, wonderful exhibits, great cafe. Just a great family day out and we learned a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akimbeau
50,not bad for a History museum,It might not be the best it it's pretty good for LA. Very clean and well kept and a must see for museum lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel1108
40,Loved it!!,"The Dinosaurs are awesome. We spent most of our time checking out the dinosaur fossils. The wildlife (taxidermy) is really well done, nowhere close to the real thing, but awesome none-the-less. The huge collection of gems, especially the perfect ball of quartz, the gold nuggets and the fluorescent minerals, is terrific, and so is the section on birds. There were a few exhibits we missed, but would love to visit again. We also missed the show on mummies (you'll need to buy an extra ticket), which I hear is really good. If you are a student at USC, the general ticket is free of cost!Kids would definitely love this place! Very informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlokKarande
50,Excellent,I visited the museum on a rainy day in December. This museum is a nice place to be and has a lot of interesting things on display for anyone regardless of your age. The staff were very friendly too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeroen010
50,Dinosaurs!,"Dinosaurs aren't the only thing you'll see here but they sure have their share. Excellent displays of wildlife(taxidermy) around the world including an aviary's worth of birds, impressive mineral and gem collection, very cool interactive room, and pleasant grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanhN3065NE
30,Old-fashioned Taxadermy,"Seemed a little ""dated"" with ""stuffed"" animals in many of the displays, but the reconstructed dinosaurs were excellent. I especially liked the charts explaining which bones were ""actual"" and which ones had been ""created"" by the museum to complete the dinosaur. Don't miss the gem-room!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMRNJ
40,mummies and dinosaurs,"We did a very quick tour of the natural history museum and had a lot of fun. The mummies from Peru and Egypt were very interesting and the dinosaurs were a great displays. We ate at the café and we all had grilled cheeses and fountain drinks and loved the sandwhich and fries, for three people it was reasonably priced. Because of travel time, we could only do the one museum,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/407jamieb
50,This museum is interesting for everyone!,Glad we found this wonderful museum! Military and familes get in for free and seniors get a discount. I would definitely visit here again as I know every trip would be a different experience. Great for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2explore808
50,Don't miss out,"Keeping in mind that this museum is not free entry, I absolutely loved it! Definitely worth the money. I try to visit the history museum in each city I visit, and that being said this was one of my favorites. Staff were lovely and the displays were magnificent. Great for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71sianm
40,Go downstairs and check out the Nature Lab,"There's a lot to see here! The more modern stuff is downstairs but it's worth walking through the exhibits where there are taxidermy (stuffed) animals nonetheless. We like the Nature Lab. Lots for the kids to see. We enjoyed seeing the live animal they brought out as an ""animal ambassador."" That was cool and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovingNewAdventures
30,Mummies,Went so we could see the mummies. Very cool. The 11 yr old loved it. The gem room is really quite neat. Of course dinosaurs were fun to learn about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517DianaH
50,Dinosaurs!!! Imagine how the looked!,Dinosaurs! Lots of them!! Also had a very cool exhibit on mummies from Egypt and Peru! Great day! Easy to get to plenty of parking. Also in the same vicinity there are other museums to explore (science and African) the Science museum houses space shuttle! Very cool!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crush240
50,Mummies and precious stones and gems,"We were very lucky to have a visit to the mummies exhibition, a talk to people behind the scenes and see the precious stones part of the museum. We had visited before and seen the dinosaur part of the museum which is educational and so inspiring. The staff were enthralling parties of young children. We learnt so much about dinosaurs and how and where they were discovered. On this visit we learnt so much about the history of mummies and the way bodies were preserved and how technology has helped expand our knowledge. It is fascinating for people of all ages.The part of the museum relating to gems is also inspiring and has such a great collection that should not be missed.Anyone visiting LA should not miss this museum and anyone living there should become a member as it is a place that needs many visits and should also make use of the inspirational experts there. It was our privilege to meet some and we cannot adequately say how infectious their enthusiasm for their subject is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicholasBates
40,Great history of LA and skeletons of mammals,"Famous dioramas of mammals, skeletons of dinosaurs and mammals, LA nature exhibit, and a traveling mummy exhibit were great. My husband and I loved the history of LA hall, but my teens hated it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
50,Awesome Walk Through History,"This museum truly lived up to our expectations. For as long as I can remember, my 12 year old has been bugging me to bring him to this museum so that he could see the dinosaurs. He was definitely not disappointed. In our visit, we learned that there was so much more to this museum than just dinosaurs. My family enjoyed looking at the various dioramas of the animals and their habitats. The gems and minerals were fascinating and both my 12 year old and 21 year old children were entranced by the variety of rocks and minerals in the collection. We spent a large portion of our time looking at the all of the dinosaurs in the Dinosaur Hall. My son actually slowed down to read what the exhibits said. He loved that the skeletons were posed in such dynamic ways and he appreciated the opportunity to touch many of the exhibit pieces. Sadly, we did not get to see all that we wanted to in the time we had allotted ourselves. We were in the museum for about 2 hours and there was so much more that my kids wanted to see. We will definitely be coming back for another visit someday.Parking was reasonably priced and since we were there early on a Saturday morning (about 9:30 a.m.), there were plenty of spaces available right next to the museum. The museum does offer free admission every day to military id holders, but only for the service member. Teachers also get free admission every day, with a teacher id card. The cost to visit the museum is very reasonable, with kids costing $5 and students costing $9. This museum is definitely a place that we will visit again when we are in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shobufamily
50,Rainy day California adventure! Go early & pack a snack.,"Rain won't keep us away from getting out and having a fun kid day while exploring LA area. About a 50 minute drive from Orange County, left at 9am and arrived by 10am. No lines. Ticket prices budget friendly...$9 for seniors and students...otherwise $12 for adults. Also paid the extra for tour thru the Mummy display. Did that right off the bat. Runs every 15 minutes. Took 3 kids thru it (ages 7-11) and all enjoyed the interactive displays. Not crowded took our time. Once out, a line was already forming to go in. Toured the mammals wing...Dino lab...Dino wing...gems and minerals...birds... And thankfully, we could push thru ""lunchtime"" with some extra snacks I brought. Overwhelmed by 1:30pm. Our brains full. Got in car, threw some previously made PB&J sandwiches and snacks with the kids in the back, and headed home. We all had a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleAppleRed
50,More than you can do in a day!,"Many wonderful dioramas, interactive exhibits, nice cafeteria where they don't care if you bring a sandwich. Good for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poetrydancer
50,Fun place to learn and spend time,"I love this place. In fact the entire area including the NHM is a lot of fun. We have been here twice, and love walking through the halls and seeing the animals, bones, and other exhibits. The building itself is beautiful and can hold its own. The grounds are gorgeous and on a nice sunny day, it is a lot of fun to walk and explore. Great for kids, though, please don't let them run around unattended please.I will have to say some of the mammals need some restoration work. Their fur and skin have started to show wear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast

50,Museum,The place is similar to NY MET but on a smaller scale. Inside has the beginnings of hollywood and as agricultural area. Current show right are the mummies from Peru and Egypt.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirgilR_13
50,LA totally competes with the other great world museums!,"I first visited this great museum 20 years ago and it was a bit forgotten then... in need of some attention and ""love"". Wow, has it ever grown! They have completely renovated and upgraded it to a level befitting Los Angeles AND the history it showcases. It celebrated its centennial a few years ago and all of the upgrades that were made for that celebration are beautiful and effective. Great for families or just a quiet solo escape on a weekday afternoon. Good food, and the exhibits are incredible! Parents... bring your kids. YOU'LL love it just as much as they will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardrG7342OV

50,Excellent Museum - Hope to Return,"This was one of the best Natural History Museums I have been to. We only had 3 hours to spend there, but could have gone on longer. Just about every single exhibit was spectacular - the mummy exhibit, the most impressive huge and life-like dioramas I have seen anywhere, the dinosaur exhibit. The only exhibit that was less than fabulous was the spider exhibit, which had replaced the butterfly exhibit. There were very few spiders to be spotted, and none were much different than the ones you would see in your own home. I had just expected something more. But the rest of the Museum more than made up for that one slight disappointment. We had a wonderful guide for our tour, but unfortunately I have forgotten her name. The cafe was one of the best museum cafes we had ever been to. Everything our family group ordered was delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiBowers
50,Spectacular and you can spend all day there!,"This is my favorite natural history museum and I've been to ones in Seattle, San Diego, DC, Pittsburg, Chicago and Milwaukee to name a few. It took hours to get through it and every exhibit was even more interesting than the next. The gardens are beautiful and so nice to walk through as well. My three year old loved it so much he threw himself on the ground and sobbed when we had to leave as closing time rolled around. He wanted to live there. One of my favorite features is the beautiful stained glasses dome in the rotunda. It's a visually stunning sight to behold! They have plenty of dinosaur bones to keep your little paleontologist happy, but they also have live bug and spider displays and exhibits on the history of Los Angeles. We also went to the dinosaur puppet show they put on with giant almost life sized and realistic looking dinosaur puppets. My son thought it was great fun! Another bonus is we were given free admission with my military ID. I highly recommend going early and making a day out of it! You won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raincheck88
50,Surprised at how wonderful this museum is!,"Going up to LA for music at night and wanted to do something during the day. So glad we picked the museum. Was blown away by the dinosaur collection - the best we had ever seen and we have been to a few museums. If you like dinosaurs, you will be very impressed - I guarantee it. Price was good and we decided to pay extra for the Mummy exhibit (goes on thru Jan 16). Mummies from Peru & Egypt. Very interesting - glad we went but had mixed feelings about how we felt about digging up gravesites.We were there for 6 hours and did not see it all - will definitely go back. So much to see - dinosaurs, insects, local stuff, rocks & gems, butterflies (seasonal), African mammals, North American mammals and some incredible artifacts from mexico, central and south america and so much more. Had hands on exhibits for kids. They have a cafe but we did not try the food.Located by USC, public transportation can get you close or if you drive there is a pay parking lot right next to it. We will definitely go back and check out all the stuff we missed (need to spend more time at the hopi fetish collection). What are you waiting for? stop reading and go there now - you deserve it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenLeCreate
50,Spectacularly good,After visiting the Science Museum I ran across the plaza to the Natural History Museum. It was after 4pm so I was able to get discounted entry. The dinosaur exhibition was may main target and it was more exceptional than I anticipated. This time of day was fantastic as it was not very busy and I was able to stay until closing and get photos without anyone in the room. The attendants were really friendly and chatty. The museum is beautifully maintained and well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strategicallyb
50,Great museum!,"I love museums, and this one is great! Easily accessible via the train. The dinosaur hall was one of the best ones I've seen next to the one in New York. Great exhibits and nice staff too. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhonhagedorn
50,One of the best museums in Los Angeles!,"Located near the Science Museum, this is another gem you should visit. While not as comprehensive as New York or Chicago, it is an excellent choice in our area. Typical of other Museums of Natural History, you will see everything from dinosaur bones to gems. Whether alone or a family, there is something to be appreciated by all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seacreature1
50,Secret gem,Remember to go downstairs to view the 25 minutes video about the history of Griffith Conservatory. You might call ahead because the roof was closed when we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travl4fun_GA
40,Something for almost everyone!,"We went there with the intention of just looking at the space shuttle Endeavor, but ended up being drawn into many of the other exhibits as well. The Endeavor exhibit was wonderful with intersting videos and displays. The rest of the museum was fullnof interactive exhibits that were fun and engaging for sdults and kids, we spent about 3 hrs exploring. The ocean exhibits were exceptionally good. Would probably have given it 5 stars, but there were a fair number of the interactive exhibits off line for repairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234peggyp
50,A jewel in Los Angeles,"(Spanish below) They have a variety of excellent exhibitions that are educational and interesting to the whole family. The African and North American Mammals exhibitions are our favorite. The halls have habitat dioramas that recreate the natural environment of the animals in the exhibit. The animals look so real and is like having and eye-to-eye experience with the animals in the wild. My sons love it and we spend at least an hour there observing the animals and sometimes my sons sketch them. Another great area is the Natural Lab which is an interactive area where you can experience facts, exhibits and even live animals that live in the L.A. area. There you can explore and play to be a scientist. For those that like dinosaurs, there is a large new exhibit that is very interesting with computerized, interactive technology. I don't think I have enough space to share everything about this museum. The rose garden is wonderful! They also have an insect, spider and butterfly exhibits! You have to go and enjoy it! They also have an excellent program for homeschoolers several times a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayra-EstiloFamiliar
50,Dinosaurs,"The main reason we came all the way from San Diego was because they have so much more dinosaurs displayed and many other things. It was awesome! My child enjoyed everything that was in this museum, we all did. They even had a dinosaur show😊. It's worth the time and trip!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marelisr2015
50,My absolute favorite museum to visit in LA,"I have always loved this museum, it's always been one of my favorites. I took my (now) husband there for our anniversary (as he's never been) and we had a lovely time checking out the different areas and the fossils and animals. I love going in the summer as they have a butterfly garden set up outside for an additional fee -- you get to walk among flying butterflies, watch caterpillars cocoon and butterflies emerge, plus they sometimes land on you, lol.My absolute favorite part of this museum is the Rock and Gem section, where they have various natural geode and gem formations that are so amazingly beautiful. They also had a set up to take pictures similar to a green screen set up and we have pictures of us about to be eaten by a TRex, freezing in the Artic, and as bug specimens.All in all, it's a great place to go to learn and have a relaxing day, no matter your age. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishsiren32
50,Amazing!!!,"To see an excellent array of creatures from the past and present, this museum has most of it. Even the gem exhibit is worth seeing if you like exploring its creation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xelha92
50,"Never Boring, Never Old, Always Changing ~ Mummies from Peru to Egypt","Wow, the Natural History Museum of LA continues to amaze me. Never boring, never old, always changing, and staying relevant. Currently ~ Mummies from Peru to Egypt. Thought you knew mummies? Nope, you did not. Gotta see this exhibit. Take the time and check out the entire museum. One thing that I have always loved about this museum is its ability to make itself a part and parcel of the discovery. It's like a treasure chest within a treasure chest. Prepare for an adventure, prepare to be amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,"Fun place to take the kids. You will see some really cool stuff; al la ""Night at the Museum""","This place is literally right out of the film ""Night at the Museum"". A great place to take the kids on a rainy day or if you just want to get out of the heat.Multiple dioramas with specimens of taxidermied animals in their natural settings. Many MANY dinosaur skeletons. A Bug Zoo. Hands on learning. The architecture inside and out is amazing!!!This place does cost. The prices are minimal to keep the exhibits fresh and the place staffed. If you are a VETERAN, show your ID and get free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricStarcher1974
40,"Very underrated, good permanent collection","A surprisingly well curated collection, the Natural History museum also has a fine mix of seasonal exhibitions.Located in downtown LA near USC and the Coliseum, it's very easy to access on public transit and worth a visit.Of note, check out the hall of gems and minerals, and then whatever is seasonal, e.g. butterflies or mummies. The Natural History museum also has select evening events in the spring and summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannyrogue
50,never old,"saying it never gets old about a history museum might sound like an oxymoron. But, I have loved this museum for decades. It has fascinating exhibits, always refreshes exhibits, varies, offers science camps for children, It was also the site where one of our favoriite stray dog rescue pets was found, a collie that looked like Lassie and was very smart and good mannered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyh620
50,This Place Is Never Boring,"The museum is a short distance from downtown Los Angeles and once you enter, you will feel like you are in a different world. The museum's imagery and displays take you through a multidimensional historical tour. You will have a sensory and visual experience as you view history like you've never seen it anywhere else. Life-size and life-like animals depicted in what would be their natural habitat (whether ancient or modern), foster a learning experience like no other. The artistic renderings of nature are amazing in and of themselves but when you add the carefully placed models of the creatures - from very large to very small - you will be fascinated by not just the history and evolution of the human, animal and plant kingdoms, you will marvel at the variety within each particular species. Every section is a must-see but the natural gem exhibit and the bird exhibit are my favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajiR_12
50,Lots of things to see!,"Kids loved it - so much to see and with changing exhibits, it's fun to keep going back. Membership includes La Brea Tar Pits - good value. Loved the Butterfly Pavillion in August, going back next week to see Mummies and spiders!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munstah
40,Very entertaining and enjoyable!,"I very much enjoy the variety of exhibits and sights here. I especially enjoyed the collection of dinosaurs - very impressive seeing T-Rex and his many cousins on display. I also enjoyed the many gems and minerals on display. Learning about the scientific and biological history of our country and our planet was truly fascinating. I gave it four stars rather than five simply because the first and only time I was there, there were a great many school children there visiting on field trips so it was very crowded, very noisy, and distracting to try and listen to docents and volunteers. The next time I go back (and I will go back), I'd like to do some either during the summer or maybe during a holiday period in hopes the place is more subdued.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
50,Los Angelesd Museum of Natural History,This is a spectacular way to spend the day. We saw the Dead Sea Scrolls there as well as the Space Shuttle. What a terrific day we had. Be certain to catch the movie there as well as they are quite spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrykritzman
40,"Beautiful, clean building and tons of exhibits","This museum makes for a great afternoon outing. My husband and I especially enjoyed the mummy and dinosaur exhibits. There were three floors to explore, too much for most people to do in a day. Maps are provided, so just visit your favorite topics. The building and surrounding parks are beautiful and clean. There are lots of picnic places right outside. The exhibits were thoroughly labeled and interesting for adults, but I noticed many kid activities too. Outside exhibits and playgrounds offered places for them to expend energy. The museum is rather pricey, around $20 per person depending on which special events you'd like to see. (The mummy exhibit requires an extra fee.) However, the ticket price clearly helps keep the facility pristine and modern. This Natural History Museum exceeds many other museums I have visited. Last note, parking was easy to find, but it costs $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TT_ND
40,Wow.. perfect day getaway!,"In shock again... discovering my own city and finding some pretty impressive stuff! Brought my little one here on a day off from school and could not believe how much there was to see and do. I ran out of steam before we got to see it all! The Spider Pavillion was a tad flat (smaller than expected) but the rest of the place was simply amazing, especially the Nature Lab - so much to keep a young child busy! Bird section needs to be spruced up.. showing it's age but still plenty to keep the little one busy... shockingly! Parking was easy ($10) and lunch was ok (typical museum fare - a bit pricey but rather larger portions). I wish they'd put a coffee cart in the garden section... by the time we got there I was beyond exhausted! Make sure your young ones wear easily removable shoes.. there's a section in the garden where the kids can get their toes wet! LA is impressing me more than I expect sometimes!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Novemberpeanut

50,Mummies and Dinos and rocks oh my!!!!,"Just visited this awesome museum with my tween and his pal to see the new state of the art MUMMIES: NEW SECRETS FROM THE TOMBS"". Have to say it was well curated and interesting with both mummies from Peru and from Egypt. Also we had not been here since my son was little and there have been a lot of 'for the good' changes. More open and light and airy with nice grounds and also the park across the street has a fun apparatus for kids to play on and picnic tables. We joined the museum this time around (well technically we renewed and old one) and it was well worth it because the price of the Mummy exhibit was included in the membership. Now we can go whenever we want to just 'dip in' to the dioramas and dinos and wonderful gems collection or maybe hit the Spider Pavillion. Soon there will be a train connecting us in Santa Monica to the perfectly located already working station just at the museum. Def will return soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
40,"T,Rex and Sabre Tooth Tiger - who needs a theme park!","Kids love dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals and this museum has great displays of both. It is a must see for kids and adults alike. As out of town visitors, We tried to do this museum and Science Centre next door on the same day. While we saw a lot it was too rushed and each museum deserves it's own full day visit. They are ideal for kids around 8 years old and up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442darthd
40,Beautiful but crowded,We visited on a Sunday afternoon and the line to get in was soooo long! But it was also totally worth it. We went to the mummies exhibit and it was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e125angel
40,"Mummies and Spiders, oh my!","We came for the mummy exhibit and even tho I grew up in Chicago and the mummies are permanently there at the Field Museum, I had not see them in a while. The displays were very well done and easy to read with not too much text. They explained it very well the difference between Egyptian and Peruvian mummies. It was interesting and educational. Also we went to the spider pavilion which had many large spiders, of course some were not from around here so you likely will not have seen them before. It was definitely worth it to see them live and you walk through an outdoor pavilion which is a large tent and mingle with the spiders. They use this same venue for the butterfly pavilion in the summer and that is really fun to see too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MySeaBiscuit13
50,"Dinosaurs, etc.- A fun and interesting place...","We enjoyed the Natural History Museum very much. The dinosaurs we a great hit with the children. If you are going to downtown L.A., this should be included.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleElyseLesser
40,Wish I had more time,Had to get my nephew back for his name so we didn't get to see everything but my nephew loved it. He's been here a few times before but this was our first. I love museums so really enjoyed it.my only complaint was not enough staff up front it took forever to get our tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/585nikkil
50,Diverse collection and interesting activities,"Wonderful place to go for the day with friends and family. The dinosaur hall was recently renovated and now hosts three T Rex. My favorite room is the gem room, the presentation and quality of the stones is outstanding. There is a small but delightful collection of fetish on the stairs going up to the second floor which is worth a look. The museum hosts many children's events and first Friday events with live music and DJs in the main exhibition areas. Memberships for families are affordable and recommended if you like to go often and there is always excellent touring exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/champagnejane2015
50,Still fun as an adult,I had not been to the natural history museum since I was in grade school. Recently visited on a weekday and really enjoyed it. The dinosaur exhibits were by far my favorite. The history of LA was interesting as well. Lots of animals and bug exhibits full of interesting information for all ages. Sign up for the butterfly exhibit early if interested because it does sell out. Check exhibits open before visiting because they do change. Cafe had good food for a decent price. Prepare to stay for 3-5 hours to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linzerb709
50,Los Angeles Bucket List,The Natural History Museum has been on my bucket list for LA since I moved here. Don't ask why it took me 30 years to actually get there but I am glad I finally did.

30,"No answer on the phone, despite numerous attempts...","Will be visiting tomorrow, and just wanted to know if photography is permitted inside ""Mummies"" exhibit.

50,Natural History Museum of L.A.,"See the real fossil of Tyrannosaurus Rex, fully put together and looming large in front of you!!! There is so much more to see here, a truly educational experience. Easy parking across the street.",
40,An Amusement park adult can enjoy!,"Have plenty of money, lots of time. Wait times for the attraction same can be long, but we'll worth the wait.",
40,Great Museum!,"We went here on a Tuesday when it was free. Although it was free, they did ask for a donation to keep the free days going. While this did surprise us a little, it was not a problem especially after visiting the museum.We got there at 2:30 pm and we still hadn't seen everything by 4:50 when the security guard kicked everyone out of the Gems and minerals hall for closing.We hadn't realised how big and interesting this museum was, otherwise we would have arrived earlier.I definitely recommend visiting.",
50,A must see for everyone and anyone,"We recommend this to anyone anytime for whatever reason that spending time elsewhere this will be time very well spent and you will fell relaxed, refreshed when you walk out.True it can be tiring to go thru it all but hey there's coffee snacks, etchave a great time",
50,Something for everyone!,"What a beautiful museum! We spent a couple of hours here & only made it through less than half of this gorgeous place. Exhibits range from dinosaurs, to gems, to traveling art exhibits.The staff is friendly and eager to help you with any information you may want or need during your visit.I'm looking forward to my next visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLSpiteri
40,Great and keeps getting better,"I'm a member of the NHM and take my friends here whenever possible. The Board of Directors for the museum have done an excellent job to improve the overall visitor experience in important ways:* Events to attract the early-20's to 30's crowd: First Fridays with live bands late night museum visits during the summer, adult ""sleep-overs,"" a beautiful outdoor nature garden with interactive exhibits, and a cafe that offers healthy options for kids and kids-at-heart;* Updated exhibits: The Los Angeles discovery zone in the basement is perhaps the most important exhibit to be added recently. The interactive displays offer something for all age ranges, including live animals (watch mice run through tubes in the ceiling) and maps displaying the ever-changing landscape of the LA basin. The dino exhibit is also completely redone with huge, interactive displays. The changing main exhibit also keeps things interesting with unique cultural offerings. I'm still impressed by the detailed static displays of ancient animals on the main floor.I encourage the museum to continue replacing worn-out exhibits (i.e. the rare mineral room) to attract new visitors while maintaining the uniqueness and quality of the offerings.Your entire family will have something to do here, so I recommend bringing everyone. If you can, take the Expo Line and get off right in front of the gates. Parking is ample and underground, but is $10.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoLocal
40,Great museum for kids,"We have annual membership for the museum. Great place for kids, especially in the summer. My son has a very little attention span, so he does not spend a whole lot of time near the exhibits. The dino exhibits are really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648umag

And we felt very unsafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicalee9336
40,Dinosaurs are the stars !,"Great museum and very reasonably priced . If you are into dinosaurs you will love the displays here. Also, if you are an international visitor you will really enjoy the North American exhibits . There is always a special exhibition running : at the moment it is the butterfly pavilion and starting Sept 18 it is The Mummies. The Science centre is on the same grounds so go there too. Safety tip : do not walk along Vermont Avenue in a southerly direction from Exposition it is very unsafe !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamma_C_69
30,"Nice History Museum, same stuff, different town","Spent a couple hours here with my 12 year old son while we were in LA for the long Labor day weekend. We received free admission due to reciprocating membership at our local Science Center. Spent a couple of hours seeing the different rooms and their butterfly exhibit (we did have to pay a small fee for that). Having been to Natural History museum in NYC, Chicago and other large towns, on par with others and nothing overly unique about this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tber

50,Highly recommend -- esp for kids,I used to come here on school field trips and actually came here one school field trip with my niece. I ended up getting a family membership and it was totally worth it. We came to the museum several times and the membership allows entry to la brea tarpits aswell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzie_almeida
50,Great Dinosaurs!,"A great museum with a huge range of dinosaurs. Not a fan of stuffed animals or insects so the dinosaurs were the stars of the show. We didn't stay long enough but the entrance display pays for itself really, not to mention the displays inside with which the museum try to keep kids amused with interactive displays.It is quite a walk from the disabled parking spaces but wheelchairs are available inside. Food in the cafe was good and the gift shop was reasonable with a good choice of souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrudyO179
50,So much to see!,I was kind of hesitant of going since I wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out it was one of my favorite things I have done in LA. There are many exhibits from Dinosaurs to the Beginning of LA. And around the corner is Rose Garden and that was beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calimart
50,Not enough ways to explain how great a museum this is.,"A great place for everyone to visit. We were in LA for a Saturday night wedding, and had about 4 hours free time. We elected to go to the Natural History Museum for a special exhibit that my wife wanted to see, and I toured the rest of the museum. Everywhere I turned had a fascinating display.I guess I spent most of my time, like others, with the dinosaur exhibit. I have never seen the number, nor the variety in any other museum. They were well displayed. plentiful, with explanations that all could understand.The downside was that there was a ""blow by"" of the rest of the exhibits.Take a day, plan lunch there, and have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wgou
50,Butterflies and Dinosaurs.,"A favorite for LA Families, a spectacularly beautiful building in Exposition Park, makes for a great day. Nestled in the historic Rose Garden, next to USC, and the Colosseum and the Science Museum, it is reachable by the Metro from all parts of LA County. ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,First rate museum experience,"We took advantage of a ""two-fer"" --- buying a combo ticket at The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach that allowed us to go without additional charge to LA's Natural History Museum with our granddaughter (age 3.5). Everything about this museum is first-rate --- the exhibits, the ease of getting around, the helpful staff, the special exhibit (small extra fee) outside --- what I could call a butterflyarium (not sure of the technical name). Of course there is a huge dinosaur exhibit --- our granddaughter's favorite was the one I called the DonaldTrumpasaurus. Parking is easy but with a fee of $10 cash only (just adjacent to the museum).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trup
50,My two year old son LOVED it !,"I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't terribly crowded despite our arriving at 11:30 on a summer Sunday. It was very easy to maneuver around the museum with the stroller. Parking was uncovered and $10 and was about 150 flat yards from the entrance. There was no line to enter and my admission was $12. Kids under 3 are free. We went straight to the dinosaur exhibit as that was recommended to me by two other sets of parents. My son was enthralled. They had good fossil displays of T-Rex, Allisaurous, Stegasaurous, a huge plant eater (maybe Brachisaurous). Plenty of others also and some good pictures. Of course you are greeted at the Museum entrance by a huge fossil display of T-Rex and Triceratops. Great photo op. And speaking of photos, they do such a good job of taking the typical photo at the entrance. It cost $32 and included 4 different pics that I can duplicate at will. They photo shop in some interesting backgrounds and it really makes for a cute keepsake. The other major draw for my son was the mammal halls filled with taxidermy/stuffed life sized animals which are displayed as if in their natural settings. This was really very interesting and all are well-labeled. They do a great dinosaur show which is one guy talking about T-Rex for about 10 minutes and then a T-Rex comes out and chases him around a bit. Its a decent-enough costume that the kids are really entertained/scared. My little guy kept asking long after the show was over if the dinosaur was going to come back. It was a good mix of fear and fun. We were there four hours and didn't make it to the garden. The café on-site is fantastic with a wide variety of good food that is not overpriced. I think I paid $12 for a burger and sweet potato fries, which were both very good. You can sit inside or outside in a pleasant patio area. Overall this was a great day for the two of us and I'm sure we will return in a month or two as we are local. I believe annual membership is $49 or something like that and I probably should have done it. You can decide at the end of the day and apply that day's admission to the price. I couldn't recommend this attraction enough for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeathCalabasas_CA
30,Great Tour,Very informative and nice tour of Natural History. Great day trip if you travel to Los Angeles. Lots of interesting history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresamd0906
40,So Much to See! Loved the Garden!,"We arrived at 9:15 a.m. prior to the 9:30 a.m. opening. Parking is $10 and close to the area. We waited in a small line before going in. Since the museum had a busy week, we were told they only had maps in Spanish but with English highlights, which we took.The museum has a lot of space and exhibits are separated nicely. It is easy to spend a lot of time reading and photographing items. We spent three hours there and didn’t go upstairs and miss a few of the rooms.I was pleasantly surprised with the exhibit about Los Angeles and how it became a city. Of course, the dinosaur exhibits were great. The graphics and teaching signs were simple, and there were a few interactive items for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasBling
50,Among the Best of Los Angeles,"This is one of the absolutely best places in Los Angeles! It's new dinosaur exhibit, its renovated gardens based on what might have been the landscape of the dinosaur era, its Los Angeles wildlife section, its soon to be opened Los Angeles section, and its gem collection, all these cannot be done in one day. NHM has a very nice cafe at the ground level, and it is accessible by buses and by the Expo line which stops right outside the museum. I go here several times a year with and without children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec

50,Butterfly Exhibit was Beautiful,We had fun! The butterflies were beautiful and the kids loved it. We got some amazing pictures. I would recommend a weekday if you can pull it off to avoid the crowds. The museum was pricey and they didn't offer any discounts but you can easily walk over to the CA Science Musuem which is located on the same property and it's free! You'll have to pay a $10 parking fee (cash only) and then your set for a day of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emrlddrgn7
50,one of the largest natural history museums in the world,Ignore those old reviews that complained about outdated exhibits. Major renovations a few years ago. Modern large museum.

50,"Dinos, Gems, Dioramas, Eye Poppers at LA Natural History Museum","A pastoral setting in Exposition Park perfectly frames this classically styled Museum which artfully presents the W Coast interpretation of natural treasures - & does so splendidly. Large gallery spaces & access makes for ease in seeing the collections & displays. The up to date Dinosaur hall is a perpetual favorite as are the Diorama displays of African & American fauna - perfect for children, youths & adults - there's always a nice mixed assemblage of visitors. The upstairs Gem Hall is a treasure trove of amazing Geological beauty, as is the section on Gold in early California, Nice.and there's much more to see. The annual Butterfly exhibit is in progress now & is spectacular to walk through - as is the Spider exhibit each fall. I love to walk through the California Landscape & Gardens which face the street & Metro line on Exposition - easy on & off train access from the west side or elsewhere. The family always packs a small picnic & we sit under the big shade umbrellas at the stream pool / waterfall area to casually enjoy. Plus, there are 2-3 others museums & the huge Rose garden in Exposition Park & USC is just across the street. A nice change of pace from the beach.

We particularly liked the gallery that allowed the kids to explore what might be living in their backyard. Lots of hands on activities. We were there for over 5 hours and could have stayed longer but our feet hurt. I suggest getting there when they open, at 9:30am. It starts to get crowded in the afternoon. Parking is $10.00 and is nearby and abundant. There is a cafeteria which is clean and large with patio seating.

50,Wonderful day trip destination,"The first area we checked out was of course the dinosaur exhibit, filled with fossils, information and friendly staff to answer our questions.Since we have visited the LA Science Center (Awesome, FREE museum!) several times and had walked by the LA Natural History Museum, my six year old has been asking to come here. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $5 for under 13 yrs. So while $17.00 plus snacks and a long drive isn't the cheapest of excursions, it was definitely worth it as we spent a good 5 hours exploring and it was something he really appreciated seeing. Parking is $10 for all day as wellOn the bottom floor of the Natural History Museum an exhibit called the Nature Lab. Ooooo, very fun and we almost missed it! Everything is hands on stuff to do and we ended up spending another hour in this areaBasically, this area leads you on a nature walk of different areas of LA. Trace an animal you might see on your walk and do some bird watching. Look at creatures through a magnifying glass or microscope and learn about animals habitats disappearing over the years. See yourself as a rattlesnake does and a view a native bird close up.This is a wonderful way to spend a day while visiting the LA area with kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellokate81

Gems are so beautiful, I did not want to leave. We also took two free tours, Gallery Highlights and Gallery Highlights. Both were very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inna_lamesa
40,Excellent museum experience,"This is an excellent museum with well done exhibits. It is a little crowded during the school year with buses upon buses of school kids on field trips from all over the L.A. area, so plan your trip for the weekend or when school is on vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5800DTpeterm
50,Great place for little and big explorers,"Definitely a place to visit. 2nd largest Natural History Museum with an outstanding Dinosaur exibition. Especially the T-Rex collection with 3 different age groups faszinated my boys. Also the butterfly pavillion was a pleasant surprise. Very friendly and supportive staff, very nice cafeteria for in between rest with special kid's meals. We spent quite some time there and will return next time we're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dirk747
40,"great, free with EBT","nice place, some stuff is really geared to a younger crowd like teeny kids, which i get, but i wish there was more advacned material for adults. free with EBT card which is always handy, and gift shop wasn't actually half bad. good day all together!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kath1031
50,Lots of Exhibits for Different Interests!,"AFter visiting the Science Center, be sure to have time to visit this place! Lots of rooms to please every interest in your group from dinosaurs to gems and minerals!It might be a little chilly due to the a/c so bring a light jacket/sweater/sweatshirt! Again, ask volunteers questions to help enhance what you are reading and looking at. Better yet, let the kids ask the volunteers questions! Food and drinks not allowed in the rooms but there is a cafeteria on the first floor if you want to purchase food or bring a lunch bag! Hydrate! Like the Science Center, obtain a map and route what you'd like to check out! Take a picture of your group in case someone roams too far and have to be ""found""! Another one for the bucket list! By the way, Robert, one of the volunteers had the coat of a coyote which we were able to touch and asked him lots of questions! He was very insightful, informative and helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsHoku
50,Awesome!,"This is probably one of the best museums I've every been to. After paying our admission, we walked into the lobby and my child stopped dead in his tracks, speechless at the giant tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops fossils on display. As we walked from room to room we were all amazed by the dinosaur displays. The exhibits provided tons of up to date information. We were also impressed with the other animal exhibits and the history of LA exhibit. We only had two hours and found ourselves wishing we could stay way longer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noteworthymom
50,The best we 've ever visited Dinosaur museum!,"We arrived there around 10:00am as some suggestions to be there early to avoid the crowd. It was a weekday but there were many group of kids coming to visit this museum. The museum is huge , I wish I can be there all day ! The parking fee in the lot is 10 dollars a day. Because my family is big, it is better to become a family member of the museum and can enter both NHM and Page museum for free. We also got privileges in other activities too. There are many collection of dinosaur fossils and exhibitions to educate people with some activities that also entertain too. The volunteers in many spots in the museum also helpful . They are always there to answer your questions or explain more about the exhibition ,they even kindly take a photo for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Supani
50,Great museum for families.,I love this Museum. Just recently finished a major renovation and the exhibits are first class. The rose garden is amazing when in full bloom. Check out the butterfly exhibit when open during summer hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidayInnHollywood
40,Lots to see,"Crowded, but lots to see. Dinosaurs, insects, gems and gemstones, birds and a butterfly exhibit until early September. Have to pay extra for butterfly and folk art exhibits. Butterfly exhibit was sold out and we didn't know when we purchased museum entry tickets. Bummer. Better to visit on a weekday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelagentreplies
40,"Great Museum, Wonderful ""Grandes Maestros"" Exhibit","The building and gardens are spectacular - the gardens include fruit trees and herbs as well as bushes, trees and flowers. There is a gorgeous ""rotunda"" room with a statue of the 3 muses - Art, Science and History, I believe - check out the floor, ceilings, pillars etc. As soon as you come in there are a couple of great dinosaurs - in sort of battle confrontation positions. My favorite thing there was a wonderful exhibit called ""Grandes Maestros"" with folk art from 22 countries of Latin America, also Spain and Portugal. Wonderful brightly colored masks and puppets and carvings from Ecuador, Mexico etc. Exquisite textiles from all over the Latin American regions. They even had a bagpipe made in the town of La Coruna Spain, where I lived for 20 years - yes there is a ""Celtic"" tradition of bagpipes in a couple of regions of Spain - Galicia and Asturias. We enjoyed a tasty lunch with friends in the cafeteria. I hear they are having an Egypt exhibit this fall - we will be back! All the young people employed in the museum are bright, well-informed, articulate and enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418jeanl
50,Well Presented displays,This building is great to see on it's own accord but the displays are also extremely well done and the dinosaur skeletons are simply awe-inspiring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jensjourney
30,Busy museum with lots of noisy school children.,"This museum seems to attract large groups of school children, making the visit a bit chaotic. It is not a very large museum, but I was able to spend quite a bit of time visiting the gem and mineral exhibit, which is quite good, with beautiful specimens. This area did not seem to attract groups of kids, rather just interested visitors. The impressive gem exhibition also has large cut gemstones and the raw crystals from which they are cut. The dioramas of African mammals are very realistically done. I think for children, the highlight would be visiting the many dinosaur skeletons displayed in the main entry and the dinosaur halls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615edwards
50,Worth the visit,"This museum is free once a month, the first or second Tuesday. Parking is $10 unless you find a spot on the street and walk to the museum. The gem section is fabulous and beautiful. Quite a bit to see in this museum, bones and historical exhibits about Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,YES!,Definitely a place to hit up. All the exhibits are so fun. You can walk around for hours taking pictures and staring at all the cool things. Wear comfy shoes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bijou38
40,worth a visit,This is a nice museum if you like dinosaurs and fossils. There are other nice exhibits as well. The gemstone exhibits are particularly nice. During the week expect schools groups in abundance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlegto67
50,Great place for dinosaur lover,"The place is huge. It's got many dinosaur bones and models, bird, prehistoric animal, mammals and other exhibits. Definitely check out walking with dinosaur show where a person dress up in this dinosaur suit and do an interactive show. May sound cheesy but in a dark lit room with dinosaur coming out in middle of story telling many kids got surprised and didn't realize there was a guy inside. Great place and definitely educational but not as hands on as Science Center next door. But great thing is if your young ones get bored you can hop over to Science Center which is free. Parking is cheaper if you park at the Science Center at price of $10 compared to $15 at Natural History Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77
50,Terrific institution to learn or just amble...,"Fabulous interactive exhibits (especially on dinosaurs and local creatures) and native-plant garden! Lovely place to learn or relax (although excited kids can get in the way of that). Check for great evening events for adults , if you are not going with children. I would go more if I had the time. Check out their website and GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100lat
50,A great day!,"The museum was very nice. It reminded me of museum I had visited back east in Philadelphia and New York with the marble floors and large passageways. The variety of displays was nice. My boys liked the history of the Los Angeles area over time. It was interesting to see how the area had changed from its beginnings to present day. The employees were very kind and helpful. The gift shop had the regular items, but the also had some unique items like California Gold Rush items and resources for teachers which I enjoyed looking through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cataussie
50,Great setting,The recent revamping of the grounds of the Natural History Museum make a nice difference in the experience. The restaurant is enjoyable too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttempel
50,Dinos!,"Huge dinosaur collection, well arranged and informative. The kids loved it. It also has a bunch of animal displays (by world region). I liked the gem collection too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charles2B
50,Dinosaur Heaven,What a amazing place. My two boys were in dinosaur heaven. Will be back next time in town. The exhibits were great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phishan
40,Great Place!,It was my son's first time at seeing dinosaur bones and he was so excited!! He loved touching the bones and watching the video clips they have playing. He loves gems and loved their gem vault. It was all neat! Only part I thought was cheesy was the room with caged centipedes and stuffed animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiM506
40,The LA history exhibition is intesresting,"Pro:1. Location: Close to the California Science Center(CSC). But I would personally recommend spending more time at CSC.2. The LA history exhibition is educational. Tourist can learn about history of this region. The local people can see things, picture that are parts of the history.3. Dinosaurs part is good.4. Gems and mineral hall is good, as always.5. I love their elevator's doors.Cons:1.. The special exhibition, 'Grandes Maestro' and butterfly pavilion, ..... were not so special. I should stick to the main exhibition.2. Some stuffed specimen are displayed in rather boring way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmaco
50,Great museum for children,Great exhibits. Children love this museum. butterfly pavilion is a lot of fun. New gardens surround the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orange552015
50,Dinosaurs,"We enjoyed the trip to the natural history museum of los angeles, and my son and my niece really like the trip to the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silvina9258
50,An experience not to be missed,"If you are in LA then please don't miss this visit! The Natural History museum is an open field for curious minds and young kids!'Our 6 yr old had a great time with the free shows, butterfly garden and lovely demonstrations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeenaK91
30,"Really old, although the basement area has new exhibits.","I grew up in L.A., so I've been going to this museum since I was a kid (& most of it has not changed). If you're going to the Ca Science Center, then it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't say drive all the way down to USC just to go to this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
50,"Given a new facelift, but still a great place to visit, as ever","Plenty of interactive exhibits, but I still love the dioramas from the ""old school"" days from when I was coming up. Great fossils (the whale in the entrance) and the dino in the lobby. Take the kids and be sure to visit the butterfly garden or bug stuff (in season).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
50,Awesome Dinosaurs,There is so much to do and see here that you should spend several hours. The hall of Dinosaurs is amazing enough that you could spend several hours in this exhibit alone. The kids and you will both love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcO2461JB
50,Hall of Dinosurs,"I need not say more than the ""hall of dinosaurs"". Great museum and is a jewel in the museum crown of Los angeles. Yes, both of the Getty's are world class.But nothing beats a hall that is overfilled with dinosaur bones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,1st rate specimens,"Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, dinosaurs. If you have any interest or have a child with a current dinosaur obsession, this is your place. They have some of the best skeletons and displays a be seen. The rest of the mammal rooms, as well as, the excellent rotunda are wonderful. This museum definitely rivals NYC and Chicago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajdial
50,Get a Membership!,"You can use it at this museum and the La Brea Tar Pits and you get entry to special exhibits even if they sell out. Educational, fun and plenty of variety throughout the year due to special exhibits. The Butterfly Pavilion was amazing and we can't wait for the Mummies later this year. VERY cool and a must for parents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hammonpa
50,The Dinosaurs were so spectacular!,"I can only say this was a mind lowing experience! I was expecting a lot and it was more than fulfilled! From the minute you walk in this fine building, you get the sense you are surrounded by something special, and you are. The way the exhibits are displayed, the amount of space donated to each category is absolutely amazing. If you don't visit another attraction while you are in LA the Natural History Museum has to be top of anyone's list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
50,totally amazing,I have been there at least 30 times over the years the LaBrea tar pits are right there it is a beautiful place watch out for tar where you least expect it in the park area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadillacbluez
50,A MUST SEE,It was amazing. there is so much to see. Give yourself enough time to see it all. A lot of fun awaits you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosalief779
50,Dinosaurs were amazing,"We went because my son is all about dinosaurs. We all left in awe of the displays and amount of fossil and completed dinosaur skeletons. Our kids also enjoyed the gemstones as well, it was money well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HAM04
50,Bugs and more!,I have been a member for over 30 years and the annual Bug Fair was spectacular! The new nature garden around the museum is fantastic! A must see if visiting LA and the rose garden adjacent to the museum is in full bloom... BONUS!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doozer2015
50,Don't miss it!!,"I had heard the new-to-us dinosaur exhibit was better than expected, but words can't describe it. We were surprised at how many real fossils were included in the exhibit. Replicas are great, but seeing real ones really puts things into perspective. There are several rooms w/themed exhibits, plus a hands on lab downstairs. We spent a good 3 hrs there and could have done a couple more. We liked it so much that we became members so we can go back many more times this year! (The cafe downstairs has food that is reasonably priced and quite tasty. Their burger rivals many sit down restaurants.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliTR
40,Awesome place for children,"I visited this place with my godson and we had a great time. Easy to get to on the weekends, well ""signaged"", convenient parking. Try to get there early, there is a lot to see. They often have special exhibits, check ahead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManyPlacesToGo
50,Facinating for all ages,The downtown Natural History Museum is part of the museum complex. Don't try to see more than one museum in a day. You can spend hours here. The dinosaurs are amazing. There is a rock and gem area with some lovely gems. The dioramas are very well done and natural looking. Go upstairs to walk through a wetland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
30,A little confusing,"Took the kids for the day. Got a deal so got a membership as I didn't see us being able to see the whole place in 1 day. We did 'go through' all of it but wasn't able to spend a lot of time in any particular area. Layout is a little confusing. The membership desks need improvement. First, you have to go to the desk and check-in rather than show a membership card. Then (not their fault) their printer wasn't working so asked us to come back for the papers. We did this. When we walked by again, I saw little bags and asked for one. The girl told us it is for new members. I told her we just signed up and was never offered a big. What I thought was odd was that they don't give out membership cards. This membership also includes 2 other museums. Parking is also a little strange. Located next to the California Science Center so a bit confusing. Nice museum. Will go back to see other things. Not sure I will renew the membership though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mookix
50,Worth a day,"This place can keep a family, with or without kids, engaged for a day. Dinosaurs! Many other things and a beautiful vegetable garden outside which provides much produce for the lunch room inside. Other outside attractions as well. The attractions inside are unbounded but if you should tire of the place it is located in Exposition Park with many other attractions. Plan for an extended stay in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pixer1
50,Must-See Museum in Los Angeles,"There is so much to see in this wonderful museum. I like the fact that many of the older displays such as the dioramas and the bird collections have not been ""high-teched"" by using lots of computer displays. If you want to see lots of neat exhibits, make sure to visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howards704
50,"Always fun, educational, and engaging","I LOVE this museum. It's so well curated and well maintained. The Nature Lab is very interactive, visually appealing, and my kid can see and touch so many things. The museum is great for families with young children to spend a leisurely day. The cafe has decent food and the outdoor area is perfect for little ones to run around and burn energy. Great naps are guaranteed after a few hours here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgmadventure
40,Very interesting for kids ans adults,they had lots of interesting exhibits. was very impressed with their set up. great kids section lots of hands on. have a huge store and a restaurant that had excellent food. Dining inside or out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraP0
40,i love museums,I really love visiting museums and this did it for me. LA is one vibrant city and my visit to this museum really enhanced my visit. So much to offer for the history boffin. Friendly people all around who are happy to answer any questions and make you feel welcome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delainec
50,LOVE!,"This is by far my favorite museum in L.A! They have so many neat displays and things to learn that are fun for both adults and children. Not to mention they have a butterfly pavilion/ spider pavilion that you get to go inside and be with live specimens. Really recommend the extra fee to do that experience. Overall, I love this museum and will continue to visit it every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347summerw
50,Exhibit: Grandes Maestros do Iberoamerica - Banamex,"The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is now hosting a truly spectacular look at the indigenous arts and craft of the Spanish-speaking people of Mexico, Central and South America along with Spain and Portugal. Much of the folk art exhibited are composed of readily accessible items like clay, wood and fiber. But much like coal becomes a diamond, the craftspeople exhibited here have taken those common items to an uncommon level of beauty, complexity and symbolism.I believe there are 1200 pieces representing around 600 artists. Each one in its own way and style is truly a masterpiece. My wife and I collect Mexican and Central American folk art and were so pleased to see two artists whose pieces we have collected represented in the show. There may be one other, but we cannot remember the name of the ceramic art piece that we purchased last year in Nicaragua. We will have to check upon returning home.Credit needs to be given to two very deserving groups. First the Museum for making the commitment to take on this exhibition and curating is so well and especially for training and having available such a exceptional group of young people to guide us through the areas. They are excited about the Folk Art and just bubble over with enthusiasm.Overall, this project and many, many others like it would not exist were it not for the awesome stewardship of Banamex. This institution has been recognizing Grand Masters of Folk Arts for some 19 years now. This single entity had raised up the Folk Artists of their region for the world to see. It is an amazing trip to take. Do so if you can!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshubert
50,Awesome day just relaxing and wandering the grounds,"My neighbor got a living social deal for 3 people admit. It's 10 bucks to park. Go early. easy traffic and it gets crowded after noon or 1. The Butterfly pavilion is opening this week I think but there were SO MANY BUTTERFLIES and Hummingbirds outside it was beautiful. Such cool plants outside too. AND a HUGE Rose garden. inside is awesome, too much for a day really. The gems are awesome, gold and diamonds in rough and polished form. so many colors. We checked out the new Mexican+ fold art exhibit. I loved seeing all the textiles. Bought some cool stuff ( way expensive though ). We ate at the cafe, it was ok, register gal was not friendly. I wish they had a fun cool cafe with really good food and interesting drinks and snacks. if we were not starvin' I would have passed. It's a perfect day trip, just eat somewhere else. I mean you have all of downtown LA to choose from. Unfortunately the place we choose before getting to the museum was closed which is why we ate at the museum. My personal fav thing in the museum are all the birds. they have a huge selection and great dioramas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idrawart
50,Big dinosaurs!,"Great Natural History Museum - good exhibition on the history of LA, and a particularly impressive dinosaur section. Which is what everyone wants in this sort of place, isn't it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlynEvans
50,Little Museum is Large in California History,"The Southwestern Museum of History has an extensive collection of Native American artifacts and historical documents relating to California history going back to 1800. They have a historical documents room that contains photographic history collections equal to none. Containing original glass plate and daguerreotype plates, the viewers can get a feeling of what the old time photographers went through to document the old west. A fun delight to the senses is their variety of prepared foods. They offer smoked brisket, buffalo burgers, a variation of street tacos,and freshly made salads and sandwiches for all tastes They even have a children's menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
50,Amazing collection of fossils,"My son just loves dinosaurs, so while in the science museum we took the opportunity to visit the Natural History also, and we weren't disappointed. There was a $35 entrance fee for the family of 2 adults, 2 children, but I gladly pay it to see their Fossils and Dino exhibit. But it doesn't end there, there is a Dino lab where you can watch them extract fossils, there is a live animal exhibit, mammal exhibit, insects, fauna, flora, there was an Inca exhibit and a California history exhibit. We had to rush through it because I wanted to beet the LA traffic and get back to Vegas but you could spend several hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dimenion3
40,Don't go during Easter break,"This museum is great for kids and adults alike, here is something everyone will like. My daughter joined and takes her toddler every couple of weeks. He loves the dinosaurs. I enjoyed seeing the stuffed African mammals, most of which I had never heard of. You can easily spend many hours here and there are nice outdoor places for when you need a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzycruzsc
40,A DAY at the MUSEUM,"We brought our youngest grand child here when she was 3 but she was overwhelmed with the dinosaur exhibit. We brought her back now she is 6 and her older sister is 12. They both loved it! So very much to see. The exhibits are appealing to all. Bathrooms are a bit of a problem always lines and a wait. Food prices a bit high for most families. Drinks $3, hamburgers 9, sandwiches 6.75. So over $40 for 4. Parking $10 in cash. Plus admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag
50,A scientist gives it 5 stars,"I visited this museum with my husband, a biologist who is very picky about his science. He gave it four thumbs up, if you count mine. We loved the old museum feel of the entrance with dueling dinos and then the rotunda with the incredible stained glass dome three floors up in a magnificent ceiling.The dinosaur exhibit was outstanding, not going only for the ""sharp teeth gee whiz make the kids go ooh"" glitz but highlighting the science and how the discoveries are painstakingly made and brought to our sight. We spent over two hours there.We wish we had had more time, but it was a Sunday afternoon and we got there around 1. We thoroughly enjoyed the gem and mineral pavilion--wow!-- and the gardens. Beautiful wildflowers blooming.We took a peek into the mammal exhibits and realized we were running out of time.We even made an extra donation to the museum in appreciation of the excellent work they do. Thank you, Natural History Museum of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corisline

40,Very cool,Great museum. Lots to see and explore. They have a lot of dinosaurs too and the butterfly garden was my favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natzelim2014
40,Beautiful Building and Great Place to See Dinosaurs,"We had a nice time when we visited. I love that it is in an older building that has some beautiful architecture. There are several different wings and exhibits in the building, but the highlight is definitely the dinosaurs. It's great because it is two levels, so you can get a relatively close look at the bottom and tops of the dinos.As most museums, this place is family and specifically stroller friendly. They even had a docent in the dino area talking to kids and letting them touch a dinosaur tooth! But, be prepared for the small elevators since the building is so old.There is parking for ~$10 in a garage for the museum as well as adjacent lots in Exposition Park. Just be aware that some of the lots are cash only!This place was great, but if you are looking for more hands on stuff for the kiddos and no entry fee, I would recommend the California Science Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,Great place,"I feel like this is a great place to bring your children to. For one, it's informative. But it's also fun, so they will not get bored. I mean, who doesn't love dinosaurs?What's best about this place is the fossils. They also portrayed the North American landscape really well, putting different biomes in different displays. They were very realistic and beautiful. Make sure to visit the African biomes too, they're great!There is also a place where children can do mini science research. I think it's pretty fun, and I spent around an hour exploring the gadgets, informations, and activities there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenalim
40,We only had an hour,"Parking = $10 + Admission = $12 per adult.I thought the price was a bit steep, and I was underwhelmed by the first exhibit we wandered into - but it did get better. The LA exhibit was only ok. It starts with the Spanish-Mexican history and the environmental destruction, which seemed odd. When it gets to the Hollywood stuff, I expected more and better (but the Disney animation table was ultra cool). I love minerals and gems, and that exhibit was pretty good (seriously, who donated their gemstones to a museum?!?). There was a video about the fault lines - it was a bit dated, but the info was really good.That was all the time we had. Then we headed to lunch at Figueroa Philly Cheese Steak...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kadels_s
50,Great for kids and adults alike,"There is so much to see and do here it is a great place to visit. We had about 4 hours of time and it was far from enough. There is an entire area for kids to experience science. There are dinosaurs, stuffed mammals, gems, different land types (swamp, coast, plains), history of LA, and much more. Then restaurant is decent with a variety of premade and on demand items. We would highly recommend going and look forward to going back on our next trip out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmanuel954

50,Day at the Museum,Great exhibits and the museum is constantly being upgrade. Recommend weekends because there are a lot of school field trips there during the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacke625
50,Step back in time,"This place is quite a gem. One can spend hours here simply enjoying all it has to offer. The gem/mineral exhibit is unbelievable, simply world class. Yeah, some of the dioramas are a little cheesy but the general theme of the facility just oozes history. There is a lot more to see on that campus, take time to visit the rose garden and other attractions.-Word to the wise...don't plan on doing too much exploring in the local neighborhoods. Aside from USC, the surrounding areas are questionable and not the safest.-Plan on at least 6 hours or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyP563
50,1st visit with new Family Plus Membership,"Hi everyone! Wow, awesome opportunity came my way to buy this membership for $80..covers 2 adults.up to 4 children plus an extra floating card for anyone you wish to invite.

50,La Brea Tar Pits,"Our last visit here was 30 years ago, and unfortunately our planning was off and the museum was closed. This visit was planned much better, arriving mid-morning and not having anything locked-in afterward, we spent 2.5 hours exploring the museum and surrounds. The exhibits were well presented, a one hour (free with admission) guided tour went through the grounds, well worth the time to have all the history explained and to see tar pit excavations in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0bertw49
50,Lions and Tigers & Bears and So Much More!,"A wonderland literally! Fun and FUN and informative!! Dinosaur exhibit incredible, and friendly helpful staff guide you through",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214suzanc
40,Very educational,This place is ideal for weekend get-a-away with family and friends. We had so much fun and learned so much visiting this place. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominicg532
50,What a great museum!,"The museum reminded me of a mini version of the Smithsonian Natural History Museum when you first walk in. If anyone is into dinosaur's this has an excellent section of a multitude of exhibits. Very good. The museum has many exhibits to view. And the gem/mineral area is awesome. As well as the bird section. There is a lot to learn from reading the placard on each animal on display as to where they originated, some of which I never knew they originated in North America. There is a nominal fee to enter but well worth it and parking is right there. You can easily spend a full day if you take the time to read every placard at each exhibit. It tends to get crowded as the day progresses so go early. The outside architecture is very beautiful and a large lawn area in the front of the museum. A museum for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
40,Very nice museum for kids,"The museum has a huge collection of dinosaurs an they use a ""hands on approach"" so that kids understand how they were discovered, how they lived and died, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TudelaMartins
30,Not bad!,Dinosaur exhibit was great! Plenty of real artifacts and lots to learn. But not much else too see. It would have been nice to see some general world history. It was very scattered,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826emmaf
50,A Night at the Museum for real!,"My grandsons attended this event as a birthday gift from me. I wanted them to have an experience rather than another toy to get bored with. They had a sleepover complete with flashlights, a nightwalk, slept with the animals so to speak. They were filled with stories for me the next day and related all the facts they'd learned.They loved it! We will be doing this again as I'm told this is a regular event at most of the museums. A wonderful experience for youngsters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRoselius
40,Loved the Dinosaurs,"A really great Museum with an awesome Dinosaur exhibit, so many animals too, kids really loved looking at everything and we found it really interesting. There is a cafe there too so if your feeling peckish or need a break its a nice place to sit and take a breather. Bundle it with the Science Centre and you can make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtaust19405
40,Dinotastic!,"Well if you love dinosaurs, this is the place to go!My boys (10, 7 and 2), and my husband loved it. We went between Christmas and New Year. It was quiet when we got there, but got much more crowded around lunchtime.The layout of the buildings is a little confusing ( feels like several buildings mashed together) and as a result it is lacking in lifts and restrooms.We had a small snack at the restaurant, chilli fries, and they were good. Not overpriced and freshly cooked.Parking was $10 and not too far from the museum.We'll go back when our two youngest children are a little older.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneB909
30,Some Good Features,"Come for the Nature Lab and Nature Gardens. The building's architecture is special and best viewed from the rose garden. It is still missing a good children's area, but the butterfly and spider exhibits in the summer and fall are worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whetherperson
50,Great Place for the Family!,"This museum has an excellent dinosaur exhibit, a stunning gem/mineral collection and a comprehensive exhibit chronicling California's history. When we're back in the area, we'll visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPSCalifornia
50,Best Dinosaur Exhibit,"One of the things my husband and I love to do in every city we visit is visit the local Natural History Museum. The LA NHM has the best dinosaur exhibit we've ever visited. It's interesting, informative, and interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6205QQlisam
40,Dinosaurs are fabulous,"Needed to kill some time before a flight so came here. It's great, the dinosaur skeletons are fabulous and took me back to memories of my young schooldays!! The stuffed animal exhibits are great, a reminder of times gone by, you feel like you are in the night at the museum films!! Friendly staff- recommend a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozziebd
50,Great Museum for family and kids,"Very enjoyable, cute dinosaur shoe for kids. staff informative. some interesting live anim las and it was not too crowed. by all means visit the science denter too as it is right next door..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDogAz
50,Great Place,I wish I had more time to check this museum out I spent over an hour in the Gem vault alone my daugher and I went into every wing to look at all the animals and skeletons it was amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212ricks
50,Worth a Visit,Their dinosaurs hall is awesome..They also have mammals exhibition.Easy to find parking spot but a little bit pricy ($10).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dianti25
40,Dino hall is the highlight,The dinosaur hall is a definite highlight. Huge variety of dino displays that kids surely love. Go early to avoid the crowds and I recommend you get the membership pass. The membership pass also gives you free access to the La Brea tar pits just a few miles away.Some of the other exhibits are a bit outdated and it needs a food area to get some grub for kids. Outdoor area is a nice surprise for a garden tour and has a view of the rose gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allmotorking
50,For kids and curious adults alike,"I really liked this museum, although some of my friends did not and found it boring compared to the California Science Center that has some activities for you to do with your family.The NHM really tries to show you the dinosaurs or the animals of the wild wild west for real, creating beautiful fake sceneries for you to imagine what being under their skins felt like.We spent 3 hours and I do not regret my visit. Truth be told I'd probably not go again unless there's an interesting exhibition going on. It feels like one visit is enough and then there's not much else to see again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/appolinnaire
50,wow,Upgraded dinosaur hall is wonderful. Lots of docents to answer questions. Nice cafe . Parking is confusing and handicpped access has a few glitches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emeritus24
50,Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County,"Very clean and interesting, many things to see for everyone. Be ready to spend some time there because there's a lot to see and you don't want to rush. We are members of The California Museums of California so we only pay a yearly fee and don't have to pay at the doors, guess you could say we sort of get in for free. Good place to spend the better part of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmguinm
50,Going Natural in L.A.,"Not every beauty is fake or unnatural in the city of Los Angeles. Don't believe so? Think again.Discover the history of L.A. and the world, including the prehistoric dinosaur world at the very attractive and inviting Natural History Museum, in Exposition Park, by USC.As one of the staple museums of the entire city and the largest natural history and science museum in the U.S.A, NHM is a must-do for all of you history and science buffs with a few hours to spare in your downtown adjacent L.A. visit. Take that, Smithsonian! Split up into several halls full of rare local and world artifacts, NHM is a delight for the eyes and mind.If you or your kid goes gaga over dinosaurs, you'll love the several dino-riffic skeleton figures displayed in the magnificent Dinosaur Hall. There is a dedicated Dino Lab that works painstakingly on fossil collections.Those who are fascinated with Los Angeles as a city, NHM is a perfect place to discover the city's origins and historic highlights from the 18th century to recent past of late last century. The ""Becoming L.A"". exhibit is a massive permanent feature of the museum which features an impressive 3-D model map of the city, several actual artifacts owned by citizens like clothing pieces, a life-size grizzly bear creation (Grizzly bear is the state animal of California) and much, much more.Take the family, friends or go solo here. Get to NHM easily by Expo rail line. It's about a 10 min ride from downtown L.A., at 7th/Flower St. Parking can get problematic. It is somewhat limited in the museum lot and street parking costs $10 (cash only).Notes:The museum was open in 1913.Admission*: $12 adult, $9 students/children. Big school groups are free (lucky locals)* subject to changeCheck out the website for more details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marinarena
50,"Usually not a museum person, however this is worth your time","This has to be one of the coolest museums I have ever been in. We opted to head to the museum on a rainy day and we were really glad we did. You could spend hours in here reading about the animals and exploring. They have a cool area where they show devices and ask what they could be used for and in the back they explain what the items were used for. the fossils of the animals were truly amazing. They resurrected many animal skeletons, they have a huge skeleton where they used fossils found at various dig sites and it is like the Frankenstein skeletal rebuild of fossils. There are also outdoor gardens and such, alas since it was raining we did not get a chance to go outside. There is a fee for the museum however, the day we went was a Tuesday and the admission was free. They did ask for a donation though and we were happy to oblige.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiouspb
50,One of the best museums!,"I loved it! Even if you don't like going to museums, this one is a must see during your trip in LA. There is a lot a lot a lot to see! Dinosaurs' lovers will be thrilled! They have an incredible collection! I could go on... But you should see it by yourself!One of the best museums I've been to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
40,Great for kids and adults,Exhibits from space travel to autos. Well layed out and presented but several appeared shop worn. Ok parking. Rather a bad neighborhood. Nervous about leaving my car in such a poor area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432brucej
50,Perfect is you want to learn about our ancient history and see real dinasour skeletons.,"The place is located just outside of the heart of down town L.A. right next to the USC campus, and has a very large variety of thing to see, from the insect zoo, to spectacular displays of animals in beautiful replicas of their natural habitat. The parking can be a little tricky if you go during the summer because it's a very popular place to visit and the other attractions such as the Los Angeles memorial coliseum, other museums and the beautiful rose garden can make it a bit crowded but if you have the time there is always a lot to see. So bring you walking shoes and lots of time for there is a lot to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielR84
40,Great for dinosaur lovers!,"Admission plus you must pay for parking. The grounds are beautiful and the dinosaurs are amazing. Bring a sweater, it was cold! Ate at the restaurant which was ok. Overall, an interesting, informative experience. They had an extra exhibit that was extra than the admission which we decided not to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djz032070

40,"Some parts stellar, some need repair","The crown princes of any Natural History Musuem are dinosaurs, and this museum has a good collection. They have one section showing three T-Rexes - a child, an adolescent and an adult. In the center of the museum, there's another T-Rex wrasslin' with a triceratops.Upstairs, there's a ""living dinosaurs"" presentation I didn't discover until after they were finished for the day. They've got people running around in dinosaur costumes and judging by the terrified children bolting out the door, it could be pretty intense.I also enjoyed the extensive gem and mineral exhibit. Lots of purty rocks to take in.There's also a section dedicated to the history of Los Angeles, taking you from the old missions, through Charlie Chaplin (his costume is on display) and beyond.Some parts of the museum seemed far newer and more interactive than others. Kids are sure to find plenty to see here.There were some areas that seemed broken down, particularly the bird section upstairs. Lots of burned out lightbulbs.The layout of the museum is very confusing. Be sure to grab a map or you're guaranteed to miss out on a lot of cool stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BowmanInc
40,"Parts were great, others need updating.",We loved the natural edible garden and the landscaping. We did not like the obvious holes in the LA history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmlvngstn
50,My Niece had the Time of Her Life!,"This particular area is full of educational activities! You will go out of this museum enriched with knowledge, theories and history not just of LA but different aspects. I got to give it to my niece for totally having her time and enjoying every piece of artwork and how it affects our current society. This place reminds me or it resembles the Smithsonian Museum from the movie. Good value for money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieConti
40,Educational Trip for the Kids,"We went here for the Veteran's Day holiday. I have not been here in years. This museum is part of the Exposition Park complex. The dinosaur exhibit was very nice. The gems & rocks display had a good variety of specimens. The early Los Angeles exhibit gave a good look into the history of the city. The museum is not large so you can go through it in 2 -3 hours. The place covers 3 floors with a small outdoor garden display. My only complaint is that the restrooms are tiny for amount of kids running around, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheapasian
40,History in LA,"The natural history museum is history in itself. The building and architecture is amazing! This is a must see in LA. We tend to be a society of tear down and rebuild so when I see amazing places that have stood the test of time and been preserved they need to be celebrated.This is one such place where both children and adults will enjoy spending the day. I had been here many times as a child growing up and have very find memories of visits with school and family. I enjoyed bringing my family back to share that experience with them.The halls of animals are truly breathtaking with the architecture of the space. The few things that surprised me were that many of the items on display especially in the gems room were dusty and could certainly use a cleaning. These gems and minerals are beautiful and some of that was lost under dust. The other was that many of the displays and rooms were very dark making it hard to appreciate the items on display. Many had lights that were either burned out or not turned on, thus it was almost impossible to see and learn from some of the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardenmomof2
50,Totally Amazing!!,"Probably one of the best places that we visited in our 2 week stay, not too busy first thing then all the school children arrived and peace was shattered, all the staff that we interacted with were very knowledgeable and interesting, the huge dinosaur exhibits were truly breathtaking, didn't do the spider exhibit outside too scared, the rose garden also worth a mention, looked and smelt wonderful, the other side of the rose garden is the Science museum also well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
50,"Meet your new ""old friend""","Going to the Natural History Museum is like visiting an old friend, even if you've never been here before. The new Dinosaur Exhibit is fabulous and well designed. The weekend live shows with people sized muppets about dinosaurs and the Ice Age are great for adults as well as kids. We went to the spider pavilion recently and saw some REALLY big spiders up close and personal. They run the exhibit just before Halloween every year. It turns into the butterfly pavilion in the spring. But I also love the Hall of Gems (what girl wouldn't?). Both my husband and I loved their new exhibit called Becoming L.A. We learned more about our city's history in that short tour than I knew in many years of living in the area. And, I kid you not, their museum store is also a fun stop. We find unique gifts for friends here every time we stop by. Because we stop by several times a year, a family membership is definitely worth it to us. That way, we don't have to kill ourselves seeing absolutely everything. We can have lunch, visit a few old friends, and see some new special exhibits and call it a day. A very pleasant day at that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100SusanS

50,First Time Visitors,"We just visited this museum for the first time! Our kids loved it! We had the pleasure (at least pleasure for our two boys) of visiting during their spider exhibit.

50,Walking amongst the dinosaurs,"Excellent! We (me, DS 13, DS 10 & DD 10) enjoyed our brief visit to the museum. Kids loved the dinosaurs (and me to be honest). The architecture and décor was pretty fantastic too. Got some great photos. We had a combo ticket that we purchased at the Page Museum good value. Spend more time than we did but we had a pretty jam packed day, glad we didn't miss it though. Staff members were available and happy to answer kids questions about the authenticity of the fossils and skeletons.

50,"Love, love, love this museum","This place is perfect for kids and adults alike. My toddler loves coming here to see all the creatures in the nature lab as well as the dinosaurs. It's a beautiful building located in a beautiful park. And the staff is very friendly. I always learn something new when I come and I often bring out of town visitors. If you don't have kids, the absolute best way to experience this museum, in my opinion, is by attending one of their first Friday events. An open bar and DJ in the North American Mammal Hall? How cool is that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisone228

50,Awesome dino fossil collection,"I really enjoyed my experience at this museum. It had an impressive gem and mineral collection and a really great dinosaur fossil collection!

Although I'm not a fan of taxidermy, I have to admit the collection of mammals (North American, African, etc.) is quite fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IHeartTheobromine
50,Great place for science.,"This natural history Museum has a variety of rooms with various themes. They have ancient art, Jems , dinosaur bones, etc. Parking is about $10 and highly suggested. It is by USC and although the surrounding cities have a high crime rates this particular area tends to be safer. There are many tourist and I have never had a problem. I go here often with my little sister. The science Museum is also located next-door and it's free. There are rose gardens outside and plenty of places to relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_Medina

50,Love going to this place,I would recommend becoming a member if you plan to go more than once a year. It is definitely worth it. There is always something exciting going on and plenty to enjoy. I usually combine it with a visit to the Science Museum- it is doable in a day. I love the new outdoors area and the entire lower floor. They did a fantastic job with the design and execution of it. I also prefer the food in the NHM - much more healthier choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freemaee
50,Must go...,"This is a great museum where you can enjoy a whole day. dinosaur, mammals, minerals and diamonds... Lots of stuffs to see. I spent a whole day in the building. Parking is easy except for game day( This museum is so close to USC stadium. In game day, parking is difficult. You can chose metro line to go there instead.) In normal day, it cost 10 dollar(cash only) for a day. If you finish this museum quicker than you expect. There is another famous museum, California Science Center, which is about 5 mins away by walk. You definitely can spent more hours in that center. Overall, it is great museum and a must-go-to-visit place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haog24

40,VERY GOOD MUSEUM NOT ONLY FOR DINOSOR,"they are eventually three natural history Museum of that kind : in LA., London and Paris at ieast the one I know. The LA one has superbe presentation and you will spend 4 to 5 hours to have an overlook at this very important museum. You would discover the Dinosor time until the 20th century and colonization of America, with also a part dedicated at ancien civilisations of the American continent. Its eventually the piece who should be extended,giving a better idea of what happened from XV and XXX century, before industrialization and colonization from europe.

40,The Dinosaur Exhibit Was SCARY!,"I traveled to the museum with my extension class from the University of Redlands and had such a great time. When we got here, we were told that we simply could not miss the Dinosaur exhibit, so we made sure we were there on time. This exhibit was a live action show in one of the darkened exhibit halls and it was very memorable. When we got there, the hall was full so we stayed closer to the back. There were tons of kids sitting on the floor waiting for the show and we all talked and thought this was geared for small children and not adult educators but we wanted to watch it anyway. Once the show started, we were all blown away. The narrator is on stage and very animated. He tells the story and then the T-Rex ""puppet"" comes in and the show just takes off. HOLY MOLY, that thing looks very life like, and was charging at the crowd. The kids were screaming, and some even started crying. It was not a soft approach to the dinosaurs, it was the real, gritty, scary story and it was great. This was definitely a must and I am glad I went in. One word of advice: If your kids are small, sit back and not right up front. I did see quite a few young boys who were in heaven watching that show, and a lot of girls who took off to find comfort in the back with their parents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beandipshell

50,So Awesome!,"We took our seven-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter here in the beginning of August. It was only $34.00 for all four of us (plus $10.00 for parking), cheaper than a movie or a few games of bowling! It was amazing. Even my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and plan to take the kids back again sometime. The dinosaur fossils were cool, but our favorite part of the day was the dinosaur encounter complete with docent and robotic dinosaur! The gem hall was beautiful and very educational, I never knew how many gorgeous and amazing things grow inside what looks to be a boring, ugly rock. There is so much to do here, we didn't even go outside and we were there for over three hours. My son really loved the Nature Lab where he was able to use some microscopes to check out some bugs. The museum is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend a trip here to people of any age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packyourheart

I got some really great photos of both exhibits, and even got a good photo of a humming bird that was feeding out on the patio in the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cafox74
50,Love dem bones!,"This is a must visit for anyone coming to L.A. You won't see a museum like this anywhere in the world.

40,Schedule Enough Time,I was visiting for a USC football game and had the morning open. Wandered over to the park and stumbled into the Endeavor exhibit. The exhibit itself is fascinating but it seemed as if it was dropped into the middle of the Eco exhibit. The flow was awkward and the signage was difficult to follow. The Eco exhibit was free and the Endeavor was $2.00. I really enjoyed seeing this. If I go again I will plan my time to see other buildings. The architecture is beautiful as is the rose garden.Check the football schedule--traffic is terrible but the museum was uncrowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jema_T_12
50,Never loved a museum like this one,"This museum not only for kids. You will enjoy going around the museum by yourself or you make use of the daily tours that they do starting 1PM on top of every hour.If you're SoCal local and you have kids, i suggest you get the membership for $89 and that already covers 2 adults and up to 4 kids.They do occasional shows like what's happening right now are the birds and Pompeii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0chard
40,Can't see it all in one day.,"Absolutely love this place - It's a bit heavy on Dinosaurs and a bit light on birds (my particular fav) and other animals, but still an absolute must for your visit to LA. The cafe is actually very good and reasonably priced. Probably the best disabled accessibility places I've been in LA - elevators and accessible bathrooms aren't tucked into far corners - I really appreciated that. The place is huge, clean, interested and you'll need a good two days to see it or a ton of energy and about 10 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morgan6157
30,Went with a pre-school class field trip...,"The caveat here is that we went with my daughter's pre-school class so I think the experience would likely be different if we had went as a solo family. That said, this review is based on that experience. The entrance with T-Rex right there was definitely an ""oh wow!"" moment, but that's largely where the excitement ended. Since the museum didn't have a lot of hands on activities, the kids attention level was quite limited. Any effort on any parent's part to try to educate the kids were futile since the kids were more occupied with their friends and finding ""things to do."" Even as an adult, I felt there weren't a lot of engaging exhibits. I enjoy natural history museums and found this one to be very, very dated.The Dinosaur Hall was fairly interesting. Getting up close to see the team at work on some fossils great to see. The Dinosaur Encounters show definitely got the kids excited having the puppets so close to them. For those that were paying attention, one got a great history lesson on the science of paleontology.This museum deserves another trip with just our family as I know my daughter is always interesting on how things work and from where things originate. Going with a group of young kids will be a challenge given they will be more distracted than focused to learn something new.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpn1997
40,had not been there in years,"I had not been to the museum in years. It is newly refurbished. The building and architecture is stunning. It is clean, well organized and we enjoyed our visit. My granddaughter was not crazy about all the dinosaurs but it was a spectacular display of bones, fossils, artifacts and information. We also went to the Butterfly Pavilion but since it was the last day, I have to say, there was very few butterflies and I was disappointed. If they were going to have less butterflies, perhaps they should have charged a bit less. Overall, however, the museum was great, with helpful docents and workers. The gardens were also spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsie49
40,Worth it!,"Plenty of parking even though it was very very crowded! $10.00 parking fee. Free entry to the museum but you pay for certain sections. We paid half price to enter the museum since it was closing. The ticket lady was nice enough to tell us ""if you wait 10 minutes your tickets will be half off"". From 3:55 pm half off. We paid $21.00 for two adults and two teens. We flew through the place to see it all and made it! Enjoyed it there are a lot of cool things to see.We also saw the space shuttle which we paid $2.00 a person for. We bought the tickets online the day before and printed them out. The Pompeii exhibit was sold out so we didn't see it. You can bring a picnic and eat in the pretty garden. Or there is McDonalds and a deli in the food court.Nice place to spend the day with any aged children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bowiebow
40,Nice medium sized museum.,"This is a nice museum with nice traditional style displays, like the 'hall of mammals', etc. My children and I enjoyed the experience. We did not visit the butterfly house as we have been in another one recently. The architecture of the building itself is nice as well and in some ways similar to the Smithsonian museums with large domes and rotunda's. We went on a weekday and it was not overly crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnS173
50,This is a great museum for all ages!,"We took our 1 year old grandson here and had a wonderful time. The building is grand and beautiful with lots of old features of huge ceilings, columns, marble etc. We loved the animal dioramas and the dinosaurs and especially enjoyed the outdoor garden. Our little grandson enjoyed playing in the twig hut and the little pond waterfall. We enjoyed the big exhibit of the history of Los Angeles since we have lived here for many years. This is a place we will come to continuously as our grandson gets older and will get into different things. There is a lot to look forward to- the nature lab with bugs and the minerals and gems. And the cafeteria is very good too with reasonable prices. Of course it is kid friendly, but we grownups had a great time too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janny45
40,Good for a half a day with the kids.,"While on the small side, trhere were plenty of nice exhibits that kept the interest of both kids and parents. According to my reseach, The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is host to one of the better dinosaur collections in the U.S. Another highlight was the outdoor spider tent which we found to be well worth the extra cost (I'm not sure how long this exhibit was going to stay and it might be gone by now). All in all, a nice few hours before heading over to the California Science Center",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theswissmister
40,Not so crowded in the afternoon,"The museum is mainly focused on activities and exhibitions for children. However, I went there for an afternoon and I enjoyed it very much.Despite all the warnings I received in advance regarding the crowds, I arrived at the museum around 1 p.m. The place wasn't crowded at all.Be sure not to miss a guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rasemanju
40,Old School Natural History Museum,Kids love the large mammal galleries. They have a fairly new and very well done Dinosaur exhibit as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pba1
40,Fun Museum,The museum is surprisingly large inside with a number of exhibits. The exhibits are labeled very well with informative descriptions of the items. There is a butterfly garden as well that's worth visiting. If you live in the area it's probably worth becoming a member as there's a reciprocal relationship with the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits. The café is a bit overcrowded and the seating isn't organized very well. You may want to get there early if you plan to stay for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippin00
40,Great Museum,A great place for families. Lots of hands on learning for kids and a large dinosaur fossil collection. There is a cafe on site with healthy choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingmom362
50,Great Family Fun,This is a great place to spend the day. Bring the family and friends.The Butterfly Pavilion is a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/644ninan
50,Dinosauers and a HUGE Boulder and Butterflies,"The recent rennovation of the Natural History Museum is just the shot in the arm this place needed. It is SUPER COOL for kids and adults alike. You walk into the space under a GIGANTIC boulder and it just gets more cool from there. The dinosauer exhibit is really great an educational and in the Spring there is the butterfly exhibit that I defy anyone to not smile & giggle all the way through. It is a lovely way to spend an afternoon - and across the street is the California Science Center - go see the Space Shuttle! The parkling is excellent and there is the metro that passes right by as well. And if you are college searching, USC is right accross the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonAdelle
40,Great learning experience,The employees are great- parking is easy and the exhibits are very fun and educational. The butterfly garden was a little disappointing though as far as number of butterflies- but the employees were super cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/totallytodd
50,Great Afternoon,Tons to see and great when paired with the Science Center. Spent a lot longer there than we had expected because there was so much to see and we were having such a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berlynblue
40,Great!,I had never been to such a large museum before. I could easily visit three more times and never see all it has to offer. The Butterfly Pavilion wasn't as amazing as I had hoped but it was super crowded. The dinosaurs were my favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797dyland
50,Great museum and fantastic dinosaur display,"My husband and I visited the museum in June 2014. The museum is fantastic, we particularly enjoyed the (permanent) dinosaur exhibition. The collection of bones and casts is the best I have seen, the information boards and interactive exhibits really added to the experience. We also really enjoyed the hominid/evolution collection. The museum is set in a lovely park area and there are a number of other museum type attraction including a butterfly pavilion and a space center. You could easily spend a day here exploring. Overall, a fantastic experience and relatively inexpensive compared to other museums we visited in the USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evenstar2712
30,Interesting,"This was a nice afternoon out! Museum is not that large but does have a lot of nice exhibits. The dinosaur exhibits are wonderful - as are the open areas to watch the scientists working.You can see a beautiful park out the back.The gem area was very dark - and it was difficult to read a lot of the descriptions on the displays but it was still very interesting.There is a food area on the bottom level with an indoor/outdoor seating area. Prices are what you would expect for both LA and an attraction - food was average.If you've been to the Museum of Natural History in NY you will certainly be disappointed - but if you've never been this type of museum, it was good!It is directly across from USC, so that was nice to see - very urban area. We were warned when we left our hotel to not venture out to eat/walk around down there. We didn't see anything that dangerous when were were there, but I have read other posts that there are sometimes pick pockets at the park.Be sure to park at the MUSEUM parking lot, not the lot across the street - that is not run by the museum nor is it convenient. Museum parking is directly adjacent and below museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlnRoundUS
50,One of the best Natural History museums,"I'm a science museum buff and have been to museums of this type around the world and I would put LA's in the top 5 I've ever seen. The dioramas are truly amazing and the displays themselves are an amazing piece of history (date from the 1920s-30s). The gem hall has an overwhelming collection. While the display's in the Smithsonian's gem hall are better done, LA's collection on display seems to be larger and includes a great display on California's gold. The dinosaur fossil exhibit is newer, larger, and very well done; perhaps the best dino exhibit I've ever seen. The architecture of the building is impressive and rotunda with its stained glass ceiling and tall curio cabinets should not be missed. I only had time to see half, but since I'm a teacher and get in for free I plan to go back to see the 2nd and ground floors along with the butterfly pavilion. It is a bit expensive, but the cost means that the place isn't as crowded as the California Science Center or the Smithsonian in DC. You can enjoy all the exhibits in cool, quiet peace and actually see the signs to read them. There is fairly little to touch and interact with for little kids, but they all seemed to be loving the butterfly pavilion (spring and summer months only). Didn't try the cafe but they do have one on the ground level. Save $1.25 on admission if you show your Metro card! Expo line has two stops next the museum or there's parking for $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMW
40,"Great value, awesome bones","One of the most inexpensive and fun thing to do in LA. Located in the USC LA Coliseum area this museum has something for kids and adults. On the first floor you'll find the halls of mammals from Africa and north America. Massive dioramas depicting the animals in a natural pose and environment. The world of insects was a little disappointing , but keep your eyes out for the megamouth shark and the huge ribbon fish.Dino hall brings you up close to those animals. Lots of b I nes, educational.Perhaps my favorite part was the hall If gems and minerals. You'll be up close to the most real gold you'll ever see up close. The gems and rocks along with meteorites were spectacular.Parking is $8, handicapped access good. Wear very comfy shoes, hard floors don't flex give yourself 2 to 3 hours. The museum will take your picture for $35, take your own and save. Family fun on a relatively cheap ticket. You can carry snacks and water. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culture478064
50,killer dioramas,"We love going back to the Natural History Museum. The dioramas are a must see. The Large ones at the end of the halls make you feel like you are there among the animals. Check out the display of the steller sea lion. Who knew seals could get that big. Lots of cool exhibits to see. Lots of dinosaur bone and even a dinosaur skin fossil. I didnt even know there was such a thing. Plus they have a Megamouth shark and an Oarfish. You might want to check the calendar for The LA Coliseum, if there is a USC football game or some other big event traffic in the area will be a huge bummer. The rose garden is right across the way for strolling and there are food options right outside. All killer, no filler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackS181
40,Great Dinosaurs,"Disappointed there is an entrance fee as I live near Washington DC where the Smithsonian Natural History Museum is free. Otherwise, very nice.Gorgeous rose garden right out the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoribytheBay
40,Dinosaurs to butterflies,"It is a museum for all ages. We brought our 3 yr. old and 19 month old initially to see the butterfly pavilion as they are now at the age that are crazy about bugs and insects. As we stepped into the museum, their eyes immediately filled with wonder at the huge whale skeleton that greeted us at the entrance and the matching T-rex and triceratops at the lobby.Butterfly pavilion is seasonal (during summer only). It is just a small enclosure but with some thirty-something different species of butterflies. The butterflies were up close to touch and some even landed on you if you stayed still. That experience alone was worth it for the kids to see. The pavilion is a different ticket and the visits are timed. I suggest booking the visit online prior to going to the museum.Museum is small but has the elements and exhibits that are worth seeing. The dinosaur exhibits were great from long necks to the mighty T-rex. There was also the section of other animals from different regions and animals of the prehistoric period such as the mammoth.Since we had small kids, we opted to visit close to closing hours from 3-5 p.m. to avoid the crowds. There were less people and we were able to enjoy the exhibits as much as we could. Museum is small so you can see as much as you want in two hours without feeling rushed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmajuelo
40,LA Museums,Love the Museums. I have been coming to them since 1968. Its nice to spend the day in Museum then go to a USC game!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliHawaii
50,"Huge, fun museum for people of all ages!","Great, educational museum which is made for people of all ages. Huge part devoted to dinosaurs but does include other animals. It took us about 4 hours to complete the museum however did take a lunch break which helped out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goodtimes1104
50,Dinosaurs!,We had a wonderful time at the museum... dinosaur exhibit is fantastic and the rest of the exhibits were excellent too... great for families of all ages... something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenc990
40,"A little dated, but still very good!","We got combo tickets with the Page Museum to see the La Brea Tar Pits which was a good value. The dinosaur and mammal exhibits were excellent, but the rest of the museum was a bit dated. Still excellent value for the money, we're happy we went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevorb643
50,Free to Teachers!,Thanks LA for making this museum free to teachers..just bring proof since it's not posted. Loved the new Dinosaur Hall!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlyGuy21
50,Love the Dinosaur skeleton's collection,This is a musuem that should be visited if you are already at the California Science Center. This musuem is the largest on the west coast and their dinosaur collection is beyond belief. My favorites were the main one near the lobby and the three t-rex's in the dinosaur are an amazing display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanmV8011RR
40,Not just a typical Museum :),"We visited this museum and i was actually amazed with the displays. It was so much that i would expect of a museum. We were greeted by huge dinosaur skeletons above our head from the entrance :) It was certainly a great work for them to preserved the dinosaur skeletons, the fossils found. There were also so many other animals which were preserved and the way they tried to display the animals according to their habitats were just wonderful :) The display of the minerals and gems were also great with the many types found all over the world :) Certainly a great day spent :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5571MLjenniferl
40,"""Very Educational for all""","This museum is the largest natural and historical museum in the Western United States with an active research center. It maintains more than 33 million remarkable, assortment of specimens and artifacts covering 4.5 billion years of history.This one of a kind building was constructed of marble walls, domed, and with a colonnaded rotunda, is on the National Register of Historic Places.The museum has three floors of permanent exhibits and maintains research and collections in a myriad of fields such as Herpetology, Ornithology, Annelida, and Anthropology along with many others. The museums most popular displays are devoted to animal habitats, pre-Columbian cultures, dinosaurs, and the “Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center and Insect Zoo Collection.”The new “Dinosaur Hall,” which opened in July 2011, is one of the most extraordinary dinosaur exhibits in the world, and considered the premier dinosaur experience in the Western United States. The hall carries more than 300 real fossils, 20 complete dinosaurs, and ancient sea creatures. The centerpiece of the exhibit is the “T. Rex Growth series, the only trio of different aged T. Rex Specimens in the world.”The museum doesn’t focus on plants, animals, and fossils alone, but also incorporates the activities of people, cultures, and the ongoing relationship between human activity, cultural, and natural environments.The museum's collections are strong in many fields, but the “Mineralogy and Pleistocene paleontology” are the most esteemed, thanks to the wealth of specimens collected from the famed La Brea Tar Pits (reviewed). The museum carries almost 30 million specimens representing marine zoology.“Did you know….,” that the museum's interior was used for an episode on the sitcom, “How I Met Your Mother,” as well as for “A Lot like Love.” The United Kingdom’s version of “Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur Nick Palatas,” visits the museum to find out about dinosaurs. And, in the movie Spider-Man, Peter Parker, is bit in the science laboratory in the rotunda outside of the “Discovery Center.”For lunch and in between breaks we ate downstairs at the museum’s café where they had a large selection to choose from.“The exhibits in this museum are organized in chronological order and mark changes in human settlement of the region, focusing first on open and unsettled spaces and then concentrating on the modern industrial society of the 20th century, with the City of Los Angeles as a final focal point.”The exhibit’s 12 themes are: Native Americans, New World Exploration, Spanish Outpost, International Competition, Mexican Territory, War with the U.S., 31st State, Craftsman Style, Agriculture, Land, Sea & Air, Motion Pictures, City of Los Angeles.”Our visit:After our visit to the La Brea Tar Pits out on Wilshire Blvd we drove over to this museum which was part of our itinerary. Our whole family love visiting museums and this one was no exception. Like all attractions there was a fee to park along with the admittance fees, but well worth the price.The place was so huge we didn’t know where to begin from birds and insect halls, archeological treasure, California history, and the mammal halls to name just a few, you could definitely spend a full day here. Here are some of the attractions we toured.We viewed an exhibit titled “The Founding of Los Angeles, September 4, 1781.” There were a number of dioramas which recreated the 1930 era and depicted families from northwest Mexico who came to California during the Spanish period and reflected the regions diversity at that time.The “Walt Disney’s Animation Stand” which depicted his uncles Los Angeles garage back in 1923 where he used it to produce the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon, “Steamboat Willie.”We viewed a scale model of what downtown Los Angeles looked like in the late 30’s, early 40’s and from this model the city was built. Some of the old landmarks still stand, such as the Union Station, City Hall, the Bradbury Building, and the old Plaza.The model of the 1924 Douglas World Cruiser, “the ""New Orleans"" was also another interesting exhibit. This one said that “a team was comprised” of four biplanes and commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Service to complete the first round-the-world flight. It went on to say the ""New Orleans,"" successfully circumnavigated the globe. One of the actual plane is here and the other is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.Of all the exhibits inside of the museums enormous collections, hands down it was Dinosaur Hall and “Thomas the T. Rex.” It’s a wonder how they were able to bring this prehistorical dinosaur back to life. To make all the movements seem lifelike must’ve taken years to develop then put together. The skin looks almost real and it was fascinating to see this huge thing “strut its stuff.”Linkhttp://www.nhm.org/site/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdtheair
50,Spectacular museum,This museum was nothing short of amazing. Our family loved it. We plan to go again. You can definitely spend a entire day there. The dinosaur exists were so cool and I loved how they have the second story floor looking into the room so you can see the skeletons at a whole different angle. We loved many of the other exist rooms. I especially loved see artifacts from our own American history. I highly recommend this museum you won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babysnoopy154400wsh
40,"A variety of exhibits, beautiful rose garden","This is an old museum, so some of the exhibits are a bit dated but are good examples of how taxidermy was displayed in the 20th Century. Still the dioramas (mammals and such) are interesting to look at. The highlight of the museum is the minerals and gems; don't miss the gem vault. Beautiful collection of many different gems and minerals. Hidden away is the ""visible vault"" which has an amazing (although not well-lit) collection of early Latin America artifacts (Mayan, Incan, Aztec). The museum building is beautiful in itself and the vast marble halls are a good place to cool down on a hot day. Don't miss the rose garden outside and of course all the dinosaur bones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,The Gem and Mineral Room is amazing!,"If you like dinosaurs, of course this is the place to go -- on Expo and Vermont they have a huge Dueling Dinos statue (T. rex and a triceratops going at it) and when you go inside the Grand Foyer there are the skeletons in the same pose, the new Dino Hall is really well done, and even on a Sunday morning there was a scientist in the Dino Lab, patiently working at a fossil bone. But what I loved best was the Gem and Mineral Room. They have *tons* of specimens, all well-displayed and lit, with lots of information about them, but even if you're not interested in the science, it's just so pretty to look at, and since everybody runs to see the dinos first, you can have the room pretty much to yourself and linger as long as you like. If you take the Metro to the museum, show your Metro pass and get $1.25 off admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardsmom24
40,Dinosaurs and Butterflies,"There are two ""new"" attractions at the NHM of LA County: Dinosaur Hall and the Butterfly Pavilion. I say ""new"" in quotation marks because, of course, there have always been dinosaurs at the NHM, but there have been extensive renovations and specimen additions to the collection. It's beautiful and fascinating. Your kids will dig it (no pun intended).The Butterfly Pavilion has been open before, but it's seasonal so now is a good time to head over to the NHM. If you have little ones, be sure to keep a close eye on them as some butterflies rest on the pathways and they'd probably be traumatized (as would I) if they were to step on one. Bring your cameras since this may be the only time you'll be able to see this many butterfly species in one place. Gorgeous! You'll need to purchase your tickets for this attraction ahead of time (timed tickets) and you can do so online: http://nhm-px.rtrk.com/site/plan-your-visit/tickets?utm_source=ReachLocal&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NHMNaturePPC&rl_sitelink=363478",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaO22
50,Awesome!,"This museum isn't huge, but is laid out nicely. There are plenty of dinosaurs, a few live critters, and a very beautiful array of rock and mineral formations. My family loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thordargreybeard
40,Nice Museum - Great for Dinosaur Lovers,"I had not been to the LA County Natural History Museum in many years, so some friends and I decided to check it out. The dinosaur hall and mammal exhibits have been updated and are wonderful. The dinosaur hall is fantastic and has many fine specimens, upstairs you can actually watch real scientists preserving dinosaur fossils. The three rooms with the large taxidermy displays are old, but are still quite lovely. The only part of the museum that is really showing its age is the world of bird display on the second floor. There is a great room on the second floor that is full of objects and specimens that can be touched and explored. We purchased additional tickets to view the live butterfly pavilion that is open certain times a year. The pavilion entrance is outside and you purchase a timed ticket to get in. It is a small pavilion but it was full of many different butterflies and caterpillars. We were not aware however that the experience is limited to 30 minutes, we thought we could enter any time between 3pm and 3:30pm and stay as long as we liked. We arrived about 3:10 and then were promptly escorted out at 3:30pm, it would be great if that point had been clarified on the website before you purchase tickets. Overall the museum was great and it made for a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shutterbug44
50,Fantastic Museum!,The dinosaur exhibits were awesome. There are interactive touch screens near the exhibits that give extra information and help you identify some of the artifacts in the display cases. My 6 year old son loved these and spent a lot of time using them. They definitely helped hold his interest a lot longer than a sign could do. The bug and nature room was also a big hit with the kids. They didn't want to leave it. We spent 4 and a half hours here and my kids didn't want to leave. We had to bribe them with a trip to the gift shop so we could get going. One of the best museums I've ever been to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam
50,Great place to take your family,Went specifically for the Calder exhibit. Has a great restaurant! Also adjacent to the tar pits and other great areas to explore. We spent all afternoon and my daughter (aged 17) was never bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drfuzzgr
50,They must be the best for dinosaurs,"A lovely museum, in partly old and partly new buildings. So much to see, it really warrants a full day. The dinosaurs are magnificent and you can see the paleontologists working on them in the lab. There is plenty of activity for kids and plenty of interest for adults. The live butterfly collection is very good, as you are surrounded by over 15 species that vary with the time of year. The old building has a room that reminded me of the pantheon in rome. Reasonable cafe and great gardens, worth a hour of walking around just by themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelB776
50,A great mixture of traditional and cutting-edge,"Parts of this venerable museum are quite traditional (e.g. the huge dioramas of North American and African mammals, and the mounted dinosaur skeletons), others (the brown rats in their transparent tubes and ""houses"") are cutting-edge. An wonderful combination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professional-Pilgrim

A family could easily spend the day here, I visited for an hour and was good enough to walk thru most everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frogster14
50,Wasn't in our trip plans!,"Wow, you should definitely consider this museum! We went here on our free day with our bikes and spent almost a whole day walking around the museum. It's so big and offers so many interesting exhibitions we couldn't possibly see it all! The dinosaur exhibit was one of the best I've ever seen, and they even have a Dino Lab when you can see real life paleontologists working on fossils!!! If you have kids, there's also this hands on critter exhibition that's pretty neat, your kids will absolutely love it! If you don't have kids, like me, you will live this museum also. You don't want to miss this, especially if you're a dinosaur lover!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249normanl
50,Great way to spend half a day,"We had time to fill before our international flight home. A visit to this museum and to the La Brea Tar Pits museum were a great way to spend that time. The dinosaur exhibit is fantastic - nothing like being reminded of the size of T-rex, as well as those really long-necked dinosaurs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StheG
50,Something for everyone to enjoy!,"Natural History Museum has gone through a renovation and is better than ever. Who doesn't love dinosaurs! The North American mammals are a wonderful educational opportunity for children and adults. Learn about insects and animal habitats. Visit the bookstore. Enjoy the beautiful architecture and grounds. Some exhibits, such as the butterfly garden are seasonal. You can easily spend half a day touring the NHM and Exposition Park with the CA Science Center, Rose garden, IMAX theatre. There is a small park adjacent to Museum. USC across the street. Some of the other museums, unfortunately, have limited schedules, so check. Entrance fees and parking are reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101travelers
50,A favorite for our family,"We've visited this museum on several occasions. My son of course loves all the dinosaur exhibits, and I love all the taxidermy displays. Plan on spending a few hours here, and then heading over to the California Science Center (and then even across the street to USC for lunch or some ice cream!). Quick tip, teachers receive a discount here, so make sure you bring your ID along with you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliveOyl2001
50,Great family day,Great museum! We didn't take children but if you plan on taking them they will love it. Tons of fun interactive for kids and adults. We were there for almost 3 hours and could have stayed longer . We did not visit the butterfly exhibit because we were limited on time .The gardens behind the museum is a great place to sit and relax a while.This is a must see! There are other museums in the general area of the a natural history museum . You can spend the whole day there. Places to eat within walking distance as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lacubanita6
50,Learn and have fun,This is a top notch museum. Your kids will learn and have fun!! Plan on spending at least 3 or more hours to see and do everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1955mickeyfans
50,Dinosaurs,"NHM will always be my son's favorite. The various exhibits they have are great, the dinosaur adventure and reptile (bugs) are hot on his list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44tracic
50,"Butterflies, and Gardens, and Gems! Oh, my!","The huge, impressive, and gorgeous gem exhibit was my favorite of the displays at the Natural History Museum, and the Butterfly Pavilion is absolutely not to be missed!! Once inside the Butterfly Pavilion, you get a half hour of pure delight!!...There are butterflies galore, lovely benches to sit and watch from, and if you are like me, you'll spend the entire time photographing them!! After exiting the Butterfly Pavilion, you are almost right in the rose gardens of Exposition Park...a little gem of a park with 15,000 rose bushes that is so worth a gander!!Back inside the museum, I really enjoyed the L.A. history, Native American, and fossil exhibits too.Lunch/snacks on the patio were refreshing, and they also have lots of picnic areas that I would probably take advantage of next time;)...The Natural History Museum is as great as the Getty Center...Why the Getty Center is the #1 attraction in L.A. and the NHM is #15??...I don't ""Getty"" it=) LoL...so many of the Getty's statues are baroque LoL!!...But seriously, the NHM is definitely ""a go""!! I highly recommend getting there right when they open, making reservations online for the butterflies, and allotting at least 4 hours for checking out the museum!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MademoiselleMermaid
30,Mostly boringly dull,"I know that there's a history to this place. I know that lots of people are very proud of it. But most of the museum is so very old in its ways that it's just dry and dusty. The story of the horse told by half a dozen skeletons. Dinosaur bones, stuffed animals from Africa. How on earth is this meant to excite kids?Thankfully there's a bit of real stuff on the lowest floor, I just hope that this overcomes the boredom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevetupper
40,I remember the dioramas best,"We have not been there for many years, but I remember that our young children were fascinated by the Dioramas. They were windows into a different world - a foreign natural world with exotic animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loreb828
40,"Nice museum, but bad neighborhood","The only saving grace for the Natural History Museum of LA is that it near USC, which is a college campus oasis in ""the 'hood"". Back when the college was established, the neighborhood was affluent. But due to suburban sprawl and ""white flight"", the neighborhood has gone downhill since the 60's & 70's. If you visit the Natural History museum, science museum, or the USC campus, do NOT leave valuables in plain sight if you park your car, especially on the street. Lock all valuables in the trunk and lock your doors while driving through the neighborhood. There are a lot of homeless people, petty thieves, and gang members who live in, or nearby, the college and museum 'hood. Eating at restaurants in the neighborhood is generally safe at daytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
30,a bit dissappointing for night at the museum fans,"My boys wanted to see all the things they had in the movie the night at the museum..the dinosaur is the first thing you see when you walk in, but thats all we could find.We were a bit dissappointed really and for the price they charge I dont think it is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aneyefordetail
50,Utterly breataking T-Rex & next door to astonishing no-fee Science Museum,This place is one of those places that rocks so much that it becomes indescribable. So just go do it :) We took the red line and expo line subway trains from our hotel in Hollywood to get to it . Right next door is the free Science Museum which has the new real-life space shuttle and is a breathtaking place too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyc302
50,Dinosaurs Galore!,This museum is massive - displays on several floors -you could send all day here.The best display of dinosaurs I've ever seen. Interactive things for kids to do - especially the rat house!Very high class presentation of animals standing against painted scenes -the polar bear exhibit is very realistic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoisG702
40,Nothing Like this at Home.,"If you are a tourist in the LA area and you research what are the major attractions to see in LA, the Natural HIstory Museum comes up being one of those places. I would have to say that I was not disappointed with my visit there. Afterall there is nothing like this at home.One amusing side note about my visit to this museum. Very often times I've seen glimpses of this Museum in commercials and scenes in movies. It is exciting when I see these because I can then say that I was there and saw that!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJL117
50,Dinosaurs,Coming all the way from New Zealand we were very excited to see the dinosaur exhibition and it did not disappoint. A must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GinaChalmers
50,fun place to spend the day,"This wonderful museum has recently undergone a massive facelift and update - looks really wonderful, full of informative and fascinating exhibits. Extensive displays on local Los Angeles history and flora and fauna; interactive exhibits for kids too. Still houses the classic taxidermy animals with beautifully painted panoramic backgrounds (mammals of North America, etc.) Awesome dinosaur skeletons galore too!! Lovely cafes and outdoor seating, plus attractive landscaping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngliaUSA
50,LOVED IT!,"Spent a couple of days in LA to see family and was very happy that we got the chance to see this museum. Not as extravagant as the MNH in NYC, but then again nowhere is... Beautiful day outside and wasn't disappointed on bit to have spent it indoors looking at the exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannec303
50,Great museum,"This place is awesome!! I love exhibits and museums of any kind so it was no surprise that I took a good 3-4 hours to walk around to absorb all the things it had to offer. Great museum look up the free days. You have to pay for parking, and if you get hungry, your options are limited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carroza
30,A bit disappointing,"After spending time in the natural history museums in New York, Chicago, and Washington, this one is pretty disappointing. The dinosaur section is above average but everything else is pretty weak. The insect zoo is a bit of a laugh -- maybe ten or so aquariums with insects. There is not a lot of interactive stuff, so not the best place for kids. The science museum is much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanLChicago
30,Dinos are great but...,"Parking here is $10. So def do the science museum on the same day. We didn't so we really got bent over. The Dino exhibit is great the rest is just a bunch of taxidermy by ""scientists"" with guns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dumptrumpco
40,Fun for the family,"I did not like the 10$ fee for parking, I had to leave and go find an ATM which I was charged a fee for to pay the parking attendant. I had 2 small kids with me and it was inconvenient for me.The museum is very entertaining. My kids loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allathaf
50,Best history museum in los Angeles,the best natural history museum in the West Coast. The Smithsonian of the West! Great for kids or couples!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USMC0369
40,Worth a Visit,"Whilst not in the same league as its counterpart in London, this is still well worth a visit.Some very good exhibits, especially in their prehistoric section. However I think they have fallen short in selling the history of California & the West as it was 200 years or so ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timjoe333
40,"Great dinosaur exhibit, older exhibits that need remodeling",I visited here recently because I love natural history and I love museums. It was reasonably priced-- $21 or so. There are some older exhibits that need updating but the updated ones were great-- they integrated technology and great exhibition design. An enjoyable afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ldeimos
30,"Lots to see, just not what I'd hoped for","This was a first-time visit for us. We had 3 hours and wanted to see exhibits focused mainly on southern California ecosystems and natural history, and how immigrants (Spanish, Mexican, American, Asian) affected the landscape.Displays in the Becoming LA and California History exhibits were informative. The Just Add Water display was disappointing - seemed to ignore the controversies surrounding LA's acquisition of water from the Owens Valley although it noted the importance of increased water availability to LA's growth. We didn't find anything on specific natural ecosystems of southern California although there were lots of animals organized by continent and biological class. Would have been nice to see more of how native animals, vegetation and physical environment were related, The outdoor Nature Garden had a modest and eclectic mix of plant-related displays which might be informative to kids or those without much biological background.The Gem and Minerals exhibit was impressive, but the organization was confusing at first - some stones were grouped by donor and others by mineralogical family.The Museum buildings are impressive, but, as first-time visitors, we had difficulty finding our way around the building. A visit probably deserves more time than we were able to give it, especially given the cost of admission.Accessing the Museum and grounds from across town (Hollywood) was very easy via the Metro line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65Rambler
50,One of the big museums of LA,"We headed over to the Natural History Museum after visiting the California Science Center. This place has a very Smithsonian feel to it with all the marble and size in the building. The place is much larger than I thought it would be. First, there is of course the Dinosaur Hall (home of ""Thomas the T. Rex""). Then there is the North American Mammals hall (which has 2 levels). Then the African Mammals hall (similar to the North American Mammals hall), the bird exhibit (pretty generic and not specific region wise), the evolution of Los Angeles exhibit (one of the most interesting exhibits) and the huge gems and minerals exhibit (featuring lots of various kinds including gold, REAL gold). While the place is amazing and one could probably spend a whole day here, there are a couple of things I have to point out:1. The North American Mammals hall incorrectly suggests that the ""Dall Sheep"" and the ""Stone Sheep"" are two different species when they really are actually the same species. The same also goes as well with ""Brown bear"" and ""Grizzly bear"" which the exhibit also seems to suggest are two different species (North America wise).2. The Evolution of Los Angeles exhibit is not clearly signposted where you start. We entered from the rotunda and were in the late-1800s part of the exhibit and we made our way to the back area which is the 1700s. We then made our way forward all the way through the 1900s to the present day, but then suddenly jumped back to the 1500s (the very beginning of the exhibit).But otherwise, this is is still one of the best museums in Los Angeles. While it is not free when compared to the science center next door, it still is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
50,Awesome,The Natural History Museum in Los Angeles is awesome. The exhibits are great for everyone. I love the whole environment in there. It is a great place for last minute day trips. It is just a wonderful place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevenh7272
30,Good museum,"This is a large museum with lots of exhibits. There is an outdoor area as well, which is nice to explore on a nice day. It's kind of pricey but is worth it if you stay for a while (we stayed for at least 2 hours, there is so much to see).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
50,So much to see!,This was our first visit! We wanted to something a little different and I am so glad we decided to spend the day here! It was so interesting and a great experience for the whole family. It was so much fun that we forgot about lunch and had an early dinner instead. There is so much to see and if we visit again we will plan better and bring a picnic lunch and snacks! It is for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828pattisb
50,Great Museum,It was the first Friday and they had a special event with Food Trucks outside music inside and just a wonderful venue. We were able to skip the music and bands and tour the museum after normal hours for the event. Great museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9823FBbarbarac
50,"Go, go, go","This is a world class museum in a great setting. There are so many exhibits, you could spend the whole day there. The newest is the Silk Road. Really interesting for all ages. Don't miss the rock and gem exhibit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tzipster
40,Great exhibits - enjoyed the downstairs live animals too,Huge exhibit halls with beautiful animal specimens. Downstairs was very interactive. Owrth the trip to see and explore. Loved all the facts about LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMF568
50,Feels like a Modern/Smithsonian Museum Mashup,"You walk over a bridge and look down at the new terraced gardens, through the modern entryway (and the gift shop fyi) and then enter the old hall that looks like it would fit inside the Smithsonian.I was told that the museum has been updated, and parts of it definitely feel fresher. The dinosouar wing is a great mix of bones in scenes and touch screens.Downstairs at the new Nature Lab you can learn about species native to California and invasive species in the plant and animal world. Along with more screens and lots of stuff to stuff.Pack a picnic and sit outside! Lots of places to sit and they have an outdoor kid play area so the kidlets can burn off steam.We also checked out the Gem & Mineral room, it felt and looked older but still was a great place to visit. Especially if you have a minecraft fan.We visited Silk Road and missed the all the taxidermy, on purpose because it bothers my youngest.I say it is a great place to visit, especially if you have kids that are dinosaur/animal/mineral fans.(P.S. There is a new park and playground across the street as well.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClineFam
50,Don’t Miss the Silk Road Exhibit!,"Dinosaur exhibits were wonderful, the Gem and Mineral gallery was superb with the breathtaking “Butterfly of Peace” showcasing all of the colors of diamonds found in the world, but we came to view the Silk Road Exhibit (on display through April 2014) and were not disappointed. Designed by the American Natural History Museum in NYC, this exhibit really does a great job covering the sights, sounds, and history of the Silk Road 1,000 years ago, traveling from China to Baghdad. Normally, I would pass on Museum food, but the Museum Grill restaurant was serving a “taste of the Silk Road” in a wrap sandwich, so we decided to stay for lunch. The wrap was terrific, and we were surprised to find we’d stumbled upon some of the best burgers and fries to go along with it at very reasonable prices. Great food at a great museum—made for a wonderful day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthwestLivingTV
50,love nite at the Museum where every thing comes to life,"and paris outside love it , cant help it love the place I see Theodore Roosevelt and all of the features its a good thing that the movie was decent because I love the place .....In back theres like the biggest site of natural roses, it looks like your at the back of Versailles in paris at the observatory with your own private village of roses this is sereal unbelievable great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywooddreamSuite
50,Marvelous natural history museum,"This museum has excellent displays, a marvelous minerals and gems collection, beautiful mammal dioramas, fine dinosaur hall, and very interesting special exhibitions. Can be easily reached with the new Culver line metro -- Expo & Vermont stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marigold60763
50,Watch Out for the Dinosaurs,"The entry features a whale skeleton overhead, and a shadowy dinosaur walking past. If you have kids, I think this would be a lot of fun. We weren't kids, but still enjoyed our visit. The ""rock room"" is not to be missed. And the special Silk Road exhibit was truly unique, and enlightening. We could have spent at least three hours here, but had only allotted one. There is just so much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatConwell
40,An educational afternoon.,"My visit coincided with a special exhibit on the Silk route, and I loved every bit of it. Do keep aside 4-5 hours if you intend reading every letter of every exhibit. The gems and minerals section in itself was a lot of information to remember and it took me a long time to get done there. It is worth spending an entire day here if you really wish to learn something and retain it in your head. This museum is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/middle_earth_maiden
50,Nice natural history museum,"Not a big but a very complete natural history museum. There's the requisite dinosaur and large animal display. There's also gems, birds, and many other display. One unique feature of the museum is the inclusion of an outdoor garden with a huge rose garden as a backdrop (the fictitious Jeffersonian Institute from TV.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/48Traveling

50,Great for kids!,Took our grandkids. They had a blast! It was refreshing to see them enjoy things that were not electronic.. They actually got excited about the displays and scientific facts. That is saying something for 14 & 11 year olds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldenrulelady
40,Always a Pleasure,"I went to see their special exhibit on the Silk Road. I visit the Natural History Museum several times a year and I enjoy every time. The membership is totally worse the price. There is a small member lounge in the South Entrance, and I enjoy a self-serving free cup of coffee or tea, and the gift shops have tempting collections.I did not give five stars just because I used to live in NYC and Washington, D.C.... Yeah, their natural history museums are something else and compared to them, I had to give four stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShiroWani

50,Educational and fun,Our family absolutely loves visiting this museum. We can spend days visiting and still not see all of the exhibits. The botanical garden was closed which was a little disappointing but overall a very positive experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ali250
50,Oh Wow!,This place is just stunning! Enjoyed and loved it! Quick Tip! Bring your own sandwiches and food!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iReval
40,if you want to get some history of los angeles,"This museum has exhibits about the history of los angeles here. You can see exhibits highlighting the growth of los angeles and california. If you are a tourist seeking the growth and change of los angeles this is a good place to visit. Also, i appreciate some of the newer exhibits here such as the urban environment showing what local creatures have adapted to los angeles and locations of where to find them, for example, the parrots that are now living here. There is the typical exhibits such as dinosaur fossils and an extensive mineral collection on display here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,Extensive collection; high quality exhibits,The Natural History Museum is worthwhile. The large displays of North American and African animals is excellent. The bird exhibits are extremely detailed. There are many areas geared toward young children also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11JerryB
40,Great museum with something for everybody,The museum has a nice location with a pretty garden around it. In the museum is a lot to see. The collection is very wide. The museum is well seperated in logical blocks. Oveall relative little coherence between main subjects.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuudS_11
40,New and Improved!,"The new dinosaur exhibit is world class and they retained the old dioramas I enjoyed in the 40s.

40,LA Natural History Museum,"This Museum has a lot to offer. The dinosaur exhibit is really great. Also don't miss the fabulous gem collection. With the opening of the EXPO light rail line that has two stops for Exposition Park, getting there is easy and inexpensive.There is a dinning area that serves hot food that is pretty good. The californina exhibit is also worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryJ57
50,"NHM, enjoyable..!","It was so informative, and it felt like it was never going to end (in a goodway), it was so much fun. I enjoyed the ambiance of the rooms with the exhibits, and the darkness, it felt surreal, and was super informative. The price wasn't expensive, and it was fun, a great day out, it took us about half a day, walking at a slow speed, reading the bits slowly, and leisurely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S551RMrogera

50,Great fun for the family,"This is my first review online of any sort. This year the museum was expanded adding more exhibits. Our membership to the museum allow us to visit here several time during the year and its affiliate museum, La Brea Tar Pit museum. The money spent on the membership is worth its cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radman2013
40,good but dated in places,"the diaramas are very kitchy, but remind me of visiting decades ago. the newer sections are very interesting -- insects, new dinosaur exhibits. I looked at the NMH most recently for a private party and it's very expensive compared to other venues. easy to get to by Metro",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedml
50,"Must see museum, its amazing!",Went with my wife and family that included a 10 year old. The museum is a classic and a must see for anyone that is visiting or local. Lots of free entertainment outside and history too with the historic Coliseum. Only place to host two Olympic games and its still going strong. The museum has lots of great artifacts and you can spend hours enjoying it all. There's a great cafe there or you can go to the Science museum next door for free and eat at their Mcdonalds if you want to save some $. Stop by the rose garden outside and enjoy some goodies from the local vendors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
50,I love this place.,"The big dinosaur skeleton that greets you when you enter sets the tone right away. The dioramas are so lifelike, you can really spend a long while gazing at them. There are rooms on Native American Indians, and others on gems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgalambos

40,One of the best urban natural history museums,"I've been to far too many similar museums around the country and this one ranks in the top 2 or 3. It's an older gem, marvelous maintained and full of spectacular sights that will keep any kid's attention high. On my last visit we did the butterfly exhibit and were charmed by the guides, all into butterflies and science. A cool must-attend place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988patrickg
50,"Really impressive, great for kids and adults",We took our grand daughter here today. She is only 5 but absolutely loved it. We spent a little over 3 hours at the museum and probably only covered half of it. We will definitely be back.Go straight to the Dinosaur Hall. The dinosaur/fossil collection and displays are truly impressive as is the level of interactivity with numerous touch screen displays. We found the older dioramas quaint and a little creepy but still worth seeing.The nature lab and gardens are worth visiting and fascinating for kids. Lots to see and do.A high of our visit for my grand daughter was the Dinosaur Encounter show. Entertaining and educational with a clever interaction with a Triceratops that thought it was a horse!Make sure you get to the museum at 9:30AM when it opens as it get crowded by 10:30AM.We'll be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbeavis
50,Great Museum for kids,Daughter enjoyed the La Brea Tar Pits and found even more interesting things inside this museum.. Have your picture taken with the dinosaur chasing you and don't miss the fossils..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahbee99
50,Creepy Crawlers aren't so creepy,"My husband took my son and I in a day trip here. I LOVED IT!! We have passes to everything! Disneyland, Knotts, Aquarium of the pacific! You name it! The NHM of LA County by far takes the cake and cream! I do NOT like spiders but I took a few deep breaths and braved the live open air spider exhibit!!! ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!! I loved how calm and collected but not overbearing the tour guide Laura was!!I took our 20 month old son in and he was all over the place. Not where you want a kid running around. The spiders are in thier house so they can drop on you at anytime although I don't think that's EVER happened. The rose Garden and fountain were fragrant and beautiful. The museum itself was cool and just as awesome as when I went there as a kid!! Take a day and ENJOY/support an amazing place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verosweet428
50,Amazing Museum,"Could spend hours there - easily!!! The displays are so life like, they are simply incredible. Felt like I was in the wild with the some of the animal displays. Will definitely go back next time I visit L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mal316

50,nice museum,I went there on a Wednesday morning. There were very little people in the museum. So we felt more enjoyable. The museum is quite big an the exibitions were great too. We did not go to the butterfly one and it would cost extra $3. This museum is pretty similar to the one in NYC. I think it is one of the best in U.S.A.F,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieS935

40,"Great for kids, even little ones","I've been here many times through the years. But this spring, my daughter gifted me a one year membership for Mother's Day. Yay! There is so much to see here, you can spend hours and never see it all. Years ago, we took my first grandson there to see the Butterfly exhibit. This May, my daughter and I stunned, with her 2 year old in tow. His favorite thing was the Dinosaur Show. It is not to be missed! He was upset when the show (20 minutes) came to an end. He wanted more! The butterfly pavilion in spring is so wonderful! Lots of butterflies to see, and knowledgeable docents are there to help answer questions. We loved it. My personal favorite is the gem and rock collection. Amazing! After the dinosaur show, we ran wild through the rose garden. This is perfect for toddlers and children to run around and adults to enjoy the beauty of the vast array of roses flourishing in this wide open outdoor area. We took advantage of the McDonalds located conveniently close by, and had a picnic in the rose garden. This museum has so,etching for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tylersnana55
40,Good place to go with the children,"We went on a half day trip to the museum with some of the school colleagues of my 5 yo son. The place is very nice and for kids learning everything about dinosaurs was great to see them in real size and figure out what is left of them nowadays, however the food choices were not very kid friendly and the other areas of the museum did not appear very attractive for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostAngeles
30,"Great Collections, confusing presentation","My boyfriend and I went to this museum. As you can see from other reviewers, the ones with children were likely to rate the museum highly. I would say it was just okay. The mineral and dinosaur exhibits were very well done, but the rest were just plain scattered. A few of the exhibits felt like artifacts and A LOT of text all over the room. There wasn't clear linear story-telling for these types of rooms such as the history of Los Angeles where it needed to be. This museum felt like work to learn while others have felt effortless to me. Lastly, some of the displays were definitely dated compared to the dinosaur area.This museum was good for a day trip, but not comparable to say... the natural history museum in Gainesville, FL.Lastly, avoid the food court. Pretty bad prices for the quality of food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oceanblue535
40,Great history,"If you want to spend a day going through time, looking at dinosaur remains, gems, and other pieces of natural history, this is a great place. Lots to see and great for kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant
50,Best Museum ever,"My son loved it and we all had a great day here, so much to see and do, my son was fascinated by everything there was",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lfa951
50,Dinossaurs!,"Amazing! That discribes the whole Museum. The collection of stones was amazing, also the enourmous dinossaur's bones, the stuffed animals are ugly as some museums. Everything very clean and organized. Also the staff very attentive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seraphyne
50,Must visit with kids,"Informative, well organised and designed. Kids love it. They have dinosaurs walking around on weekends. Lovely butterfly park and great food in cafeteria. Great for +3 kids. They do get a little scared at times with the stuffed animals who look almost real",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiran232
40,"Beautiful Building, interesting place","Located in Exposition Park, there is a fee for parking. The park itself is pretty neat and has a lot of other offerings, like the California Science Center.I really like the layout here, but it seems like this is not a place you could visit many times as a few of the exhibits are dated and take up a lot of space. It is a rather large place. When you enter you see the two dinosaurs skeletons, which really excited my son. There is a mineral area that is pretty interesting as well. There is a dinosaur exhibit that really interested my son. It has two levels and a lot of recreated dinosaurs! The building is beautiful. There was a spider tent when we were there for an extra fee. It was about 20 minutes.It was not what we expected and was not really worth it in my opinion.I think you would have to go at a really slow pace to make this an all day trip. We were there for only a few hours going at a snails pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utopianidealist
40,museum trip,"i loved the museum, very interesting. my grandsons would have enjoyed it a bit more had it not been for us being there on the same day when there were hundreds of screaming kids running around loose on a field trip and their chaparons could not keep them together",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ophie24
50,Your kids will love this place,"I used to take my kids here at least twice a year when they were little. We never got tired of it. Great displays, in a beautiful old building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1freebird2
40,Good museum,"We spent an enjoyable couple of hours here, the dinosaurs are really well presented, and the interactive kids displays are excellent. The butterfly house was a dissapointment; a hefty additinal charge, not that big, and a timed entrance; we got there at midday, and the earliest entry was 3:30, so if you want to see the butterflys, go early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyTraveller1012
40,Butterflies and Dinosaurs! Hurray!!,Butterfly Pavilion was wonderful as was the dinosaur/prehistoric mammals exhibits. We had a lovely time. There were even some nice bargains in the museum shop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeAnnYG66
50,They just renovated and expanded,This is a fantastic museum- especially for families. They just did an extensive expansion and renovation and it is even better than ever.Allow several hours. This place is large!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lqgueradg35
50,tons of fun!,"the museum has made a lot of changes in the last few years and its great. if your from so cal, the history of LA is not worth the 45 minustes i spent in the hall. if you like gems, plan on an hour to soak up everything, the newest dinosaur hall is worth the admission price alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd46
40,Really nice science museum,"This museum is huge and there are tons of different displays. We spent most of our time with the California species, birds, insects and spent some time in the Butterfly House, which was amazing! The Museum is located right next to a Metro Link stop so it's easy to take the train and avoid traffic, parking, etc. It's also next to Exposition Park and a number of other interesting museums so one could easily spend many hours there with a variety of things to see and do. We chose to spend all our time at the Natural History Museum this visit and even though we were there most of the day, we did not have time to see 'everything' nor did we have time for any of the wonderful docent-led tours or presentations so if your goal is to be thorough, be sure to allow plenty of time or possibly more than one day - we decided to join the museum because we felt we could not see all we wanted to see in just one trip.We were there on a Sunday afternoon so there were lots of families visiting - I really enjoy children but it's a very exciting place and at least during our visit, many of the parents weren't interested in keeping their children very controlled so after awhile the piercing screams echoing off the marble walls and unruly children crashing past me to see something started to dampen my enthusiasm for being around kids. I think I will plan my next visit for a time when it might be a little less crowded.However, even though there were lots of people and a few unruly and loud children, the museum itself was big enough to accommodate even more people than were actually there and we even ate at the Grill during the height of lunch-time, fearing a super-long wait, but found the line moved quickly and our food was ready within about 5 minutes so we were impressed with how well it was organized. The food prices were about average for this type of place and from what we could tell, all of the meals were generous and looked good.Be sure to spend some time in the museum stores if you're looking for unusual gifts or items. I found a number of unique gift items including books, games, jewelry and all sorts of other things so it's a great place to shop for unusual items. Overall, it was a very nice visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaA819
30,OK for Dinosaurs,"This is a good place, esp for youngsters, to see dinosaur skeletons (incl a T-Rex), diorama displays of mastadons and sabre tooth tigers. Otherwise, this museum hasn't changed much in the last 25 yrs and is kinda tired. Next door to the Coliseum and the Science Exposition center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalhasa
50,A walk through history,A real walk through times beyond human knowledge built with patience and skill by reconstructing dinosaur skeletons! Amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZiaChaudhuri
40,"Good Displays, Large Museum",The LA Natural History Museum compares favorably to the museums in New York City and Washington DC. Large facility with the usual diaramas and mineral/gem rooms. Nice way to spend part of a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickMoore
50,Wonderful Display of Dinosaurs And More,"I visited in July of 2013. It was easy to locate and had plenty of parking. The day was warm and the museum was very cool inside. The dinosaurs were fascinating, especially T-Rex. Plenty of information about each species and other scientific displays. A great way to bring your dinosaur books to life! The rose garden is exquisite with every rose imaginable. And the smells!!! Lots of places to sit and eat. A+ attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylviag136
50,Great science museum,"My interest is primarily minerals, and they have a GREAT collection, especially California specimens - they also have an excellent collection of gemstones. The paleontological exhibits were also great, well-labeled and very well-staged. My only disappointment was that there is no exhibit of fluorescent minerals (at least none that I could find).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232JimS
50,Very Educational For Kids And Adult's Alike!,"Took my daughter several times here and she was thrilled each time! There's a butterfly garden, rose garden and a science center close by which is always great to visit too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarwara691
40,Good Experience,"If your child is a dinosaur or animal lover, then this place is a great family outing. Tons of dinosaur exhibits. Some where the kids are able to touch. My kids felt like they were in the movie ""Night at the Museum"". There's an area outback where you can have a picnic, and it faces the Coliseum. The best part is teachers go in for FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JENNIEC_13
50,50 Shades of Blue in the Gems and Minerals Hall,"Who wouldn't want to see the amazing dinosaur exhibits (awesome), but the Gems and Minerals Hall is not to be missed and is my favorite, for sure. The colors in nature are amazing. http://trysomethingfun.blogspot.com/2013/07/fifty-shades-of-blue.html",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzette008
50,"Dinos, Gems, Butterflies and More","This is a great place to spend an afternoon. Spring & Summer there's a butterfly pavilion out back where families can spend time up close with butterflies & caterpillars.The dinosaur exhibit has been open maybe two years, and it's beautiful, interactive and open and bright. Next to that, there's a new edible garden exhibit that shows the beauty (and practicality) of planting a garden that doubles as a food source.On the opposite side, take the time to find the gem vault. It's a must in our family to spend time looking at the gemstones, birthstones, and all the tiny little shiny things. It's set up like a 'vault' and it's a neat little exhibit.We've been members for some time, but there are free days each month, and teachers also get free admission. If you haven't been lately, definitely take the time.Tip: The Expo line of the Metro has an exit right in front. Given the frequency of USC football games at the Coliseum next door on Saturdays in the fall, just plan on taking the train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,An excellent museum,"If you like natural history museums, this is a fine one. The dinosaur exhibit has vey nice specimens, and the dioramas of wildlife are nicely done. I particularly enjoyed the mineral hall, which has some beautiful pieces. Next door is the extensive rose garden, which when in bloom is amazingly beautiful and most be part of the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMFPEDS
30,Good one time visit.,Nice museum. Lots of things to see. Rose garden and butterfly area. Check space museum behind it if you finish early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denverperson
50,What a gem in L.A.!,"This is a great treasure for families and everyone to experience! We always enjoy the dioramas on the first floor and this was our first look at the dinosaur exhibits. The insect ""zoo"" was an unexpected little treat. The building itself is a real treasure. It originally housed the combined art, history and science museum- do not miss the rotunda with the original statue depicting each of these disciplines. I recommend taking a whole day and seeing this and the science museum, as they are within easy walking distance of one another. Parking was simple- you ca park in a paid lot just across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954shern
50,One of the really fun parts of Exposition Park,the exhibits are great and the one people talk a lot about are the dinosaurs. Pretty cool stuff but they do have to live with the La Brea Tar Pits pretty close. This museum is well worth the trip and you can make a day of also visiting all the attractions near it. Make sure you take a detour the Rose garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDLightpainter
30,Interesting One Time Visit,"Dinosaur Exhibit is interesting, but it did not captivate my 6 year old son enough and he is OBSESSED with Dinosaurs. He spent a few seconds at each exhibit and moved on. We found the African Mammal Hall to be the most interesting life like exhibit! This is not a Museum that I would buy an annual pass to. One or maximum two visits is more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee802692
50,So cool!,Amazing place. Plan to spend a whole day here. Lots of great hands on exhibits for toddlers and an amazing collections of specimens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAttryde
50,Natural History Museum of Los Angeles,This is a geat museum for adults and children to learn about the world of dinosaurs and mammals. I did not get to see the whole museum since we were running a little late in the day. The museum is well laid out and has a lot of information on each of the species shown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mhood_VA
30,Well spent afternoon,"The museum is a fun afternoon. It does not atke very long to go through, but is well worth the admission price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firemann2003
50,Gorgeous New Garden!,"Spent the day in the newly renovated and established garden and nature lab. Took a bird-watching tour with the resident ornithologist. Since the new garden is particularly designed to attract birds - with nesting site, undergrowth, and a water feature - I will definitely bring my binoculars for my next visit. There is a wonderful herb garden, vegetable garden, and some fruit trees - inspiring for what I can create in my own yard.Over the past several years, the museum has done extensive restoration of the original building as well as adding new galleries and exhibits. The new café even has a vegetarian salad! A winner all around, and definitely worth the long drive into downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,Great field trip - with your school or your family,"We recently went on a field trip where I chaperoned my 8 yr old's class (along with other parents) - the kids really, really enjoyed this museum. Of course the dinosaurs are awesome, but they really enjoyed the gems too. Getting a look at real paleontologists was another highlight. The museum is well maintained and it's definitely worth the trek through the traffic to get there. Parking was a little busy - I would recommend getting there as early as possible and have your money ready - parking is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
50,A nice change.,"When it comes to finding something to do with our family, for some reason we always gravitate toward an amusement park. Taking my kids to the history museum was a nice change of pace. My kids had a great time and left with more knowledge than they came with. My four-year-old son adored the dinosaurs. I highly recommend the family membership. If you just visit this museum once and La Brea Tar Pits just once each with a big family (we have four kids) it totally pays for itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneM418
50,Fun,This museum is a lot of fun and has great displays. It is very unique and the dinosaur exhibit is one of the best I have ever seen. I really can't wait to go back. Well worth seeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
50,Those Dinosaurs are HUGE!,"Exclaimed my 4year old son. He loved this museum. He really enjoyed all the different dinosaur exhibits and all the different levels the exhibits were at. There were many interesting informational rendering, and ""touchy"" things you could look at around his level. (3 ft. tall) Which was nice, not having to lift him up on our shoulders to see everything.The diorama's were a bit scary as my son said. :) Interesting, but we didn't spend too much time in there.We loved the gem and rock exhibit. My son, not so much, but us adults loved it. Somehow, we stayed out of the museum store, but I don't think we felt like we missed anything.The grill in the basement was surprising good. Who knew you'd get decent food at an exhibit hall. My son and daughter finished the macaroni & cheese, the veggie burger was good, the regular hamburger was good, and the salad was good. Wow...crazy, but it worked out well for us. I had happy kids.Anyone who goes out to venue's with kids know they are always moments away from meltdown.We can't wait to go back!I would plan about 4 hours for this. Totally worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manateegirl
50,fabulous find!,"we did a cancer walk at Exposition Park, and saw the museum, and after the walk, went in to take a tour! Fascinating, well run, and perfect for families!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicajohns
50,Try Night at the Museum!,"We attended a Night at the Museum event at the L.A. Natural History Museum last summer. It was the best possible way to see the museum! When you first arrive, you put your belongings (sleeping bag, air mattress, etc.) in one of the Halls -- we were in the Hall of African Mammals next to the elephants -- and sign in. You're assigned to one of four groups, so that everyone can enjoy the four evening's events in smaller subsets.The kids made plaster casts of trilobytes and allosaur claws, did a scavenger hunt for information in the dinosaur exhibit, got a close-up visit with a millipede, and had a mini-lecture about some of the dinosaur items on display. Partway through there was a snack break, then lights out.One of the best parts was that after breakfast the next morning, we could explore the entire museum before it opened! We encountered only a few people before opening time, and enjoyed having all the exhibits to ourselves. Later in the day it became quite crowded, and we appreciated our private time there even more.They keep the kids up rather late for such a young audience (ours were 7 and 8 at the time, and they were up well past their bedtime, yawning through the last program). Still, it was a great learning experience and a very cool feeling seeing the dinosaur bones in the lobby from the darkened hall where we slept!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonunit999
50,My girls are totally addicted to it . . .,". . . and they're grown up and married! They know every exhibit in the place. We've been visiting here since 1986, when our first child was born, and we all still visit regularly. My younger daughter, a Chemistry doctoral candidate at CalTech, volunteers here in educational outreach, and my older girl very nearly got a job here recently as a gallery interpreter. That's the impact this place has had, and continues to have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladarnton
40,Good day,I coupled my visit to the Science Centre with a visit to the museum as its in the same complex. It was a good display and my 5yo son (who thinks dinosaurs are still alive) loved the exhibit of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMinelli
40,"It was great, but bring earplugs!","I went on a Monday, which I thought might be less highly trafficked, but guess again - hundreds of schoolkids were there on class trips. They were adorable and mostly I was fine with them being there (except one group which seemed unchaperoned)... However, one thing to know: Most of the surfaces in this museum are concrete or marble and any noise at all gets magnified greatly. Multiply that by hundreds of schoolkids, all excited to be looking at dinosaurs with their friends, and, well, I've been to quieter rock concerts. Seriously. It was just pretty distracting to be trying to focus on the material while trying to tune out the noise. Also, they should do something about the kids running - that just isn't safe and on a couple of occasions I thought I was going to witness an accident, as falling on hard marble can break bones.On the upside, there's a lot of great fossil material and I particularly enjoyed the prehistoric paintings by Charles Knight. The Butterfly Garden was quite nice and not overcrowded or loud. Loved seeing the beautiful insects in a natural setting.The fossil collection is very nearly as good as that at Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman - for my money the best dinosaur collection on the face of the Earth - and since I'm a paleohistory buff I was glad to see a lot of the current thinking on dinos was up to date (they are ancestors of birds, in many cases they had feathers, etc.) The curation was excellent, with explanations of where things are found.Definitely worth a visit, the lawn outside is gorgeous, too. Very friendly staff. The gift shop was amazing, bought some super-cute jewelry I'll wear to pieces. I'll be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DivemistressofthDark
40,Dino land,Lots of bones and history about Dinisaures that lived in the local area. We spent around 2hours here and personally didn't really think it was worth the money. We also had lunch here which was typical American food and ok.If yo live dinosaurs then come here. Great displays. Building very nice as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whistle007
50,LOVE,"LOVE LOVE it here!!!So many different exhibits to look at! Fake animals (which remind me of the zoo), birds, jungle, minerals (which I wasn't too interested in until I saw the sparkly diamonds!!), the Aztec art, dinosaurs, insects,etc. The list goes on!They have the butterfly exhibit going on now. I missed it because it was sold out so get tickets online if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
50,Dinosaurs Galore,"This museum has a special place in my heart, since I started visiting it over 60 years ago. There are several great exhibition halls but my favorite is the recently opened Dinosaur Hall which features ""Thomas the T-Rex"". I am a bit biased perhaps because I am friends with the paleontologist in Montana who discovered him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikew938
40,"Dinosaurs, gems, oh my!","This is a pleasant museum to visit. It is free on the first Tuesday of the month, except for July and August. They recently renovated their dinosaur exhibit and it truly has to be the highlight of the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCarlos
30,The we enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special,"This museum wasn't anything special, but we take our kids to a lot of museums when we travel so the bar is pretty high for us. That being said, there were some displays that were really good. The minerals and gems wing was great, the dinosaur exhibit was good, and the large mammal dioramas were ok. There were a lot of dioramas though, too many for me and the kids. They did have a small hands on area that the kids loved exploring, but they needed more. We did pay the extra $$ to visit the butterfly pavilion. This was a great but over priced exhibit. there were many many caterpillars out doing their thing, along with the butterflies. They had a wonderful staff working in there, they were absolutely wonderful with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MommyBird53816
50,Great Place to Visit,We have been here many times on our visits to LA and it is one of our favorite places. I heard that it is the best Natural History Museum west of Chicago. It is expanding and a large dinosaur section has been added since we first came here several years ago. There are nice displays of animals but also of minerals and birds and other things. The atmosphere is tranquil and it is a pleasure to walk around the building with my son. It is so nice to learn about an animal or something in another situation and come here to get more information. They also had a live performance about a T-Rex that was really fun for us all - especially when the T-Rex attacked the speaker!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419KenL
50,An LA treasure,"We are members. We love the method of displaying the skeletons of aquatic reptile fossils in particular, but find the whole place and its programs worth frequent visits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenryK525
50,Visit the natural history museum,We went for a special event and presentation. Well organized and interesting. There are several new exhibits including the new dinosaur hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plhaaker
50,A Great Change of Pace!,"If you're in Los Angeles hitting the Disney and Universal Studios theme parks, consider stopping by the Natural History Museum while you're there. It has amazing displays of dinosaur bones that kids and adults can appreciate, plus exhibits on animals, gems, etc. etc. We went with kids from ages 6 to 14 and there was something there for everyone. It was our first visit to the museum and we definitely want to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwendolynn1
50,Great museum!,"This museum was wonderful! 3 huge galleries of animal displays, a large dinosaur exhibit, bird rooms, history of southern CA room, gems & minerals room, and several other new things that are set to open later this year. Our kids are 5,7,and 10 and we spent about 3 hours in here. We could and would have spent longer. Lots of interactive stuff for the kids to look at and touch. If it's a southern CA school day, I recommend you go in the afternoon and all the school field trip groups should be gone. We got there and they were just leaving so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. Well worth the time & money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCP75

40,fun with dinosaurs,This museum has great special exhibits. I've visited it with my grandchildren several times and saw both the butterfly and spider exhibits. There are great interactive sections which are fun to visit with kids. The dinosaur bones are spectacular. They are well documented and give an adult a fascinating look at the history of paleontology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllegraS_12

40,Interesting exhibits,"We enjoyed our recent visit to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. My favorite exhibit was the mineral and gems. The exhibit was quite extensive and had lots of gold, gems and minerals. The dioramas were quite well done and the bird exhibit was very good as well. Many families with children were at the museum and seemed to be quite engaged. There is a strong emphasis on active participation with lots of hands on activities for children on the Saturday that we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheatgrower
40,A small but lovely museum.,"Yes their are larger and nicer natural history museums, the Smithsonian for instance, but this one is well maintained and has a nice array of bones and exhibits for a small space. My daughter loves it, it's just the right size so she can see everything and not get bored or tired by the end (she's four). It's my local museum and we go fairly often. If you are in the area check it out- it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommymiad

50,Excellent mineral collection,"Went to see the mammal collection and was fascinated by the mineral and gem collection, if you like gold then this is the place to go. Found the dioramas very good and very informative. The bird section good but some displays not working properly, excellent for children and a good learning opportunity for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarethH542
50,Dinosaurs and large fish!,"This is a MUST see. YOu have no idea how 'really' large these creatures were until you see these dinasaurs bones in this museum. I didnt even know one had a neck as long as a few football fields. Yep, and they explained how this creature kept it's head up. it is great for kids, school trips but not exactly how I would of spent my weekend after being in this Museum. More for kids than adults, but then again we can all learn something and be impressed by visiting any Museum of course. The line was outside in the blasting sun and it took about 45 minutes to get past the door to even get a ticket. You can't just see all the things in this Museum 'at your own whim', because it is so busy with kids and school outings, you have to wait for an hour or so to get a 'time' by the powers that be, to schedule some of the showings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debras299

30,Disappointment,"First of all, the entrance fee was overly expensive relative to the overall exhibit quality (except for the Gem & Mineral section, which was outstanding). Other exhibits were limited in scope and in several cases, the lighting was so dark that you couldn't read signage or see some of the display items. And in the North American Mammal room, there was a safety issue because in the darkened room (to create a contrast with the lighted display cases), about eight short poles normally used to create queues were left scattered in the room and I saw a number of people bump into them and nearly trip. Doesn't anyone check that kind of thing?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoRoadie
50,One of my favorite museums to take the kids,"So many wonderful halls, spider or butterfly pavillion and now the new dinosaur hall make this a perfect place to spend the afternoon with kids ages 3 and older. What makes this place even nicer is that it is right next door to the CA Science Center so you can spend the entire day at these two museums. We go at least 3 times per year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72

50,Compares favorably to NY's Museum of Natural History,"I visited this museum with my six year old granddaughter who was immediately impressed by the various exhibits geared for children that can also be enjoyed by adults. The dioramas were well presented, there was a butterfly exhibits and there was a puppet show for the children to see. We were there for 3 hours and there wasn't a moment that we stopped except to eat.The sheer size of the museum assures that there is much to be seen within the museum's confines as well as on the grounds where their are exhibits under tents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerM965
40,"Great Museum, Check Out First Fridays","This is a great Natural History Museum, complete with nature dioramas and dinosaur bones. I mean, what else do you want?How about cool bands, DJs, and affordable wine? The First Fridays events at The Natural History Museum are always a good time, with hot up and coming bands and top DJ's playing sets in exhibition halls. The events also usually include other cool guests, such as cinema's mad genius Werner Herzog, who presented his Oscar nominated 3D documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams and then stuck around for a fascinating Q and A at one of the more memorable events in the last few years. And as you're enjoying the cool hipster culture surrounding you, you can enjoy the little kid pleasures of the dioramas and dinosaurs without letting on to the fact that you're still a little kid at heart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethG527
50,Brilliant day out for the kids and good value,Loved the interactive stories! Displays were very interesting. My kids loved to see the dinosaurs up close!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/controlfreak28
40,Plenty to see with everchanging exhibits,"The museum is the largest in the western United States, and its collections include nearly 35 million specimens and artifacts and cover 4.5 billion years of history.The place is friendly for children and adults. Most kids enjoy the Butterfly Pavilion. If you are a real ""History Nerd"" like me, consider looking up info on the LA Coliseum for your own curiosity and/or to share with the youngsters. As it, the Sports Arena and Science Museum (with the Space Shuttle) are on the same grounds.Dont miss the Megamouth Shark in the tank near the Rotunda. It is easy to pass up but worth looking for... and at.The first Friday of the month is free and they stay open late. Check website or call for info.One could go to both the Science Center and History Museum on the same day depending on schedule, energy and attention span.Pack a lunch to enjoy in the Rose Garden.Pay to park in one of the lots, I dont advise parking, or even walking, anyplace in the neighborhood. It is simply not safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Interesting place,"Gems were great, with a gold display that is hard to describe--you have to see it!, The dioramas were beautifully done. I sat and looked at one for about 10 minutes, marvelling at the exquisite detail. The more I looked, the more I saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghotai
50,So much to see,"We only spent a few hours here because we had spent time at the nearby Science Center and iMax movie. I feel like we just scratched the surface. The dinosaur exhibit, which we almost missed, was fabulous. The California history exhibit in the basement was a great compliment to my daughter's 4th grade California history lessons. Loved the bird and wildlife displays. Will definitely come back when I have a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSLAMT
50,Incredible,"We have just returned from the museum and all we can say is wow. We debated between this and the Getty and I think we may have had our best day LA has to offer. The dinosaur exhibit is worth the $12 admission alone, plus we got a Jurassic park themed tour off one of the many helpful members of staff, amazing day. It was also first Friday so it was open till 10 with lots of fun extra stuff to do. Thanks NHM!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelO505
40,dinosaurs!!!,Im not a museum person....but this was not like other museums...the displays were excellent the price was not expencive and I saw dinosaurs!! a bit small though..i expected it to be bigger but thats ok...Im pleased with everything saw..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiaL_13
40,"Expensive, lack of bathrooms, and terrible foot route traffic planning. Excellent displays, especially the dinosaurs and Mayan e","The first thing we noticed was how expensive it is. We were there on a very busy day, so the fact that there are only 2 bathroom stalls on the ground floor was a giant glaring problem as well. Most museums would make sure that there was a logical circular route through exhibits, but the planning here was bad. This caused lots of crowding where there didn't need to be any.Great exhibits!!! The dinosaurs especially so. I also enjoyed the Mayan exhibit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acotton73
50,Very Amazing Exhibits & Reasonable Entrance Fee,"Truly amazing exhibits at the Natural History Museum of LA County! The MANY different dinosaurs were breathtaking with brief but informative information to make it an enjoyable time without having to spend a long time reading. The mammals, well, all the many different mammals were truly impressive. Birds, insects...too much too see almost! The geology and rock and gem displays were stunning and nearly overwhelming. I went with my elderly parent who loved it and I saw a LOT of families with kids of all ages enjoying this remarkable museum! And, you really should JUST TAKE THE EXPO LINE METRO! You get to walk through the Rose Garden and it's beautiful! Highly recommend this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeNMiSelf
50,Natural history Museum,"The Museum was awesome. We saw all the exhibits, but my favorite was the Geography exhibit, But my family enjoyed the Human evolution exhibit. It was the most amazing Museum I've seen out of LA in a long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicholasD451
50,great day,The restoration of the museum is beautiful. Great displays. It is such a beautiful museum. LA can be proud of it. We went to the new dinosaur exhibit. Fantastic. We took the Metrolink and the subway that let us off across the street from the museum. Very easy connections. Excellent day trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesJ413
50,Wonderful Museum,"I really enjoyed it here, and was able to fill out a couple of hours with all the different things to see. The dinosaur section is brand new, and looks great! The museum is also creating new exhibits, so down the road things will only get better. Above everything, I loved the gem collection the most! No only is it huge, but the collection is truly breathtaking, filling up a large room (and vault!) with countless gemstones. If anything, go for the gems, as they will marvel almost any other museum's collection! The only downside is that the California and Mammal sections could use a bit of a makeover, for they both seemed old and a little outdated. Other than that, loved it here, and it is totally worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevonE303
50,I'm a member. It's cool really.,"It is a little expensive really for what it is, but it is fun. Check out the science center next door while you are here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW
40,fun museum.,this is a classic museum in la-have been going there all my life. they recently remodeled if you havent been in a while you should go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debPasadena_CA
50,Great for young children,"The museum was recently renovated. I gave it 5 stars because of the major improvements to the dinosaur exhibit. You get a lot of great views of giant skeletons; low views, high views.If you don’t want to see dinosaur skeletons you probably won’t like the other stuff.Thankfully there’s plenty of on-site parking paid parking. It’s surrounded by a bad neighborhood and you may experience people at stop lights trying to push advertisements into your car. Keep your doors locked, windows rolled up and wave them away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SthCA
40,Love the museums,"I might be bias because I really love history and museums and this is both! However, I will say that this is a particularly good museum, that is kept up well with constantly new and exciting exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
40,Baby T-Rex,If you (or your kids) like dinosaurs - go there. Every first Tuesday (except for two months which I don´t exactly remember) general admission is free in most LA county and city museums - yay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asrael
50,Go for the day and spend a week,"There is so much to see here you might as well move in. The dinosaurs and mastodons and other skeletons, huge and tiny, are captivating. There are informative, easy-to-operate information displays. The spruced-up dioramas of yesteryear are a pleasure to re-discover. There is even a Spider House, where they're just hanging around...literally. And don't miss the gemstones. Wear comfortable shoes!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayT917
50,Thrilling & Exciting museum,"I visited the NHM for the first time this past summer while on a scavenger hunt at the museum; I wasn't sure what to expect from the museum so my boyfriend and I thought we'd kill two birds with one stone by doing a scavenger hunt to visit the museum - since it is a museum and it's mostly look at stuff. We did not expect to love it so much that we considered getting membership.NHM was so lifelike and really immerses visitors into each exhibit. Upon walking into the museum, there's a great display of T-Rex & Triceratops fossils which just puts you in the mood and as you travel from room to room with the diorama type exhibits you forget that you're in a museum. We were a bit disappointed that we visited the museum on a scavenger hunt because we didn't have much time to view the museum but we still enjoyed it.If you're like me and enjoyed the movie ""Night at the museum"" with Ben Stiller, then you'll really enjoy the NHM. I felt like I was in the movie by being at the NHM and many of the exhibits were so life like that they could come to life. We will definitely be returning to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kchen83
50,A day of Learning,This is a great place to take the family. Its filled with many things that you can look at and also touch. Kids love it. It is not to expensive. It makes a nice day trip and you don't get bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddyone1
50,Wonderful Museum!,The NHM is one of the best museums of natural history that we have visited! We have been to The Field Museum in Chicago numerous times and the NHM is a close second!The grounds are beautiful and the interior is old school museum untill you get to the new Dino Hall which is contemporary and spectacular.If you have kids that love dino's this is a must go to!There are many different dinosaurs on display. Ask for a tour to learn more details and ask for Ashley who was our tour guide and very informative and knowledgeable.She is very good with kids and any questions you might have!The dinosaur puppets are a big hit too!There is food available and a great gift shop.I recommend spending a whole morning or afternoon.If you have kids make sure to visit the live animal area where they have animal presentations and a question and answer period.Your family will learn alot and have a great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailF175
40,Dinosaurs,"its been awhile but there are lots of interesting exibites to see but i live the dinosuars the best , there is just something about these huge animals i find amazing , the others things are typical of a museum of this type , its an educational way to spend a day and on the way home from work so know real bother to get too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprildoornbos

50,AMAZING MUSEUM!,"It was all I hoped for. The museum went under remodeling and now looks modern and still so informative. Being a pre historic kind of guy I loved the pre historic animals, and also the animals that live in the little exhibits upstairs. They have tarantulas and other critters that are really unusual. They also have killer new exibits coming, this is the museum that you need to go be young or old you will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meregorovian

50,Excellent,"This place is great for kids. If you haven't seen the dinosaur exhibit, take your little ones. There is a free Tuesday once a month, I believe. The butterfly house is also really amazing to see with your own eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kst00Visit
50,Well Worth it,The museum is very good. Amazing displays of dinosaur bones. It's not huge but we thought all the exhibits were interesting. The spider exhibit was awe inspiring. You get to walk around an enclosure with spider webs and their spiders everywhere. They were some of the most colorful spiders. We definately enjoyed our afternoon here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatorbaityogi
50,All creatures great & small,"Out of the intense heat of a Californian summer - and into the cool palatial marble foyer. Lovely! Prices $12 adults $9 seniors & children 3yrs + $5This was no ordinary museum of stuffed animals in glass cages. There were fantastic 3D back-drops, and the animals looked alive - in natural poses. Absolutely the very best museum I have ever been to. Take children 9 yrs old + otherwise it is just too over-whelming for them, and they switch off. The grill cafe' was good, but over priced. I recommend this wonderful museum unreservedly! I am astonished that one reviewer found The Natural History Museum a disappointment. She must be very hard to please.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlannahC_12
30,Average,A little bit disappointing. It seemed a bit like an old museum - not as interactive as museums seem to be now. The discovery centre for children was rubbish. Worth going but wouldn't spend more than an hour there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singmummy1
40,Small But Worth a Trip,"The archives are open and fairly well labeled, so that you can see objects that are ""in storage"" as well as the regular exhibits.The gem and mineral displays are some of the best anywhere, with one room of gold that will take your breath away!Worth a visit anytime!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler401
50,Worht the trip when in Downtown Los Angeles.,"This is L.A.'s version of Night At The Museum -- it looks just like the New York version, but it's been cleaned up and improved recently. The Gift Shop and Restaurant and clean and worht the money, and the exhibits are great for the kids. Not as well known, but worht the discovery!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHSwift
30,Nice,"We had stopped at the California Science Center and had noticed the Natural History Museum near by. Addmission price was quite reasonable - $9 each (for senors).The displays were quite nice, but not expansive.I may be prejudice, but I think the one in San Diego is better.Also, San Diego offers more museums in one central location in Balboa Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimThacker
50,dinosaur exhibit is amazing,"really loved the dinosaur exhibit - I understand it is relatively new and the space is beautiful! Rest of the museum is standard ""diorama"" type setup with stuffed animals in posed scenes... But we loved the dinosaur wing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maychang
30,poor signposting from the metro,the sign post for the museum is only visable from the science museum side of the road so you wander around looking for directions no clues at all for metro platform,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrytap
50,LA History- In your own backyard,"Terrific for all ages! Well done displays- EXCELLENT Dino Coverage!Easy parking- access to the Rose gardens and other adj. museums. Spend the day!My Grandson had a great time and he was 2 1/2 at the time. Dinos, trains and cars are his life so...a great place for him to explore. The grounds are great for a picnic and a quick TODDLER (get the energy out) RUN before heading back into the museum. Free day ROCKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preciouspinkxxx
30,Almost there,"It's obvious that the Natural History Museum is transforming itself by the construction fencing and closed off areas. The new Dinosaur Hall is wonderful, new, interactive, informative and fun. But some exhibits were a little shabby around the edges and really need an update. The gem collection is massive but their exhibit hall is lacking. The History of California has yet to be renovated. It's going to take a lot of money to make this museum world class. But it would be worth it. The building's architecture has some real highlights, like the Rotunda. My 11 year old guest and I gave it 3 stars, but that's because we are comparing it to our experiences at the Smithsonian and New York museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jocelyn1157
50,Fun for even an 18 month yr old.,"Went on a Monday and got there at opening. Not busy then, but picked up in afternoon. Beautifully kept building, clean, airy and cool on a hot day. Saw butterfly exhibit. Will go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDK_11
50,Educational,Three of us spent a very interesting few hours there and I could have done with another few hours. Every thing there was interesting but I was particularly struck by the collection of stones/gems/rocks; an outstanding collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ei9hk
30,nice,"I didnt go here myself, my daughter went with the grandpa and they both enjoyed themselves, had hoped for a few more exibits, but still enjoyed their day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951
50,DINOSAURS!,"Best dinosaur exhibit we have seen,african animal display, mammals, and gemstones too. Not too crowded on a weekday. Had to pull the kids away",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FRQNTF
40,"Excellent, But Getting A Bit Dated.","I loved the Museum of Natural History. In a city loaded with glitz and attractions that are totally phoney, this is a real museum that is obviously much loved by it's staff. Minerals, stuffed animals in large diorama exhibits, dinosaur skeletons, all those great museum things are there.But - sadly - it's pretty clear that the County has cut back on their museum budget. Some of these exhibits are looking a little long in the tooth.Still, It's a wonderful change of pace from the go, go, go pace of LA. It's close to the wonderful California African American Museum, which was a real surprise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/air4ce
30,Page Museum LeBrea Tar Pits,Downtown Los Angeles the strong stinch of tar? Yep! Exterior exhibits great including the huge boulder in the back and parking outside of the SAG (Screen Actors Guild)! Didn't see any movie stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oldspice1947
50,A good time every time,"It was so good I signed up for a membership. Educational and fun, and nothing beats First Fridays there - live music, interesting speeches, and two bars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
40,"""Hidden"" Gem just out of downtown LA","I say that the Natural History Museum is ""hidden"" because it's not in the main tourist areas so I'm guessing many tourists wouldn't go there. I spent most of the day there. There are heaps of exhibits. There is a rose garden and butterfly house (seasonal I think) out the back and inside there is a huge dinosaur exhibit, an extensive gems collection, a collection of stuffed animals, the history of LA (this one was being moved, so it was only partially available, which I was bummed at) and there are a couple of new exhibits opening end of 2012/early 2013. Well worth a visit and not too expensive at $12 for an adult plus an extra $3 for the butterflies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DutchieGirl
50,Great museum,One of the best natural history museums around. It is huge and has great exhibits. You could easily spend an entire day here. I think this is on par with the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. Well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue
50,Fun,We went to the museum for a wedding. It was fun. The service was held in the Rotunda and the reception in the Mammal Hall. We were allowed to wander through the rooms of the museum and got to see the dinosaurs and animal exhibits. Definitely an unusual experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huskydog49
50,Prepare to be amazed.,This place has multiple things to intrigue you. The exhibits are first rate and the collection is quite extensive. Hard to beat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeniceL_12
50,A must see if in Los Angeles,If you find yourself in LA with kids you can't go wrong here an must visit the museum. Took my kids and they have one of the largest exhibits of dinasours and fossils I have ever seen. Not to mention animals from North America and native to CA. A pretty good gem and stone collection too. Not crowded and the price is cheap. A must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robo44
40,Interesting,I'm not really a museum enthusiast but the LA Natural History Museum was worth the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandaxxjean
50,Great Museum for Everyone of All Ages,"The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles is one of the best museums in the entire state. The dinosaur exhibit is great. There is a room with North American Animals that's been around for years, but it's fun especially for young kids. There is a section of a room full of rocks and gems that is very interesting along with many other exhibits. In October they have a fabulous spider pavilion where you can get up close and personal with a variety of large (non-poisonous) spiders. In April into summer they have a great butterfly pavilion, which the kids love. Don't miss the exhibit on California History on the bottom floor of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachkindy

40,Interesting place for all ages,The exhibits are very realistic and make it seem like you're there with the animals/people/places in a different time. A little something for kids and grown ups to enjoy. The attention to detail makes the experience I think.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneeW

40,Fun afternoon!,"I haven't been back to this museum for quite some time, and boy has it changed! It still had many of the original exhibits, but they've added on a wing that houses the dinosaur exhibit. It was so much fun just wandering through each section, and seeing the life size skeletons and fossils! It is a wonderful place to take kids, and spend an afternoon there as a family. The main reason I went was to see the butterfly pavilion, which is only there until the beg. of Sept. Entering into the space, you are immediately overwhelmed with beautiful butterflies, just floating by you. As you linger through, you see many different varieties, all happily fluttering about. It was so interesting to see them in a natural setting, and very calming and soothing. I highly recommend booking your tickets on-line before going, because the wait list can be 2-hours+, depending on what day you go. Also, go earlier than later. The heat really builds up in the pavilion, and it gets quite humid inside. But absolutely a must, and soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt

50,Old and New . . . All Very Cool,"I love the old dioramas featuring dusty taxidermy, but the new dinosaur exhibit is FANTASTIC! Plan to spend several hours there, as you'll want to linger over the displays; reading the signs that go with the fossils will blow your mind. Then visit the new cafeteria downstairs and refuel for some more natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antisocialpaula
50,Awesome Dinosaurs,Love love dinos .....some exhibits pretty good .but the Dinos were brilliant .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frangii
50,Great animal displays,"We visited the Natural History Museum on a Friday morning and it was packed with school visits. This was very noisy but also charming :)The museum has fantastic animal displays (North American Mammals, Dinosaurs, African Mammals, Insects to name a few). We were in awe of the detail taken to prepare each scene, and the quality of the animal specimens.We caught a live dinosaur show with the Triceratops puppet. Aimed at young children, but we still found parts of it amusing.Overall a great way to spend a few hours in LA. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louise_nz
50,Bug Day at the NHMLAC!,"First of all, I love the area around the museum, the rose gardens, the Coliseum, USC campus, and on this particular day, Bug Day, there was a butterfly habitat set up outside for members. Inside, vendors selling insects to collectors, educators with live insects and companies selling collection paraphernalia filled the area where the dinosaurs and dioramas are. It was crowded and lines were long, but it was very well worth the wait.There were bugs you could eat, bugs you could let walk on your arm (I had a scorpion walk over my hand and forearm!), bugs to look at with wonder, and lots to purchase and the boxes to show them in.I've been collecting for a year, and I learned so much!Aside from the special day, the volunteers who went around giving directions, helping everyone find things, were amazing! I like that everyone who works there has a great attitude and are helpful and patient.The various rooms have been redone to make it more streamlined for visitors, and my favorite minerals rooms were still glorious.If you hate crowds, wait to visit during the fall or spring when school is in session and only school groups come with their teachers for field trips. It's not crowded at all and there are always timely exhibits besides the usual mummies and bones.It's great for everyone. Parking is not far from the entrance and is not free (I paid $10), and the entrance fee is $12 for adults (I got in free as a teacher--just show your CTA card!), and little kids are free to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritFrenchPol
50,bring the kids or go by yourself!,"What a gem in the middle of downtown. Just steps away from the coliseum and Staple Center, and the USC campus. Spend the day strolling through our native natural history and step out side in the wonderful rose garden. Walk over to the historic Coliseum, home of the Olympic games, NFL football and of course the home games of USC and UCLA back in the day before UCLA played at the Rose Bowl. This museum has been seen is many movies and TV programs and it is a must for locals during the summer when school is out. for singles and couples take time during the week when it is less crowed and noisy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineIrvine
50,Impressive,"This Museum was a must-see on my recent trip, and it did not disappoint. The dinosaur hall was rather amazing and well presented. There are a lot of educational displays throughout for visitors to read and learn from, which I liked.The Gem & Mineral exhibit was also a great area to walk through.Quite a few families were visiting, so it was loud at times, but overall it was an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brad208

40,Dino-mite,"If you like dinosaurs, this is the place for you. Loads of dino skeletons and, for the kids, a great interactive area where they can actually assemble dino bones on a stand to make their own near-life-size skeleton.There's also a great display of gems and minerals. The two halls containing mammals are looking a bit dated but are impressive. In the basement there's a section about LA history with a number of dioramas that we found interesting.If you're a fan of the TV show ""Bones"", the NHM's Rose Garden with the fountain is the view that's often shown as the exterior of the fictional ""Jeffersonian Institute"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cards-Preds-Fan
50,Not as famous as other LA attractions but one of the best in the world,"I'm talking about the dinosaur displays. This relatively new display is well presented, educational and enjoyable. Parking can be a bit difficult at busy times. If you are either interested in dinosaurs and natural history or don't know much about these topics, I recommend that you pay the museum a visit. Otherwise you should visit Disneyland, Universal Studios etc. first. There is not much facility for relaxation inside the museum but Exposition Park is nice. There are a lot of kids running around and they are are noisy as are their parents. The displays can be enormous until you find out that they are reconstructed from parts of a dinosaurs femur or other skeletal bits and pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/not_johntan
50,Come see the dinosaurs - Awesome,"I hadn’t been to the museum in over 10 years and was pleasantly surprised by all of the changes. The museum used to be dark and rundown. The remodel of the museum last summer has turned it into a world class venue.The new Dinosaur Hall is incredible. The displays are very informative. The T-Rex display showing the different stages of a T-Rex’s life (growth series) was my favorite. Very well done.There are several interactive displays that kids (and adults) enjoy.The California History & Gems and Minerals exhibits were very interesting and informative.Fun for adults and kids of all ages.The area around the museum is nice, not scary like it used to be. The grassy area in front of the museum is a great place to picnic or just relax.Plenty of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
50,WOW,"This is a must visit when in LA. My LA host who was visiting the first time was even shocked and awed by the mineral displays of large gold nuggets, must be worth millions; the colorful gemstones; the beautiful crystal formations; the dinosaur bones etc. Everything inside is an eye opener. A must visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albert808

50,Don't Miss the New Dinosaur Hall!,"My sister and I took our 7 year old daughters to the museum in March 2012. My last visit there was about 3 years ago, prior to the remodel of the dinosaur exhibit. The girls LOVED the dino hall! It's full of interactive and educational high-tech activities and video. All the grownups loved it too! The old hall was dark and gloomy and the remodel is well-lit and inviting. We spent about 2 1/2 hours in the dino hall alone, and probably could have stayed longer but wanted to see a little more of the rest of the museum. This museum is well worth the price of admission ($10 fir adults and $5 for kids). It's a thoroughly enjoyable day for the whole family. You may want to pack a lunch though, as the cafeteria is very overpriced, and if it's a nice day you can sit outside and enjoy your lunch in the rose garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJMesq

The outside gardens are nice, too. Maybe I'm a little spoiled being in DC and going to NY regularly, so I'd call it nice but not extra special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254SusanC

50,Awesome Dinosaur Hall,The fairly new Dinosaur Hall is so great. The information is well organized so it is easy to see and connect the evolution of these amazing creatures. My family and I also love the T-Rex exhibit where we can see an archeologist at work. There are many other exhibit at this museum that are so fascinating. The interactive room is big and airy. Great place to get the kids touching all sorts of things. Go when the outdoor Butterfly or Spider exhibit is on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKrisC

50,Lots to see and fun for everyone!,I've taken my kids to this museum several times over the last decade and it never gets boring. I feel like a kid when I go and there's always something new to learn. The newest Dinosaur exhibit is really nice! We were all very impressed by the extensive collection of bones and specimens the museum has. My favorite exhibit that should not be missed is the Gem and Mineral hall. Beautiful colors dazzle the eyes here and you are certain to be amazed at some of nature's greatest formations.Allow plenty of time to see this museum as it has a lot to see. Trying to cram everything into two hours will leave you feeling rushed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Cheapest museum for me...espected more for being such a large system of them!,"There were at least five separate museums though I had time for only two!

50,Very nice,"I really liked the new dinosaur exhibit. One thing that was interesting was the different ages of a T-Rex. I loved the ancient sea creatures on display, especially the sea lion that was 12 million years old or so. My Husband thought one of these sea creatures looked like the Loch Ness Monster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Buff29
40,"Great experience, even without the kids.","20 years ago I went to the Museum with my kids. Now that they're grown, I wanted to see it again without them.

40,"Diornamas, giant bones, a great place for kids.","The set pieces of history, dioramas, of animals and early people are fun and instructions for children.

Fun for children and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarpBooksFan
50,Historic.,"I never hear about the L.A. Natural Museum on a national level, and that is too bad because it deserves more recognition. It has fantastic displays, awesome dinosaur exhibits, animal exhibits, cultural displays, and so much more. This is the place to take the kids if you cannot afford Disneyland, and wish them to experience something with a little more then just entertainment. My children loved it. I recognized that several of the rooms had been used time to time in some move settings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fuzzball42

40,A Place of Wonder & Learning For the Whole Family,"Our family has visited this museum over a dozen times over the years! The insect fair and butterfly exhibits are wondrous and takes place only twice a year - so check the calendar for those! Otherwise, there are many interesting exhibits to see year round, such as the dinosaur exhibit which has recently been expanded. This is also a really great place for very young children and the really terrific Science museum is within walking distance, so go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet
40,Enjoyed walking around the exhibits and dinosaurs,"I have always been interested in dinosaurs; seeing some of the most complete fossils in the world was amazing. The exhbits of animals in diorama like settings may be a bit dated but were still interesting. Went on a school day and there were a lot of noisy kids. Have to agree that this is great for young children, but even my 27 y.o. enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris9111948

50,A Trip To The Past,While this is an older museum it has recently gone through renovation and has opened new and exiciting galleries. It is a must see. Also in the same area are the Museum of Air and Space & Science . These museums are free so the $9 parking is well amortized.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
40,Overwhelming.,"On the first Friday evening of every month, the museum offers booze, pop music and conviviality, and a science lecture. I liked the bird exhibit the best. (There are live bugs and insects, too.) You can have your pic taken with an enormous polar bear, which has been rearing on two hind feet for at least the past 65 years (I remember from childhood). Get food from outside trucks (one of them very vegan, and good!). Buy books on evolution and the origins of the universe from a well-stocked store to give to your ignorant friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnParleFrancais

50,This is the 2nd choice of our Grandchildren to go visit...,"They like to go at least 2 - 3 times a year. Seems to always hold their attention. Lots of displays to enjoy and drawers of items to touch and view. The new exhibit is the Dinosaur Encounters and is really worth seeing. There is a special area for viewing live insects, bugs, sea life and digging for fake fossils (great for the young ones). Good way to spend a day and if you have time, check out the Los Angeles Science Center part of the property as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJ928

Every exhibit is so well put together, there is so much for every family member to enjoy! if you have older children or you are a child at heart and have a thing for dinosaurs, DO NOT MISS this museum!

50,Great attraction that easy on the pocket.,"The museum is a compact but complete version of the famous one in Washington. DC. Kids had a hell of greta time looking at the Dino bones, stuffed animals that looked alive. Its very easy to tour the place and it takes around 2 to 3 hours to finish. Easy for us adults. Souvenir shops are well stacked and parking is not a problem. Only downside is theres only one canteen/food outlet thus the very long queue. Overall i recommend the museum to everyone specially the kids. Not at all expensive. Will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorycook
50,Great new dinosaur exhibit,The new dinosaur exhibit is beautifully done. With views of the exhibits from a second story balconies. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAJFJ2
50,"Beautiful building, interesting exhibits.","This museum is located right next to USC and plan to spend at least 4 hours going through the exhibits (prehistoric animals of LA, insect zoo, an outstanding gem collection, animals, birds, hands-on discovery area, etc). I loved being in the building, some places were breath-taking, some places were bathed with warm sunshine, some rooms have lovely views of the adjacent Rose garden. Lunch in the downstairs cafe was actually pretty good. We also visited the free science museum (good, but it pales in comparison to NHM) and took pictures in the Rose garden, so one can spend the day in the area. If you are thinking of going to the la brea tar pits/page museum, be sure to ask about upgrading your tickets and getting a discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattymommy
50,Excellent Museum Complex,"You can't help but love this museum, the building is old and has a lot of character to it. A very kid friendly museum. The best part is that there are other museums, like the Air & Space attached. Lovely rose garden too and an IMAX theater. You could easily spend the day here, For a fun place to eat try the nearby Mercado Paloma, which has a few shops and some terrific restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalSorrows
50,Great Museum with something for everyone,"The LA Museum of Natural History was a must for our 7-year-old granddaughter who's really into dinosaurs. We roamed all over the place and two floors in checking out the dinosaur exhibits. They are great. This museum is not something that you can do in a few hours. One could take all day and still have to come back to cover all the exhibits. They do have a restaurant and it's adequate for a light lunch. The prices are, as might be expected, a little on the high side, but not excessive. All in all it's a great attraction for locals as well as tourists. Well worth whatever time to can spare for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonc11
40,Good place to get kids interested!,"So much to see and do, lots of experiences, especially for kids. The exhibits are realistic and very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylandBrett
50,Must bring kids,"We live in a rural place far from the city, so bringing my 12 year old son here was a must and treat for him. They have a whole floor for birds, with lots of old drawings by Audobon, and a lizard and reptile floor downstairs with live animals. Room after room of history, we jumped in on a history tour of early American in the west that was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeirdreLamb
50,Excellent,"Have seen many museums in my decades on this planet and this one may be at the pinnacle. Not just for kids like nearby Science Museum. Learned many things about CA history, living and dead animals, and especially mineralogy that this jaded intellectual did not know. Well worth the 2 hours travel time from hotel and admission to get there; would go back (a rarity). Next to a very large and well-tended multi-variety rose garden that was nice to sit in and contemplate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smarteconomist
50,Night at the Museum live !!!!,WOW !!! Tis place feels like you are in a dream and you woke up and you are still in it. Try to go on a weekday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
30,"Cool Insect section, awe inspiring dinosaur exhibit",We spent an afternoon with the kids at this museum. Lovely insect section with helpful and informative staff. They also have a great dinosaur exhibit and the bird section is also well done. You could easily spend more time here but we ran out of time. Close to many other museums. Entry fee is not much and kids really enjoyed it. The Spider Garden is also fun and would love to visit when the Butterfly House is there in Summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigholidaydreaming
50,"Night at the Museum - spend the night on the floor, and wake to animals!","Grab a group of friends, or a club and register for a fun night.We were the first group to be allowed to sleep in the museum after the Dinosaur Hall opened. The night begins at 7 p.m. and included 4-5 tours of the museum lead by cool/young docents. There were live bug talks and a scavenger hunt. The kids learned about the animals and how we study fossils. There were crafts and activities to keep the kids busy until 10 p.m. Then it was time to sleep. Parents/chaperons were provided with earplugs...because the kids stay up all night. Thank you so much for thinking about this NHM - great idea! Bringing a blow up mattress is better on the back. Morning was juice and danish. We could stay the whole day a the museum (included in the price). Overall, it was a neat experience that we will remember for a long time. Thank you NHM for making this overnight in the museum possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Well done! Great educational outing!,"We just visited the NHMLA this week and fell in love with it (bought a membership so we can go back as often as we please). Our 6 year old son was in Heaven! There's so much to see and do. They've done an incredible job of using space, wisely. They really put the extra touches on creating ambiance in each room/exhibit (low lighting, music, sound effects, etc.).The Dino Hall was exquisite!!! We went on a weekday morning and didn't even need tickets, we were told. There was hardly anyone there. Worth taking a day off work/school to go on a weekday, let me tell you. I'd heard horror storied re: weekend crowds and didn't want any part of that! You can't believe what they've got there - dinos EVERYWHERE! They're hanging from ceilings, even! They did a fantastic job of setting up video stations that allow for interaction on the actual digs for these monsters. Our son liked that. The T-Rex threesome is phenomenal....could've stared at them all day!The Dino Lab was fun, fun, fun! You get to actually watch someone working on a dino bone. It's amazing! Not to be missed. They even tell you what type of bone and dino they're currently working on.Our son really enjoyed the Insect Zoo. They've got some really cool insects in an easy to navigate room, full of glass tanks and creepy crawlies. Great for the little ones!The gift shop was a nice stop at the end of the day for a souvenir. They've got a beautiful selection for kids AND adults. Easily spent some money in there!!!Can't wait to go back and take things a room at a time, in detail. There's just so much to see and learn about! Bring your cameras and comfortable shoes - you won't want to leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flossboss
50,Dino Hall is amazing,"We love the Natural History Museum. The new Dino Hall is a stunning addition. Comprehensive, interesting, and visually amazing. Tip: Go in the morning - especially weekends - at opening. We were there on a Sunday at 10:30 and it was getting quite crowded. By the time we left, there was a long line outside. You can also order tickets from the museum website. Afterward, we walked through the Exposition Park rose garden. It is huge, peaceful, and beautiful. In all, a great day for any age visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
50,New Dino Hall is awesome!,"First off, we followed the driving/parking directions on the NHM website, which helped us get around the construction. Also, we purchased our tickets with Dino Hall reservation time online - this way, we bypassed the long line to purchase tickets at the entrance! A reservation time for Dino Hall is important - it is packed, and we saw many people turned away because they had no reservations.Even with reservations, Dino Hall was quite crowded, but the exhibits are breathtaking. We could have spent far longer in this area, but we still wanted to see the rest of the museum.We really enjoyed the North American Mammal Hall and the African Mammal Hall. The unexpected plus was going into the vault in the Geology Hall to see the rare gems - so cool!It took about 5 hours to see the entire museum, and we could have taken much longer to really explore everything. I would recommend getting there when they open to give enough time to see everything without rushing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaykayfam
50,Great Experience!,"We have been to this museum quite a few times, usually during the week. This was our first time on a weekend, and we were a little surprised at how crowded it was, but then we remembered everyone was here for the new Dinosaur Hall. The new exhibition is really well put together. It had the attention of my kids (4 & 6) for a good hour. The California section of the museum contains lots of dioramas that my kids (as well as many other by the looks of it) really enjoy. We didn't visit the other areas of the museum on this particular visit, but they are all fantastic. Can’t wait to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlinfamily1
40,Great for all ages.,"There is so much to see at this museum. Insects, minerals, ancient artifacts, dino lab, etc, etc, etc. We allocated about 4 hours during our trip to the museum and we didn't get to see it all. Lots of interesting things for all ages. They were also advertising for a new dinosaur wing opening the summer of 2011 so that should only add to all of the great stuff they already have.TIP - teachers get in free with identification so make sure you carry it with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wildkat520
50,"Loud and crowded, but fun and interesting!","We checked out the new Dinosaur Hall at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, and it was great! The little kids were fascinated by the towering fossils, and there were interactive activities for the older kids. I had never been in this museum before, and in addition to the Dinosaur Hall, my 6 year olds loved the taxidermy mammal displays! A few helpful tips - if you want to visit the Dinosaur Hall, you might consider getting your tickets online ahead of time. Also, you need CASH to park, and it was $10. Overall, this was a fun way to spend the afternoon with my two little boys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettandanne
50,World Class Dinosaur Exhibit,"NHM recently opened its new dinosaur exhibit, and it's one of the best anywhere. Around 30 full skeletons, and hundreds of other artifacts, including a fair number of ""touchables"". Lots of interactive displays, including one that produces computer-modeled dinosaur calls! Really really cool, and lots of information. Bring the little ones, and they'll love it; bring the older ones, and they'll be blown away!And that's just one hall of this place -- check out the gem hall, the hands-on insect lab, the mammal and bird halls, and an amazing collection of pre-Columbian pottery. You'll probably want to spend a full day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BurbankAV
40,Every age will get something out of this trip!,"Hm, tip number one would be know where you're parking; we accidentally went in over by the Science Center and had to walk a ways. Apparently there's underground parking right beneath the museum. Also, if you're meeting somebody, clarify which entrance you'll be meeting at. There's the main entrance on the lawn, and the other entrance on the backside; it can be a bit of a hoof if your fellow visitors are older and grumpy! Go visit the Dinosaur Hall; beautiful exhibit, lots of skeletons, fossils, really wonderfully displayed. My kids loved it, my hubby and I loved it and the grandparents enjoyed it too! Go early, or later in the day, to avoid the crowds. The Butterfly Pavilion was really neat, everybody had a butterfly land on them! Go back more than once; lots to see there! My kids loved that it felt like the ""Night at the Museum"" movie. The dioramas are gorgeous. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munkiemama
30,Dinosaurs - good for children,"Best to go to this attraction during the weekday and early morning to avoid the LA traffic and overcrowding. Parking is located directly across fro the Museum within easy walking to the dinosaur attraction. They had lots of staff available to answer questions at a child's level. Limited dinosaurs, but had some very upscale exhibits. Worthwhile exhibit to get children started on visiting a museum. Warm inside so dress cooly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highwaytrip
40,new displays are very Smithsonian,"We checked out the new mammal displays. Very modern and informative, compared to the old timey dioramas. The renovations look great so far, can't wait to see the outdoor exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
50,Discovery area - first day it opened,"Pretty fantastic museum. This was our first time there, and we enjoyed it. Parking is still $8. It was pouring the week that we went. Ours was a special members-only day so we had perks the morning of. The hit was the Discovery room (first day that it opened) and it was a big deal for the kids. There was a life-sized stuffed polar bear as you walk in, and several animal heads on the walls, that had been acquired from various donors...pelts the kids could touch, antlers, all kinds and sizes, and bugs in glass that they could explore under the microscopes provided. They went crazy and the museum was kind enough to provide chairs for parents to rest while the kids looked at everything...good job museum! Another hit was the life-sized dinosaur puppet that comes out twice a day for a cool show. The puppet rests in this room w/ a puppet Saber tooth tiger that does the same at other times. We stayed much later than we thought we would...most of the day...and really enjoyed it. We will return very soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
40,Wonderful and economical the NHM in Los Angeles,"Recently visited the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles County on a weekend, with my two daughters 5 and 7, and my in-laws. The entire family had a wonderful time from the youngest to the oldest, there is so much to see and do. If you have young children the dinosaur show was great they couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the day. Make sure you are there at least 20 minutes early to get a good front of the action seat. The best part was the price very reasonable for a family of 5. There are several new wings and there is still some construction in the Museum and around the area that you should be prepared for, but can't wait to see the place when it is done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAExplorer69
50,Lots to see,FREE on the first Tuesday of the Month. Parking is under $10.I took my son when he was 18 months. He liked looking at all of the animals and loved the Discovery Center. I brought the stroller and I would park it in at the beginning of the rooms and then walk around.I need to go back soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalpcktmemories
50,Great alternative to SoCal theme parks,"I brought my kids (aged 10 and 6) to the Natural History Museum of LA County because I wanted them to see more of SoCal beyond all the theme parks in the area. It was a day well-spent! The kids and I enjoyed viewing all the displays. Of course, the dinosaur displays were such a big hit with them! What they found even cooler was watching scientists working on actual fossils. It's really a great way to get them interested in science and history. Admission price is reasonable, the place is easily accessible, this museum was a great find!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gafrancomd
50,A Day Well Spent,"In researching possibilities for a special outing for just my son (age 10) and me, I came across Los Angeles' Natural History Museum and Science Center. My son LOVES museums... I'm not such a fan of them... but thought we'd give it a try since this was a day for him. We both had an absolutely awesome day! My son was so impressed with the dinosaur exhibits, the North American and African animal halls, gems/minerals exhibit, the bug zoo... the list goes on!! I was as well impressed with all of these and just the overall quality, beauty and architecture of the museum itself. We also thoroughly enjoyed the Science Center but decided it was too much to do both in one day! We could have easily spent the better part of a day at each facility and taken more time to enjoy all that we experienced. We are anxious to make another trip (which is an hour+ for us) to both again in the near future. Very well priced too for a full day's entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road37765
