50,Hike the Challenge,"This hiking trail will be closed until the end of March 2017. It will reopen with restricted hours because of the abuse and damage less educated humans have caused. Parking at the site is for about 20 cars and street parking around the entrance to the trail is restricted and patrolled. Make sure you read all the signs and park accordingly.BUT if you ever come to Whittier and have the opportunity to hike these hills and reach the second of the 2 water towers you will find yourself among many people who have used this hills to get back in shape, gain self-confidence and their health back. This is not an easy hike by any means. I consider this a medium to strenuous hike depending on your health.See beyond the people, admire the hills and nature. There are many different types of birds and deer. You might spot a coyote or two. Stay on the trail because there has been reports of rattle snakes. On your way to the water tower you will be able to see the Buddhist Temple inside Rose Hills Cemetery property. On your way back stop and take a glance at the city and don't forget to take anything and everything you hiked with. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHernandez
