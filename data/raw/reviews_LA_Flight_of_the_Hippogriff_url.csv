30,Cute,Definitely a kids roller coaster ride but it is still fun to go on for a little ride. It did not have a large line up when we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missedme
40,Very short but fun ride,"My kid (she is 12) doesn't like roller coasters, we need a lot of convincing for her to ride this... and she loved it !!!!Since we had early entrance to the park we rode it twice.This ride is 1 minute long since it starts moving. 30 seconds going up to the first fall, and 30 seconds of thrill.Recommended for kids or those who doesn't like scary rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karife28
40,Maybe good for small kids....,"This may be good for smaller kids, but it’s too short and too small for most experienced coaster riders. Ride is over very quickly. Also, other than sitting next to a replica of Hagrid’s house, this has absolutely nothing to do with Harry Potter or any other character. Still, it’s fun and lines are shorter here than for other rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dware82320
30,Short,"If there’s a long queue for this, song bother. It’s ok as a walk-on but is over before you can say accio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingofgeography
50,Flight of Hippogriff,"This was a smooth junior roller coaster that was just long enough to get you screaming and then done. Not jerky and is faster than it looks. Has Hagrits Hut, life size version from the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariyalew73
40,A quick rollercoaster,This is a very quick ride. Not fast quick but quick as in it's over in just around two minutes. It is fun though and not the least bit scary. A great starter coaster for kids (or adults) working up the courage to tackle bigger rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
40,The best in terms of waiting,"The shortest waiting time for this ride, as it is very short and quick. Also, it is lots of fun, we went on it several times. The only problem is that you can´t the total rip-off of the entrance Price to the park: 129 dollars per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabesua
40,Fun roller coaster,The flight of the Hippogriff is a simple but short and speedy roller coaster.... it is so fast that it is almost over too soon! (The actual time of the ride is just over one minute and reaching a speed just under29 miles per hour...Hang onto your hats!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
10,Not Worth The Wait Times,"Certainly not worth the wait time of 55 mins. The coaster is very short any only lasts seconds. If you’re a die hard HP fan do it, but don’t wait inline too long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
30,It's a Roller Coaster,"We arrived at the park for early entry at just the right time. We had barely reached where the crowd was gathered when they released the flood gates and the masses headed for The Wizarding World. While the majority of guests made a beeline for Forbidden Journey, we decided to grab a quick ride on Hippogriff instead.It's a short family coaster that's over just as it's getting started, but Hippogriff provides a comfortable and smooth ride. The theming surrounding this otherwise standard roller coaster is excellent. True Harry Potter fans would probably appreciate it more than I (or perhaps if you had to wait more than zero minutes to get on the train).It was a perfectly low key start to our first Universal visit in over five years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thedlr
30,Short and a bit boring,The ride is really short and there's nothing special about this one. So a bit boring I might say. Nothing even close to the other Harry Potter ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
50,Fun for all ages.,"Although a small ride, we wanted the full Harry Potter experience so got in the queue. It's mum friendly which is nice and judging by the mum behind us swearing away, she had fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWestSpain
40,Fun but Short.,Quite fast. no loops. Over in no time. So it is brief but enjoyable. We went here first so didn't have to wait too long to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
30,Long wait for a short ride,"This is a roller coaster in Harry Potters Wizarding World inside Universal Studios Hollywood. It is a fairly short and tame roller coaster ride, which is probably more suited for young kids, rather than teenagers or adults that want a real thrill. Check the wait before you go on this as you could queue for a long time for a very short ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
