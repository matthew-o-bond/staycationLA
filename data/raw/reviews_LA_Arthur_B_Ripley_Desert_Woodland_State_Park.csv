40,beautiful Joshua Tree forest,We had a pleasant stroll through the beautiful blooming Joshua Trees. We had the preserve to ourselves. A nice printed guide gives a good description for features along the short nature trail. The port-a-potties provide marginal services. No water is available.,swj
40,Nice Find,"Stumbled across this park today after leaving the Poppy Reserve. Many of the desert plants are blooming. What a pleasant find. Nice walkways, east access.",Brendavig
40,Nice walk through the desert,"There are boardwalks, rangers and an interpretive center. Good place to learn about the high desert flora and fauna. Nice place for a walk if it isn't too hot.",JKPImageFusion
40,Desert Park is Much Bigger Than it Looks,"The ""main"" section of Ripley, where the park sign and gate is, has easy-to-follow trails, picnic tables and an informational kiosk-- but if you look at the preserve on Google maps you'll see it's bigger than you think. Much, much bigger.If you like wandering among joshua trees and scraggly chaparral, with the big desert skies above and not much else, you'll love Ripley. I gave it 4 stars, most people might not -- it's an acquired taste. Next time we go, I'm printing out the bigger maps so we can explore the far western and southern sections of the park, and the adjacent Desert Pines Sanctuary. We just like wandering around in the wide open spaces while trying not to get lost.You might want to include the Poppy Reserve on the same trip, since Ripley isn't far from it, or take a section hike on one of the more drab parts of the Pacific Crest Trail.",SoCalRambler
30,Nice Little Desert Woodland Park with Easy Hiking Trail,"We stopped by Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park after a half day visit the California State Flower Fields - The Golden Poppy at Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in Lancaster, CA. Only few miles to the west of the Poppy Reserve, Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park and Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve make a nice day trip for California residents. All the hiking trails at these two parks are easy and short. While at the Poppy Reserve you can combine several short trails to make a longer loop, at Ripley State Park, there are only two short trails (a .3 mile round trip Nature Trail and a 1.0 mile round trip Rare Juniper Trail). Desert hiking is perfect during winter and spring time of the year since the weather is mild with blue sky, white clouds, and nice spring breeze.At Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park, you will find a virgin forest of Joshua trees and California junipers like how the western part of the Mojave Desert likely appeared to early explorers in the 18th century. At the park, Joshua trees and California junipers are the dominate species with a large undergrowth of California buckwheat, golden bush, Mormon tea, blue sage, and beavertail cactus. Because of last year wet winter, Ripley State Park becomes more lively this year with vibrant colors of blue sage, golden bush, and Joshua trees themselves. The reason that this park was called Desert Woodland and so unique because it is a a transition area between desert and mountain climates, resulting in a mix a plants that are usually not found together.Although less visited, the hiking trails at this little state park are well maintained, leveled and very easy.",IheartZephyr
