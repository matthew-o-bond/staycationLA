50,Fantastic,"This temple in Malibu near Los Angeles is fantastic. Architecturally very beautiful inside out, one gets positive vibes inside the temple. Photography is not permitted inside the temple. Certainly would very highly recommend visiting the same to any traveler, when in LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716sachink
40,Nice place,"Took the kids here so they could experience a Hindu temple. We all took our shoes of and washed our feet in the tap right next to the shoe stand.The place was a little dirtier than I expected it to be, and several places where tiles was loose. But all in all a beautiful place worth to stop by just to take a look, if your travelling from Malibu to Calabasas for instance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960carmend
50,Amazing architecture,Came here w some clients and this is a magnificent area hidden in the middle of no where.It was quite busy when we came but with the sun shinning down at 103 it was quite hot on the feet especially for the young ones.I’d waited back in the room as they’d went in and was getting horrific stares from hose around because I was in shorts and have tattoos on my leg and female. That’s just not what’s part of the culture but still was rude of them to stare like that.It’s not my religion but didn’t stop me from appreciating what they offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Beautiful temple hidden in the mountains along the highway,"Beautiful temple nestled in the Santa Monica mountains near the King Gillette Ranch Visitor's Center. Free parking.

40,Soothing balm for the mind and soul,"The Malibu Hindu temple is actually located in Calabasas about ten miles northeast of Malibu. The drive up to the temple is on narrow, really picturesque roads. The temple built of marble and white brick in traditional South Indian style, has a very scenic setting in the Santa Monica mountains.Surrounded by expanses of open space, the white temple structure stands out against the backdrop of the lush green tree-dotted hills. The temple ‘gopurams’ (pyramid shaped towers) are finely worked with carved images from Indian scriptures and mythology. Dating back about 40 years to 1981, it is owned and run by the Hindu Temple Society of Southern California.The temple is dedicated to two presiding deities – the upper temple complex for Lord Venkateswara and the lower temple complex has Lord Shiva. Apart from the presiding deities, both temple complexes have altars dedicated to other Hindu gods such as Ram, Lakshman, Sita, Hanuman, Ganesh, Padmavati, Bhoodevi, Krishna and Radha.As per Hindu faith, there is only one god although in different forms – the religion is unique in that it encourages believers to worship their favourite god or goddess, because in the final analysis they are all manifestations of one God.Walking barefoot on the cool and clean temple floors, one can inhale the fragrance of sandalwood and incense and hear the priests chanting their ‘mantras’ or conducting ‘pujas’ requested by visiting devotees.Tiered chandeliers provide illumination within the temple. The priests reside on the grounds of the temple complex. A large subterranean Cultural Hall offers space for functions, music and dance recitals.On weekends and holidays, the temple kitchen serves up reasonably priced, tasty, good quality vegetarian fare. The kitchen is in the Cultural Hall below the upper temple complex and all the food served here is prepared on site by volunteers.All “poojas”, “abhishekams”, “aarathis”, and “archanas” require tickets to be bought at the Temple Office.Apart from the regular ‘aarathis’, ‘archanas’ and ‘abhishekams’, the temple website lists the various ‘homams’ and ‘samskaras’ that can be done both within the temple and outside the temple on weekdays and weekends/holidays. The outside the temple option is more expensive compared to the same done within the temple and also requires travel expense to be met. The outside the temple option on weekends/holidays, costs more as compared to the outside the temple option on weekdays.Wedding engagement and wedding ceremonies can be conducted at the temple on payment of the required charges. Apart from payment for conducting the ceremonies, a further payment needs to be made for use of the Cultural Hall for an 8-hour span – the payment for use of the hall is significantly less on weekdays as compared to weekends/holidays. Additional payments are required for the services of the priest and use of the kitchen. The person hiring the hall is responsible for cleaning it before handing over the premises back to the temple.Photography of the temple exterior and its grounds is allowed – no photographs are permitted within the temple. Admission is open to all regardless of religion, colour, ethnicity, race or gender. Visitors are expected to be appropriately dressed – footwear is not allowed within the temple. Smoking on the premises is prohibited as also non-vegetarian food.Temple trivia: This temple featured in the 1997 Chris Farley movie Beverly Hills Ninja and the 1998 Tamil film Jeans. In 2006, Britney Spears had her son blessed at the temple.The Malibu Hindu Temple was most recently in the news in November 2018. There was great apprehension that the temple could be in harm’s way as winds fanned the flames of the raging Woolsey fire that decimated large stretches of nearby land and property including several celebrity homes. While the flames did come threateningly close and the temple was forced to close for a little over a week, perhaps it was collective prayers and divine grace that saw it finally come through unscathed.The temple is open all days of the year. Timings are:Weekdays: Summer 9am - 1230pm and 5pm - 8pm | Winter 9am - 1230pm and 5pm - 7pmWeekends & Holidays: Summer and Winter 8am - 7pmThere are no entry fees but voluntary donations are appreciated.The Malibu Hindu Temple is calm and restful even as it has an indefinable positive energy about it. It matters little whether you are a Hindu or not – being here is soothing balm for the mind and soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Supreme Divine Experience,Our New Year started with the divine blessing from Balaji Perumal the principal deity at the Hindu temple at Malibu.

40,Weekend visit to LA,We took this beautiful drive on PCH up to Malibu in to Malibu temple. It is a really windy drive on Malibu Canyon road to the temple which is situated in a pristine valley with calm winds. The temple is really really nice and brings a lot of peace upon entry. We attended the puja in the main temple along with all the other smaller ones. We stopped by the hall underneath the temple to buy some good vegetarian food for a very good price. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/achunder

The architecture is unbelievably intricate. Visitors must remove their shoes to enter the temple. Signs are clearly posted. During the week there were few people around, but I'm sure the weekend is a bit more crowded. Great place for reflection and some photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli

It was really an excellent trip for me and my family.Only drawback is there is no proper place to keep our foot wares. Since the management is doing renovation I hope they will arrange a proper place to keep our foot wares.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiriBhat
50,Our Path to Malibu Hindu Temple,"Vickie & I enjoy listening to older songs on YouTube. A favorite is singer Annette Hanshaw and accompanying musicians from circa 1930. As you probably know, off to the right of our selection on YouTube are many suggested items that we might like; related to what we are listening to. Some pictured suggestions for Annette showed a Betty Boop type figure in a colorful setting. There were other similar offerings for Annette.Each of these offerings had the stereotype Hindu dressed Betty Boop girl ""singing"" actual Annette Hanshaw songs from the late 1920s and early 1930s with, strange to us, animated things going on around her.Turns out that these animated songs are from the movie, ""Sita Sings the Blues"", made in 2008 by Nina Paley. The movie is based on The Ramayana, an Indian epic poem written before the birth of Christ; 24,000 verses long and the bases for a lot of Hinduism. We watched the movie on YouTube. It looked like most of the participants are gods. It is the story of Rama and his wife Sita. Sita is kidnapped by a questionable god king of what we know as Sri Lanka and Rama rescues her. During the movie Sita breaks into song to ""sing"" an Annette song that describes what she is going through; mostly blues. The movie is billed as ""The greatest break-up story ever told"".Nina Paley had been going through rough times with her husband. During her low point she chanced to hear Annette's songs and she realized that the lyrics described what she had been experiencing. Nina had worked in India so she was familiar with the Ramayana, which she could also identify with. Nina put the two together and almost single-handedly made ""Sita Sings the Blues"" in her apartment. The movie contains great history, religion, and music.We took a library DVD of ""Sita Sings the Blues"" to watch the night camping before our Saturday Hindu Temple visit; to get in the mood. Not knowing what to expect, we were overwhelmed by the experience of observing many worshipers and priests at the different shrines; so much going on all at one time. From what we experienced, most church services were sitting in a pew and listening to one or two ministers giving us good advice. Not here! The participants are interactive with the priests and shrines. We were given a no-charge vegetarian meal. There was even a Rama and Sita+ shrine, so we felt connected. One take away is that it is a lot easier to have one God, than many. We were treated well and we had an amazing experience.Chuck & Vickie",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck246
40,HINDU TEMPLE,"This temple is generally known as malibu hindu temple. The temple houses Lord Venkteswara in standing posture, with Lakshmi and Andal, separately housed within the premises.

Services were taking place and worshipers invited us to stay and watch and also politely answered our questions about the proceedings. The temple and adjacent buildings were breath-taking. Very ornate and beautiful. It was very interesting to watch worshipers crack coconuts to extract the milk that would later be poured over one of the deities during services. Other alters had fruit and grains placed in front of other deities. I understand this is the only Hindu temple in America. It felt like an honor to be allowed to visit it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oregonsenior
