30,A lot of repeats,"This is a pretty large flea market, but unfortunately about every 3rd stall is a repeat of the same items.It was fairly clean and costs from$1.50 to $3.00 per person to enter depending on the day. Parking is free but the spots are pretty tight and today someone backed into a parked car and then drove off.We didn’t feel unsafe, but we can’t think of a reason we’d go back. It is a mostly Hispanic population, so the majority of items are of this interest.",RNRVTraveler
50,Awesome place to send a day,The Santa Fe Springs Swap meet has something for everyone. If your looking for gift ideas or just shopping for yourself there are so many things to buy. It is family friendly and the bands that play on sunday are right on time. I've been trying to make the saturday night entertainment but it seems that I'm alway busy. Oh and the selection of food to eat is off the hook. What a selection.,Dflores

30,A fun place to walk around,"You need to have on your walking shoes. There are so many vendors selling everything from tools, kitchen ware, clothes, purses, jewelry, food and much more. It's kind of fun to just see what people are selling, even if you don't buy anything, but you will probably find something that you want.",DONNA P
40,1st time here,"Parking wasnt too bad just a packed house. Had to wait in line for admission and get searched for weapons..there was a 2.00 admission fee.There were alot of vendors with different items from hats,shirts, makeup etc. Live music was playing and different types of food was being sold and alcoholic beverages. Stayed open pretty late..best swapmeet we have been too in this area.",Monika T
