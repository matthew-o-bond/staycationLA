40,Iconic landmark showing you've arrived,"It's really nice that the sign has been preserved and continues to welcome people to Santa Monica Beach and the Pier. It is a gateway to a unique place in Southern California that can bring joy and kill your wallet like some place in Anaheim. It has some nice attractions in the Pacific Park, but mostly more kiddy type rides, but still fun. Great place to watch people of all types, sizes, and ages.",geotech522

50,"It is Just a Sign, but That is Not Why You Came","The old Santa Monica Yacht Harbor Sign does not direct you to yachts, you will find none. They are long gone. It is a cool sign and at night it has neat lights. It is old and has been refurbished. It is just a sign, but behind that sign is magic.Behind the Santa Monica Sign is the Santa Monica Pier and the Carousel and the ocean under your feet, and the arcade and fun fun fun.If you want you can drive on the Pier to see the sign up close and then park on the Pier if there is any parking, but just park below at beach parking and walk on up. Walk under the sign, grab a wristband and go on the rides that make you dizzy (eat after the rides), make sure to ride the most beautiful Carousel and just walk. It is magic. The best time is right when it starts to get dark. You can smell the pilings of the Pier and cotton candy and old wood. You will love it. It is Santa Monica.",elizabethlascheid
