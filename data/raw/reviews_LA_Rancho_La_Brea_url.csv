40,Third Trip still interesting!,"Always love the tar pits. It is not huge building but you need to walk the grounds, too. On a beautiful day be sure to visit other museums in the area. Did not do extra fee items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiatucker
50,"Spanish Land Grant, includes the Tar Pits ...","Rancho La Brea refers to an old Spanish land grant - & not to the La Brea tar pits, which are only a small part. The original Rancho was in what is now the Miracle Mile area and more. Visit the Tar Pits Museum where this history is nicely explained, photos available, oil field history + the amazing tar pit discoveries. Worth visiting as a Must See when visiting LA! Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Rancho La Brea is not just the La Brea Tar Pits,"As a previous reviewer has alluded to, Rancho La Brea has an interesting history - the background and context can be easily accessed by searching for Rancho La Brea (for example the Wikipedia page will tell you all about the history of the land grant). It is largely a portion of land around the Miracle Mile, Hollywood and parts of West Hollywood which includes the famous La Brea Tar Pits. The Tar Pits themselves are more than worth a visit to understand the tragic (for the poor animals) history. It is fascinating to see the scientists working on discoveries made in the tar pits and there is still active excavation occurring. The museum is reviewed separately under the La Brea Tar Pits listing though. You can get the 720 bus from right outside the Tar Pits Musuem (on Wilshire) right through to Santa Monica for $1.75. It takes about 40 minutes in light traffic, longer in peak times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
50,An amazing museum,For children and adults. The possibility to witness how researchers find fossils. To see history unfold in front your eyes is tremendous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grondy
30,"If you are on your way to the beach, make a stop","We were going to Santa Monica Beach and we decided to stop at La Brea Park.It is a natural ""brea lake"" were a lot of fossils where discovered. You actually can see the metane gas coming out... we had the ""luck"" to see how a dove sank, so it was interesting.The museum costs 11 dollars, we didnt visit it.So, as I said: If you are on your way to the beach, get down the bus for 15 minutes ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwinkyWonder
40,Historical site,"un californio is wrong about the history of this place. If you want to know more accurate information, you can google it. But basically, it was granted to a Portuguese immigrant(Rocha) by the Hispanic Mayor. Rocha's family later sold it to Henry Hancock because they owed him money.As to the place itself, it was educational and fascinating. I am always impressed by those who can take a bunch of bones and make them into something that used to exist. Well worth a trip if you have a few hours to spare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarrieL844
50,Fascinating look at a geological wonder,"It was our last day in LA and we thought we would try someting different. Easy parking and no crowds so we off to a good start. The facility was well laid out and a joy to wander round. The discoveries found in these tar pits are truly amazing - so many bones, how do they make sense of it all? It was great to see people at work in the Paleontology Lab inside the main building.For something different and a fascinating couple of hours, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Somuchtosee01
