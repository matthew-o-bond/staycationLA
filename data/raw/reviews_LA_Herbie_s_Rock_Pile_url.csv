50,A gem of a find!,"I've read about this place online and decided I'd go today as a little birthday present trip. They've got a lot of stuff, albeit in a tiny space! Crystals, incense, resins, and jewelry! The girl working today, Melissa, was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable and also lovely to chat with. Prices on the items are also very reasonable. I was super happy to find it, I'll definitely go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marias111111
