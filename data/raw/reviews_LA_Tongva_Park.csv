30,Novel park between the ocean and the City Hall.,"Small park well laid out with interesting walk, water features, restrooms and children's play area with slides and climbing frames but no swings. It would help if the plants could have been named in the park, whilst there was a lot of grass overgowing the beds. There were staff working on the grass, there was also a lot of homeless people in the park which I think would be quite scary at night.",HughMc
30,pretty park,"pretty park, right by city hall and all the city buildings. Lots of homeless however, so be careful. Can be a little scary at night.",Becky RTS
40,"Very nice park, but...","it is a real shame that so many homeless people were sleeping out in the open, in the middle of the day. There *has* to be a solution, some way to give these folks a purpose, and a real place to live. All of that aside, this park was an unexpected part of our day, and well worth the time to explore it.",Jim C
30,Small park,We needed to kill time and let traffic die down before we left Santa Monica to head for Disney so I took my two daughters to the playground here. There were a few homeless people sleeping on the benches at the entrance of the park. They did not bother us though. I did see a security guard patrolling the park while we were there. The playground is unique. There are a few slides and climbing structures. No swings. Decent park to pass the time with but nothing to go out of your way to visit.,Travelingankara
40,A great little neighbourhood park for young children,"Our Children (both under 8 years old) really enjoyed this park. There is a splash pad, a climbing structure, a couple of slides, rocks to climb on. Its close to Santa Monica Pier.If you are in the area, definitely worth a visit with the kids.",khochajee
50,Perfect for kids,It has a nice playground for kids. So I was feeling great for my son who enjoyed himself so much at the park. Definitely must visit!,Dewi Erawan

30,Tongva Park,"We stayed in a hotel four blocks from the Park. Our hotel clerk mentioned this Park when we checked in as one of the things we could do during our stay, although the day before there had been a stabbing there.... we figured if we went during the day we'd be okay. There were very few people in there walking around....not much to see...pretty trees and flowers and plenty of benches that were occupied by homeless people. Lots of homeless people everywhere in the area we were and lots of people under the influence. Sad.",JamieLeman

50,Beautiful Downtown Santa Monica Park,"This is a lovely park to stroll through at the end of a long day, or after a wonderful dinner downtown. The wide paths and grassy edge plantings are soothing, offer some shade, and generally keep the walk relaxed. You will occasionally find a homeless person sleeping, but for the most part it's other strollers, and moms with strollers. The architecture and layout are lovely, and the overlooks of Ocean Avenue make a great photo opp.",seatowngetawaygirl
30,Fun splash pad,"This isn't my favorite park, because there isn't that much grass to play in, but it has a great splash pad for when it is warm out.",Luika
50,A Nice Little Kids Water Feature,We have recently visited Tongva and our young son loves it. He likes the water features he can play in and the other natural waterfalls that have been created. There is a roller slide and a couple of other long slides that older kids like. Most of the play area has large rocks around the perimeter and the surface is mostly rubberized for safer play.,Mitchel N
50,An imaginative cityscape -- very thought provoking.,Take a break from the commerce of the pier area and calm yourself with the depth of thought that has gone into the design of this beautiful haven in the midst of the craziness.,Zachary Matz
40,Dense and interesting park,"You need a good reason to go back from the beach but this park is quite different, with dense stands of trees and flowering plants, water features and good playgrounds. The parts of the park away from the highway are quiet and might be good if you want to rest in the shade - except that most benches are cunningly positioned in the sunny spots.",mrdom
50,Lovely in the evening,"This park, a block from the Santa Monica Pier, is beautifully landscaped, with fountains and metal sculptures. It's lit well at night, and felt safe for the short time I walked through it. It's also just a block off Colorado Avenue, so very accessible if you are downtown.",CleopatraBunny
50,A Peaceful Clean Park To Enjoy-No Restrooms,"A multi-level park that's close to Santa Monica Pier/3rd Street Promenade without the crowds. A water garden, wave structure lookouts to Ocean Avenue, playgrounds for little ones, lots of plants. Across the street from City Services - great place to spend your lunch hour. A few homeless people but they were keeping to themselves. A park for everyone to enjoy!",humudog
50,Different than your usual park!,My 4 year old loves this park. It has a lot of cool water features and places for climbing and sliding. It's walking distance to the beach and to the Santa Monica Mall. Great place to have the kids burn some energy and explore!,Marina Howley
20,Progressive Paradies Park by the sea,"$36.2 Million dollar park. You can see how a park costs this much money b/c no detail was spared and the cost of steel, a multiple story skyscraper, underground parking certainly adds up (all of which isn't in this or any park). There is no bad element that has taken over the park and you can feel safe walking through the park, especially at night. If you wish to purchase personal fulfilment items there are plenty of vendors in the park.",660traveldude
40,Relaxing environment. Pity about the hobos.,"Tranquil park with sculptures and water features leading to Art Deco City Hall.. Very helpful attendants, restrooms and child's play area. Can walk around it in 10 minutes although it would be a lovely place to sit for a while if you aren't put off by the number of homeless asleep on the benches.",macfirth
10,STRANGER DANGER!,"I live in Santa Monica and I would not recommend anyone go there. You can't see what is going on there is so much foliage. Too many homeless, drug use, crime and mentally ill people have made it their place to hang out. Be very careful if you are visiting Santa Monica at all as crime is on the rise.",NancyatTheShores
10,Too many homeless,This is a nicely designed park (same designers a NYC's Highline). Unfortunately it is over run by homeless people. Last week a kid got stabbed in the head and throat by a homeless. If you are an unsuspecting tourist stay away until Santa Monica City decides to do anything about its vagrancy issue.,Eric S
10,Beautiful but VERY DANGEROUS. Be careful,"On the same day as someone was shot on the pier, that night a teenage boy had his throat slashed by a homeless person who hangs out in Tonga. It has sadly become a home for transients who are very territorial about their benches, possessions. They store their belongings in the gardens so be especially careful when you walk the beautifully designed by now truly dangerous paths. Though we have been begging city council to station security guards or police in the park, they haven't done so. Also be careful with your kids because hypodermic needles have been found. Maybe Rick Cole will do something to clean it up and make it safe.",TheresaRodgerton
40,Great Park.,"Santa Monica really takes pride in each one of their parks and Tongva is no exception. The park has so many things to do. The water attractions are great, and there are plenty of restrooms etc. ---- something you will never find in an LA Park.",Ronald S

30,Nice Park but ....,"This park was a nice walk to our hotel but be careful of the homeless community. Generally they didnâ€™t bother us but on one occasion, there was an argument between them, luckily a local ambassador was there and showed us another way out. We avoided the park afterwards. Pity",Jacqbren
40,Beautiful!,"I really, really liked this park! The design of it is very unique and beautiful. It was also extremely clean, including the bathroom area. There was staff at the park who make sure to keep it clean. I liked the water design art. I think for those living in the area this is a great place to take a stroll. It's very relaxing. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to see this place while going on vacation; in that case it could be skipped.",Erica I

50,A wonderful surprise visit!,"I accidentally stumbled by Tongva Park as I was leaving the Santa Monica Pier and I was so happy to have experienced this park! I did spot one homeless man sleeping near the entrance, but no one asked me for money and I felt safe walking around during a weekday afternoon. I mainly spent my time looking at the cool art installations, walking around the playground area, and taking photos of the beautiful flowers. I'm surprised not many locals have heard of this park and I hope more people get to see this park in Santa Monica!",reesarei

40,Interesting park with cool sculptures and local plants,If youâ€™re in Santa Monica area close to this park definitely check it out! Itâ€™s fairly new as the attendant told me it had only been there 4 years as a means of preserving a green space with the influx of new apartment buildings. There are some cool metal sculptures and sitting area plus some overlooks. Not to mention the various local flowers and plants they have. Itâ€™s well designed and a place you could come relax for a little while or just pass through.,SouthernBelles98

Highly recommend place to visit! Great family or couple park for a picnic!,Yehbut

Historic and interesting place. Nice easy walking.",VendellaS

40,well designed park,"Brian, a Downtown Ambassador was working in the park the evening we were there and he was super informative and thoughtful about the questions I asked him. What he told us about the park, the art, the history really made the experience much more interesting. It also reassured me to see him there since there is a rather testy homeless population in the entire area, not just the park, but as a woman I would not walk around inside the park alone after dark, and I am a New Yorker!",nyccali2907
50,So cool!,"Walked through on our way back to our hotel. It's beautiful and kind of tucked away. We wandered back to the play area and were amazed at how cool it was back there. This was a kid free vacation, but would totally come back with the kids.",Jennifer K

50,Beautiful park! Nice views! Great for kids!,"This is a really nicely kept park that I hesitate to review because crowds would ruin it! Tongva (named for an indigenous people of LA) is a six-acre park across the street from Santa Monica pier. It is big, clean, full of beautiful trees and plants and sculptures and water features, and has some really nice play areas for children. Playground areas have soft, bouncy rubberized material on the ground. There are slides and things to climb. There are also numerous art installations. There is even a ramp and stair up to two lookout points over Ocean Avenue where you can see out to the pier and Pacific.There is also a very clean public restroom with an attendant. This is locked up after hours but open in the daytime.Bring your pet or children or significant other for a stroll!",Heather S
50,Nice new park and fun for all ages!,"My teenage boys and I took a stroll through the park on a recent visit. It was very clean, quiet, and had many different places to sit and relax, or play with the kids. We loved the extremely soft flooring of the play areas and the different architectural designs that made the park unique. I definitely recommend taking a lunch or snack as enjoying some family time.",Nancy H
40,Good spot for lunch and a little play with visual interest,Wanted some place to eat lunch that was both visually interesting for the adults and fun for the kid. This achieved both. Nice place to go before spending the afternoon at the beach. Parking was a little challenging.,Jennifer J

50,Interesting,Small well thought out park with lots of unusual sculptures. Lovely water features and windmill spinners. Peaceful and some good viewing platforms.,saturnstan
40,Quiet escape,"This park is right across the entrance of the Santa Monica Pier. It provides a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Ocean Ave. and the Pier. Since everyone is making their way to the pier, no one really stops by the park, so it is a great place to have a quiet stroll amongst the palm trees.",F S
50,very unusual!,"This park, named for early Native American dwellers, formerly parking lot, is a real gem of design and landscaping. In a very accessible location, on Ocean Avenue near the popular Santa Monica Pier, it is virtually ignored by locals and visitors to Santa Monica alike - because there is nothing to buy or eat. Highly recommended for a relaxing stroll, or ten or fifteen minutes of quiet contemplation on a bench. Nearby is Chez Jay, one of the last of the old Santa Monica dining and drinking establishments.",dl5490
40,Lovely beach views and good playground,"Although there are a few homeless people here, they seem to leave folks alone. There is a lovely playground for the little ones and a short walk up the path leads to beautiful coastal views.

50,A lovely local park away from the hubbub of Santa Monica Pier,"After seeing how heavily congested the entrance to Santa Monica Pier was, I slowly strolled towards this park which was across the street and found it to be a hidden gem away from the tourist crowds and attractions. It was peaceful, artistically designed and a pleasure to walk through. It also had a great playground, designed for all children, including special needs. Definitely the place to go to get some relief from the crowds.",jaauoc
50,"Great for Little Kids, and Big Ones Too","We met my sister and her adorable 2-year-old granddaughter there. We all had a great time, especially the baby. One nice feature: Foam rubber pavement, so little ones won't get hurt falling off the monkey bars, which they invariably will.",Dan S
40,Neat children's park,Just happened upon this walking back from the peir to where we parked. It felt very clean and upkept inside. Clean bathrooms. Nice fountains flowing. Sculptures around. The kids play area was a lot of fun and different than your normal run of the mill playground. Definitely a little quiet gem inside the busy area around it.,Kelley J
50,Wonderful city park close to the beach in Santa Monca,"One of my favorite parks in Los Angeles - landscaped with interesting, indigenous plants and trees, fantastic playground for kids and lots of benches for sitting and contemplating. Across from City Hall, walking distance to the beach.",Susan A
30,Fell a bit short of my expectation.,"When I visited Tongva Park, there were a lot of homeless people and smell of marijuana smoke here and there in the park. The nicest and safest part of the park was by the playground because there were a lot of people there but when I went to other sitting areas trying to have my lunch, there were homeless people sleeping on the benches. I am sad to see that but also not very inclined to go and relax there. Too bad.",GOSIA P

40,Lovely park,This is a very nice park between the pier and City Hall in Santa Monica. We walked around it and were a bit dismayed and sad to see that so many homeless people were sleeping there. There is a wonderful play area for children on the north side of the park. We saw a few monarch butterflies and a squirrel who was scavenging for crumbs that people had dropped.,GerMar60
40,Sleekly designed park!,This park located very close to the entrance of the Santa Monica pier offers an oasis in which to relax amid the sound of fountains and trees swaying in the breeze off the Pacific ocean. There are restrooms available and I guess it's these open and free restrooms that have unfortunately attracted many of the homeless people who seem to make this park their home. But despite the vagrants of which other reviewers have complained about I still believe this park is worth a quick look for it's sleek design and creative landscaping or maybe a longer visit to destress and disconnect from all the noisy crowds!,ARodriguezP
30,Shame about the homeless,"Lovely park filled with homeless people sleeping everywhere so gives a feeling of unease , nice water features and view points of the ocean",Jangransutton
50,Beautiful park with unique design.,This park is absolutely unique in design and beautiful. The park spans a few blocks.

40,Just walking thru,The park is very modern and beautiful . What I found to be a turn off is how many homeless people were finding refuge in the park and really not taking care of it. Just because someone is down and out doesn't mean they have to contribute to the slumps.,Angel R
40,Nice seaside park.,"This park sits right across Ocean Avenue from the Santa Monica Pier.

50,Walk and talk,Lovely place to include in your Santa Monica walk. Very pretty with benches for a rest or stop to talk or if alone a good place to read. The water features are soothing. Plant selections are interesting and varied. There is a children's area that looks and sounds like lots of fun!!,shotinthedark1956

40,Looked good for kids on a hot day,"Saw lots of kids around age 6-10 playing in the water in this lovely park. Dogs are allowed but can't play in the water. Still, it was a rare area of green and shade in the middle of a hot day next to the 3rd street promenade for my dog.",emememSFbayarea
40,sit and chill. A welcome green space,"The green space that this park represents is certainly welcome in beachside Santa Monica because there is not much else room for small kids to be small kids and for people just to chill. The park doesnâ€™t take long to walk around, and essentially there is not much to see, unless you want to count the homeless taking a snooze in the warm afternoon sun. The place is well maintained and thereâ€™s a nice area for kids to do water place dashing in and out of the water spouts, and walk up a rise to sit and view the ocean. As a place to visit, it wonâ€™t take you long to cover its attractions. How long you wish to stay and enjoy it is another matter entirely.",JohnSB3
40,Nice park,"Nice park to walk through. A nice play park for kids. Lovely sculptures and very well taken care of.

We walked through the park various times during the day and evening and always felt safe.",PJJK
40,Gem of a park,"We walked through this lovely park while returning to our hotel from the Third St. Promenade. A beautiful collection of native plants, landscape design elements (decorative lighting bollards, etc.) and pathways. There were a few homeless people hanging out the north side of the park abuts a busy road near the 10 freeway. Well worth a visit.",terere2
40,Great park,Nice park with natural grasses and cacti. Great for a leisurely stroll. Also has an interactive play area for children. The only deterrent is all the homeless people in the park. The city of Santa Monica must choose not to do anything about all the homeless people and beggars in the public areas. Very disappointing is such a beautiful city.,dwmv65
40,Nice Park But Falls Way Short of Hype,"Lovely setting, but very isolated feeling. Doesn't relate to any of the surrounding streets, especially Ocean Avenue. Has a bunker aspect approached from the west. You can't even really tell what it is from that direction. The design doesn't pull the visitor in. Very disappointing. Inside is a peaceful setting, and there's a nice play area for kids. When you drive by, you have no idea how to access the space. Poor urban design that doesn't relate aesthetically or visually to the surrounding neighborhood. The opposite of what a park should be.",Richard G

40,Great If You Stay In The Park; Expect Drug Dealers At Restrooms,"In just a short period of time, this community park has split into two worlds. On the one hand, the play structures and grassy areas look wonderful for kids of all ages. But the public restrooms appear to have been taken over by drug dealers and law enforcement appears content to do nothing. It would seem a simple task to sweep this area on a random, frequent basis, so it's sad that it appears to have been abandoned.",Michael H
30,Nice park if you remove the homeless people,"Nice looking park, with good kids play area, however there are a lot of homeless people and ""crazies"" loitering here. Unfortunately one of my children needed to use the public toilet which was a bit scary due to the wierdos hanging around, probably should have got our tetnus shots redone after that. Has potential to be a great park, its just ruined by all the homeless.",LisaB
50,Great park for young kids.,"It's a great way to start off the day with little kids and then head to the beach or pier.

50,"2nd trip to this park, this time with lots of kids in tow...GREAT!","As a local, I have been to this park before but wanted to give it another review seeing it through some kid's eyes yesterday. First of all there are two very cool unusual slides...one is bumpy! Fantastic. The apparatus are more like the kind in Europe...they look cool and inspire imaginative play in the kids. Oh..and there are plenty of places for parents to sit while watching. The kids discovered an ENORMOUS tree...just sequestered on the VERY edge overlooking the freeway. Iconic..I believe it was a type of fig...probably 300 years old. If you head towards the ocean side there are places you can look out onto the ocean. All it all a great time and was so happy to 'staycation' with my pal from San Francisco with the kids. p.s. there are food places right near the park...Joan's on Third (pricey but have sandwiches) Cheaper you can grab a pizza to go at Bruno's.",AFoolForTravel

This area between City Hall and Ocean Avenue is a well-curated collection of drought tolerant plants and trees, with water elements and picnic tables and children's playgrounds. All you could wish for in a city block!",rebmans
40,Beautiful Park...choose the right time!,"I love this park, it has a great design with places to sit and enjoy lunch with a friend or family. Beautiful urban art with fountains throughout the grounds. Fabulous old growth trees and succulent gardens incorporated into this little oasis. Close to the beach, shopping and restaurants pretty much anything that you want is near by. I find it a great place for a peaceful walk or catching up on some reading I never get to.I wish I could go on and rave that you can go here anytime and enjoy all of what I just shared. Unfortunately the homeless population in the mornings and evenings keep me away. The reality is I live in Santa Monica and am very selective about the time of day I choose to spend time here.This was a utopic idea for a park on some ones desk in city planning. Not sure why they thought this would not happen? Until something changes I will continue to enjoy this place selectively.",Bradley1965
50,Lovely Park!,"Really happy when they created this park a few years back. nice areas to sit, water pools and fountains, little play area for children. well landscapped and maintained.",allison r
50,WunderschÃ¶n!!!,"The park is new and since I travel almost every 2 years to LA, is for me just amazing how they worked it out despite the drought to build up something so pretty which was needed in the zone.The new buildings and appartments around the park are also astoning and perfect to sit and relax... It has nice fountains with treated or recycled water and special plants which need less water to save, children areas and many trees, my favorite place are the banks or views right in front of the park. The are high so you can make awesome pictures from the Sea, Santa Monica, Malibu and Venice!!",Sunamun Bellyda... M

50,Neat Modernistic Cali-Park,"A really unusual park built above Ocean Ave. w panoramic coastal & ocean views. Has special amenities such as climbing wall, sand box play area & ultra nice bathroom areas. Greenscape plantings are well done. Come here for the view & then walk over to the inclined ramp to the pier, then down to the beach. ( Parking is easy in any if the lots near city hall area...",David B L

50,Cool new park on Ocean in Santa Monica,What a cool park! Lots of interesting spaces and cool art. The kids park is really nice as well. Clean bathrooms/wash basins which is convenient.,Robin s
40,Wonderful park with ocean views.,"The newest, but also the best park in Santa Monica: great play features for kids, pretty paths, picnic tables, ocean views. For those who do geocaching, there's a cache here. But please, do not ride your bike inside the park: walk it!",Yseut
50,Awesome Water Features Not Much Shade,"We LOVE Tongva Park! It's such a fun place to take kids and meet friends. There are lots of unique water features that are built into the brilliant design of this park. Our favorites are the mini rivers. You take your sandals off and let your toes take a little soak, walk or run through the mini rivers on the natural stone paths. It's so fun. There are a few climbing structures, spinning tops, a splash pad, a built-in rock wall, picnic tables and a few interesting slides to keep parents and kiddos happy. The only thing this park lacks is shade. They really should've planted more shade trees and installed canopies or sails to offer more shade. It can get really hot near the splash pad and you'll see the parents huddled in the few spots of shade that the sparse trees provide. Chez Jay Patio is adjacent to the park and offers breakfast and lunch items for take away or to enjoy at a table on their patio. Metered Parking surrounds the park at $2 per hour with time limits but fines are $64 and up, so best bet is to park at the Civic Center Parking Structure at 333 Civic Center Dr, Santa Monica, CA 90401, where fees max out at $5. Quite a bargain considering the proximity to the Pier, beach & Third Street Promenade. Last time we went there was a fun & free Puppet Making Workshop as part of their Family Saturdays program. Check out their upcoming events http://tongvapark.smgov.net/events/",Can'twait2go2ASP
50,A very nice stroll,"The park is about 2 years old, just south of the Third Street Promenade and 2 blocks inland from the Pier. It is well thought out urban park with interesting sculptures and water elements and a great playground area for little kids. Grab a cup of coffee and meander for 30 minutes or, if you have toddlers, let them have a great time in the kiddie area.",ljsamson

50,The perfect place for walking and sharing with Friends.,"Occasionally, I am joined by my Art Squad for watercolor painting in this joyful park. After a few hours of painting we share our lunches. What pleasure, Everywhere the eye goes is another picture. Van Gogh and Matisse would be covet such a location.",Marylou M
50,Beautiful,"This place is really new and beautifully designed. We were slightly put off by the number of down and outs, but only because we were tourists and did not know the area well.",AAGill
50,Beautiful oasis,"You can tell that a lot of care was taken in each detail of the park - architectural landscaping, organic and inorganic materials, very peaceful. Lots of places to sit and even some overlook areas where you can see the beach, PCH, the pier, etc. Can't wait to go back and take my camera! It would be a great place for a first date.",Lizzykins_1913
50,Perfect After Supper Stroll,"Santa Monica has a lot of wonderful parks, but this one is outstanding. I've been to this park several times, but this was the first time that I had ever come here at night. My significant other and I decided to come here after having a night cap at the Starbucks across the street. It was a bit cold that night, but we were bundled up nicely for our stroll.Even though there were a few homeless people on the perimeter of the park, when we went inside all we saw were other couples. We decided to walk to the top level where there is an overlook that provides a view of the ocean, beach, and Santa Monica pier. This is a spectacular view during the daytime, but it is also nice at night, because you see the changing lights of the ferris wheel at Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier. There are also lights built into the floor of the overlook that change color at night. This is a very romantic spot for couples.Even though it was after 9pm on a weekday, we felt safe being in the park. I don't recommend that people go there much later than that though, because I think that it is probably unwise.",debras223
40,Very Pretty,Nice quiet oasis just off the main street. Water features are a nice touch as is the shade. Breeze comes off from the ocean.,Diana E

50,Beautiful! An architectural treasure.,"I took notice of this park while passing by in the car on Ocean Avenue, but I did not realize just how beautiful it is until I took a walk through it. It is a work of art, an architectural gem, and one that you can appreciate in a short visit. I have no idea who designed this park, but they were able to pack a lot of visual interest into the space. Wonderful little park!",gentlecritic
20,Disappointed,"This park is on two levels with walkways, very weird in my opinion. a lot of wasted space and money. very ill conceived design.",Fred A
50,New park for the kids in all of us,"My brother in law told me this area was vacant land for many years and on this visit we had to see the fountains, climbing walls for the kids and all of the unique climbing structure that border on art. Very well urban designed area and hats off to SM for having such a nice area. Not sure if I would venture in there after dark by myself due to many people sleeping on benches. My wife said the bathrooms were clean. Starbucks to the southeast of the main part of the park if you need a drink.",Veni-vidi-vicidotcom
50,A beautiful new addition to the city,If you need to go to City Hall or passing by - take a walk. This is a well thought out 'grand' park for the city. Many different areas for kids to adults - wonderful views of the ocean.,askworldtraveler
50,Well constructed park close to Santa Monica Place,We passed it a number of times before seeing a photo of it at the Visitor Centre. Certainly worth a brief detour.,MikeLeicester
40,Quaint Little Park Centrally Located,"While Tongva Park has not been able to maintain a pristine appearance due to use and foot traffic, it is a delightful spot, especially for families with small children. There are plenty of playground activities for the little ones, and for adults the layout of the park provides a pleasant backdrop for a leisurely stroll.",Michael H
40,Excellent place to walk dogs,"We always appreciate a dog park when traveling with our dog, and Tongva Park had lots of grassy areas to play in. I would have given this 5 stars but you have to leave your dog on leash (all the locals just left the leash on their dogs who ran free). It would be nice if there was a doggie level water fountain or bowl.",sfgranny
50,STUNNING,This park is STUNNING. Just absolutely beautifully designed. Another knock out of the park for the designer of the High Line in NYC. There are art installations that move with the wind. There are slides. There are other art installations. There are water installations. The park is filled with clean lines and overall just has an elegant design. Just so beautiful.,Jvalliant

50,Very cool park,"This appears to be a relatively new park. It is still bright, shiny, and clean. There are some very cool architectural pieces at this park along with beautiful palm trees and plenty of benches. It has a very modern feel to it.

50,A lovely park,"This is a lovely park with pathways, fountains and streams had to walk past it everyday to get to the shops or the pier. It is across the road from the pier & beach.",MissDetox
50,New Park...modern retreat from City hustle,"I am a local and I had not been to this park...but when jury duty called at the nearby Santa Monica City Hall it turned out to be a wonderful respite on the lunch hour. It is an unusual design for a park and it works. There is a Starbucks on the eastern side of the park across from city hall so you can get a cuppa and sit and enjoy a view of the ocean. There is a fantastic view spot on the far western end. When I was there there were tons of families, local workers and tourists wandering, resting...enjoying this bit of quiet in downtown Santa Monica. It is a great addition to our city.",AFoolForTravel
40,"Nice, new, modern, clean park","Tongva Park is a nice, new, modern, clean park in Santa Monica across the street from The Lobster restaurant. I can't remember what used to be there but I think it was an ugly vacant lot. The park is not huge, but very hilly and interesting, with some twists and turns that make it feel bigger than it actually is. At night, it's lit beautifully. Definitely a nice improvement on the area .. and right next to Chez Jay!",john a

50,Cool Park For The Kids,After getting to Santa Monica pier everyone was hungry so we stop and eat and we brought the kids to play and have some fun at the park and this is a nice park for the kids and there is a lot of thing to see and check out around the park too....

50,Beautiful Park with a Beautiful View,"Tongva Park is a tribute to Modern Landscaping with sustainable plants in a great symphony of beauty. There are neat looking water fountains that you can sit down and feel your stress disappear. The design of this park is gorgeous. I bet it wins awards, looks like something you see in a high end Architecture Magazine. The playground is very cute...and they have lots of table for eating. The best part of the park is two architectural overlook spots that look out to the ocean. It is walking distance to Santa Monica Place, Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica City Hall, Parking and tons of restaurants and shops. Soon, the rail line from LA will have a station right down the street. Access by Big Blue Bus is easy. There are bicycle rentals close by.",Akiko A
40,"respite from 3rd street, perfect for kids","I take my 3 year old and 2 year old here. The ""splash pad"" is a section where there are several fountains of water that shoot up from the ground and walls and the kids can play and get wet. This is turned on seasonally, usually around the end of May through the beginning of September. This year, 2014, was so hot that they turned the water on earlier! The rest of the park is fun for kids but can be very intense for parents if your child is less than 2 or so. There are 2 slides built into a hill. You will have to climb up and down the hill to help your kids if they aren't confident or 'sure-footed. Still, very fun, clean and beautiful!",oohlaalaa

50,World class park in the heart of Santa Monica,"This gorgeous park just opened last year. Native plants, playgrounds, climbing wall, outdoor amphitheater and ocean views all make it a great destination for family, friends and solo soulstice. Designed by James Corner Fields (of the acclaimed NYC Highline project), this $40M city park is a must for gardening affectionados and nature lovers alike. It's adjacent to Santa Monica Pier and SM Place and the new Expo Light Rail Station will be just 1/2 block away when it opens at the end of 2015. Happy exploring!",88jet88
50,Take a stroll at sunset.,"This is such a nice park. There is a great place for kids to play, water features and a unique view point looking out to the sea. Santa Monica is lucky to have this park which is built on the former site of the Rand Corp. Check it out when you visit, it's so peaceful.",Russell A
50,Gorgeous!,"I waited for so long, watching while they unpaved the parking lot and put in a paradise. Literally. This park is almost perfect, with waterfalls and bench seating everywhere. My only gripe is that there isn't a dedicated dog park, but there is a big dedicated kid park. Oh well, paradise can't always be perfect!",Suziselt
50,"A great addition to ""outdoor"" Santa Monica","Tongva Park is not a lush rainforest, or anything like that. Instead plants indigenous to the area, and presumably drought resistant, are festooned in this limited, but still substantial area. It is a park for everyone, of all ages. It includes walkways, and play environments for children. I like that the park connects the civic center to the beachfront areas. Staying at the Doubletree Suites, it is now a more comfortable walk (not having to ""cross over the freeway""--one can bypass that way getting into downtown Santa Monica) to e.g. the Santa Monica Mall and Third Street Promenade. Tongva Park is great addition to the Santa Monica parks.",KLMChicago_IL
50,Well Planned,"The did a great job designing this place. It used to be a flat asphalted parking area; now, it is a more functional and much greener place! The plants and trees look like they have been there and naturally grew there since forever. If you want to take walks, bring the kids to the play areas, or just read a book in peace, this would be a nice place to go to.",Bernadette F
50,WOW,"Constructed by the City of Santa Monica, across from City Hall this park is cutting a edge use of urban space. With native plants and flowing water with climbing walls for kids and quiet places to sit and contemplate it is a model for what a park can be. Oh...there is great contemporary art pieces throughout the property. A must see.",paul_nancy1
50,Cool discovery,"We discovered this park on a weekend stay in Santa Monica while walking to lunch. What a cool place. It is right across the street from city hall. Not very big, some walking trails, play areas for the kids and two water features and picnic tables. Nice place to relax for a couple of hours, and it was not too busy. There are also two observation points that overlook the beach and the Ferris wheel. Very pleasant to walk through.",dragonhart
40,Unexpected!,"As we were walking from our car to the Santa Monica Pier, we noticed this park, completely unexpected and amazing!

50,New - family oriented - a nice bridge towards beach,"I visited here on the week before this park officially opened, but there are already young families driving here..with strollers, et al to download. There are two sweet, small areas for children (just bigger than toddlers) where they can make water jets, climb objects, slide, etc. Play areas have a corklike surface. Paths meander in gentle slopes and curves in a very naturalistic pattern with water features or benches along their sides. There are lots of new trees grouped along edges of park. The pair of oval sculptures (in photos) mark the higher point of the paths, where there are platforms allowing you to look west over adjacent boulevard towards the Pacific. This park connects city hall plaza to the boulevard, which runs parallel to Santa Monica Beach.",Gay T
40,Fantastic views. So close to LA but so peaceful,"Took a drive up here to escape the sea fog down by the bay and so glad we did. The sun was shining, the views were amazing and it was so quiet you could hear the birds singing! Lovely way to escape the noise of the city. We didn't meet another car on the drive. Would definitely recommend.",Erylis
40,Beautiful park in the center of Santa Monica,"In true Santa Monica fashion, this park was designed to be environmentally friendly. Most of the trees are native (as is the name; the Tongva people occupied this part of California before us). It is meant as a more meditative park. Unfortunately, the children's portion is occupying the space where it would have been quiet and the quiet section is freeway adjacent! A real missed opportunity here, but oh well!The children's section is quite cute, including a water feature that can be controlled by the children using it.This is not a park for basketball, soccer, or much else besides a nice stroll or to meet a friend for a picnic lunch. It is nice because we do need a bit of quiet in that area.",Plumeria D
