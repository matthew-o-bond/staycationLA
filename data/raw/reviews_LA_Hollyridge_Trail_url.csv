50,Nice hike up to the Hollywood sign,"We hiked up most of the trail but ran out of time since we had tickets to the taping of Jimmy Kimmel. Great views all around and a nice way to kill some calories. Bring extra water and a hat in the summer, there's almost no shade on the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuresahead
50,Beachwood Drive access is now ul,"Hiking up to the Hollywood sign was on my bucket list for years. I finally did it today, on a Tuesday afternoon in March! Parking was near full.I parked on North Canyon Drive and meandered up the sandy wide path for 3+ miles one-way. I also stopped at the ""Bat Cave"" that's less than a half-mile from the parking lot. Unfortunately, it was in a heavy fog so the dogs and I got wet, but the cool mist was perfect for the dogs.My only complaint is that there is a lot of horse poop on the Mulholland trail section. A nearby riding club takes groups of ten people up at a time to ride along the upper trails. Dogs are allowed but must be leashed. The Mulholland trail then intersects with the Hollyridge trail for that last mile up to Mount Lee. You will walk on a wide sandy path and on pavement.Before you go, look at the large map at the trailhead off North Canyon Drive. You take three sections of three trails to get to the Hollyridge trail that takes you to just behind the big Hollywood sign. Go on a clear day for the views, but expect to be warm as most of the trail is exposed and there is no water along the war, so bring your own!There are many trails in Griffith park and various ways to hike up to the sign, but this 6.5-mile round-trip hike offers views all around and is a challenging workout. A shorter route is to start at the Observatory. That route is only three miles. It's free on all trails to hike in this park.My only other complaint about this hike was the filthy port-a-pot at the parking area. It was near full! (there are no flush toilets in the parking area).Please note North Canyon Drive parking area closes at sunset, so time your hike accordingly. Residents on the street don't want hikers parking in front of their high-priced homes and some have signs in their front yard warning you to stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniegum
50,Awesome!,"Put in your GPS 3100 Beachwood drive los angeles. You will drive all the way up beachwood drive and park there. You can park there every day except for weekends and holidays. We arrived at about 10:00 and there was a plethora of parking spots. Another thing to keep in mind is that the residents of beachwood dive don't want you there, so keep in mind to be as quiet as possible and be respectful of their property. When you get to the top you will see a big gate, just open the door and go through. turn right onto the trail when you see smokey the bear, follow the trail and make sure you keep on eye on other people to see where they are going. There are enough people on the trail for you to not use a map or any kind of navigation, just follow the trail and see where it goes. The only part where it gets tricky is when you have to take a very sharp left and continue up the trail, you'll know what i'm talking about when you do it. When the trail ends, it turns into the road, to go behind the sign, turn right on this road, to go in front of it turn left on this road.The view behind the sign is breathtaking and simply awesome. You will get some great pictures but I also recommend turning left because the view from the front is awesome too, it's just not as high.Hike up to the hollywood sign it's free and very rewarding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinlN7675RJ
50,Getting up close behind the Hollywood Sign,"Hollyridge trailA great trail to get up close behind the Hollywood sign & also good views in front of it along the trail.To get to the Hollyridge Trail look up the directions to Sunset Stables as the stables & the start of the Hollyridge trail are at the same place which is acessed off Beachwood Drive - I wish I had known this before as finding the trail is then easy.If you are driving do not be put off by the signs on Beachwood Drive saying no access to the Hollywood sign (there is access to walk just not drive the whole way) just keep driving & park on the residential road in front of the large metal gates which are the entrance to the stables. The side gate is unlocked (which wasn't obvious until I saw someone else go through) & as you walk up towards the stables you will see a hiking trail sign on your right which is where you start the trail.You can park on the roads anyday except weekends & holidays.There are a couple of unmarked turns you need to take on the trail, the first one is to the left where you either get the option to carry straight on or take a switchback to the left heading uphill, this is the one you want. The second one is as you hit the tarmac road you get the option to turn left or right & here you will need to turn right. The path has plenty of visitors all heading the same way so you won't get lost.When you reach the top you are rewarded with lovely views of the Hollywood sign from behind where you can get some good pictures by positioning your camera lens through the wire fence or go up the small hill behind to get better pictures.The trail is a relatively easy hike for anyone with a moderate level of fitness but parts of the trail have no shade so bring plenty of water as there is no toilets or water facilities on the trail. A very enjoyable morning trip during a short stay in LA & I would definitely do this hike again from either this starting point or one of the other two available routes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEDBRO68
50,Hike with a view of downtown Los Angeles,"Trail to Hollywood sign.Easy trail on canyon drive, once on the top, there are 2 option either to the from or back of Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange
50,Great different view of the Hollywood Sign,"This is a great way to see the Hollywood Sign from a different angle. Sitting behind the letters, you'll realize the sign is too big to get it on one photo. Also, be aware of the fact, you can't touch the sign. There's a fence and cameras.The trail is perfect for people, who like to walk in the sun and it's upwards. But not too bad. You can go there from Beachwood Canyon Road, the Griffith Park observatory or from the Tree of Life trail (another great trail)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eat-a-roo
40,Beware no signs but worth the hike,Firstly there are no directional signs at all so either have your phone with a detailed map or prepared to get lost. My son and I took a wrong path and ended up atop a hill opposite the actual sign. Thank goodness there are plenty of people around ( many lost as well) that will help direct you back to the path of enlightenment. Bring lots of water ( especially since you may get lost) and my best friend was an umbrella ( highly recommended but put it down if horses come by as it scares them I was told off by two horse guides) . When you finally reach the lookout right behind the sign you realise it was worth all the effort. There are no toilets along the way so be prepared. Not a hike for the faint hearted as shade is very minimal and trail all uphill ( from beechwood drive entrance where horse riding car park is located).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopef767
