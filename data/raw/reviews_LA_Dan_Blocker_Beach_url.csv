50,"Take a walk on the West-side! Extreme Westside, it's the Pacific Ocean!","Seeing the Pacific Ocean, is really neat- being in Malibu and at the Beach, in the sand and toes in the water- is actually Neater! this is a place to do just that- HUGE SMILES! Great Sunrises and Sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
40,Beautiful with Great Waves,This beach has some rocks in it but the waves here were the best when we went. We were able to park right next to it on the side of the road and access the beach quickly and easily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
40,Fantastic,Loved the beach the views and the waves. Great location fun to get to and uncrowded which is a huge plus for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
20,not much to do there and people leave trash all over,There are so many better beaches. This is a shallow beach. Low tide rocks make launching a Kayak difficult. Escondido is better and just up the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
20,View only--No direct beach access,"No beach access. You gotta walk 1/4 mile north or south to get to the beacit's nestled in between corral canyon and latigoNamed in honor of ""Hoss"" (Dan Blocker) on the old tv show bonanza.It's a long thin stretch of beach, rocky except at lower tides.Pay parking lot, picnic tables to enjoy the highway noise and restrooms.Highway noise is unpleasant.Small parking with a fee for 14 cars +1 handicap. You can also park along PCH.Please be careful if you walk on or across the highwayNo beach access but if you jump the fence or walk (1/4 mile or so)up to latigo or down to corral...you'll get a standard beautiful Malibu beach.Dan Blocker is nice photo stop for sunrises.No direct access takes to below average",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Hoss' View Beach in Malibu ...,"Blocker Beach is primarily a nice view spot without active beach access - so it's a view beach spot & to be enjoyed as such. Parking is expensive, But what does it matter anyway if you're in Malibu on a fun vacation? Views are super & it's just past Pepperdine when heading North on PCH 1. Enjoy Dan's Bonanza Beach! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,"Dismayed Fee to Park at this ""Lookout""","As a Bonanza fan, I was eager to see the new Dan Blocker Beach & dedication plaque. However, since there is no beach access, it is basically a lookout on the PCH with an overpriced parking lot, picnic tables and restrooms.I was very dismayed to see that a fee would be required to park. This parcel of beach, supposedly worth $3 million dollars at the time, was donated in 1979 by Michael Landon & Lorne Greene to honor their colleague. Since it came with the instructions that it be used for a public park & recreational purposes, why the fee to park?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuskokaBarb
40,Name's sake done proud.,Very quiet and open beach. We enjoyed our time here very much.This beach is accessible and understated. We're here to give it a great rating!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaved1
30,Go a little farther north.,Just go about another seven miles north and you'll be in Zuma Beach. A much nicer place to go with plenty of surf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetsGetOut
10,A ghostlike atmosphere in an overpriced parking lot,Parking is 25 cents for every 10 minutes with a 90 minute maximum. There is no beach access and like a speed trap this could be a parking trap to raise city revenue for a little used parking lot.Citations are likely if you let the meter expire. Feed the meter while you picnic on the highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
20,No Beach Access,"This newly opened beach ""lookout"" is just that, a nice place to stop, go to the bathroom and have a nice look at the beach. However there is no beach access and however much money was spent on this project seems like a waste. This access with tables, parking lot and bathrooms should have been created about a mile south on PCH at Corral Beach which has easy beach access but no facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
10,Barely a beach,"This only has value to the lucky ones who live near it, it is not worth driving to. Try Zuma bch instead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mykomyko
40,Picture is wrong,"The main picture shown is Surfrider Beach a bit down south of Corral, but Corral Cyn Beach is amazing, and has a great kelp line about 100' out from shoreyou will have a great time whether it be to soak up sun, or to SCUBA dive. good location for both!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbap2014
