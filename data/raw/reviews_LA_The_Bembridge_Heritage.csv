40,Beautifully decorated every year for the holidays,"Really enjoy this classic Victorian especially for the December holidays. Last year they also had Christmas carolers that were really good. The house looked lovely, we had Christmas music and hot drinks and I bought a succulent garden that lasted for months. I think it was only $10-12 per person. A great experience for the holidays!",TrinaSchoon
30,a fine historic house,"One of the things that I love about Long Beach is the architecture. While this city has demolished many of its original buildings to make way for the new and put money into the pockets of the developers, some beautiful examples remain. This is one of them. There are many more to see if you look as Long Beach has 17 historic districts, as well as various ""city centers including bixby knolls, the east village arts district, downtown and 4th street/retro row.",Alexander_Designs
50,A trip back in time,"I love that they wear clothes of the era. A hidden gem in our city. What a wonderful tour, go during Christmas it's even better if you can believe it.",ginahicks921
10,Do Not Go!,"The hours are very limited, but from the website I thought there was a neighborhood of historic homes in the area. It is one house in a very bad area of town. We pulled up and, while the house was gorgeous, just beyond it was tent city. Perhaps not the heritage’s fault but certainly the city’s. I feel for the plight of our nation’s homeless but this felt like loads of false advertising.",Angela
50,Victorian Christmas,"We visited Bembrige House for the annual Christmas Tour Fundraiser. Different neighborhoods sponsor different trees and rooms in the home. The house is not generally opened to the public except on sponsored events and private parties. If you are interested in antiques & architecture this is a nice venue to visit and there is indoor plumbing. There are docents stationed throughout the house to offer information and answer questions. This house has some unique features definitely worth checking out and worth the price of a ticket. The outside garden is small and surprisingly good use of the space available. House was hard to find the first time, mostly because in that area wifi is not readily available for Sprint. I suggest mapquesting directions and having a paper copy on hand.",Lori A
40,Historic House in Long Beach,"It is hard to visit this house museum because of limited hours, Tuesday and fourth Saturday. After rushing to make the last tour of the month, we found the tour rewarding.The house was built in 1906 from a kit in the Queen Anne Victorian style and is considered an important landmark near the heart of the historic center of Long Beach. The house was almost demolished in 1969 to enlarge the adjacent park but was saved. Dorothy Rankin Bembridge died in 1999 and Long Beach Heritage bought the house in 2000 and now operates it. The interior is furnished and the house is in a good state of preservation and restoration. A Victorian style garden is outside along with a carriage house and small aviary.The guided tour was well delivered and detailed by a volunteer. We felt that we saw everything important and enjoyed the tour. Fee is a donation.",Kenneth L
50,Old Historic House,"We visited on a Saturday Afternoon, just making the last (2:30) tour. The Queen Anne Victorian house was built from a kit in 1906 and is one of the most important historic sites in the City of Long Beach. The house was almost lost in 1969 to development but today still stands with the original furnishings. The docent lead tour was informative and we enjoyed the visit.",Kenneth L
