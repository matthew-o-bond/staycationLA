50,Favorite LA Art Venue,"The Hollywood Sculpture Garden was the highlight of our art-heavy summer trip.! We make a point to go to both conventional (Getty Center and LACMA) as well as funky (Velveteria and Hollywood Sculpture Garden) venues when we travel. The Hollywood Sculpture Garden was the our favorite ! There are sculptures everywhere you look as you wander this residential property. We lucked out because the owner opened his home the day we visited as well. It was absolutely beautiful, the host was gracious and kind, and it was all free! HIGHLY recommend. The only drawback is parking on the narrow windy street is a little tricky. Skip the LACMA, go to the Hollywood Sculpture Garden!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShesaBadMammaJamma
