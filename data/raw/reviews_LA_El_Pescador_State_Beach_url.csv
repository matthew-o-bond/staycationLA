50,Quite beach,"Love love lived it . No parking fee and plenty parking . The waves are beautiful I waded in the water and sat in the sun on the beach . Great for solo, couples and children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoddessSersnitySmith
50,Quiet beach,Had a couple extra hours following a business meeting before heading to the hotel. Found this quiet beach along PCH. Quiet area with fabulous views. Parking lot is small. Only porta potties available. It was a weekday afternoon but few people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbga53107
50,Nude sunbathing,"I am a local, and this has always been the beach, for hidden nude sun bathing... Find an area and no one will bother you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
50,Great place to soak up the sea air! Awesome sunsets!,We enjoy going to this cool state beach in Malibu. The sunsets are amazing and the waves are perfect. Great place to have a picnic or just take in some sun. There are many coastal access areas up and down the coast you just have to look for the little brown and white signs. It seems that the state beaches have the more natural views. Never the less in my opinion every beach is perfect. Thank you for having a safe clean beach to get grounded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
40,Another fabulous find on PCH,"We were roaming PCH and found this quiet little beach. I believe it was quiet because you have to pay for parking and if you try and get the free parking, which thereâ€™s not much of, the trek down can be a little tricky. Once you get pass all that, it is a peaceful little gem of a beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
40,Classic Walk Down to the Beach California Beach,"Nice views and wildlife, Pelicans, nice surf and not too crowded or difficult to find a on the roadside parking. Warning, the walk down may be a bit precarious for some",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhefu
40,Another nice pocket beach,"A good place to spend an hour or so; if you're looking to spend the day at the beach, you're much better off going to Zuma Beach (which has lifeguard stations, restrooms, outdoor showers, seasonal food stands, and lots of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Enjoy the sights!,"Free parking on PCH, paid parking lot at entrance. Steep 5 - 10 min walk down to bottom of hill, not for the physically challenged. Had to literally jump down to beach and help my wife step down. But in the end....all worth it. Beautiful unobstructed ocean view, sounds of waves crashing soothing us as we sat in our beach chair. A single surfer keep our attention for an hour, maneuvering the waves and rocks protruding from the shore. The sand is littered with rocks and shells and the rock formations make for interesting exploration. There is no shade, concession stand, lifeguard here. Just enjoy the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hakimom
50,Amazing Pacific Coast Beach,"Spent the day here and we had such a great time. The waves were huge and we played in them all day. The beach was quiet and had plenty of room to spread out our towels out and rest. The weather was amazing. I loved the big rocks along the beach they were perfect to take photos by but my favorite part was not being crowded like some of the other spots.This place was beautiful, we were lucky enough to see dolphins swimming not that far from the beach. It was a great place and hope to go back for our next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angboudreaux13
40,Secret spot...Keep it a secret,Kinda hard to find.Up from Matador and down from Nichols$8 fee...lots less than the ticket so you might as well pay the machine cause they do check.Parking for 15 cars or so and 1 Outhouse.3 minute walk to sand.Exposed to the standard onshore winds.Nice little cove a wide and long enough beach that the 15 cars and people can spread out. The sand is clean and relatively free of trash! Like the sign says at all parks...pack your trash out.I like this beach/cove better than crowded matador beach down the highway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Quiet and great!,"Such a nice beach! You have to walk down a cliffside and there are no amenities, but, boy, if you want a beach to yourself this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fussytraveler53
50,Great uncrowded undiscovered beach,Very scenic and secluded. It is not uncommon to see sea lions and dolphins. It is a strenuous hike up to the parking lot but well worth the scenery and seclusion. The Eastern side of the beach has a few caves that you can crawl through to the next beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,always a great and romantic place to view the sunset ....,"we frequently come here to watch the sunset, hear the ocean lullaby, and just relax during weekends ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inadiwata
50,Great place,A real gem of a place. Definitely a place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
50,A Great Beach for Kids,"This little beach is quite a gem. My daughter takes her two boys, aged 11 and 9, there often during the summer so they can observe the abundant and diverse creatures that inhabit the rocky tide pools. This small beach is a nice mix of rocks and sand. The waves are usually mild to moderate.We made an impromptu trip there last Christmas and were surprised to see every rocky surface was covered in black, shiny mussels. Sea lions and sea birds cavorted in the waves near the shore. It's our favorite place to visit and take out of town visitors.Access to the beach can be a little steep and tricky, but that keeps visitors down to the serious-minded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauRodr
