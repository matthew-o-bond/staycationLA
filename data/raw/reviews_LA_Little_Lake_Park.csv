20,Little lake Park,Fields are in poor shape and the basketball court players play inappropriate music for young childrenThe staff is nice and helpful the park just needs the city to invest money into the fields they are in constant use meaning the city is generating money from them some funds should be put back into the facilities,reneemooring
50,One of the nicest community parks in America,"This is simply an amazing park that has it all. The lake is real. There are lighted team fields for all sports (maintained in excellent condition), trails to stretch the legs, play areas for kids, lots of places to hang out for a meal or just enjoy the sun/shade. You have to see it for yourself to understand just how great this park is for the community.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
