10,Disappointed.,"So, I walked into here on the last day of summer with the hopes of having a fun day with my 3 boys and a friend for one last summer hurrah!I explained to the young attendant that this was our first time. She informed me I would need to fill out a waiver and have the parent of the friend sign a waiver for her. I explained to the attendant she was under my care, I was her guardian for the day. She informed me that was not okay, her mother would need to sign and she could do that via email. I was not about to bother her mother who was working and asked me to watch her daughter to sign a waiver. So we walked out and went to Mountasia instead.I understand the need to sign a waiver but if I hadn't mentioned she was not my daughter it would not have been an issue but I wasn't about to lie and secondly I could have easily emailed myself and signed the waiver. I think ""Top Out"" needs to rethink their policy or train their staff better. I cannot imagine I was the first adult to walk in their with someone else's child.",rwheeler
