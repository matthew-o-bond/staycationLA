50,Trails are a Hidden Gem! Peaceful and well worth the hike,"The Ocean Trails are truly a hidden gem. We hiked on a sunny winter day and it was still quite lovely, as there had been some recent rain. Certainly well worth the effort and time. It really is not that long a walk, compared to the other trails in the Palos Verdes Peninsula. You get some amazing views, and if you are a golfer, you can watch them hit. But also watch out for stray golf balls!The whole area is so peaceful and relaxing - you can hear the waves against the rocks - amazing...Very relaxing and peaceful hike to go with a date or the family. Listening to the ocean waves crashing onto the shore rocks is very tranquil. The scenic views are breathtaking as well.",pasowine
50,Beautiful hike,"Easy access to the trail through Trump Golf Course, easy parking, too. It often stays cool at the coast, a plus for summer hiking. You can keep the hike easy or step it up if you hike down to the beach an back up.",ojerio
50,trails through Southern California coastal sage scrub,"Idyllic place to walk or jog in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, in well maintained trails featuring native plants.One can forgets it is part of Los Angeles County....",Consuelo F
50,Beautiful views and beautiful setting,This place like a hidden gem. Spring 2019 was probably the most interesting setting with lovely flowers blooming everywhere and greenery at its best thanks to the recent rains. Worth the walk!,Nas S
40,"Short Walk, but Worth It","This is not as long as some of the other public trails in the area, but it does give you access t the public beach below. Be careful of the golfers riding by in golf carts with little regard for the people. Other than that, you will love this place!",amarraval

50,"Lovely hike, easy to moderate","We parked in the lot at the base of Rotunda Drive and then walked the trails to Founders Parks and back. About 2 miles. It is mostly downhill on the outbound and mostly uphill on the return so make sure to take a break on the benches when you get to Founders Park. We did not enter the Golf Club. We decided to have a coffee break prior to the hike over at Terranea Sea Beans Coffee Shop, I did not see a cafe listed when I researched the Trump property. I will have to do some more research to see what is available there. I highly recommend this walk. For older folks like me, or families with younger children, this is a good distance. Be aware of the moderately steep inclines. This is PV so you can't avoid the hills.",pwillard
50,Lovely spot for walk,Our relatives live near here so we like to go for a walk with their dog here. It is open to the public and there is a public car park.,wombatdavid
50,Great Golf with Incredible Views,This Golf course is an incredible experience! No expense was spared in the detail here! The views are second to none and all the grounds are extremely well taken care of and everything is first class! All the employee's are very helpful and professional. You can order lunch from your cart (which also has GPS) and the staff will cook it and bring it out. This is a must play course for anyone who ever wanted to play at a world class top golf course.,Rob M
50,5 miles of trails with magnificent view points,"Nice walk along the coast and through the Trump National Gold Course. If you want to spend $$$ get a snack at the club. It is a great family walk, but hold on to the kids along the cliffs.",CTE
