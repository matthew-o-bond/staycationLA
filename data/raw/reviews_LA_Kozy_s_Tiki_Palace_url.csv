50,Mind blowing fun entertainment,Didn‚Äôt know what to expect when we walked in but oh boy we‚Äôre we amazed! Kozy is quite the entertainer and magician! Best live entertainment around!,Laura S
50,Still trying to figure it out!,"Looking for laughs and fun entertainment in Wikaloa, then Kozy's Tiki Palace is the place to go. We love comedy shows so we checked out Kozy's. The interaction Kozy has with the crowd makes the magic funny and amazing. A perfect evening is dinner at Tommy Bahama's, which is exceptional, followed by some laughs at Kozy's Tiki Palace. One of Kozy‚Äôs jokes was that we would be in the car trying to figure it out on the way home. He was right - we tried. It was a good night of magic and laughs. Have to mention the art gallery is good too. The art in the gallery is interesting and colorful. We will definitely go back the next time we are on the island.",Craig L
50,An unforgettable experience,Kozy is a master magician and we're still scratching our heads trying to figure out how he does it. We were captivated the whole time and his energy is electric. He was also really good at including the audience. A must-see if you're on the Big Island!!,jgsf2000
50,Epic Experience,"Kozy is a master of mystery, comedy, and entertainment. The depth to which his act goes is simply mindblowing... we can't stop wondering how he did it! Additionally, Kozy takes the time to interact with his audience, learn everyone's name, and make each person feel a part of the show. A relaxing yet exciting atmosphere where you byob. This performance is not to be missed.",Jenny
50,We still don't know how he did it...,"And we have it on video! We laughed, we wondered, we were totally dumbstruck! In fact, Kozy made fun of our small audience because we didn't clap--we were too stunned at the end of each trick to clap! We had people ages 15 - 85 in our party, and all enjoyed it. It is a very small ""theater,"" so be ready to be included in the show. No need to upgrade to front row. We did do the deal of having Kozy book dinner for us at Tommy Bahama's which was a fun treat and literally next door; that bumped us up to the second row. It is not for young kids, as the humor or adult, but great for teens and up.",Katrien V
50,Still talking about it!,"I‚Äôve been to the Magic Castle in LA and have been impressed before by magic BUT this was mind blowing. It‚Äôs not just a night filler because you don‚Äôt have anything to do, THIS is a must see show when you‚Äôre in Hawaii. So much fun, entertaining, amusement and will leave you awestruck. Treat yourself please!!!",Jean L
50,How'd he do that?,Great magic and comedy. Well worth the price of admission. Bring your own bottle or dibnner. You will laugh while trying to figure out how he did it.,boatdrinks
50,Hilarious and Mesmerizing,This was the most entertaining comedy/magic show I‚Äôve ever seen. Prepare to see magic that seems impossible ... intertwined with both outright and subtle humor. I highly recommend.,Troy B
50,Dude is Hilarious,We had an amazing time at Kozys. We were stumped by how he did his magic but hes constantly throwing jokes in and he was way funny. Best thing to do in the evenings on the big island hands down.Kozy is a super warm and fun guy too he took pics with us and everything.,timkennedy777
50,"Unbelievable, highly recommend","Unbelievable. Hilarious and mind blowing. Highly, highly recommend. Good for all ages. Have gone twice now and will continue to go whenever i come to the island.",jason
50,Absolute entertaining,"Wet went to the place with a group of about 40. For two hours, non-stop entertainment, stories, surprises. worth every penny",Franz
50,Best magician ever! Better than anything I've seen on America's Got Talent!!!,I went with a group for a private party and Kozy tailored his show to our audience. This is not your average sleight of hand magician. He got into peoples minds and amazed us all. I can't even begin to tell when he did as you need to go to this show and see for yourself! Highly recommend if you're a visitor or live on the island. I can't wait to get a group together and go back to Kozy's Tiki Palace! A MUST SEE!!!!!!,Kathy D
50,Truly hysterical and amazing beyond any slight of hand you have seen!,You will really laugh during this show and you will walk away talking about it! You will question how he did the things you just witnessed. For days afterwards you will postulate theories about how he may have pulled it off.We saw the show two years ago and it was so good we decided to go again. This time I was really impressed with how he worked modern technology into the show with quite dramatic results. Many of the thing Kozy does just defy explanation.His audience banter is quick witted and very certainly bawdy. 18 and over please!üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüß†,LisaMarieScubaDiva
50,This show was amazing!!!!,"My husband and I have gone to Kozys show twice and had a blast both times! He is hilarious and we where amazed by his magic! We still have no idea how he did any of it! We are definitely going to go again!!! The setting is awesome, we loved all the art work!",sgoldsby856
50,Magical Comedy In An Art Gallery,"My wife and I attended the show with two other couples and our adult daughter. There were three other couples there. The hurricane, volcano and earthquake had the room only half full, so the show was a bit more intimate. Kozak ""Kozy"" started off his performance with some simple tricks and built up over 90 minutes to a brain-busting finish. He called every audience member by name and engaged each member of the audience at some point during the show. This made the show that much more entertaining. His venue was his personal art gallery. I found a diverse collection of Hawaiian themed paintings, carvings, and photos from comedic to dramatic. He also had a nice collection of CDs by various Hawaiian arists. I recommend a stop by his shop and highly recommend attending his show.",Rodney C
50,Wonder Evening if Magic with Kozy,"I went to see Kozy with two friends, and we had a blast! I am still trying to figure out how he did his tricks, he was amazing. It is an intimate atmosphere and it's BYOB, which makes it a great value. I woul highly recommend his show to both locals and visitors alike. You won't be disappointed.",Kimberly C
50,Totally Amazing?,This magic show left my daughter and I totally baffled as to how Kozy could do this. We are very glad we went and highly recommend the show.,Teri F
50,Evening of fun!,"What a fun evening! We ate at Ruth‚Äôs Steak House a few doors down (best steak I EVER had!). Kozy was SO accomendating and nice as we has missed our night‚Äôs show (Arrived by plane and prompty got lost - don‚Äôt ask!) and rescheduled for the next evening. His show is so fun, personal and close up; interaction with the audience is total! So if you‚Äôre in the area, don‚Äôt you dare miss the show! Close your eyes for a second and you‚Äôd think you might see Frank or Dean walk in!",Cariboudave
50,Crazy Fun!!,"Kozy is incredible! We had so much fun at the Magic show I couldn't stop smiling the whole time. I highly recommend it, in fact I would call this show a MUST DO if you are staying on the Kona side of the island. You won't be disappointed!",Robert H
50,Comedy,"Kozy is great fun, really good for groups. Venue is small and byob keeps the costs down. He is a wild and crazy guy!!",triplejg
50,"Amazing show, so much fun!!!","Omg! What an amazing show!! The best magic show my family and I have ever watched! Kozy is hilarious, personable and engages the audience. An interactive experience!! A must see!",Theresa0910
50,What a fun evening!,"Kozy is a brilliant, talented and hilarious entertainer. The intimate setting and super interactive magic show makes this show a great way to spend an evening out. If you enjoy magic and witty writing, you won't want to miss Kozy's Tiki Palace. We had a blast.",loudouros
50,Amazing Magic!!,"Kona Kozy is a REAL magician. Some of the stuff he does cannot be explained any other way. My friends and I sat through his show last night at the Tiki Palace with our eyes, ears, and mouths open in amazement, shrieking our astonishment! How could he do this? He understands and uses quantum physics and teleportation. How is this possible?? How can he read other peoples‚Äô thoughts and know what colors they are seeing? I don‚Äôt know but I went from a science-based skeptic to a blubbering fan. You have got to see his show to believe it‚Ä¶ My head is still spinning and yours will be too‚Ä¶",Harry8086
40,Night of Magic on the Kohola Coast,"Kozak the Magician has a new permanent home at the Shops at Mauna Lani. He has created a small and intimate magic/comedy venue where you are up close and personal (if not part of) his performance. Very entertaining and some of his tricks are amazing and mind boggling. His club does not serve food for beverages, but you are invited to observe the Hawaiian tradition of BYO. There is even a market in the same center that has a nice selection of wines that you are invited to bring with you. Cups and ice are provided. We went to his show on a Monday night and it was a sold-out performance, so definitely a good idea to reserve ahead.In addition to a magic club, Kozy's Tiki Palace has an extensive collection of tiki's and Hawaiian artifacts that are for sale. Plan to get there early so you have to time walk around and see all of his treasures.",Annwill2
