50,Beautiful Old Venue,The Palace Theatre has been wonderfully renovated over the years and still keeps signage from the 1920s up to lead visitors to the restrooms or exits. Take an Uber or Lyft to avoid the hassle and cost of parking. I hope we get to visit the theatre again someday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenH602
