50,Fun Move Experiance,"Edwards cinema is getting closer to a premiere movie experience. They now have assigned seating, which is much easier to do online, but you must pay a ""convenience"" fee. They haven't yet flipped the ticket counter around, as to pay inside, and pick your seats, so the lines outside are long and you must tell the teller what seats you want. This takes extra time and is inconvenient. They've replaced the seats with nicer ones, but theyâ€™ll have to do an overhaul to widen the walkways and add trays to the seats to be more convenient for eating and enjoying a glass of wine. So overall, not there yet, but they are making progress in the right direction. The theatre is clean and well maintained. I would recommend going to this location.",ScottlandMc
