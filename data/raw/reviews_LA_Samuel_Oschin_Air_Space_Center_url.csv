50,Just wow!,"My husband and I were in LA for a few days and one of the things I wanted to see was the space shuttle. Mission accomplished!! Seeing the space shuttle upclose and personal, you realize how huge the thing is! There's a short film that you have to see. It's a film on the transport of the shuttle from the air force base to the museum. You cannot go into the shuttle but there is a live streamed of the inside of the shuttle. Outside of the building that houses the shuttle is an orange fuel tank. There are also exhibits to see from tires of the shuttle to a space toilet. A must if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alpw
50,Marvels of Technology,"The space center is built to be the permanent home of space shuttle Endeavour. It's my first time to see the real thing. It's huge! Endeavour is the marvel of science, the best example of teamwork. The exhibition explains complex concepts in simple and easy to understand ways. There are volunteers and researchers all over the place to answer questions.The admission is free. You need to pay $3 service fee, though.I arrived at 10am when the center just opened on Saturday. I did not reserve tickets in advance, there's no line. I spent 4 hours there.In the building, there are other free exhibitions about natural environment which are fun and educational for kids.I highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qinlola
50,Ambitious Plans!,"We visited the other air and space exhibits but came specifically to see Endeavour, which is displayed in a temporary building.The Endeavour exhibit doesn't have quite the emotional impact of the Atlantis experience at KSC, which is largely boosted by its Disney-style preshow and reveal, but it's always a thrill to be so close to so much history.The adjacent halls feature some exhibits showcasing Shuttle technology and science, and the Endeavour building itself contains a Shuttle Main Engine and other interesting displays. The room is staffed by knowledgeable docents, some of whom had worked in the Shuttle program.The museum is in the midst of fundraising for a new building (see the photos for the model) that is intended to include a full Shuttle stack including the external tank (currently outdoors behind the Endeavour building) and solid rocket boosters. This is an incredibly ambitious undertaking, as the building would have to be almost 25 stories tall to contain it! Please help their efforts through their webpage.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Analogkid1958
50,A thrilling experience to see Space Shuttle Endeavour,"This is real space history and science in action. Endeavour flew 25 missions as the newest space shuttle as a replacement for Challenger which was tragically lost in 1986. Before you enter the special pavilion, you can see exhibits about the space shuttle program which describe how the shuttle program worked. There's even an exhibit on the special space toilet on board and how it works. Also very interesting videos on the journey of Endeavour from Florida to its new home in Los Angeles and the journey through the streets of Inglewood and LA to Exposition Park and the California Science Center.Although Endeavour is currently housed in a temporary building, it is exciting to see and walk around and below the shuttle. Around it are exhibits about the missions of the Space Shuttle program and stories about the astronauts that flew the missions. Cannot wait until the Samuel Oschin Air & Space Center will build out the new facilities which will feature Endeavour in its launch position mounted with the external fuel tank (which is currently on view outside the pavilion) and two booster rockets. Exciting to walk underneath and see the individual protective tiles that shielded the shuttle from the heat of reentry. Must see, and the timed tickets are still only $3 each. Visited on the 50th anniversary of the landing of the Eagle on the surface of the moon which was a special treat with the special programs and exhibits at the California Science Center in Exposition Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,SpaceWOW,"We visited in January 2019 and I've only just stopped talking about it to write the review. This half day visit was a treat for the 'space nut' I was travelling with and I left as a space nut, myself! It was a very interesting, engaging and well laid-out exhibit including being able to touch the tires of the Endeavour Space Shuttle which has gone to space 22 times, see the original space centre command room, watch movies including various take-offs, and the relocation of the Shuttle to it's home there, today and much more. We roamed the exhibit, stopping reading, and enjoying the learning and excitement the Endeavour exhibit gave you. I will tell you that we stood under and around the shuttle for nearly 1hr, it was STAGGERING how close you could get to a machine that spent so much time in space..#mindblown It made you feel goose bumps and quite taken aback at the engineering feat and incredible technology of it's time that saw that machine rocket above our earth. My photo's below give you a little idea of its magnitude. I assure you that you cannot visit this Space Exhibit and leave disappointed, that is Mission Impossible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiSydney
50,Space shuttle,There’s a lot here. Most of it not worth seeing. You would come here to see the space shuttle Endeavour which is housed in its own building. Each of the four remaining shuttles are positioned differently. With Endeavour it sits on stilts above you so you can walk underneath it for a close up view. They are making plans to put it on display in it’s vertical takeoff position with fuel tanks attached. The main orange tank is there on premises already. I will be back when it’s in it’s new vertical launch position,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/granizadodelimon
50,Must-see,It's was such an interesting exhibit with a lot of background information to help you understand and appreciate the significance of the space program over the years and how hard it is to engineer and build a shuttle. Loved every aspect of the exhibit and the actual shuttle was amazing. Can't wait to visit it again someday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdbitb
50,Amazing to see in person,"Seeing the Space Shuttle Endeavor in person was a real thrill. You imagine how bit these shuttles will be in person, but then to actually be standing next to one is breathtaking. Seeing all the tiles that make up the outside of the spacecraft is really neat. They've also done a tremendous job of highlighting every single Space Shuttle mission in a historical walk around the building that surrounds the Endeavor. The enormity of the external tank that they have on display is pretty amazing as well. Other space-related items on display in the museum are all really cool as well, like the actual Apollo command module, an Apollo spacesuit, and much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilmScoreComposer
50,The best I've been to so far,"This is the best space museum I have been to. It has a lot of cool things such as our weight on other planets, Space objects, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerbrgfamily
50,That makes it the 3rd and final sister ship in the shuttle fleet that I managed to drop a visit.,The best part is spending 20 - 40 minutes having a conversation with the volunteering folks who ACTUALLY worked in the Shuttle Program. Really knowledgable staffs and an excellent tribute to American ingenuity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeweyLe
50,A dream has been realized,Since child I would like to see a space shuttle! This was one of my best and unforgettable experiences. I'll never forget the day that I saw Enndeavour so close!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JorgeFilipeRibeiro
50,Awesomeness,"We had to go way out of our way to see the space shuttle, but it was worth it. Great to see something so fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LavonM3
50,Endeavour,We visited specifically to see the Endeavour Space Shuttle that is housed in the pavilion. The Endeavour is enormous – definitely worth seeing up close and personal. This museum is free but there is a small fee to view the Endeavour ($2) – well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
50,Up close with Endeavour,"We were there just to get a closer view at Endeavour - and it blew our mind. For someone like us who only managed to see the space shuttle on TV, this is indeed an eye opening experience to learn about the history of mankind's greatest invention and adventure to the outer space. There is an entry fee (US$2), and it can be purchased online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/man7drake
50,A modern day wonder of the world,"Having watched the shuttles from conception to their final demise, throughout my life it only seemed right to visit this amazing machine when I had chance.It was an breathtaking experience, to be so close to something that has been so far away.If you get chance to see any shuttle then go, it really is part of our history. Thanks to all who had the vision and determination to make this happen , God bless America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teflontinker
50,history in the making,"great experience for the family you can see it at all angles, except the top something we may never experience again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittGlendora_Ca
50,Get there early and enjoy an unforgettable site of the Space Shuttle Endeavour,"Having seen the various Space Shuttles on TV - I thought it was no big deal to see it in person. I was wrong and to be blunt, the Space Shuttle Endeavour is a must see in person. It's enormous, much bigger then it looked like on TV - and seeing it is a ""highlight."" By getting to USC early you will not only enjoy the Space Shuttle - you can have lots of fun in the California Science Center too because once the Science Center gets crowded, it's not so much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardt707
50,$2 entry - WHY would you NOT go??,"This is a piece of history for sure. The shuttle is huge, compact and impressive for sure.. I am not sure I could fly around in that for weeks though :-).. Respect to all the astronauts who made the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCDane
40,Great Museum at an even better Price!,"Came to see the shuttle, and realized the Science center attached was not only free but really well displayed and engaging. Turned into a much longer visit and a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadie218
50,Exceeded Our Expectations!,"On a weekend excursion to LA we decided we should see the Space Shuttle Endeavour mostly because it seemed like a must see, we're not space or flight buffs at all. The visit exceeded our expectations by far. The fact that something could seem so big, but at the same time seem so small when you considered it's tiny living quarters that the crew lived in for up to weeks on end. It was also very interesting to see the texture of it's hull, created by the heat absorbing ceramic plates. In my mind, at least, I always pictured it looking just like a commercial airliner's hull. Also take time to watch the time lapse video of them moving it from LAX thru the streets of LA to the center- crazy! If you are in LA you must take the rare chance to see a space shuttle. Here's hoping they can continue with plans to move it to a more permanent home that is deserving of displaying the Endeavour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSpeis
50,Shuttle over to Oschin ...,"I never realized just how large the Space Shuttles are until visiting the Oschin Museum complex - the are Huge / Gigantic! Nice museum with super high ceilings. Rocket motors, parts, photos & memorabilia. Loaded! You enjoy & learn! Easy to visit. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Awesome awesome awesome,Did I mention that this place is awesome? 😉.I have been to see the Shuttle Atlantis now I have seen Endeavour just Discovery and Enterprise left roll on our next holiday 😎Thanks to all the friendly and informative staff for the warm welcome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MostlyMikeJones
30,Needs it's own space,"I visited the Air & Space Center many years ago when it was in a separate building from the California Science Center. Now that it is integrated, all the planes are hanging and dispersed throughout the museum campus. Most of the exhibits are concentrated on the 2nd floor.I liked the space shuttle exhibit and to see the shuttle itself. Wish they could build a replica of the shuttle cockpit so we can look inside!I don't like the timed ticket procedure for the shuttle, especially when the museum isn't busy. We had to go from the 2nd floor Endeavor entrance back to the 1st floor to get tickets.Some of the older exhibits weren't working. Wish they could fix things to make it a top notch air and space museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Fly me top the International Space Station!,"We came here as part of a visit to see the Dead Sea Scrolls. We followed the signs saying Endeavor. This is a nice exhibit, but I wouldn't pay extra for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianrU4388XZ
50,Out of This World - !,We are so fortunate to have 'landed' a space shuttle in California --! The only others on display that went into space are located in the Smithsonian and Florida. It's massive size is unbelievable. Very affordable at $2/person and there are a multitude of other exhibits about space flight that are easily do-able. The film that covers its 'ground roll' on the streets of LA to get to the museum is not to be missed. So very enjoyable to see. Makes one wish we still had a space program.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalMare
50,Incredible,"We had 2 hours & wanted to see the Endeavour - only $2 entry. It was incredible & worth our flights being cancelled and us ending up in downtown in a terrible motel only for finding this place nearby!Could easily spend a day here & the surrounding museums & garden. WAY better than Hollywood or Rodeo Dr.Wish we had more time to see the rest of the science centre, Would loved to have watched an IMAX film & explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brisbane_User
50,Awesome,Getting up close to a space shuttle is an experience money can't buy - well $2 can! Really impressive with some good interpretation before the big reveal...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyboyLondon
50,The Enlightening Area!,A place to visit if your a science geek or are extremely interest in science and/or astronomy. This place features a lot of things ranging from actually studying about the history of space to getting to go into space ships and hands-on projects and small activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1384DHmichaell
50,What an Experience!,"I have always been interested in the Space Program and after seeing the Endeavor on her final flight to LA on the back of an airplane in September, 2012, I knew that it was a place I just had to visit up close. I was not disappointed.The Science Center did a nice job with the display. There is an exhibit inside the main center that includes information about all the missions, plus some cool displays (including one on the toilets aboard the Space Shuttle). Once I gained entrance into the pavilion where the Endeavor is housed, I got chills. Looking up at this immense space craft and being able to see the thousands of little tiles that cover it was truly an experience. I enjoyed the timeline of the entire Space Shuttle Program that covers three walls of the pavilion. It was nice to see the shuttles all placed side by side and what the focus of each mission was.The price cannot be beat - $2 to reserve a time. We arrived early enough in the morning (on Memorial Day Weekend even) that we were allowed to go at any time. I will definitely be going back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanM05
50,Fantastic being able to see endeavor space shuttle and Dead Sea scrolls,"The shuttle display is fantastic. We went mainly to see the Dead Sea scrolls, but the shuttle was awesome. If you go go the Dead Sea scrolls and artifacts exhibit, it is very crowded and you will move slowly for 2 hours. Get the audio recorder. It will save you a lot of standing. You can listen to the description without have to stand in line to read each one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923BobG
40,very interesting,a must see for aeronautics enthusiasts. very educational and conveniently located within walking distance of USC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spector_13
50,Informative and awesome!,"Seeing the Space Shuttle Endeavor up close, underneath, front and back was great. Sad, too in a way- what is NASA doing now that captured us for so long? Looking at the Gemini capsule and then Endeavor is a visual reminder of how far the USA came in space pioneering. Now? Anyway, the exhibits were very good, and of course start with the display of the shuttle toilet if you can push your way through the kids! Not enough time for us to see everything, but the shuttle alone was awesome and well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zvic2018
50,"Final Home for the Space Shuttle Endeavor, Los Angeles, CA","It was a real treat to see the Space Shuttle Endeavor in its new hanger built for iis ""26th mission"" at the Samuel Oschin Air & Space Center in Los Angeles at Exposition Park. The main focus of the building is showcasing the shuttle. There is information, photos and a gift shop in this building but the Endeavor fills it up - you can walk all around it, under it - it is a great experience. So much to see at Exposition Park in Los Angeles and it is on a Metro stop. Beware of school holidays and weekends in the summer. Call or visit website for ticket info plan your trip to visit it accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasVegasSylvia
