50,ART RAINS LIKE MILK AND HONEY AT NEW ART HOTSPOT IN DOWNTOWN L.A.,"Not far from Downtown L.A, just past ChinaTown, the Milk and Honey Contemporary ART in CALIFORNIA Gallery is a unique find. This fun little art gallery is filled with big mind blowing art that is sure to get you talking and coming back for more. This place was so cool that I could not help but recommend it to my fellow art lovers out there. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieE775
