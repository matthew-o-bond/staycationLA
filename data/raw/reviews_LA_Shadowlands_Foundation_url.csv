50,Great Experience,This venue is a wonderful place to learn about the importance of the wolves. You are able to see them up close. It's a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeriG242
50,"Something familiar, something wild","Four of us arranged a private visit (up to 5 ppl per private visit) and it was so worth the long drive up to Lake Hughes. I booked the visit practically last minute and Shadowlands was quick to grant the request. Instructions via email were sent to me and we were all set.As we pulled up to the red gates, we indeed heard the howling of the wolves right away. We all looked at each other and knew we were in for a treat. For the next 2 hours, we were educated and guided by Colette, Mary and Antoinette. Oh, and we were guided to meet each of the Shadowlands wolves. To say these creatures were beautiful is an understatement. For me, I had a mixture of nervousness and curiosity and awe as I watched them. At the same time, it felt very safe and natural to be in the midst of the pack, mostly because the Shadowlands team knows exactly how to handle these kinds of visits. We were well-cared for.Thumbs up for this experience if know a little or nothing about wolves and the importance of their existence in our world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misgrace
50,A must do for kids that love animals!,"My son and a friend are into animals of all kinds. They love the spirit animal books and wanted to meet and greet a wolf. I read the reviews before going and have to admit I was skeptical after looking at the pictures and reading about wolves. But I have to admit, after going there and interacting with the wolves, I really believe these are wolves and not dogs. The things that I really noticed about them are the hair in the ears, the close stance of the front legs and chest and the way they walk. Most of all there was no smell when we left. With all the shedding, we can tell they are not bathed and groomed and if these were dogs, we should have smelled it.But on to the visit. We got there a little early because we didn't know what to expect going through the hills from Castaic. It wasn't bad and we took our time and still only about 30 minutes through the pass. It was actually a nice drive. Single lane, but if you are not rushing, it doesn't fell like the mountains and there isn't a 1000 foot drop to the side.Everyone seemed very nice and the staff was very accommodating. There was one party with a wheelchair and they went out of their way to help them and make sure they had access to everything. I was very impressed. We went into a room to first learn about the wolves. I have to admit, I have a whole new outlook on wolves after this class. The class consisted of a little video and then a small lecture which was really informative.We then split up into 2 groups, we went with the feeding group. This was a lot of fun for my son, he just loved this part. There is a picture of the wolf kissing him, but it was actually grabbing the treat from his lips. There is also another picture of him in a feeding frenzy. You hold treats in both hands and the wolves can smell it. They tell you to keep your hands closed and they just try to nudge their way in. This shows you the gentleness and the training they have. After Paul placed several treats on his head, he had a nice layer of wolf slobber in his hair which they made into a little mohawk. He just loved that and didn't want to wash it out. Kept it all day.Next was just the petting part and this was just as much fun. Most of the wolves would let you get close and cuddle with them. The kid just enjoyed being face to face and taking pictures. One wolf was on patrol. It kept just circling around the enclosure the whole time. We barely got to touch it but another sign that these are not ordinary dogs.For what it is worth, I do believe this is a great place to visit. You will learn some very interesting facts about wolves and how they play a big role in our eco system. You will have a great time if you are daring enough to feed them and let them slobber all over you. Makes for a great video so bring a video camera. The petting part is chill, and you'll get some great pictures. Alaska was my sons favorite, Freedom was very friendly but Takoda was his first kiss. All the wolves were great and we can't wait to go back and see the new black pup. It doesn't look like a pup, its already bigger then most of the others. But they say it will still grow for another 6 months.A big thank you goes out to Paul who makes all this possible. Keep up the good work, we will see you again soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevekH1751DK
30,"Great Education, Bad Misrepresentation","Shadowland Foundation is a great place if you love animals. They are very passionate about educating the public on how wolves are a keystone species in our ecosystem. However, they misrepresent the animals that you interact with. None of the ""wolves"" you get to play with are wolves at all. They are mid to low content wolf dogs and no content dogs. This is confusing to the general public as they are telling visitors that these animals are 100% wolf. Wolves look and behave much differently than these animals.I would recommend this foundation for animal lovers, but I would advise visitors that you are NOT interacting with wolves. If you are okay with that, then head on down. It is $35 dollars per person to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahwhitewolf
30,Buyer Beware - These are NOT wolves,"I really want to like Shadowland Foundation ... but ... I cannot abide the fact that they are representing their animals as wolves when they are not. They have huskies, mixed breeds, and perhaps a few very low-content wolfdogs.They do a fine job with education and I appreciate their passion. I just resent the misrepresentation when there are wolf rescues and sanctuaries that have full wolves and struggle with funding.So, sure, visit Shadowland. But go in with your eyes wide open. These are not wolves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaziaW1
50,Must do for any wolf lover,"I love animals and wolves are definitely a favorite. These are wolf hybrids (wolf/dog mix), but still amazing animals. They had nine on site, but we only got to interact w/ six. Two were more on the hyper side and the husband is the one that handles them and he wasn't home at the time so we weren't allowed to interact w/ them, but we still got to see them. Then there was another one that was sick so didn't see her either. Wolves were very friendly and after a while and them getting to know us they just relaxed next to you an let you pet them and even rub their bellies :) Their website said suggested donation was $25. We were charged $25x2 for this encounter so don't expect taking a family and only paying $25. This is by appointment only so make sure you call ahead of time to schedule seeing these amazing animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basketballchick
