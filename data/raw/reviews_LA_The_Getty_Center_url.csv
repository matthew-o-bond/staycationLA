50,unbelievable with free admission,"The Getty Center has great views of the city and amazing artwork on display. Although it was a rainy day, it did not spoil our visit because there is so much to see indoors. The short tram ride from the parking area goes up the hill to the property but you can walk if you choose the challenge. Lots of people from all over the world were visiting! Don't miss the introductory movie in the visitor center.",Movinup
50,Fantastic,I'm not really into art galleries and only went because my wife wanted to go.However it is fantastic.Allow most of the day and have a leisurely lunch while you are there.Take your good camera for the views.,Fredbloggs2014
20,Getty villa is better IMO,"I really wanted to like this place. It is so popular, and I live just down the road, I just HAD to visit. BUT, I’ve gotta say, the villa was far more impressive to me. Much more of a story in a quaint setting. The ghetty is a massive art gallery. Perhaps it was just all too overwhelming. Parking was a hassle. Security. Then taking a train. It’s a monster of a place. The cafe is also very expensive.",Alan
50,A bit of everything...,"Artisan gardens?... Check!Art Gallery?... Check!Fantastic views?... Check!Open spaces and dining?... CheckThis is a great place to spend time and enjoy the varied displays. One thing to note is that when we arrived in late afternoon most of the cafes/restaurants stopped serving. Otherwise, this is well worth the visit.",PhillipP
50,Fascinating Place to Visit,"The Getty Center is located on a hill adjacent to the I-405 Freeway, off a section called the Sepulveda Grade in Los Angeles.The grounds consist of museum buildings, gardens and several restaurants. Parking is underground and a tram takes visitors up a hill to the Getty Center, itself.I'm not a big fan of art but the buildings and grounds are so pleasant to stroll (and the restaurant lunch was so out-of-this-world delicious) that I can recommend a visit to anyone.We experienced a hazy day, but on a clear day, the views to the south, toward downtown LA, will be wonderful from any of several balconies with a southern exposure. Fingers crossed for you!",JM_in_California
40,Get there early!,Cool trip up and down in a funicular from the car park. Had to pay for parking but it was free to enter the museum so still worth it. Lots of art if you like that kind of thing but being from the UK we are a bit spoilt with great art galleries and museums so we skipped a lot of the galleries. Great views across the city and great architecture. The cactus garden was a bit of a let down though as couldn’t get to walk around it. Get there early though as it gets super busy!,Claire M
50,I love this place,"The artworks, and the architecture is fabulous. There are more than on restaurant here and both are good, but that will be determined by your budget",Wynn R
50,Must see when visiting LA!,"We spent half of our last day in LA at the Getty and I would say that it probably one of the best decisions that we made. We were also fortunate enough to see Da Vinci’s sketches that were on display during that time. We also joined two free tours that were conducted by the Center. Great for picture perfect IG photos. Btw, did I already mention that entry is totally free?",JP Alcos
30,Quite nice!,"A quite interesting and nice place, good for spending a few hours there in the afternoon there. Nice place",Lenka
50,Beautiful Museum of Art,"This place really is super nice. Beautifully built, lots of marble, beautiful gardens, lots of great art, etc. The only downsides were that one they advertise it is ""free"" yet it cost $20 to park but even at $20 it is still a worthy visit. The place really is huge with multiple buildings and display so it does take several hours to see it all. Which of course means you will probably get something to eat which once again means be prepared as it won't be cheap.The artwork and most of the exhibits were excellent, we were there while the Michael Angelo exhibit was going and it was mostly his small sketches that he did preparing to do a painting or sculpture, what I found most interesting is learning how he approached his work and his history.There was also a photography exhibit that was a joke. How someone tagged many of these photos as being worthy of an art museum is beyond me. There was a picture of a giraffe that has been taken by school kids every day about 1000 times. There were multiple pictures, from expired canisters of film, that were literally nothing more than a white spot or black spot. There was a picture of a woman sitting in front of a TV, one of a plastic dog in a Chinese restaurant and one that was a photographer's self-portrait that was out of focus and red! They were ridiculous and a waste of time. I have seen better photography on Facebook!But overall, excellent place and worthy of a visit.",Speedracer61
40,A winner,"Lucky for us we arrived after 3, just, so parking was $15 otherwise it's $20 and the entry is free which is wonderful for such a facility.You have to then get a tram to the top of the hill and entrance.The building itself is a work of art and the landscaping too.The gardens are in my '1001 to see before I die' book. Well, they are very good, modern and some colour even in February. The azaleas in the 'pond' were a very good effect. Being able to walk through some of the other planting in raised beds was also lovely with bulbs out now and promise of things to come. Love the bougainvilea umbrellas, just starting to bloom. Good cacti on green roof, not seen that done before. Lots of sculpture and other water features outside too.Of course there is art. Good, 'proper' art old school masters and a collection of French furniture set out in a room scheme.We only spent 2 hours here but could easily spend longer if the weather was good enough to sit outside with a drink and you lingered longer over the art.Great view over Beverley Hills and Bel Air too and the whole of LA really.",Gardengel-IoW
50,beautiful architecture and museum,"there seems to be a bit of something for everyone from paintings of all eras, sculptures to antique artefacts. the museum itself is beautiful with a nice garden and a view from the mountain top. best of all, the entry fee is free. the cost of parking will be $15-$20 depending on where you park, but the museum is super easy to get to from any parking lots nearby.",shenquille
50,This place is FANTASTIC,"This place is FANTASTIC. The permanent collections are rich and varied. We were lucky to come across the temporary exhibition dedicated to Manet, which brought together an impressive quantity of magnificent works. The architecture of the place highlights the gardens. A long visit is essential.",Nanez

Ask at desk for free tours, headphones available. GO",JJ4444
50,"Fabulous View, Great Exhibits and Beautiful Gardens",I have to say my favorite place to be at the Getty Center are the Gardens in the back. A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the middle of LA. The curated art collection is fabulous and exhibits change regularly. On a beautiful day the views across the city toward the Pacific Ocean is breathtaking. Entry is free! You will pay for parking but it’s reasonable and either in the bottom of the hill on the grounds of the center or just across the street. A tram will bring you up to the center itself. Highly recommended,TheTootles

Tip: if you're getting an Uber/Lyft there, request to be dropped outside during peak times - the traffic to get to the tram entrance takes longer than walking!",MatchstickLive
50,"Wow! An amazing synthesis of art, architecture, and landscaping; Not to be missed!","We came to a conference in LA, had a day to look around, never saw the Getty before so we went by Uber. What an amazing place! No entrance charges and a recorded audio tour was gratis (but we needed to leave a driver's license as security- but not a problem). The weather was perfect, the grounds are out of this world wonderful! The buildings , nestled into the hills are spectacular, pleasing to the eye and aesthetics, and integrated well indeed. Upon arrival in the drop off center we saw the first of the sculpture gardens. We then took the tram to the main building complex. The steps had a Maillol sculpture (outstanding), and heralded the further enjoyment. The various buildings housed various collections and everything produced and indoor-outdoor synthesis. We loved the European paintings especially the impressionists. The other Paintings were likewise enjoyable. We also enjoyed the pastels collections and Michelangelo drawings (in a different building. The gardens were spectacular and designed with extraordinary care. Many visitors were stretched out on the lawns enjoying the sun, the sights and picnics. The staff (many volunteers) were very friendly and helpful. A second sculpture garden also showed two Maillol pieces as well as from Moore. from the garden we found a spectacular view of LA from the the high hills vantage. We came early on Saturday, and spent over 5 hours, by which time the number of visitors increased. We could easily have spent the whole day, and we definitely plan to return again.",Joseph A
50,Spectacular.,"The Getty is one of those places that, when you're there, you can't quite believe that something like this exists. The view is such that you can see the exact spot where the smog meets the sea. My friend and I did not have much time here, but were able to ogle at the architecture and take a quick walk through the gardens. Everything was magnificent, aside from the price of parking ($20!) We visited on a Monday morning and there were many elementary school groups visiting as well. It was fun to share the space and the wonder with the kiddos.",kaochristine
40,Wonderful architecture and garden. Great docent tours.,"We did a Highlights tour which focused on 4 works of art. Excellent docent, invited reflection, discussion and art appreciation. The garden and architecture tours are very interesting. All free tours and many to choose from during the day. Generally, the collection does not have major works of art in the collection. Still worth a visit. Wonderful view of LA.",Cherie1955

50,ART,"A artist's heaven. Getty is free admission. Food available at event prices. Sit down you should make reservations or eat with the masses in the lower food court. Parking used to be $5.00, but has gone up. To see and assimilate every thing plan on a day.",BobandMargie G
50,An absolute must see in LA,"I can see why this is the #1 attraction in LA - this place is spectacular. The architecture of the campus, the gardens and how it all ties in to the land on which it sits is simply amazing. Adding a world class art collection and you have an unbeatable combination. Sadly our architecture tour was not the best but one in our party was very familiar with the design process and was able to fill in the gaps. Make sure to look for all the views framed by the structure. Pay attention to reflections in the glass as they can be fascinating. Take a few minutes to watch the hummingbirds. Enjoy the gardens, the views of the city and the ocean. It is overwhelming. I will definitely revisit this place again to soak it all in!",Geof J
50,Recommend the Architecture tour,"The art galleries were gorgeous, but we especially liked the Architecture tour through the grounds of the Getty Center, followed by our own tour of the architecture-inspired garden. The city and mountain views are amazing. And it's all free!",leklekblue

50,Beautiful museum + stunning museums + decent art collection,"The Getty is such a beautiful day to spend a day at -- rain or shine. I would recommend coming here for the architecture and the views. Personally, the art collection here isn't the best (primarily European paintings) but there are some paintings and art pieces worth looking at.The garden terrace area is a great place to have a picnic or enjoy a sunny day. Very kid-friendly. There are many tables and benches throughout so you can enjoy the great LA weather. I think the views are much nicer when it's bright and sunny, however, I enjoyed my experience way more when it was a rainy day (it was empty and views of a foggy LA are so lovely). The architecture is breathtaking and the views from the various viewpoints at the center are incredible! Outdoors has a stunning garden and multiple fountains and water sites. Sculptures are scattered all around the grounds.Entrance into the museum is FREE. Parking is $20, but reduced to $15 if you go after 3PM. On Saturdays, it's $10 after 6PM. Parking is in a garage and there's a tram that takes you up to the center.",denise

The grounds are good to wonder through. The cafe and restaurants are a bit pricey , the cafe food is ok .I would recommend taking your own food and drinks , they have place to sit and eat. Not much for young kids but they are very welcome in the buildings and grounds. If your in LA then check it out",Ryan K
50,Great art/architecture/view,"Everything about this place is special. The archtecture, the view over LA and the art collection itself are all beautiful.",NnNnNnN
50,Such variety,"Stopped by here on my way out of town having never been before. Very impressed by the variety in the collection. For someone who does not want to be overwhelmed by one style or medium in a specialized gallery, this is definitely far from that. And its free! (except for parking).",tonyirish
30,"Beautiful grounds, but crowded and not my favorite art collection","I'd never been to the Getty Center before I visited it this past weekend when visiting LA with my husband and my brother. While I enjoyed the visit, I don't recommend going on a weekend if you can help it. Here's the situation: the museum is free to visit, but you pay $20 to park (same as Getty Villa). This is fine, except even parking is a chore. It took us about 20 minutes to be able to pull into the parking garage in the afternoon on a Saturday. Then there's a tram that will take you up the hill to the Getty Center. The line for this was insane, so we decided to walk up ourselves. If you're able, I suggest this on busy days: it's a bit steep but pretty and not very long (maybe 10-15 minutes). Once we got up there, we realized that many people come more for the grounds than the museum! Many families had brought picnics with them and set up on the grass with the view of LA in front of them. Smart idea. The grounds and the buildings are beautiful. I wasn't terribly impressed by the collection though. If the museum has any art from 1875 on (except for that in a small temporary exhibition), I must have missed it. The collection wasn't terribly varied and just wasn't my cup of tea, really. The highlights of the museum for me were the temporary exhibitions: ""Unseen: 35 Years of Collecting Photographs"" and ""Kathe Kollwitz: Prints, Process, and Politics""! But I didn't love the museum's permanent collection. It's very crowded and busy on weekends, which doesn't make it the most pleasant place to visit. I'd say the grounds and building are lovely though. If you're visiting LA and only have time for the Getty Villa or the Getty Center, I'm Team Getty Villa all the way.",alexisrachelletx

50,Impressive site and beautiful gardens,"We did take a guided tour. Tours are every hour: architecture and separate garden tour. The guide for the architecture tour was knowledgeable about the architect Meier and the Getty history. Meier obsession with angles / 22.5, white surfaces, alignment/geometry are all on display. Highly recommend that tour. Thankfully the garden architect was Robert Irwin focused on colors and shapes to complement the austerity of Meier style. The Garden tour was a bit light on content although it was our second time there and always a highlight to visit the garden; the hard scrapping and the flowers/plant/trees are an integrated sensory experience with nature and human creativity. It is a free museum albeit the parking $20 if you drive,. We had lunch in the cafe - varied choices from pho to pizza, etc. well done. There is also a higher end restaurant. The art collection on display is on the smaller side but with some of the best. Photo collection on the lower level.",devedr1

40,Not to be missed when in the area,"We were in the Getty for a few hours over 2 days, and need to come bak to see more of it. The outdoor parts, gardens and architecture alone are worth the trip.Entry is free and the gift shops are very tempting.The galleries hold amazing treasures. However, if you have any vision issues, bring theater glasses as you cannot get too close to the art. The line you cannot cross is marked in a few places, but not in others. If you have trouble seeing, you'll have trouble telling where the line is as well. Guards are unflinching on that subject. It would have been nice to be able to get closer to the tag if not the art, so I could read what I was looking at. I left a comment to that effect. There are audio devices that are free of charge, but you have to wait in line for one and leave your ID at the counter. You also have to be able to read the number on the painting tag in order to listen to the description. Not all works have numbers, and the temporary exhiobits don't. That was my only issue. Everything else was great.",Muriel A

50,Getty Center,We had an all too brief visit of the wonderful art. The architecture is outstanding. We went after 3pm and the parking is reduced to $15. It is $25 before. The museum is free with an audio iPod tour. If you go late you will see an incredible sunset. The views are out standing.,tenisforus

50,"Architecture, gardens and great art","It is convenient to be dropped off by a ride share company and take the tram up the hill to the Getty Center. Evidence of fire was all around beginning at the tram center and the on top looking over to other ridge lines at the level of the Getty Center. One is struck immediately by the beauty of the built environment on the Getty Center campus and the landscaping. The architecture is striking and affords a wide range of views and perspectives. Follow your eyes and take the paths. Go up and go down and all around. The architects have created a welcoming and endlessly interesting set of spaces. Much of the building surfaces is covered in travertine from Italy. Squares and circles are repeating patterns that integrate the buildings.We have visited the Getty Villa and viewed its fine collections. The Getty Center is its extension and expansion, moving forward in time from where the Getty villa collections leave off. The collections are vast and need to be swallowed in bites. The Getty offers many tours and we chose one as an introduction.. Most of the topical tours last about an hour. We chose one on the “Impressionists” and were delighted. We saw four paintings by Monet we had not seen before, including one extraordinary still life that was also painted by Renoir from a slightly different perspective. We also saw the exceptional Van Goah “Irises.” That painting was a highlight, featuring a single white iris on the left side of the painting and a white and blue iris on the far right.The weather was glorious and the vistas and views from the terraces were superb. The cactus garden on the south promontory was spectacular. We aim to visit again and soon when the gardens are in full bloom, including the flowering maze.",waterandmore
50,WOW !!!,Got here early for 10 am garden tour and spent 4+ hours walking over all the grounds and exhibits - this place is jaw dropping in beautyThis is a must see in LA and its free to boot - jusdt pay to park and get on the tram to the top for an experenice you wont forget,caminorey
40,Using Public Transportation from LAX to Getty Center,"I did it in late Jan 2020. It's not hard to go to Getty Ctr from LAX directly, provided you are flexible with time and are comfortable in using public transportation.(1) From LAX, take the LAX Shuttle (free) Look for the hot pink signs posted all over outside, you want to take the Employee lot (South) bus.(2) The shuttle bus takes you to a bus Center Depot to change onto a Culver City Bus #6(North bound). Very important to take the NORTH Bound bus #6(3) #6 will take about 55 minutes to Westwood UCLA area for transfer to Bus 734(4) Super easy, but you will pay separately for 734, no transfer given. The fare is less than $2. And Westwood by UCLA is a great place to get something to eat.(5) 734 goes through some very expensive neighborhood uphill (about 20 minutes or so) to the door of Getty Center.(6) From the bus stop, you just walk 2 minutes to get onto a free Getty Tram uphill to the Getty Ctr( free). It has clean restroom facility right at the Tram station.Do the same in reverse direction to return to LAX. The South LAX shuttle bus is on bay# 12 at the Bus Depot for returning to LAX. If you take SouthWest, it is located at Terminate #1.With some in advance planning, going to Getty Center from LAX is very doable; driving on 405 out of LAX is not for the faint of heart! Westwood area has a lot of buses going to /coming from all places nearby. The bus displays signs and announces stops - who knows LA bus can be so rider friendly.Note- they do the bag search at the Getty Ctr. Tram station before you get onto the tram. It is a 15 mins uphill walk, if you wish.- When it is windy, Getty Ctr closes its indoor restaurant and the choices from the garden cafe Kiosi is very limited.Getty Ctr collection in my opinion has more in breadth than in depth; you may want to take advantage of the free tour (usually 1 hr) given on specific area of focus. and be prepared for the long line to get a free audio ear piece. This super rich museum should be on your LA visit list- it is totally free, great bird's eye view of the west side of LA, relative new and very clean with helpful staff on site.",Departure651641
50,Getty shining brither then diamond,"I loved Getty center. It is a pleasure having this type of object in Los Angeles. Architecture is impressive, stunning and their gradens are so much pretty so I cant describe them. If you love architecture visit Getty!",Gav Raich
50,Art Lovers Dream,"For a long time I have wanted to visit the Getty Center. My husband made my dream come true just last week. Having the opportunity to visit this architectural wonder in such a gorgeous setting made my whole year! The photographic exhibit, the gardens, and the incredible European paintings make it hard to decide where to go next. I have to admit that van Gogh’s Irises was my favorite, but in the same gallery are Monet, Manet, Pissarro. It was hard to move away.Getting to the Getty means navigating Los Angeles traffic. It’s just a fact of life. But once you get off the 405 and enter the parking garage, you are in a different world. The tram ride to the top is scenic, quick and easy. Once there, you’re deposited in a beautiful courtyard with views of architecturally amazing buildings. Grab a map to wander on your own, do an audio tour or take one of the frequently offered specific guided tours. Nothing will disappoint.If you want a special meal, check out the Restaurant at the Getty Center — best to make lunch or dinner reservations ahead. Otherwise, there is a great cafe with an extraordinary number and variety of options in a great setting.Enjoy the fountains, the views of the surrounding hills and the pacific as well as the outdoor relaxing spaces. You will have a truly memorable experience.",grammyliz
50,A magical place,"We had such an amazing experience at this museum. Our school group had a tour and then was able to spend the afternoon learning about, and enjoying, world-class art. I'm so grateful for their field trips and educational programs.",Tina L.
50,Absolutely Fabulous!!! Best Attraction in LA!!,"WOW!! From its stunning architecture to the impressive views of LA, from its beautiful gardens to the fresh/tasty food in its cafeteria, the Getty Center has it all...and we haven’t even touched on the art inside yet. Varied, extensive, and loaded with masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture, furniture and photography this museum is a highlight of any visit to LA. It’s easy to see why the Getty is the TripAdvisor #1 of ~2500 things to do in LA. I spent over 3 hours at the Getty and still could have used more time. If the Getty Center was a restaurant it be a Michelin 3* - “exceptional museum that is worth a special journey.”",ElTouristo61
40,Nice way to enjoy art of 15th. Century and later.,"Beautiful location with stunning views of the City. Nice Art but not spectacular. Somewhat confusing mishmash of galleries, buildings and open spaces. The travel from the parking lot to the museum was slow and cumbersome. Otherwise a nice experience.",Thomas S

50,Museum in LA,While visiting family on our last vacation day we went to the Getty Center. This was an amazing place in a beautiful location. It was a holiday weekend so it was very busy but once we entered the complex there were so many places to see it seemed that the people went in different directions. I would love to go again and spent the day there. We had time to see only three exhibits but they were most impressive.,Explore821822
50,Checked one off my bucket list,"Enjoyed great view, impressionists’ works , wonderful lunch . Missed a tour because I didn’t realize it was limited to a certain number of people. I stayed about 3 1/2 hours and wanted 2 more hours.",Karen C
50,Must See,"We’ve always wanted to visit the Getty Center but didn’t make it. This time we made a day of it and definitely lots of great pieces that you must see. What’s great about the Getty is you can start in one building and connect to the next building. When your done, you can grab a quick snack and sit outside in the garden to just enjoy the view",Julie H
50,Beautiful location to explore above LA,"The Getty Center is such a beautiful location and worth a visit out of the hustle of LA. The grounds are lovely and peaceful with great vistas. Had a teenager with us who wasn’t thrilled about visiting a museum but bared with us as we explored (not like we hadn’t seen all the LA teen hotspots before haha). Very well done and enjoyable, glad we did it.",Lori K
50,Surrounded by Beauty,"The Getty is a beautiful museum. Not only is the art beautiful, the architecture, garden, view, & restaurant are breathtaking as well.",DBM
40,Worth it!!,"Awesome museum in a really neat building. The architecture and collection of art were definitely worth the visit! I would really recommend joining one of the free 1 hour guided tours. The collection of art is on the smaller side, compared to the MET or the Chicago Art Museum, but the setting, architecture and educational tour made up for that!!!!!",Erin B
50,Such an experience,Easy access with facilities.Restaurants and rest rooms are available.Extensive and interesting collections.Beautiful view and it has a good landscapes.A “must to see” place.Highly recommended.,N88CEE
50,Incredible views,"This is another place where you ca spend several days. There are a variety of tours available, but we just opted to walk around on our own. The collections are impressive, but my favorite part was the gardens and various outdoor areas affording incredible views of the city and beyond. The architecture of the museum itself is a wonder.",pmr68
50,Awesome!,"The Getty is so awesome because they have such a variety of beautiful pieces- furniture, sculpture, paintings and more! I especially loved the top level, many rooms full of beautiful paintings by famous artists, including Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and more. And the paintings are not roped off. You can walk right up to them and see the texture and brush strokes. If you are visiting Los Angeles, don't miss the getty!",Lisa H
50,Well Worth a Visit,A great place to wonder around in for several hours. Watching the sunset from there was an added bonus!,QTHarris
50,Amasing Combinations of Ancient and Modern Architectrutral Designs,"The designer used two different shapes to represent the ancient and modern feeling of the whole complex of the center. Rectangular shape is for the modern while the circle is for the ancient. Everywhere in the center, you can get this idea!. The most impressed me is the garden with a lot of cactus located at the south end of the center. You can enjoy the whole view of the city of LA from there!",Lewis L.
40,Interesting stop,"A must stop for lovers of art and history. Kind of quirky, but what else would you expect to be built by a billionaire who thought himself the reincarnation of a Roman emperor.",Telfe
50,Fantastic museum. The Best of LA.,"This is one of the best Attractions that Los Angeles has to offer. Situated on a hilltop overlooking the ocean with spectacular views, the gardens and building of the Getty center are worth a visit on their own. Within the galleries is an amazing variety of art work. We particularly enjoyed the current large special exhibition of photographs from the Getty collection.Plan to spend at least half a day. Admission is free but parking down below is $20. Ride the tram to the hilltop.",TsviShlomo

50,Do Not Miss this Place,"Absolutely a place you I should not miss if you visit LA. Not only is there no admission charge, but the free tours are numerous and focus on various interests - architecture, gardening, art, sculpture. The views are simply spectacular - from mountains, to hillsides, to downtown LA and, if you are lucky and the day is clear, the Pacific Ocean!! Every part of this place is an adventure. The tram ride up from the parking area alone is worth the trip. Plan to spend at least 3 hours here; more if you include the art museum. Wish we had planned to stay longer. Can’t wait to return with my grandchildren!",Fern P
50,AMAZING,Every kind of art imaginable. It is located on the top of a hill and you can look out over the nearby neighborhoods. The grounds and art works are unbelievable. You could easily spend a day here admiring all the different types of exhibits and art. A wonderful experience.,HARRY M
50,An Artful Must,"Located on top of a hill in the Bel Aire slopes, the Getty Center is one of the most beautiful attractions in Los Angeles. The grounds, structures and most importantly the art within are unparalleled to other art institutions. Plan on at least a half day there.",Jet37426723805

50,"Superlative, breathtaking views","This place is a marvel. I have visited many museums, but this one really impressed me. I won't speak too much about the collection. You have the museum's webpage for that, but this one rivals the MET's or the any other European museum. Go!!!",Nelson L. Pirolo
50,ALWAYS Amazing and Incredibly Breathtaking!!!,Just LOVEEEE this place!! I realllly wish I could get there more often however were ever I do or suggest someone to visit it the response is ALWAYS overwhelmingly GOOOOD!!! I love it in the summers when they do live music and wine in the courtyard!! You can buy a bottle at one of their kiosks (unfortunately not bring your own;) and walk the grounds with it!! It’s just AWESOME and a MUST when in LA!!,Jovanna V
30,Lots of Artwork on display,"I am more of a science nerd then history or art. There is a tram that takes you from the parking lot to the Getty Centre. The parking is cheaper after 3pm at $15 USD. You only need a few hours so I would suggest arriving for around 3pm. The entire property is amazing to look at and the views from the Getty Centre are amazing. It is free to check out all the displays in each building, but unless you're a history or art buff then this may not be for you. The food spots all close by 3pm so if you plan on eating up there be there before 3pm. There is a small coffee stand with snacks that stays open, but it's very expensive! Also bring a sweater or jacket as it gets cold up there during none summer months!",Kyla
50,Great place to spend the day in LA,"The Getty Center is a free center with tons of wonderful art from medieval times through impressionism. I took the self-guided audio tour of the Manet exhibit (only open through January 12, 2020) and the guided tour of the museum highlights - I highly recommend both. There is a nice cafe with a gorgeous view of LA county for lunch - food court style but with lots of options. Just the views themselves are amazing. The garden is beautiful, even in January.",Suzanne M
50,"Of all the places I’ve ever reviewed, this is my favorite and a not to be missed if you are in LA","Every time I’ve been in LA, circumstances have prevented me from coming to the Getty. But as I was about to leave LA for an around the world trip to London, I was damned and determined not to miss it this time. So I flew in early just to spend the day there—and I swear that everything I will see in the next four months will be hard pressed to equal it.I opted to walk the .75 miles from the Uber drop off to the museum—and I was glad I did. The walk alone gave me a sense of the wonders to come as I left the 405 behind. And I still can’t believe there was no entrance charge. I make it a point to visit art museums wherever I travel in the US and to see what I saw for no charge was beyond awesome.Of course there was the Van Gogh’s Irises and all of the “must sees” but what struck me was the curated brilliance of the Getty. It didn’t try to be everything to everybody. And, as a result, it was simply magnificent. And the brilliant architecture of it all allowed you to feel uncrowned. I spent the entire day there and I doubt on this trip that anything short of Petra will rival the Getty.There is incredible power that incredible money can wield. And the Getty has wielded it with grace. I will forever remember my visit there as one of the most memorable times of my life.",Jeanne H
50,The Varied Exhibits That You Will See,"If the views out to the ocean, the stunning architecture and the gorgeous flowers and plant life are not enough to feed your soul, don't worry. There is an art exhibit for everyone! No matter what type of art or art history that you appreciate, you are likely to find one instillation at speaks to you. Don't miss. Just be certain to make a reservation because only a certain # of visitors are allowed per day.",Patricia M
50,World class,"This is a world class museum, with absolutely no entrance fee. There is a parking fee, $20 before 3pm, $15 after...so load up the car and go!Even if one does not love art there is so much to see: gardens, beautiful outdoor architectural forms, views of LA and the ocean below. Plenty of place to take little kids to run around while some of the adults visit the museum.The collection is amazing. Truly amazing in its diversity. One can always see something new.Go! Go!

50,Getty Center,The Getty Center is a must see museum. The architecture is breathtaking. You are able to look out over L.A. from different observation points. There are so many things to see and tours to go on you could spend the day there.And admission is FREE.,Shari H
50,"Beautiful Views, Decent Art & Yummy Cafe","Going to the Getty Center is free except for the cost of parking which was $15. You take a tram from the parking structure to the Getty Center. The grounds are made up of multiple buildings that are not connected. There is a gift shop in multiple buildings.The Manet exhibit was there when we just went. It was nice, but small. Having the Art Institute of Chicago in my own backyard is hard not to compare most places to the gorgeous art museum I have. But free is free so it met my expectations.This place is great and you will take awesome pictures from here. I can see how being here on a nice sunny summer day would be relaxing and fun.The cafe/cafeteria has many good and healthy food options. It is pricey where I would say that it will cost you around $20 a person including a drink. There is a very expensive restaurant that you can also book a reservation through that has beautiful views of Los Angeles.Definitely go here for a visit if you are from out of town. Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours here to see everything.",Win C
50,"Amazing views, some practical advice","Great place to visit, Some practical advice. Parking can be a horror, we were there over christmas and spent 1 hour just to get into the parking house. In hindsight, we shoulc have choosen the outside parking before driving under the bridge. You will also need to wait for the tram transport. Dress for at least a 20 minute wai if crowded. Limited avaliability of snacks and food in the museum in the afternoon (at least during holidays). All in all, with waiting for parking and tram transport, it took a bit more time than we planned. The museum and the gardens are beautiful.",Cecilia S

50,Great Museum and most everything is free!,"I loved this museum, beautiful artwork, architecture, gardens, views and best of all it is free!! The only things that costs money are the parking and it’s only $20 for a car and food if you buy it there. They have gorgeous gardens that you could bring your own picnic to if you don’t want to buy food. The collection of art is eclectic and every one in our group from 4 years old to 40 years old was enthralled by the collection. This was definitely a highlight of our road trip to LA and I’d recommend it for any age visitor.",Jolie W

50,great views in a tranquil setting with enough interesting art to make it worthwhile,"The Getty has some of the best architecture in LA. best viewed as the sun sets off the various stones that make up the buildings and gardens. The gardens are worth the trip. the art varies if there is a special exhibit. otherwise its, interesting but not outstanding. What is outstanding is the architecture of the complex and the gorgeous gardens. Best of all, the Getty is free to the public. The only charge is for parking.",Francine O
50,Very stunning place for views and art.,This museum is FREE!! There are great views of LA as well as several large galleries of different styles of art. I spent the entire afternoon there on New Year's eve and could have spent more time. I understand from friends that it was particularly crowded that day and often is very quiet.,Kathy M
50,Awesome.. Get away from LA,"If you want to spend a day or just a couple of hours, this s a great place to see. The garden, architecture and paintings. The staff is very friendly and do yourself a favor and take the free guided tours. You will learn a lot about the history and life of the painters.",MarioG
50,Best deal in town!!,"There's a reason why it's getting more difficult to visit the Getty Center -- where else can you spend the entire day (if you want) to see magnificent pieces of artwork in a beautiful setting for only $20? Admission to the Center is free; just pay for parking, but if you visit the Getty Villa on the same day, you only have to pay for parking once! (Two museums, one parking fee! - such a deal!!) Get to the Center early, though, since the line of cars waiting to get into the garage can be very long! The artwork is fabulous and the gardens are so peaceful and serene. The Getty Center is truly a piece of heaven (no longer) hidden in the big busy and bustling City of Angels.",Diana L
50,Excellent site to visit; go see Manet if you're in L.A. by Jan. 12,"This was our first visit to the Getty Center, and we'll certainly want to come back. The current exhibit of Manet (only being shown a few more days) was the primary reason for the visit, and it was well worthwhile.We wanted to have more time at the Getty, but other obligations prevented exploring the standing exhibits.Price (FREE) makes the value all the more exceptional.We also went because it was Trip Advisor rated as No. 1 in the L.A. metropolitan area-- and we couldn't agree more.One cautionary note: the tram line can be intimidating -- it looked too long when we arrived (they estimated 20-minute wait), so we decided to walk (which they said would be about 15 minutes). No one mentioned that it was an all uphill excursion, but we certainly got our steps in for the day.",Tom B
50,Spectacular art and free,"Get here early! I was there at opening and it was almost empty. The first two hours were great strolling around and enjoying the art. At around noon there were huge amounts of people showing up and it felt a bit crowded.Parking is 20 dollars, but everything else is free which makes this a budget friendly place to visit. Many of the paintings are spectacular. When I was there the special was an impressionist artist called Manet. I preferred the other exhibitions.",Rob-CS
50,Gorgeous! Fabulous! Must See!!!,"What a treasure-- and we, who are museum lovers-- were not disappointed by our visit here. This was our one must see stop in LA, as we were in town for the Rose Parade. We took the 'highlights tour' which was a great thing to do, as it gave us an orientation to all the buildings and exhibits. We LOVED the Manet special exhibit as well as the photographs on display. If we return to LA, we will return here.",Jody G
30,"Spectacular views, impressive building -- but....","Went on a Sunday afternoon -- expect to take about 35 minutes from time you get in line to park till you are actually at the Center -- 15+ minutes in line to park, another 15+ to wait for the tram. Tram right up is nice (you can walk --15 minutes and up a steep incline -- walking down is worth doing however. Anyway, views are outstanding. The building (s) are pretty impressive -- but, for the day I was there, the exhibits were average at best-- I am sure they change up but you might want to check to see what is being shown to see if you have interest. I recommend but not as highly as many others do",Stormyray
40,Beautiful Vista,"The architecture of the Center is gorgeous. The actual art exhibits were not particularly impressive, but the views out over Los Angeles were great. Gardens this time of year were not so great.",paharlen

30,Does Not Live Up to the Hype,"Yes, the views are beautiful, but you can get the same views from many other easier to get to locations.Yes, the collection is renowned....but the galleries are poorly designed, in my humble opinion. That's why I'm only rating The Getty Center as average...it's the poor gallery design does not complement the actual collection.The Getty Villa in Malibu is better, featuring the antiquities collection, or of course visit the renowned LA County Museum of Art (LACMA), Broad Museum or Museum of Contemporary art (MOCA), all of which I'd rate higher the The Getty Center.",leigh732 Los Angeles
50,To face magnificent art,"Everyone who has a chance to visit LA CA, must visit Getty Museum. It is absolutely magnificent place with gorgeous view, modern architectural design and endless examples of priceless art. The last time we have visited Getty to see beautiful paintings of E. Manet. It was great exhibition! I am sorry for all who missed it. We also visited the Museum’ Art exposition, which is also of incredibly high quality and value. It was windy and rainy day, but never the less we enjoyed every minute spent outdoor around the Museum.",Genia R
50,Enjoyed This Cultural Gem,"I've visited L.A. many times, seeing the Getty center from the 405 and always wanted to visit. This time, I made it happen and so glad I did. The grounds are gorgeous, the views are spectacular, and the art inspiring. The tram from parking up to the museum is a fun way to start the day. We did find the buildings a little confusing to navigate because we wanted to visit specific displays before the crowds arrived. Kudos for keeping this museum free (other than the big city price to park). You can also get the normal packaged sandwiches, salads, chips, cookies, etc. at the cafes. Choose to eat early or late to avoid long lines. The cafes are not set up for quick service, but rather in a single-threaded line no matter what you want. It didn't seem to be super busy yet it took 20 minutes to get through the line, select our items, and pay. TIP: If you go to the Getty Villa too, you can get a free parking coupon before you leave the Center. A recent study shows that museum, concert, and art center visits increases hour longevity!",Wis_Badger_Traveler
40,Restaurant (Cafe) mess,"Restaurant (Café) is confusing. We wasted 1 hour in this maze of people. They have self-serve (cold sandwiches and drinks) to the left as you come in. If ordering hot food you get a tray on the right side as you come in. They have hot items behind the glass partitions (and different lines) not clearly marked for everything. Be careful you are not in a ""pick up"" line rather than an ordering line. The people outside the glass are just as confused as you are so don't ask them for any instructions. You can ask the cashiers (if they aren't too busy. The food was acceptable. Just could have used better instructions......I hope this helps who ever reads this.",TADSS Guy
50,"Stylish, elegant and extravagant gallery!","The Getty is not just another art gallery. It's a bold and uncompromising statement even before you walk inside. Built on a vast scale, the several buildings all scream to be noticed; as bold as any Hollywood starlet. You can walk around and just admire the architecture and the brilliant views. The art, of course, is what attracts as well and even if you're not into modern art, you will probably be treated to one of the temporary special exhibits highlighting one or more masters from the past. We visited the exhibition of Manet's works and that alone was worth the effort. This is a very popular visitor attraction so allow several hours. Try to get there early. There is parking at the centre (US$20 in December 2019) but that's the only compulsory charge all day and great value considering what you get to see. There is a restaurant with a wide selection of food which is reasonably priced, considering the captive market they have. Finally, make sure to stroll through the grounds and soak up any available sun on the manicured lawns. If you want a relaxing and inspirational day out and appreciate fine culture and genius, you'll love this place. I highly recommend the guided tour to get a full insight into the design and history of the centre.",MelbourneMacca
50,Getty Center,Great art. Wonderful views of LA including the ocean. The garden tour was great. Very informative. Highly recommend it.,Nelson R
50,Tremendous art and architecture,"The Getty Center is a terrific showcase of great art and architecture. The collections mostly focus on European paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts before 1900. They also have an impressive collection of manuscripts from the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Although the Getty is not an encyclopedic museum, there is certainly plenty of art to enjoy.Equally impressive is the overall campus, which features contemporary architecture, beautiful gardens, and stunning views of Los Angeles and the coast. Entry is free, though parking is $20 ($10 after 6 PM). They have a very nice (though pricey) cafeteria, a full-service restaurant, and a couple coffee carts in the courtyard.It's easy to spend several hours here if you're so inclined. Since it is very popular, it is best to get there early to get a decent parking spot and avoid crowds, especially on weekends.",phvi2617
50,"The best in contemporary architecture on a mesa commanding LA, and it's free!","Atop a mesa with a breathtaking view over Los Angeles, Richard Meier has built a complex of refined shapes in pale sandstone. The gardens are also spectacular. In the rather conventional galleries you will find a collection of American and Europoean art, mostly from the 19th and 20th Centuries.

One reaches the Center via a dedicated train.",jarchcun
50,Beautiful museum with great art and free!,"Amazing museum on beautiful ,park-like grounds with fountains and wonderful landscaping. We got there when it opened and people were pouring in. Lot was full in an hour. The art was wonderful, but it was striking to me that half the people there were there to hang out on the grounds rather than look at the art. It is astounding that this amazing resource is free. A must see in LA..",Diana C
50,Wonderful,"The architecture, the views, the art... all great in here. And it's free! I've been to many famous European art museums and the collection here is at least on par with a lot of them. Must-see in LA.",TPAT75
50,Highly Recommend!!,"The Getty is wonderful Museum/Gallery. Go on the website to see what they offer. We saw the Manet exhibit. The entry is free, so if you get dropped off just enter the garage and take the elevator to the tram. If you drive: park your car in the Garage, pay $20 at one of the parking kiosks (You can pay before you take the tram up or after you come back,) then take the tram up to the best Art Museum you will ever see, and I have visited quite a few. Reminder: Check out the website before you go, and take several hours to enjoy. They have some refreshments for sale in the courtyard. Some folks took picnic lunches to enjoy on the expansive lawns.",Bruce M
50,"Amazing Art Collection, Fantastic Location","The Getty Center hosts permanent and changing art exhibitions in a world-class environment. Everything is beautifully displayed, grouped, and described. We spent over three hours with Manet, American 20th Century prints, and Balthazar, the third of the Maji who visited Christ in the manger. We ran out of time before we could visit several special shows and part of the permanent collections. We will go back again, not only for the art, but also for the stunning views of the California coast and the city of Low Angeles. Oh, and admission is free! You only pay for parking. What a deal on all fronts!",Cheryl
40,Wonderful!,"The exhibit center and, especially, the grounds are gorgeous. And, the exhibits themselves are very interesting and engaging. The cactus garden and the lights on the “weeping” trees are very beautiful. We enjoyed a wonderful, lovely, visit. Much preferred the Getty Center to the Getty Villa.",NCtravelerWS

Even the train ride up is a fun adventure.If you want to see and enjoy the highlights of LA, the Getty should definitely be on your ""must-do"" list.",MalibuSteele
40,"Beautiful Architecture, Art & Gardens","Went to The Getty today and had a great time. Amazing architecture and gardens stand out as soon as you arrive and get even better the further you go in. Some great art displayed inside and the view up there is certainly the highlight. We went with a 8mth old in a stroller and a 6yr old and certainly felt welcome and it was clear the place was designed for the very young to the very old. Children will love the steppingstones across the water feature in the plaza and a run, roll or crawl on the lawn in the garden. Certainly worth a visit and it’s free!",nb5555

50,Don’t Miss It!,"The Getty Center & museum is amazing. The buildings and grounds are exquisite. At any given time there are several exhibits well worth seeing. The Manet exhibit (through 1/12/20) is extraordinary. Here is my useful tip for your visit. The museum opens at 10am. Get there by 9:30am so you can park easily and get the tram up to the museum before the crowds arrive. And they will arrive. Trust me you’ll thank me for this advice. Parking is $20., a bit steep. There is no additional admission fee beyond that. Car pool. Enjoy.",Nancy D

After 35 minutes and .2 miles traveled, called the restaurant they stated I could have another 45 minutes after the original reservation. I thought they were joking. It took over an hour to get to the parking garage entrance. Than another 20 minutes to park. I sent my husband ahead but he was a minute or two late and they wouldn't let him in. If I had ubered I could have been dropped at the corner and missed an hour and half of traffic.The views were very nice and the Manet exhibit was interesting If you have lunch reservations aim for two hours before and look at exhibits and garden first. The garden was closed due to weather.",Connie12

We felt the soft drinks were expensive and didn't eat here.It was busy with school groups but they didn't seem to go into the various rooms holding the Fine Arts pieces or the paintings. Afternoons are quieter.We liked the drawings of 1920's/30's America, the Balthazar exhibition and the hot air balloon chandelier intended to hold goldfish the best.The whole musuem is very well organised. A great place to visit..",flowerlady64
50,Art lovers' delight,"We visited late Saturday morning. Lots of people were there but it didn't feel crowded. One special attraction was Manet's later works, which was interesting and informative. The group split up and I wound up in the European art section. We had only two hours to view the various works of art because we had reservations at The Restaurant on site. This is the ""fine dining"" restaurant, which is one level (in both senses of the term) above the cafe. The food and service there were both excellent (try the mushrooms in sherry cream sauce appetizer). The Getty is an outstanding museum with a wide variety of exhibits. One could spend all day exploring the facility. Admission is free, while parking is $20; so, a party of four is $5 each, likely the best bargain in musuemdom.",Jimmyshoes

If you go on a breezy day, you'll have a wonderful view of the sea, Los Angeles, Westwood, and Santa Monica. We've visited art museums all over the world and count the Getty among the best. Their permanent collection is diverse, so when we go for their special exhibits, we also revisit sections of it as well. The museum is free; parking is $20. Park and take the tram up to the Getty Center. There's a café, food/drink kiosk, several gift shops, and unusual gardens. The architecture is spectacular.",Linda C
40,Relaxing,"Parking is $15, but the museum is free. You get amazing views of Los Angeles from the top where Getty sits. They’ve got two stories of art and it’s pretty cool to look at, but I mostly came for the views. They’ve got plenty of sitting area so you can sit back and relax. They’ve got a restaurant and a cafe with quite the options to choose from. There’s an automated tram that takes you from the parking garage to the museum. It lasts about 4-5 minutes, if that. I went on a chilly day and it felt really nice. The building itself is pretty cool to marvel at.",Tessa
50,A must see,The world class collection of art and its unique library is a must visit place in the world. It has one of the greatest art collections in the world from different times and places. There are also world class travel collections that change frequently. The location is also perfect for photography and to enjoy the city line view. There is an art crafts gift shop and a snack bar cafe (a bit overpriced) too. Highly recommend.,Viktoriya K
50,Excellent arts and view of the city,"We went 15 minutes before it opened and it was the best time to go, easy to find parking and no line to get on the tram.

50,The Getty,"What a place! The design of the Getty incorporates the entire site, right from the underground parking to the museum’s pavilions. The design is entirely consistent. It was raining slightly and at the tram station, lovely cream coloured umbrellas were offered gratis to all visitors to get from one place to another. There were great plastic bins to put them in when you were done. The sculpture garden at the base of the mountain is beautiful and unexpected. We visited at a time when wildfires were occurring at random and in unpredictable places. One wildfire started on the hill immediately next to the Getty property. The nearest highway ramp was closed until it was safe. If you look up the hill from the lower sculpture garden, you will the blackened bracken of the adjacent hill. It was incredibly close. The main entry to the first pavilion is reached up a grand set of steps on which are mounted sculptures. The scale is large, but somehow accessible. When we entered, we thought the guided audio tour with headphones might be a good idea. Not so much. You have to follow in order the exhibits, but it might not be convenient to go in a straight line through the exhibits, and I ended up spending too much time trying to find the correct audio blurb. The notes posted with the various exhibits are very good and easy to read, so we ditched the audio guides. There are beautiful vistas to appreciate as you go from building to building. The guards and docents are really helpful. Do not hold back. They can help. We ate in the restaurant on site. There is also a coffee shop eatery as well. The restaurant was a welcome break with purple velour upholstered chairs and white linen. So comfy. We enjoyed a lunch sized meal. The wait staff were right there for you, very personable, pleasant and knowledgeable. And the food was delicious. Its the kind of place where you might spend the better part of a day.",957GeraldineR
50,Best of LA,I am a native Angelino and was so excited when the Getty opened. I felt like it was the beginning of a cultural renaissance. It has proven to be exactly that and so much more. It is exquisitely beautiful. The architecture and landscape are spectacular! The art and ongoing events make it a special place to visit no matter the weather or time of year.,Stacey
50,Worth visiting,We went to the Getty Villa in the morning then over to the Getty Center. Ask to have your parking ticket validated at both places and you only pay for parking once. Getty Villa is lovely. A fairly small scale site. Lots of tour options. I highly recommend getting a tour of some sort. The Getty Center has expansive grounds and several buildings. We took an architectural tour. I would go back to cover more of the grounds and buildings. Great views too!,Laura

30,BEAUTIFUL campus; not a lot of art,"The Getty Center is an oustanding, beautiful, campus of multiple buildings. Staff were always friendly and happy to engage. I was disappointed in the amout of art in each building: paultry by comparison to other museums in the US I've visited. I felt this was more like an appitizer size art museum, not a main course -- in terms of the amount of art available on the walls; disappointing actually. I was left with the feeling that all the hype for The Getty is the buildings and the mountainside views, not what's inside the buildings.",NJ E
50,Superlative,"From the time of ascending by tram to descending hours later was a marvellous excursion through towering European art set in a stunning institution.We looked forward to the Manet exhibition, a unique opportunity to see so many different genres by the master. Jeanne (Spring), used to promote the event, is a gorgeous portrait of the young woman.Moving onto the permanent collections we saw captivating works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Renoir, Degas, Monet and additional pieces by Manet.A pair by the English artist Abraham Solomon were intriguing. Waiting for the Verdict shows the nervousness of a family at the trial of a loved one. Not Guilty portrays the palpable relief of all at the favourable outcome.",permia
50,Can’t view it all in one day!,"I arrived around 2 pm. You do have to pay for parking at the Getty and there is no other parking options so be prepared. I waited about 15 mins in line for the tram. The tram ride to the museum was a little shaky but the views were great. Once you exit the tram the grounds are sprawling. There is no right way to see the museum but definitely make sure to see the signature gardens, it’s a beautiful place. There was an exhibit about music and plants when I visited that was very interesting as well as an exhibit about color. There are standing exhibits with traditional paintings, pottery and statues. It is definitely a two day museum!",Mary B
50,Scenic Walk Retreat in the Heart of LA,"We loved the Getty! We only had an hour to visit, but you could easily spend 3-4 hours here! 1 hour and we were power walking through and didn't get to see as much of the magic that was here! I definitely recommend going here during the spring time so you can see all the beautiful outdoor exhibits and shrubs. Please keep in mind, it gets a little cold on the mountain/hill if you go when it isn't as warm as normal in LA.You have to ride a tram up to the museum (sometimes there is a slight wait) so please keep that in mind if you are under a time crunch.This museum is like an artist's funhouse! There is something different to see everywhere! Famous works are here and there are great views of LA as well! What a great place for all ages!",Kimberly B
50,Must de if you are in the Los Angeles Area,We went with Friends to the Getty Center the day after Thanksgiving.

50,Beautiful,Great way to spend a rainy L.A. day. Really enjoyed it and the architecture of the building itself is spectacular with wonderful views of the city. I didn't even mind paying the $20.00 to park. Not bad for two people when entry into the museum is free.,MrsOregon2009
50,Not to be missed,"I can’t say it enough, this place is a must while you visit LA.The architecture, the art, the landscape and the views; they are all breathtaking.

Such a zen-feeling in the hills away from the bustling city with art, architecture and views that will leave you speechless. If you think this is just a museum it's a big fail. Cause this is a massive compound with something to see at every step you take. My wife and I spent 2,5 hours here but we could easily have spent an extra hour.It's free admission but you pay 20 dollar in parking.

50,Superb!,"So worth a visit! We were there at a time when the special exhibition was about Eduard Manet, which was fabulous, as were all the other temporary displays. The architecture of the center itself and the views it allows the visitors are spectacular. The only downside was the cost of food and drink in the cafe/restaurant, f.ex. 8.50 dollars for a small bowl of soup and 1.50 for a tiny roll to go with it.The parking charge of 20 dollars is easily justified, as the center is free to enter.",MichaelaW_04

50,A Museum Gem,"The Getty is a very impressive museum. From the moment you drive in and park, then realize there's a special scenic canyon tram that whisks you from the parking area to the museum campus, you realize this will be a very enriching experience. As you disembark you realize you've entered a true campus of buildings and exhibits that all are worthy of your attention. The artistic riches from Dutch Masters to amazing domestic all stars is really amazing. The outdoor ""mall"" atmosphere allows you to navigate from different exhibit themes an easily access them under the sunny skies of L.A. When you feel like a break, you can traverse the amazing walkways and adjacent gardens that adorn the exterior space -- a museum of Mother Nature -- with floral displays that truly make you pause and say, where is the true art -- inside or outside.This is a real gem for the L.A. metro experience and you could spend a full day and still not see it all... really a very special art (and outdoor) museum experience. You will want to visit more than once (not a ""one and done"" destination).",Mark Klein
30,Less than I expected,While the Getty is renowned and was nice it was much less than I expected. What left me underwhelmed was that the stately and cavernous exhibit galleries where modestly furnished. It had a lot of nice exhibits but I expected more.,1968GT500

A shuttle takes you to the top of the hill from the parking lot which drops you off in the plaza entrance. The steps which lead the visitor from the plaza to the buildings are “elephant steps” - deep and wide to gently guide you to the main level. There are complimentary tours available - we chose the architecture tour - and from there, you can enter any of the other pavilions to view the extensive art and sculpture on view. There are some food options should your visit turn into a lengthy one requiring some sustenance. The sun shines brightly on the pale stone buildings, so don’t forget your sun protection. There is also a garden to enjoy some quiet time when the art becomes overwhelming. Highly recommended for the entire family.",vansancopp

I love to take all my out of town guests there, regardless of the special shows on display, there’s usually something for everyone to enjoy checking out. Plus you can’t beat the breathtaking architecture and panoramic views that on a clear day stretch to the ocean. There are also live free concerts and family events, and delicious cafe and cafeteria where you can enjoy a reasonably priced snack and glass of wine, beer, or cup of coffee. As an added benefit, you can choose to walk up or down to the museum from the parking structure if you don’t want to wait for the tram, or simply want the exercise.

50,A Must See When Visiting LA,"This is a 'no-brainer.' The Getty has one of the most extraordinary collections in the world. The Getty Villa, the former home of J. Paul Getty currently houses the Hellenic statuary, which is one of my favorite aspects of the museum. While the villa was being renovated, you could see the Hellenic Collection at the Getty Center so it was like getting two bangs with one buck. But going to the Center itself is an adventure. From the tram ride up the hill, and being greeted by docents as you exit the train - ""Welcome to the Getty"" - the grounds and gardens are very special and a great place to just look out over parts of the city. The food is good in the various restaurants albeit sometimes spendy if you're on a budget, but the free admission more than makes up for food costs. There's usually a specific photographic exhibit, along with rooms and rooms of Renaissance art by painters and sculptors you've heard and read about in any art history course. Parking used to be free but it appears they're charging now. Still, you can see in an afternoon at The Getty much of the world's greatest art by its most renown artists, and in between dream about what life was like, both for the artists, and their subjects.",Ken

You only pay $20 parking and tram will take you to the Getty center for free. There, you will find so much art, history, sculptures, gardens, gift stores, and much more. From the top of Getty center, you could enjoy the gorgeous view of the city and Pacific Ocean. Don’t forget your camera!

50,Lots To See,"We visited both The Getty Centre and The Getty Villa in the same day, if you do this you only pay $20 to park, and this gets you into both places, which is really good. There really is so much to see at The Getty Centre, the collection dates back to the 12th century, there's lots of Renaissance Paintings, Golden Age Dutch and Flemish, 18th Century European Art, and a very good Impressionist Section, as well as lots of ceramics and silverware. We were very impressed with the collection.",sally j
40,The Getty,"Really enjoyed visit. The transport to the museum works well from car park. The building is spectacular and amazing views to the Ocean. I was little under whelmed by the exhibit,s. Maybe just wrong time the Manet had not opened.",Lg45now
50,Amazing place,"Great for viewing both art and architecture. The wide collection of art is quite fascinating. I highly recommend going on a highlights tour with one of the guides. They are very informative and make the experience very interesting. The architecture of the Getty is also very interesting and I got to learn more about it by joining the architecture tour. There is also a tour of the gardens, which are beautiful and of course you can experience them on your own. All in all a must visit when in LA. It is also completely free!

Our visit on 10/19 was absolutely wonderful. If we lived in the LA area we would visit every month!We found the atmosphere of the grounds relaxing and calming. Sure, it can be crowded at times and in certain places, but there are still quiet areas (both inside and outside) to be found. Seeing the current Manet exhibit was a special treat. There’s a reason that The Getty is rated No. 1 on Trip Advisor...it’s a special place.",Keystone_Traveler

40,A Must When in LA,"I highly recommend a visit to the Getty when in LA. It is located outside LA. You will see it from the highway. This was our 2nd visit. Admission is free but you pay for parking. The parking & trolly up to the Getty & back to the parking facility are well organized. Take advantage of the many free guided tours that are offered as they enhance the experience. Enjoy the lovely grounds & views. It was a cool, sunny, but quite windy, day when we were there. I think the restaurant is certainly worth a try (although I liked my meal better the previous visit). One can easily spend the better part of a day here. Enjoy!",JULOfrVan
50,Getty is a must if you are visiting LA,The gardens alone are worth the visit. The landscape and the fountains are amazing. Whether you like art or not you will enjoy it. Take a picnic and enjoy the view.,Thee_Source
40,Well worth a visit,"After a short scenic route up the hill on their tram you reach this marvellous (free of charge) museum. Parking is available but I took a cab there. I would recommend that you make use of their self guide headsets as you can pick and choose the pieces which you want to learn more about (you will need to leave your ID with them as a deposit, if you are on holiday like I was they will just make note of your passport details and hotel contact information). I particularly enjoyed the garden and surrounding sculptures. They have an amazing view across LA. Thank goodness they provided umbrellas for shade as it was a baking hot day. Snacks are fairly expensive so bring enough cash, they also have a restaurant if you prefer a whole meal. The Getty is well worth a visit and you need about 3 hours to enjoy it.",Mel
50,Amazing!,Loved everything about the Getty Center.The permanent exhibits are first rate and I loved the featured Manet exhibition.The facilities are beyond first class. The admission and self guided audio tour are free. The only fee was $20 for parking.Food in the cafe was excellent and reasonably priced.My wife loved the museum shop.Just GO!,Sherlock60
50,Breathtaking Views and VIP Service,"For the price of parking, this otherwise free museum is astounding. The local is easy to navigate with assistance from staff. Best views of the LA basin from the south side of the building. The contents of the museum vary according to the timing of your visit. I was particularly interested in the Galle Chandelier. Expertly shown with low lighting perfect for photos and beautifully accompanied information. This place is a must see just for the views alone.",Thomas P
50,Worth the effort,"After visiting the Getty Villa we decided to drive over to the Center and see some of its offerings. The parking we had paid for at the Villa covered parking at the Center. Just had to ask for a voucher from the info desk at the Villa.From the Center parking lot there is a free tram up the hill to the museum campus. A fun and easy way to get uphill.It was worth going there just to see a wonderful temporary exhibition of Manet paintings, etc. In addition, there were a couple-few more permanent exhibits we had time and energy to enjoy. And the grounds were an added reason to visit. A supurb, world class museum.",bfindysz
50,What an amazing total experience!,"The Getty Center is more than worth it!! When parked the car, you should take the tram to the Getty Center! Discover the amazing exhibitions spread out on the 5 different rooms! After, take your time to enjoy the beautiful garden!",Niels Goyvaerts
50,The Getty,"It's one of the most important museums in LA (as far as I know) and the entrance is free. (You only pay for parking). They have a wide range of art Rembrandt, El Greco, Monnet.

50,As brilliant as everyone says,"You won't be disappointed in the Getty Museum. Set aside three hours for a visit, perhaps a bit more for lunch on the premises. A world class collection of art, free tours, enticing gardens, and incredible views make this museum an LA favorite. I was particularly impressed by the quantity and quality of the descriptions mounted next to the paintings, sculpture and fine furnishings. Nearly every piece in the entire museum had a detailed explanation of its significance! I dined in the cafe, which is pricey, but portions are large and offerings are varied with many healthy options. There is a grab and go section for those who would rather get back quickly to the art. The docent on my tour about the life of JP Getty was a substitute and not effective or well-informed, but I appreciated the fact that the Getty offers free tours on a variety of subjects throughout the day.",Cassidy144
50,The Amazing Getty Center!,"This place is amazing if you've never been there before. It's free but you do have to pay $20 for parking. They do offer a special price of $15 for parking if you arrive after 3pm. Once you arrive you have to take a trolley to the top to see the Getty Center. Once you arrive I would recommend going into the main visitor building and watch a short (about 10 minutes) film about the Getty Center. I found it helpful to plan my visit and I would recommend taking one of the many different free tours they offer. I took the architecture tour that lasted about 45 minutes and it was very interesting and you learn a lot about the thinking behind the mind of the creator of the Getty Center. He had some very interesting ideas on how it would be built and you will look at the buildings different after taking this tour.Right now they have a Manet exhibition that opened recently that you can enjoy and you're allowed to take pictures too (not with a flash though). Also, if you look at the stairs walking up to the Manet exhibition you will notice they have painted the stairs to make it look like 1 large painting...very nice.The center is opened from 10am to 5:30pm Monday - Friday and 10am - 9pm on Saturday. They are closed on Mondays. I believe the last trolley ride down to the parking garage is at 6pm Monday - Friday. If you want a nice view of the 405 and the wine vineyard across the highway you can get one from one of the overlooks. They take you there on the architecture tour but I think you can walk to it without being on a tour.A must to see is the main garden at the Center. It's really neat and offers many different types of flowers and great views of the city below. You are welcome to walk around on the grounds and lay out on the grass to relax. They offer tours of the gardens that last about 40 minutes but I didn't take one.I would suggest eating before arriving because the food & drinks are expensive up there and I didn't find the taste worth the extra cost. They have a nice gift store if you're interested in shopping.I spent about 3 hours at the Getty Center but could easily spent an entire day if not multiple days if you really are interested in the arts. It's 6 different levels so wear comfortable shoes.",MichaelLong1963

50,"Wow, amazing","We had read about this and while I thought we may be underwhelmed by art, boy was I wrong. There are rare pieces here and the surroundings, view, architecture are just amazing.

50,It's a museum. It's a state-of-mind!,"The buildings, grounds, and views make this one of the most special places on the planet. Tie in great art and some good restaurant choices, The Getty has to be the best place to spend a day anywhere!",denverroadtrip
50,Wish I had a week to spend at The Getty,"We loved everything about this magnificent Center. It is spacious, airy, comfortable and has the most interesting displays. We loved the Manet exhibit and the Photography Area. I wish we had a bit more time to spend exploring.",DonnaK
50,Plan for longer than suggested,"This was a fairly last minute decision to go, so I didn't do enough research beforehand (like reading the TripAdvisor reviews) and went with ""highlights"" and the Getty website.The most misleading thing to me was the suggested time allotment of 2-3 hours. This is definitely too short unless you are going to walk the museum without stopping to learn anything. I'm not knowledgeable on art and so took a collection highlights tour -- learned about and saw examples of what makes the art ""great"" or unique, but at an hour, it took up a lot of time, and wasn't really an ""overview"" tour, which was what I thought it might be. As a result we only had time to wander about the second floor and on retrospect I wish we had either come earlier in the day, or just done the special exhibit on the Bauhaus and walked the garden. We had a group of 5, (two families) so it was a bit more difficult to know how to see a lot, not lose each other and still keep everyone seeing what they were interested in. I stayed with the tour, though it took longer (vs exploring other rooms while guide was speaking) because it was the most in depth information I had received and it was interesting and interactive. So because there are a number of tours, I'd recommend at least 4 hours, plus there is travel time from the parking structure via tram to the center and that cuts into your time to look around.Important to note is that the construction of the building can effectively block cellphone / text and so I'd suggest setting a meeting time and place before splitting up if you do so, rather than rely on messages in real time.",Ann M
50,Return Visits Definitely Required,"Visit starts with good secure parking @$20. Thereafter a tramway takes you to the top and the entrance plaza.Join an initial short tour to get an informative view of the layout and the architecture of this campus.The views of LA can't be matched.The architecture and design are mesmerising.Events are always taking place in addition to the galleries.Also, good food at reasonable prices in the cafe and the restaurant.The vast size of this complex can cope with the large visitor numbers.",Stephen W
50,Such an incredible treasure to the community!,"We drove up from San Diego to see the Bauhaus Exhibit in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus movement. The exhibit was well composed with a good overview of the impact on foundational methods of art education over the past hundred years.My husband and I both the thought the depiction of the color wheel, primary/secondary/tertiary colors; color studies with ints, shades and hues; and the impact of colors relative to different backgrounds.... so interesting!! Things we take for granted now were concepts created and communicated effectively starting with the Bauhaus.We were a bit disappointed with only two galleries being dedicated to the exhibit. We felt that the exhibit didn’t really bring to a close what happened to the school and the people, except in the timeline at the beginning of the show.Numerous people left the second gallery as we did, looking for the next gallery to see where/how the story concluded.The exhibit could have delineated about what happened to those who were nit able to leave Europe. Numerous members from the Bauhaus were murdered by the Nazis in cities or in camps.Tips for parking:-when you enter an address in Waze, enter Getty Parking Structure (don’t just say The Getty)-it’s easiest to just drive to the lowest level and park.-take your ticket with you and validate it when you get off the elevator when returning on the elevatorHave fun!!When leaving the Gerry and catching rhe team back to parking...lf the line is horrific, it’s a pleasant 20 minute walk down to the parking area if you walk rather than team it back.Enjoy!!",2beans2000

40,"An interesting day out, what’s not to like","A very interesting educational and different day out, featuring a special event with free admission. There are beautiful gardens and with some unusual art, which is not for everyone but worth a visit as 1.3bn dollars was spent creating the space, which also has great views over the valley.",JCHodges
40,"Some wonderful stuff, some mediocre, but good experience overall","There are many aspects of The Getty Center to comment on:Parking - Easy and abundant. $20 before 3pm.Getting from parking to museum - By tram from the parking garage, frequent and comfortable, but at the end of the day, one may have to wait for some time for a tram to be available due to crowds leaving, especially on weekends.Signage - Truly terrible everywhere, outside and inside. For example, the location of rest rooms, indications for how to get from one ""pavilion"" to the next, and how to reach the tram from the museum to leave the place at the end of one's visit are mysteries which are solved only by asking members of the staff who, admittedly, are to be found almost everywhere. And those are just three examples.Gardens - gorgeous in themselves, and some really good sculptures dotted all over. But the gardens' relation to the museum building, nor the sculptures' relation to the rest of the collection, is not evident. It's like they're entirely separate things which were conceived completely independently of each other.The building - The parts that are travertine are wonderful, especially as to texture and to color. But the parts that are not travertine are too white and often resemble 1960s office or hospital administration buildings. The design is in parts inventive and in other parts boring and institutional.The collection - Some truly great works: Ensor's Entry of Christ into Brussels is one of the greatest works in the history of art, beautifully but incongruously displayed in a room dotted with sculptures which have absolutely no relation to it. They paid $10 million for this a few decades ago, and it needs to be explained to viewers. Like: Why does the Getty own it? What is its relation to the rest of the collection? When we visited, viewers were totally indifferent. Then, there's Pontormo's exquisite Halberdier, also poorly displayed and positioned, and viewed with indifference by passers-by, for which the Getty paid $35 million twenty or more years ago. This was far better displayed for 50 years or more at the Frick before the Getty purchased it. Finally, the Giacometti sculpture in the entrance hall is positioned disastrously against a wall where nobody notices it, and what is it doing in the museum anyway? In general, the arrangement of the collection is either extremely conventional or has no taste and often no rationale. On the plus side, all the works are well lit and positioned mostly at eye level for easy viewing.Mostly, it's less-than-top-class works by major artists, like Monet, Cezanne, Corot, Manet, Rembrandt, Sisley, Pissarro, and so on. We loved the little Degas self-portrait; the Parmigianino holy family; the magnificent Rosso Fiorentino on loan from the LACMA; the Watteau Italian commedia dell'arte players, the largest work of Watteau we've ever seen; the Chardin still lifes; the Turner view of Rome; the Caspar David Friedrich Walk at Dusk; the Rubens sketches: the Goya bullfight: Millais' The Ransom; an exquisite Pietà by Fernando Gallego whom we had never heard of.It's not a comprehensive collection. It's a mishmash. An interesting mishmash, with some individual magnificent works, perhaps 20 or so, with the Ensor and the Pontormo and the on-loan Rosso Fiorentino topping the list.The other thing that astounded us was the literally unbelievably good condition of the majority of the works. They have been vastly overrestored, in our opinion; they ""shine"" too much to be believed. It's like somebody did them as paint-by-number. Fine when it's a single example, like the Turner view of Rome, which the label says has been untouched since the artist painted it. It's another thing with the less-than-top-quality Corots which look like someone put a coat of varnish on them to make them ""glow"". This is not the case with the greatest works, but is the case with much of the less than first-rate stuff.The café is OK, spacious and quick, with a large and interesting selection of things. It isn't cheap, however: a salad, a bowl of soup, a soda, and a brownie for $32 seems truly excessive. Yes, the museum is ""free"", but .....The views, such as they are, are impressive.We spent a good four hours on our first visit to the Getty, and we limited ourselves to the European paintings, the sculpture garden, the gardens in general, and the building. We did not have the energy for any of the exhibitions, nor the entire ground floor with the decorative arts. There was much to see, and we enjoyed our visit.",opera_fanatic47

50,Great museum with a beautiful garden and city-view,"Especially if you are into arts, this museum is a must! And it's even for free. When you get there in the afternoon/evening, you will also have the chance to see a beautiful sunset before leaving the place.",Manuel
40,A Different Journey,"A masterpiece by Architect Richard Meier, The Getty Center sits on top of a hill overlooking los Angeles and the pacific ocean. A free tram whisks you up the hill to an interesting structure surrounded with beautiful gardens. You start at the main buiding and walk through several buildings holding different exhibitions.lots of art and artifact collected by the late Getty. Each structure is unique in its own way. The gardens surrounding the structures vary in style and size. Some are large with water, others are small, with Zen like feeling. Overall its a very serene place. I highly recommend you go if you have the time. I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval.",GoldnAdvice
50,A don't miss experience,"Visiting the Getty Center is truely an exceptional experience. Its a rare example of what can be accomplished when money is not an issue. The architecture, art and gardens are unique and awe-inspiring. Mulitple tours are offered e.g. architecture, garden, art collection highlights, to name a few, and definitely recommended. In addition, there are visiting exhibitions to experience. All of the above is free, however parking will cost $20. The Center's restaurant is nice for dinner, and the large cafe in the same building is above average for lunch and snacks. Don't miss this gem.",BeerNut_CA
50,A Must-see When You are in LA,"The Getty Center is on top of a mountain, and to get there you get on a free shuttle to the top from the parking lot below. As you enter the shuttle, you feel as though you are embarking on a true cultural journey (which you are!) Separated from all of Los Angeles below, the Center has multiple exhibitions going on simultaneously. The buildings themselves are beautiful and the gardens fabulous, making this a place to go without even checking out the amazing art within. This place is always a highlight of every visitor we have had from the West Coast, Europe, etc. It is a true ""must-see!"" (Check out the special materials for childrens' visits to the Getty--they are terrific! PS the gift shop is a fantastic one, and the cafeteria is great!",Terry B
50,Great place to adventure off to learn and have fun!,This is a really great museum and I would suggest you go. You learn a lot of history and you also get to take great photos. super cool experience. Make sure to bring a camera with no flash.,Sinqua Walls
50,Different Experience Every Time,"Love this place. Gorgeous views, and incredibly helpful staff.The best part of the Getty is the fact they have traveling exhibitions; bringing some of the world's best art to our LA doorstep.",G S
50,Beautiful grounds!,"Everything about The Getty Center is amazing. The architecture, the art collection, the gardens, the views...I'm not sure it gets much better than this. Not to mention - it's free to visit! This was worth every minute of the stop. We were there only a few hours, but you could easily make it most of your day.",Robbie M
50,Better than the Louvre?,"My wife and I visited the Central Garden and then had an engaging Collection Highlights Tour. We commend our Tour Guide Pia for the engaging way that she told the stories behind some of the paintings and sculpture pieces, particularly Henry Weekes’ “Bust of an African Woman,” that made them come alive in meaningful ways. She also focused on Claude Monet paintings of Rouen Cathedral and Sunrise, a diptych of Virgin and Child by Jean Fouquet, a painting of Musicians’ Brawl by Georges de la Tour, and a sculpture of Angel of the Citadel by Marino Marini.I am not arguing that the Getty Museum is a better venue to see some of the world’s great art; but the Getty’s more manageable crowds enabled us to see more of what we wanted and our September, 2019 Getty experience was probably more enjoyable than our September, 2018 Louvre experience.",Looper_321
50,Amazing views and top notch museum,The Getty has the best views of Los Angeles!! The museum contains paintings from many well known artists and is very well organized. We took the garden tour and loved the information provided. The design of the gardens is fascinating! It’s wonderful that this museum is free so I can visit regularly.,kmeyers858
50,Beautiful,It's a beautiful museum. Amazed that it is free. The garden is stunning. Lots to see. Great views. Have a picnic on the lawn or sit at the tables.,brennaed
50,Great museum with super view of Los Angeles from hilltop,"This is my favorite place to take an out of town visitor. First, you take a maglev tram to go from the parking structure up the hill to the museum. The museum has excellent permanent exhibits, plus it always have some wonderful special exhibits as well.There is a great restaurant, reservation required but highly recommended. There is also a very nice cafeteria also. The view overlooking the LA basin is amazing.This is a must see!btw the museum is free, they charge for parking.",Eigerhike
50,So Interesting!,"This place was beautiful from its artwork to the views. We downloaded the scavenger hunt app and had a lot of fun tracking down clues for this, however it would have taken us all day so we did not complete it. Definitely something to see while in LA. I did enjoy the Getty Villa more though. A lot more interactive there.",Allison H
50,Outstanding Collection and Gardens,"The collection of European paintings is extensive with insightful information next to each work. The garden was spectacular. Staff was helpful and the tours seemed helpful - although we were self-guided. Parking was $20, not bad for 2 people to spend 5.5 hours enjoying the art and gardens. We did not see over half of the entire exhibit.",AnnaMarie H
50,Must go again,"We took an Uber there and were dropped by the funicular. Everyone else complained about the cost of parking $20 for the day. Admission is free. It is a great day out. The campus is vast with stunning views east, south and to the west and the Pacific Ocean all easily accessible for anyone in a wheelchair. Although we visited on a weekend and there were lots of people it felt spacious.There is a lot to see: paintings, ceramics, furniture, glass, it is an Aladdin's cave of mostly European/Mediterranean treasure. We really enjoyed the gardens. We also tried the cafe. The food was made to order so prepare for a wait, but it was good.We had a great day out. I would recommend it to anyone who had a hankering for something different from the usual sites and tourist hotspots in Los Angeles. There were activities for children. There were guided yours, lectures and events do check on line in advance so that you can take advantage of what is going on the day you plan to visit.",Catherine M
50,Fantastic visit,I had a fantastic visit and sadly only had a short afternoon visit due to a train I had to catch. The collection of art wasn't as spectacular as some of the more well known galleries in Europe but it had a good assortment of European art. There was a lot of furniture and such on the ground floor I wasn't too interested in personally. The grounds and buildings were really interesting and I'd have liked to have spent more time wandering. There are also fantastic views of the city and I was told it's equally great in the evening. One thing to note is that you likely need to drive or take a rideshare to get there.,westcoast778
30,Getty Villa,"Beautiful place. Amazing views. My main problem with this place is that it was built by the Getty Oil tycoon. He acquired this collection just by traveling and buying historical items. He bought the collection because he liked it, and it’s what the extremely rich do. I guess it’s good that it’s a non-profit, but I still think things that are so historically significant do not belong in some rich guys house, just because *you can*.",SassyLaura
40,"The quiet, and the beautiful",There is a free tram that takes you to Getty center. from parking. Car parking charges are $20. The center is beautiful. And it is very quiet. View of LA is very beautiful from the top.,Anant A
40,A must-visit,The exhibits are great. But what sets the Getty Center apart is the incredible site from the architecture to buildings perched atop a beautiful hill with commanding views.Great for families.,FM6565

50,amazing,absolutely worth a visit. we love the architecture and the gardens. there is so much to see. Art of all ages as well as other things,Melanie K
50,Best views in LA,"The Getty has an overwhelming collection of varied and incredibly art, but a major selling point of the Getty is the incredible 180 degree view of Los Angeles and the beautiful gardens which are wonderful to walk around or have a picnic at.",alexcoleybrown
50,Gorgeous in every way,"Beautiful architecture, art and a lovely garden. Highlight was seeing Van Gogh’s Irises painting. The cafe had great lunch options as well. It is a fee museum ~ parking would cost but we Ubered as we don’t have a car on this trip.",Ann H
50,Very Informative,I can only described my visit to the Getty Centre as one of the highlights of my trip. The views are stunning and there is endless information to keep you occupied. If that is not your thing then head outside to the beautiful garden and have a stroll. This is a free venue but parking is priced between $ 15 - $20.,Derrick O
40,Worth it for the architecture,"It was worthy of a visit just to see this magnificent property, buildings and garden. The galleries sole focus is European art though, so although pleasant it is disappointing. We've all seen European art over the years and it becomes a little same same. The American art at Huntington is so great, it piqued our desire to see so much more, so the Getty fell flat for us on the back of our naive expectation that they'd have plenty, when the reality was none.",GQHQ
50,Get to the Getty!,"Situated in the hills above Los Angeles, The Getty Center has amazing views of the valley and coast beyond. In addition to amazing art and architecture the gardens are simply lovely. There's such a light airy feel about the place. And it's ALL ACCESSIBLE!",Ferdina
50,Great venue for afternoon relaxing time,Went to Getty one afternoon on a weekend. Busy but not horrible. Actually did the Getty Center and Villa. That requires a car of course. Definitely a to do when friends come to Los Angeles,Lee H
40,Great Views of LA basin,"We braved the I-405 traffic and arrived at the Museum, from the north, without too much problem. They direct you to a parking garage where the cost is $20 per day. You walk outside and wait for a Tram to transport you about 3/4 mile up the hill.The museum complex is quite large with several modern buildings and exhibits typically on the top and bottom of each floor. As you probably know, most of the displays are paintings and sculptures. There are many nudes (2-D and 3-D), so not a great place for smaller kids. Walking around can be tiring, although elevators are available and there are plenty of benches, so older people should pace themselves. The grounds and gardens are also nice for strolling, but it was quite hot the September day we visited.Admission to the Museum is free, as is the Tram ride. They have scheduled Tours and free iphone-size tablets with head phones that are useful for self-guided tours. Warning, however, is that they charge steep prices for food and drink for their captive audience. Even if you eat in the Café, expect to spend about $20 a person for lunch. The Restaurant is supposedly even more expensive. Cans of soda are $3.50, burgers with fries are about $13, so you get the idea. I would recommend bringing your own food and snacks for lunch if on a budget.",Andrew P
50,Love every visit - weather dependant,"Assuming decent weather, this is one of my favorite laces to bring out of town guests or just to spend a day with a good friend. The gardens are amazing and don't forget to do the architectural tour!",KateM
50,Beautiful place,This place is amazing and all the history is fascinating. The drive there was good too. A tram takes you from the car park up to the Getty Center.There is SO much to see here. Take your time and take it all in.The restaurant is amazing and has so many options for hot food.The gardens and views are breathtaking,Basi5
50,Fully immersive art - a true gem,"After a sunrise gym run, we hit the Getty Center right as it opened on a Friday morning. You're whisked to the complex by tram, surrounded by glorious scenery.One of the most powerful features of the Getty was the constant shuffle between the indoor art and the natural beauty and landscape architecture of the Center. While at first I found it annoying to have to go in and out of the different pavilions, it didn't take long for me to see that this was one of the most relaxing art experiences I've ever enjoyed and that the considerable exterior splendor served as its own mental cleanser, resetting the mind as the viewer transitions through the various exhibits in each of the pavilions.The collection itself is impressive, not as full or vibrant as the Met, Louvre or Hermitage but still formidable. Put into the backdrop of Malibu, however, the visitor is treated to a one-of-a-kind moment irreplicable anywhere else.Facilities are world-class, and the only thing one has to pay for is the parking ($20). Aside from that, it's free.Getty left us a great gift, born of his unique vision and love of art, one that's worth slogging through LA traffic for and one that every visit to LA should include.",MKB1701

50,The restaurant,"Went for lunch to celebrate a birthday. The consensus was the best Cobb salad the best eggs Benedict and for me the best watermelon gazpacho.Wonder floor to ceiling windows with spectacular views. The service and servers were excellent.

50,Museum different than other museum,"Getty is different from your typical everyday museum, the art work is beautiful but the way the building is built and located is architectural genius. The garden is for you to spend hours and enjoy the view. I highly recommend to see this beautiful museum.",241yasa
50,A must stop in LA,This is a wonderful place you can easily stay an afternoon or longer here. The gardens are beautiful and fun to walk through. The museum is very interesting if you want a good history tour.,Lisa W
50,Great Museum,This is an excellent museum to visit if you are a resident or visiting Los Angeles area. The parking is easy access with a $10 fee and the museum is complete free. The campus has an amazing view of the Los Angeles area all the way to the ocean. You could pack a lunch an enjoy a delightful day for a very little expense. The permanent art collection is amazing and the temporary exhibits are world quality. I highly recommend this place. Enjoy,Zabb2014
50,"This is a ""must see"" while visiting Los Angeles",This is an amazing place to visit. You can stroll through room after room of great art and sculptures.,Kenneth1955
40,Beautiful gardens,Beautiful house and gardens although the central garden was closed while being worked on. Big collection of artifacts. My teens were not so interested in that. Entry to the house is free but the parking is expensive.,Adina R

50,A Beautiful Balance of Works of Art,"""Location, Location, Location"" is not usually what you think of when you are discussing museums with great works of art, but in this case, the location itself is a work of art. Truly one of the most beautiful landmarks in Los Angeles and one of the nicest thingsJ. Paul Getty (and his trust!) did for the public. The museum is free, though parking is not. Once you park and go through security, you ride a tram up a hill to lovely buildings completely covered in modern, Travertine tile, which house paintings of Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Daddi, and Rubens and so many more. To be specific, the collections include, ""Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art from the Neolithic to Late Antiquity; European art—including illuminated manuscripts, paintings, drawings, sculpture, and decorative arts,"" according to the Getty Museum Website. The modern glass art is spectacular as are the gardens. Plan on spending the entire day there. I took my (adult) students there and three of them went back the following weekend, taking their families and out of town guests because they were so IN AWE of the museum and the setting. If you're from out of town and love art, skip one of the many theme parks we have and head to the Getty. You will not regret it.",TravelerGal
50,Too much to imagine!,There is so much to see!!! Artm art anymore art. Love the garden area. Great tours offered at no charge. You have to see the video before you do any exploring.,Vernon E
50,Beautiful setting for a diverse collection spanning all periods/styles of art.,"The Center (not to be confused with the Villa in Malibu) is easy to get to. It’s collection spans multiple buildings so expect to spend the day there. Gardens are best enjoyed in the Spring/Summer time. If you had visited during the big drought, the outdoor fountains had all been turned off. They are back on and and add to the outdoor appeal. The main cafeteria has a nice selection of healthy options so don’t bother waiting in line at a food cart in the courtyard.",Shannon
50,Day or night,We went while it was light outside and took great pictures of the skyline and Hollywood sign. We were there when the sunset and it created a beautiful glow against the mountains and Getty center. Well worth it,Charrise G
40,Memorable Art Museum and Gaeden,"Unlike the LA County Museum of Art, the Getty Center is architecturally interesting without being intimidating. The art collection spans many eras without overwhelming you. And the garden is a nicely visual respite from the bustle of the city. Plan on a couple hours here on a clear day to enjoy the views.",Daniel W
50,"Worth the $20 parking, admission is free, carpool!",The Getty has been on my bucket list for almost a year. We took the garden and architecture tour which was combined because of the heat.Beautiful architecture story of how the stones from a quarry which built the Roman monuments was shipped on 100 vessels to the mountain. Lots of great outdoor space and clean lines to admire the precision of the build.,JCtennis
50,One of the truly remarkable museums.,"The Getty Center and its other facility the Villa are must see sites in L.A. Each one is different and each takes almost a day to visit. Both are breathtaking sites, each with a collection of work that will inspire and educate. The Getty Center has a wide collection of art, photography, and landscape design all within a remarkable facility. Special exhibits are occasionally presented.",JayArr7
50,"Amazing art, architecture, gardens and views. Got to see it.","Arriving at the Getty can be difficult. Its best to Uber it there. There is a very long line of cars at the entrance of the parking lot. The museum is free but parking is $10.00 I believe. You can walk up the hill or take the tram. Its quite a steep climb. There is a long line to board the tram. Yes its worth visiting. Once arriving at the travertine tram terminal you're on top of a hill with the views of the ocean and on a clear day Downtown LA. The gardens are beautifully manicured with fountains running from the upper levels thru the gardens below and ending at the ""Maze"". The Museum itself holds a massive collection of masterpieces.",Rodolfo S

50,the grounds are the best part,The best part of the Ghetty are the grounds. I love going here whenever I feel depressed. It lifts my spirits. I've done photoshoots with friends here too. there are so many great textures to take pictures with. And everywhere you look there is inspiration.,thisisorganic
50,"Spectacular art, architecture, gardens, and views!","I am a long time Angeleno and this is one of my favorite places in town. I'm not big on antiquities and so generally visit when there's exhibit that piques my interest, but no matter what is on this is one of the best places to visit if you're coming from out of town. The buildings, gardens, and views alone make it worth the parking fee (no admission fee - so get as many people in that car as possible!). You have to check it out.",Suju V
50,Classics!,"There is so much to see here, it's a must have for LA. Give yourself enough time to enjoy everything, could take the whole day.",Kristina O
50,Great art and great views,The Getty center is a free and very popular attraction in LA. There is a monorail like tram to take you up to the center. The buildings are unique and attractive plus views are excellent. There is a nice collection including irises. We found it a bit busy and unattended children on a group tour were a bit of a damper. The special exhibit featured many magnificent illuminated manuscripts but was crowded and I would suggest planning your visit accordingly. The grounds and gardens are also quite striking. Took some great photos!,LSQRD1
50,Worth it!,"This very unique setting with marvelous views of LA area, has so many treasures, it takes your breath away! Plan on spending most of the day, check in advance for any special exhibits requiring tickets, and take some spending money for unexpected finds in the gift shop! History comes alive with several collections of Art: sculpture, painting, jewelry, and architecture.",Suzanne T
50,The Getty Center Gardens and Architectural Tour,Have taken the Architectural Tour numerous times and always come away with new and inspiring information. The docents are excellent. Just walking the grounds/gardens lends itself to a most enjoyable day.,pattica1
50,Panoramic views of Los Angeles and a truly unique experience,"I visited the Getty Center with my friend from Los Angeles who had recommended it to me. It was a beautiful day, which I am sure added to the experience, but it is a truly unique and captivating place with such a variety of things to see I am sure it would appeal to most people.There is ample parking close to the main roads and from there you can either walk up to the center or queue for a ride in a kind of train as the center itself is at the top of a steep hill amongst the surrounding LA and Hollywood hills. It is essentially a beautifully laid out art museum with a great variety of things to see from paintings and sculptures through to furniture from different periods. I would recommend getting a map on entry to ensure you can easily find the exhibits you feel most drawn to, as a lot of the place is similar looking and it's easy to get confused. We looked around a lot of different areas. There is a lot of space so even if it gets busy it is easy to see the exhibits, there is plenty of information available to read in each room and staff on hand to ask questions who are very polite and helpful and seem proud to work there. Prices were very fair and reasonable especially considering there is enough there to spend the whole day wandering.They also have interesting temporary exhibits. We went to see one about mythical beasts and learned that unicorns were included in artwork going back to medieval times! It was very well presented and was one of my favourite parts. There is a restaurant so you can eat on site if you want to spend the whole day, I cannot comment on the food since we did not eat there as my friend needed to drive me to Venice and then get back home and we ate on the way instead.For me the best part was the outdoor areas. There is a beautiful garden full of exotic plants, gorgeous smelling as well as looking, and water features. It truly is a work of art in itself and I think that was the point. The panoramic views are amazing and to be there on my first day back in Los Angeles, my favourite place in the world, made me really happy. You can see so much of the hills and the beautiful homes and vegetation up there, as well as the city and roads below and even on a clear day (like the day we were there) right out to the Pacific Ocean. It was worth visiting just to see that view. (You can't see the Hollywood sign from up there though if anyone's wondering.)On a sunny day I would recommend visitors from colder countries wear sunscreen and sun hats as I got a little burnt from being a little careless.If you're in Los Angeles and you want an amazing view of the place and/or you enjoy seeing a bit of art, history and culture I would definitely recommend visiting and I would like to go back again someday.",ladyvalkyrie22
50,Spectacular views,Dedicate entire day to visit this places. It is free of charge but you have to pay for parking your car. From the parking lot the hover train will take you up ( for freezing) to the actual center/museum. I was stoned how much world-class artwork they gather here for display. And the views from here will blow your mind. They have also concerts for kids here and s lot of special exhibits . Amazing.,Annaline
50,Great place!,"Enjoyable morning spent here on a fine Sunday. I like that the art periodically changes for a new exhibition, so there""s always something new to see. The Getty Center has won a very special place in my heart the moment I laid eyes on the beautiful garden created by Robert Irwin. The intricacies and thoughtful details were very well-explained by our tour guide. The plants there were unique, and the colors complemented each other to create a serene environment.",Jessica Mohr
50,Definite must see among art museums,"Excellent restrained collection that does not overwhelm. Paintings are in outstanding vibrant condition. The grounds, gardens, outdoor sculpture are an added delight. Add a tour of highlights that was insightful and you have not only a wonderful day but a memorable one.Ps If you can, lunch at the Restaurant...it is an added treat",Gilles B
50,Loved the Getty Center,"What a fun and fascinating day we had at the Getty Center. You pay for parking in a giant below grade parking garage, and the Getty Center itself is free. You take a tram-ride up the mountainside to the dramatic cluster of buildings and gardens at the top of the mountain. The architecture and the views are awe inspiring. Really beautiful. The exhibits are arranged in buildings labeled North, East, South and West. And, the exhibits are arranged in chronological order rather that typical styles of categorizing exhibits. It's a bit irritating if you are super-aware of traditional museum/art center curation. If you are NOT a museum nerd, I'm not sure you'd really notice the difference. There are world class examples of art from around the world, and a floor dedicated to photography. Powerful examples of stunning famous artwork. I LOVED our visit. As a criticism though, the position of the staircases and the elevators inside the buildings is confusing and sometimes inconvenient. As far as I can tell, it is a different layout different in each building. And, although the buildings are labeled with the ""cardinal directions,"" in reality you can walk on second floor walkways between the buildings and not actually know you have entered a second building. I found this befuddling too, as it is not well marked. Anyway, it is a fantastic space. The gardens are breathtaking but the way-finding within the buildings is confusing.",Jane M
50,Amazing Place!,"The Getty Center is impressive. It contains some of the finest works of art in the world. The museum also offers spectacular views of Los Angeles on clear days. We went there on a Saturday, paid only $15 for the parking. The even had live music which we loved it.Tip- I used google maps from my cell to get there but it took us to a different building. It seemed that we were not the only ones with this issue. So make sure you plan your route before going there.",Daniel C
50,Visit The Getty!,This was a highlight of LA for us. I would definitely recommend visiting while there. It is expensive to park but well worth it. Beautiful museum and grounds.,Jessica E
50,The Getty Villa,"Firstly don't get confused as I did between the Getty Centre and the Getty Villa. They are two separate museums and are about 40 minutes apart. The Getty Villa is exquisite. From the ancient artefacts on display, to the architecture and landscaping. Well worth a visit.",Victoria C
50,An oasis!,"Apart from the fact that there are numerous interesting exhibits, this is a wonderful place to spend the day with friends or family. Have a picnic or just walk around the trees and flowers! Highly recommended! I can't believe this place is free!",Maria M
50,Always Five Stars,"The only reason I'd move to congested LA is the Getty Center. This outstanding museum has a stunning hillside location, regularly rotates pieces and exhibits from its vast collection, and moves people through security and into the tram quickly. There are food choices and lots of outdoor places to eat or soak up the sun.",GlobalGypsy_13
50,Stunning architecture and a 'Must See' Bauhaus exhibition,"The architecture is magnificent, enjoyed photographing from every angle.The temporary exhibition on the Bauhaus is superb, but there is no accompanying exhibition guide-book, so (minus flash), photograph the lot, it is an excellent collection of work that shows the development of ideas including colour swatches, technical drawings, graphics designs and typography.Good dining in or out doors, but closes early so check times.You park at the bottom of the hill, well signposted off the 405, and then take an automated bus up the hill - there may be a queue, shade is provided - but bring water.We only visited the Bauhaus but there are many other galleries to explore and find your way all the way to the upper-most balcony for views across the city.",rolf12014

Took short guided tours of the French decorative arts (furniture) and the Impressionists (the decorative arts one was more interesting) and spent 5 hours there. If it hadn’t been raining all day, we might have toured the gardens. We ate lunch at the restaurant which was a nice splurge: the food and service were both excellent.",Robin B
50,Nice place to hang out,"I had never been before. I went to the Getty with full knowledge of the price of parking ($20), that it is an art gallery and it is expensive (except the exhibitions are free). I went to do some work with a nice view. The place is HUGE! It's a complex of buildings, and they themselves are works of art. The view of the LA Basin is amazing - there was fog/smog, but that wasn't the fault of the Getty Center. There were plenty of places for me to sit with my laptop and get some serious work done. Unfortunately, there was no place to work with a view, unless I sat on the grass. Absolutely no staff questioned why I was there, and the free WiFi was a complete bonus. When I wandered around looking for a place to plug in, the complex is set up so people don't do that. There are electrical outlets, but they are either well-hidden on in a place that would make it both obvious and a trip hazard for me to plug in. So I made due with the battery on the 2 devices that I had. I ate in the cafeteria where the prices are very reasonable. I really appreciated that I wasn't questioned or asked to move on since I wasn't enjoying the Getty Center in the way that the vast majority of people would.",Ian D
50,Must go for visiting LA,Beautiful campus! Lots of great art work. A terrific way to spend the afternoon. You can go the the Getty Cilla in the morning and then go to the Getty Center in the afternoon.,jmseight
50,A Must Visit in LA,"We passed by it so many times in the past and this time we decided to pay a visit. What a great place to visit. Too bad that we did not have enough time to visit all - it is a pretty big and beautiful place. We definitely will visit it again in the future. I would suggest to reserve at least one full day, you will be impressed and have a wonderful time there.",JHT
40,Day Trip,This museum is truly a cultural gem in the land of make-believe! Anyone over the age of 10 would appreciate the beauty that this museum has to offer,Joanne S
50,Walking up is great exercise,The art and architecture is to die for. You can take the tram or the walk up has amazing views. So many opportunities for great pictures. Even if you aren’t a fan of art or architecture it’s an amazing place to see for all ages.,antart888
50,Outstanding architecture and more,This magnificent architectural and cultural center is truly a great experience in many ways. I recommend taking the guided tours to dive completely into its history!,Isabelle F
50,The Best Museum Venue Built in the last 100 years,The Getty Center is the finest museum venue built in the last 100 years. It will take your breath away. Sublime and special.,Dana Los Angeles
50,An Architectural Wonder!,"Went to the Getty Museum with the entire family. It is an architectural wonder sitting atop hills north of Sunset Blvd. It has an outstanding (private) collection of art, paintings and sculptures, generally from the 18th and 19th Centuries. It is a true bargain, as admission is FREE! Parking is $20/day. Most worthwhile!",StanF28
50,"Amazing place, the location is breathtaking and it has some great artifacts.","This place deserves more than one visit as you cannot really take in everything at one visit. It is beautifully cared for and runs like clockwork, impressive.",littlebirdlondon@gmail.com
50,World Renown Art Museums,"From the moment I boarded the free monorail tram to the Museum from the parking lot, I was impressed by this beautiful Center of Art and related. The ocean and the rest of greater Los Angeles are even visible from the top floors of the Exhibit Buildings as well. A full cafeteria type of restuarant is available as well as free-standing kiosks and related. One could spend days viewing all of the extensive and exceptionally beautiful artwork. The Renaissance pictures were in exceptional condition considering they were centuries-old as well. Friendly staff as well.",Anthony G
40,Nice place to visit,Despite our artistic ignorance my wife and I enjoyed visiting the Getty. I would happily return and spend longer learning about the different exhibits.,Adamrick13
20,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I really am shocked by all the positive reviews. Here is my honest experience...The Getty Center is boring, plain and simple. If you enjoy viewing Chinese bowls from the 1500s, then this place is for you. It's simply not exciting to view these things in glass cases. The art exhibit has one Monet, one Van Gogh, and two Renoirs. The gardens were a let down. They aren't that impressive or grand. The cafeteria food is enormously overpriced. A grilled cheese sandwich was $10 and a bottle of lemonade was 5 dollars. The whole environment has a sterile feel and most exhibits are just plain boring. Take my advice, spend the afternoon at the beach or Hollywood. This was just a wasted afternoon.",riemerclan
40,Good but liked the Getty Villa better,"My 18YO son and I visited the Villa and Center on back to back days. We preferred the Villa, but admittedly he has a strong interest in the Greeks and Romans. The buildings and the location of the Center are impressive but I wasn't as wowed by the collections as I expected. I'm an Impressionist fan and it was nice to see Van Gogh's Irises. But overall it was a small collection of Impressionists and I've seen better elsewhere. A nice visit but if I were a California resident, it wouldn't be a place I'd return to regularly.",travelgirl88
30,Had to see it,"Ok, so I’m probably not the right target market for this establishment, but, when it’s rated so highly, I couldn’t not check it out. Beautiful setting it must be said. And everything runs smoothly. It just wasn’t for me....as I expected. But if you don’t go.....you won’t know right?",JDG
50,Beautiful artwork in a Beautiful Setting.,"1. Do not use your GPS to find the Getty, use signs as it is tagged wrong in the system. We ended up in the employee parking lot ten minutes away with poor guards explaining it happens every day even to local drivers.2. Give yourself at least 4 hours but ideally leave your whole day open.3. The buildings have beautiful open air patios to relax and enjoy an amazing overview of the city.4. There is a child’s play area where kids can take a break/let parents take turns exploring/make cute crafts. Great thinking.5.;The gift shops have lovely souvenirs themed to their exhibits and art supplies too so make sure to bring money for those.The Getty is free admission but you pay a $20 fee to park. You then proceed to a tram which takes you up the hill to the museum complex. We visited on a beautiful July day and when one teenager powered out then she just sat in the sun on a patio while the other daughter and I finished exploring. Three hours was not enough so be forewarned if you only have one day to visit, We enjoyed the Bestiary and Pastels exhibits as well as the usual galleries. From classical sculptures, furniture, altarpieces, stained glass, china, paintings, modern sculptures to tapestries and manuscripts- this museum had it all. Too many to list. Staff was friendly and guards present but not overbearing so the atmosphere felt relaxed and conducive to leisurely examination. We will definitely visit here again.",Travelling Wallbury
50,A superb museum in LA,"The Getty often gets overlooked by visitors or even residents. It is larger than it looks and contains some remarkable pieces and their special collections never disappoint. Amazing views, superb food and reasonable prices make this a great stop in the City of Angels.",bbbulldog58
50,Up on the Hill -- Art and the Sea Shine,"You begin your journey with a slow monorail ride that snakes up the hill above the fray of the 405 Freeway and the Sepulveda Pass. Soon LA is spread out before you from Brentwood to all the way downtown and beyond. You arrive in a completely different world of white travertine and clean-lined, graceful structures that reflect the sunlight and beckon you inside. And inside? A collection of rare art spanning at least six centuries, illuminated manuscripts, 18th century furnishings, and the top photography exhibits in the world. There are indoor and outdoor cafes, fancy dining if one chooses, and kid-friendly activities. There is also the frequent eclectic outdoor concert and indoor special event. In short, this is a wonderful way to spend the day in LA, either for a romantic getaway or a family-oriented jaunt. The Rembrandts, Van Goghs, Renoirs, and Titians alone are reason enough to go there, again and again if you can.",GalFromVenice
50,A Tram Ride to Heaven,"The Getty Center is located atop a hill off the 405 near Santa Monica. There is an exit off the 405 that will take you directly to the entrance and parking garage. If you are coming from the Santa Monica direction, however, do not trust your GPS for directions. We trusted ours, ignored signs stating that it was wrong, and ended up in a dead end. I heard that WAZE works better. Admission is free, but parking is $20. Coming out of the garage you immediately get in line for the tram that takes you on a leisurely ride up the hill to the Center. The Center itself is an architectural masterpiece that, along with its beautiful gardens and views is worth a visit all by itself. However, the buildings also contain an extensive collection of artwork from different centuries (I concentrated on the 15th and 16th centuries) and numerous exhibits that change frequently. There are also a restaurant, a cafe, a walking trail through the gardens, view sites, and of course numerous modern bathrooms. Definitely worth visiting if you are in the LA area.",nclandman
50,Don’t even have to like art!,"We recently stopped on the way through to Anaheim to visit the Getty Center. It is well worth the stop...absolutely stunning actually. Parking is $20 per vehicle but admission is free for all. You take a tram from the parking levels to the Center (line up was full when we got there and still only waited 20 min to get up). When you disembark you are treated to stunning scenery, architecture and lovely gardens and that’s not even entering the buildings. We went with our teenage son who isn’t a huge art lover but he could appreciate the outside and even some of the galleries we wandered.Had a light lunch there, prices are not totally outrageous for salads (a bit higher than say a Panera but I expected this) and the quality is good.I would recommend a stop for a short or long time in any weather.Staff is friendly and helpful.",kdb351
50,This Trip - Well Worth It,"My wife had visited the Getty Center for a school project and upon her return she just could not stop talking about it. She insisted on a returned trip....this time together. Well, the day finally came when we had an opportunity to visit the Getty Center. Entry into the Getty Center is nothing short by amazing...the grounds were emacuclate and the surroundings were ""surreal."" This is truly an amazing place to visit. One can merely stroll the grounds and take it in the various art pieces or just sit with someone and have a nice picnic. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit. There was so much to see that we could not see everything in one day but have made a vowed to return.",Tim E
50,Getty Center,"Wonderful outing for family and friends. Admission is free. There are frequent new art exibitions or you can spend the day just walking around the gardens,taking in the view or having lunch at one of casual or more upscale restaurants.",andcut90265
50,Beautiful location and beautiful art!,The Getty Center sits atop a hill with beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean and some of the Southern California beach cities. The grounds are stunning and the modern buildings have wonderful art exhibits. They have special exhibits also that encompass many things. Admission is free but you need to pay for parking. There is a tram that can take you to the top or you can walk. There are eating places and places to rest.,maryannk877
50,DON’T TOUCH!,"This place is amazingly beautiful. Lush grounds, excellent architecture, artwork not to be believed. In fact, the art is so unbelievable that Kristina Hintgen, previous HR Director of Option One Mortgage (also unbelievable) actually claimed that “most of the artwork is original”. She also claims to have been Miss Colorado. Imagine the intellectual competition at that event!But really, do not touch. Not the artwork or anything else. I was reprimanded by a docent for touching a handrail. Yes, true.But don’t let the inability to touch the masterpieces (actually original) stop you from enjoying a day or more at this amazing place.",NotClammingUp
50,Stunning architecture and views,"My family and I weren't sure what to expect from The Getty but it was amazing! The architecture and views were stunning. The gardens were beautiful. The staff were friendly, informative and helpful. There was even a tram ride to the top! My boys (8 and 11) had fun taking part in the scavenger hunt of different sculptures and architectural features around The Getty. This was one of our favourite sites in LA :)",Marney29
50,love the scenery setting and all the art!,always a nice stop while visiting LA. they have some great rotating shows and it is free! a real gem,GypsyMiki
50,An L.A. Treasure Most Angelenos Don't Know About,"People from L.A. know about it, but they don't know much. J. Paul Getty assembled one of the most impressive art collections in the world, and you get to see a ton of it here at the Getty Center.I'm not an art aficionado, but the Getty never fails to deliver when I go there. There are great traveling exhibits, and room after room, floor after floor, and building after building of exhibits.There's a restaurant up there, but I recommend packing some snacks and picnicking in the back, either up high on the patios overlooking Los Angeles (some of the best views you'll find of west L.A.), or going down to the gardens below.There's no cost for admission, but there is for parking. I recommend booking parking in advance, or taking a ride share there.There are lots of events up there as well, so it pays to check out online what's happening.My favorites are the photo exhibits and the some of the classics that come to the Getty on loan.And finally, if you've been before, it's worth going again...the art changes all the time.Bring a sweater for the fall or winter evenings. Summer can be warm, but not horrendous. Lots of shade around between the buildings.",Brian Hemsworth
50,"Amazing architecture, landscaping, and (some of the) collections.","Built on an old westside garbage dump, the Getty still amazes. The tram to the top is even fun.Visitors should allow for at least an hour just to peruse the grounds and checking out the architecture. The latest exhibit is also worth seeing, ""Mythical Beasts"", mostly from illuminated manuscripts.",mbscreen7
50,A REAL GETAWAY FROM THE CITY-FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN LA!,"Of course the art is incredible and the special exhibits brilliant. One of the finest cultural and learning experiences you will ever have, anywhere in the world.

50,WORLD CLASS MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY,"Beautiful architecture and landscaping, wonderful presentation of art and artifacts, a restaurant with panoramic views and delicious food, free tram, free admission ... you have to pay for parking but it's a small price to pay for an incredible experience.",Jennifer F
40,A place to escape,"This is one of my favorite places to go in LA. If you are looking for a place to reflect, this maybe a good place. The garden is my favorite place. The design and color just make this a happy place to be. I have seen many people have picnics here. You can lookout and see part for the ocean from this museum.All of the art work they have is amazing. There are so many different exhibits. Its a great place to spend a day walking around. The building itself is just as artistic as the artworks they hold.",mhplaskett13
50,Best place in LA for couples and families,"If you haven't visited Getty you are missing out. Its very conveniently located off 405 which is one the busiest freeways. But the architecture and location of Getty museum is unique. It's nestled near the hills near Beverly Glen. There is an underground parking which can get full on weekends but they have an overflow lot. After parking, you can take a light rail on top of the hill to visit gardens and museums. They also have some small restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding areas.I recommend that you wait there till sunset and enjoy the views. It has several floors and levels. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Do visit the garden at the front and enjoy the view of Hollywood skyline.",Piyu2cool
50,Great Day Escape,The Getty Center is a great place to visit to escape the busy LA culture. You can relax by looking at the art and hanging out near the water features. It is a great place to spend the day.,Korie L

50,Beautiful art in a beautiful setting,"The Getty is a beautiful place for a picnic, even if you don't go into the museum. You can bring your own picnic materials, or you can buy food there. Of course, it also has an amazing art collection, much of it modern art. But some highlights include Van Gogh's Irises. Do know that parking takes a while. You have to build in time to take the monorail or walk from and back from the parking garage to the museum site. Views of the city are quite nice.",Ken R

50,Great Museum. Great exibitions,This place is amazing with all the paintings and exibitions. Staff is great. It’s got it’s own tram all the way up. There’s food. Parking is $20 ( you can use the same ticket at getty villa on the same day ),lukeizm
50,Love this place,Photography exhibit by Gordon Parks a must. Plus Bauhaus show in same building. The grounds are exquisite as are the views.,Susan L
50,The Getty,Could have spent days here! Unbelievable views! Quick walk instead of the tram was enjoyable. Take advantage of the free tours!,Btaylor
50,Phenomenal,"Worth visiting for the views alone, especially during the tram ride up to the museum. The museum itself is divided into separate buildings. I found the 19th Century European art collection the most impressive, although there is also a significant section devoted to photography if you are interested.",John M
50,Blue Sky Thinking,"This is another must do in Los Angeles. It is huge and there is so much to see you'll need at least a day. The architecture (which frames a beautiful blue sky) is impressive, as are the gardens and the many different galleries. We had a guided tour and focused on a few exhibits and afterwards we went to have a look at The Book of the Beasts exhibition which was extraordinary.",Zuzu24
50,"Just the right size, exhibits, and location","- Highlights: The location is great and the small tram ride is fun and free. You can bring you picnic and eat in the main open area in the middle of the center (there are tables and chairs) or in the gardens. The Getty audio tour is free. You do not need as much time as visiting the Louvre and the art in the rooms is nicely spread out and the buildings are magnificent. Take your time and enjoy the gardens and walks around the center.- Lowlights: For the audio tour, other languages have but a few works of art translated and narrated. What a shame, for instance the French audio tour only had 19 works of art total when we went. The museum is free but it costs US$ 20 for indoor parking but it goes down in price after 3 p.m.- TIPS: Go early so you can avoid the crowds and get to see more.- BONUS: When driving in the LA area and are more than one person in the vehicle, use the HOV lanes whenever possible and if traffic is fluid take advantage of it because most of the time there are sooooo many slowdowns that you should add 1/3 to 1/2 time more to all your local trips. I love the concept of not having to pay extra to use the HOV lane as opposed to having a toll road that one person in a car can take.",Masque2Fer
40,Great museum but so far from everything,"We visited the Getty Center on 25th July. Although it is in an extremely awkward location, and we had to get a taxi ($50 each way) or else a 2 hour bus/ train journey, it was well worth the visit. It is probably easier to come here if you have a car. The galleries of art and photgraphy especially were very interesting, and include famous paintings by Rembrandt and Monet.",Molly Macfarlane
50,Beautiful and free,"A really unusual place. Beautifully presented collection, the audio tours were free as well and the Roman artefacts were incredible.It had a nice picnic area and restaurant with helpful guides and amazing views.It seemed like it was a favourite place to visit on a Sunday morning for locals, every one was very smart.",Kim P
50,Fabulous!,What a brilliant place. Stunning grounds. Artwork of all mediums and periods - a real treat. How wonderful that Getty had the vision of sharing his collections - thank you.,karen b
20,Preferred the Getty villa,"Firstly, this is a mission to get to from LA. And the traffic is horrendous. The site was big and well layed out. The cafe was overpriced as one would expect. I preferred the Getty villa.",Hays
50,Great day out,"I didn't realise how much time that you could spend here! The place is massive. Make sure you arrive early when it's less busy and prepare to spend most of the day.Get a map and work your way around each building, you don't want to miss anything. There is some pretty famous art work here, so make sure you visit these before the crowds get too big. Not only is the art work amazing but the grounds of the Getty are beautiful. Allow yourself plenty of time to explore.Having been to LA several times, it was only on my last visit that I came here and I wondered why it had taken me so long to visit. I was highly impressed with the way the centre is set out.There is so much to see, so make sure you have a coffee or lunch break. It could be a full day event, or at least several hours.",Ero40
50,Wonderful,"Highlight of our holiday.This is an incredible place, beautifully landscaped, tranquil and serene.We arrived early on a Sunday morning as it opened and took the monorail to the centre.The collection is phenomenal. Thrilled to have seen van Gogh’s Irises up so close.Would highly recommend a visit. Fantastic views across the city on a clear day too.",Sequel429
50,excellent,"If you're just okay with art museums, I suggest allowing two hours. If you love art museums, I suggest allowing four hours. We only had three hours in our schedule and didn't make it to the fourth of four buildings. The view of the surrounding city is spectacular.",Dale T
50,Sublime,"Outstanding architecture and museum what a gift to the city of Los Angeles from Getty. Efficient operation with parking and getting visitors up the hill to the museum. Well sign posted for people driving in their own vehicles off the freeway. Incredible, free to visit just parking to pay for.",Philip S
50,Great to visit,"Good visit, but too little time. Parking is 20 bucks, but the admission is free. Plan to leave before closing as the line for the tram down backs up quite a bit. And if you rideshare, you may have to wait a while.",EdRockster
50,Free and Educational,"You pay for parking only and to get in is free. There is a lot of things to see and probablyIn three hours you can see it all. There some educational things for kids too and sometime they offer free activities for children. Plenty to see with the art, statues, and ancient artifacts. Very educational and plus it’s free to get in. Highly recommend for families.",GENA2010
50,Loved it,"We loved the Getty! Just go, you can thank me later.One caveat: we were there on a windy November day - waiting for the tram, etc., got very cold and I usually do not feel the cold, so I wore only a long-sleeve shirt and hadn't brought a jacket. Brrr!The Getty is definitely worth visiting and you'll enjoy the tram ride, too.",JeannieTheCastigator
50,Must see,It is a bit isolated but worth the trip. Of the exhibits there now the European art was our favorite.,rawband
50,FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the most beautiful and well thought-out art centers I have visited. Allow several hours to visit. You can bring snacks and drinks to enjoy outside of the galleries. There is a parking fee for the garage. Free tram up to the center.,CaraNelly
50,A must visit while in Los Angeles,"Great place to visit alone, on a date of how I did.... with my family. Took my mom to visit the Getty Museum for mothers day and brought my sisters and their kids. Made memories, experienced amazing art and learned history all at the same time.",Gotta Have Karisma

40,A must see,I have been to many museums and this one ranks very high. The added benefit to the museum is that it is free and has an outdoor garden that must be seen. If you are in the area stop by for a visit you will not be disappointed.,MickeytheSorcerer
50,It's a Must See,I was in LA on business and had a day off so decided to use the LA Metro system to see the sights and decided on the Getty. It took awhile but with the help of Google maps I was able to navigate the buses and finally got there. It was very busy that Saturday but well worth the trip. I was able to see the exhibits I wanted to see.,YorktownVickie

50,Always makes for a nice visit,"Can't beat the entrance price of $0 except for the $10-20 parking you're subjected to down below. The grounds are just gorgeous every step of the way. Plenty of great photo opps here outside in the garden and grounds area. The interior includes several art galleries including exhibits about photography, painting, drawing and sculpture. It always flows nicely and there are plenty of staff to help ensure all are behaving. Be sure to leave time for a coffee in the cafe and to shop at the large museum store located off the main building - lots of fun/cool items to purchase.",MooshLA

40,The Building Itself is the Best Attraction,"The Getty Center building is stunning, and the physical museum is maybe the best part of the tour! We did the museum highlights free tour, which is offered several times per day. Make sure you pick up the pamphlet at the parking structure to see which free tours are offered that day. The collection skews towards European art, and is light on the Impressionists. The decorative arts exhibits were great!",Caroline B
50,Absolutely stunning,"I could’ve spent an entire day here! I’m not an LA native, so I had no idea how big the Getty Center was. It’s quite overwhelming. I waited in line for 15 mins before taking the tram up a giant hill, where you can literally see all of Los Angeles. Then you’ll see a bunch of buildings with different names or themes, like furniture, sculpture, etc. The exhibits are absolutely extraordinary, and the center is free! The only tricky part is leaving because when I left at 5:30, there was already a huge line for the tram and it’s really the only way out. So be prepared to wait in long lines for trams.",Jane Doe
50,"Very Nice, also the villa","We were there very early so not too crowded. Nice views outside, Nice art inside. The villa is further but you must to it",Smiling
50,Outstanding,"My wife and I spent 5 hours at The Getty yesterday. What a truly incredible place. It's almost unbelievable. The facility itself combined with the art, sculptures, exhibits make for a perfect day. We enjoyed a tour telling us about the creation of the building and grounds, had a excellent lunch in the restaurant and viewed much of the art. This is something most anyone more than 7 years of age would enjoy and appreciate.Be prepared for lots of walking. It is truly spectacular. Spend several hours because it's a massive place.",JR/Highlands

50,AMAZING Getty Center,"The Getty Center is absolutley amazing in it's setting way up on the mountain with 360 degree views of the mountains, the city and the ocean. It is free too except for parking. We took the 30 minute Life of J. Paul Getty tour as well while we were there. It was so interesting to learn more about him as a man and how important his collection of art is to the world. Don't miss this!",Jammin1985

50,My escape from LA,"Walking around the gardens, the galleries, and the courtyard, one would never know they were in Los Angeles. The whole Getty Center surrounds you with beautiful sights, sounds, textures, and gardens. It transports you to a tranquil space for your body and mind. The treasures here are of superb quality. One might visit this space many times and never visit the same place twice",concettah667

40,it's all interesting,"I went with friends. We enjoyed the architecture, views, displays, everything. This would be a wonderful place for anyone to see.",Flyer780991
50,Visit to the Getty,"One of the top must see places in LA. Superb architecture and wonderful art. You cab spend almost a whole day there. Watch if coming on Supulvador Drive the sign to the Getty is to the ""service entry"". They have scores of people a day make this mistake and have a sheet they hand you which take more than a 1/2 and hour to get to the right entry. The sign on the Freeway exit is the correct sign to the parking. A despicable mistake for such a prestigious institution. They sense no need to correct!!!",John H
50,A good surprise,"After some research we visit Getty that is not is typical LA visit spots. A terrible mistake. Getty is one of best spots in LA, mix and match, museum and architecture in same building paying just for parking, a bargain.You will find art, paintings and a great architecture. Bonus, outstanding views of LA and Santa Monica (better than Griffin)",Acivipam
40,The Getty Center Is Always A Treat,"I love the beauty of both Getty Museums. I was there for Britweek a few months back then went to see a special photo exhibition called Gordon Parks: The Flávio Story. What a treat to see photography as it originally was used to tell stories almost in a documentary style. This one came out of then Life Magazine after President John Kennedy announced the Alliance for Progress to help the impoverished in Latin America.To meet Flávio da Silva – the subject of Parks’ camera lens for many years was a treat and surprise. It has been over 50 years since he was brought here to be treated for asthma as a kid then returned home. For an hour it felt like history stood still and was suspended in time. You could see the young boy’s pain and joy etched into the older man’s lined and bespectacled face.You could feel his life and energy flow by ever so gently when he spoke and he came out of horrific living conditions. Da Silva’s story exemplified conditions then and he said they’re the same as he pointed out poverty is everywhere and America’s poverty was also on exhibit to round the tour off.With the Getty one never knows what special additions come with the exhibits. Sarah, who is my adopted daughter and I were thrilled to meet him as were the rest of the crowd.If you’re a local or visiting, go to the Getty and if you see both in a day you pay parking just once. The exhibits frequently change and you need time to get through all the place has to offer even having lunch and looking at the perfectly aligned langscape.",EMFredric
50,If you visit L.A. This free museum is a must-do!,"The catch is...if you come with a car, parking is as high as $20. during peak times in the morning. It gets less in the afternoon and evening.For L.A. residents who have not been to the Getty Museum, you need to go--especially if you have children. The view up there is fabulous, the art-work top-notch, docents, tours, everything you'd need to spend an entire day there.They also have a cafeteria, but I would recommend bringing your own picnic. They have nice lawn areas and shaded tables and chairs.",John S
40,Allow plenty of time,By the time we took the tram from the parking lot we arrived too late to see any exhibits. It was still worth it for the views from the tram and at the center. The architecture is beautiful against the clear blue sky. We didn't have to pay to park since we parked at the Getty Villa earlier that same day.,Joanne K
30,Interesting content in sterile presentations.,"The most impressive part of the Getty Center are the grounds and exterior of the buildings. The interior art, sculptures, drawings, and displays amount to one step up from what a glossy art book provides. My expectations were fed by the media and the Center's own hype. This is not a must see in LA. Buy the book.",Dan G
50,Superb,"The location, building and collections are absolutely superb. A must if you happen to be in the area. And the wait for security checks should not deter you.",DoJH
50,Amazing,"First, you are struck by the view getting better and better as you move uphill on the tram. Then you see see the magnificent architecture of the buildings and the lovely gardens. Finally, you have your choice of many types of art to view in this impressive collection. Parking is $20 ($15 after 3pm), but the Center admission is free. Worth a visit!",NewYorkT
50,Wait for a clear day - right after a rain.,"The views from the outside are as magnificent as the exhibits on the inside. Try to go on a clear day after it's rained. You can see for MILES. Reserve your parking place ahead of time, but the whole thing is FREE. Wheelchair-friendly, bad-knee friendly, lots of places to sit. The cafe is a nice break if you go for all day. Try to stay for sunset, too.",Peggy aka Granny
40,Amazing Campus,"The collection of the museum is good, but not great. However, the museum campus itself is an amazing piece of art. The experience being there is a little surreal. Definitely a must see.",Jim723
50,Absolutely amazing,"A visit to Getty has been on the to do list. But we were waiting on clear skies. Only to find out that Getty will take your breathe away no matter the weather. On arrival we took the tram and made our way to the cafe for lunch which was suprisingly amazing. I believe there was a meal option for every nationality. I had a tough time choosing. Meals were delicious and not expensive. But what I loved the most,is that the sitting area gave the feeling of dinning at a fine restaurant because of the location and breathe taking views. The Getty was simply more than just a museum. The layout of the buildings and the materials that were used are absolutely amazing. An extensive collection of art and beautiful gardens and fountains to complement. I love the fact that you can spend the entire day and do not get bored. The main attraction on this visit was the Book of beasts which was very informative. There are pieces from all over the planet. They do have occasional planned events,so do check before visiting. The introduction video is a must do,to get you up to speed with the campus and all it offers. Thanks to the hard work of the Getty foundation and all those involved. We really had an amazing time. I highly reccomend a visit to this gem in the clouds.",Harry2J
50,Great Experience!!!,The Getty Center had great art work ranging from religious works to great paintings. The view was great and the food cafe was better than expected. I paid $15 for parking and some money for food but the art experience was definitely worth it!,Kevin
50,Best thing? The view? The gardens? The art?,"You could come here everyday for a week and still not do the place justice. But besides the art, the views are so spectacular and the gardens are so wonderful, that those alone are worth the trip.",Murfcat
50,A Castle of Culture High Above The Freeways,"I LOVE the Getty!But WATCH OUT FOR THE PARKING LOT. The Getty can get very busy, and the parking lot experience can start the entire day on a bad note. The parking lot goes way down, level after level, deep into the earth. It's unpleasant for claustrophobics, and can take ages to find a spot. And they charge close to $20 bucks for torture!SIMPLY AVOID THE PARKING LOT as otherwise The Getty Center is FREE ADMISSION. It's easy to get there by BUS, Uber...any way to avoid that lot and you will have a much better day. Then take the free tram ride up the hill. And then at the end of the day, when everyone is LINING UP to take the tram back down the hill, simply WALK DOWN THE ROAD. Avoid the tram lines. Avoid the lot. And grab a bus home. (we use the GO METRO app on our phone for bus times.)There is a REALLY NICE VIEW RESTAURANT at the Getty, and a less expensive, food-on-a-tray cafe. Both are very good but PRICEY! So my wife and I prefer to picnic on the main lawn. We bring our food and beverages in a small backpack...immediately CHECK OUR PACK FOR FREE in the storage area to the left of the entrance by the restrooms. And then pick it up later when we want to dine.The upper level balconies outside the South Side of the main galleries are some of the best places to view sunset, and that's where we like to go.Overall, the Getty Center is GREAT...but I must say, I like the smaller Beach Villa even better on a sunny day, and a totally different sort of experience. See both!",John P
50,Great Tourist Attraction,"A very well organised art gallery, museum and gardens of the highest standard. Wonderful views. Very helpful staff.",jbphpsunnyholiday
50,Modern Day Palace of the Arts,"In the past the Industrial barons used their wealth to build great stately homes and palaces. Getty used his to create a palace of the arts. The first highlight is the incredible building, made from Travertine marble, glinting white in the sun. Great views of the LA basin from the many balconies. Then there are the gardens, full of flowers and succulents, contrasting with the geometric lines of The pavilions. Finally there are the collections themselves, with excellent Impressionist rooms - Manet, Monet, Cezanne, Renoir, etc. Two outstanding Turners and many other notable European pieces. If you never get the chance to visit Europe, the decorative art collections will give you a sense of the great houses there.There are good value eating options but bringing your own picnic seemed acceptable.Remarkably the whole centre is free and there are not even requests for donations. The car park is $20, but if you get a cab you even avoid this. There is a tram to the top, or a steep hot walk. Better to walk down.Expect to spend at least 4 hours visiting and do walk around as there are many attractive exterior features, such as courtyards with fountains.",SB01
50,Amazing!,"Indeed amazing that one person would build such a place, such a collection and then bequeath it to the world.The architecture, the gardens, the artworks together form this extensive centre.It is indeed a place to enjoy; allowing your senses to soak in the beauty.",Sheila C
40,Beautiful scenery,"Take the automated tram to go up to the center from the parking place, the alternative is a tiring up the slope 15 minute walk. The scenery is beautiful, the architecture of the buildings and gardens are interesting. The European art collection is nice, but if you have been to any of the famous museums in Europe you will not find this museum very interesting.",Ahmet Y
50,A wonderful experience!,"After living in Los Angeles off and on for years I finally made it to The Getty Center. Although the parking fee is $20 the entrance is free. What a wonderful venue! You can bring a picnic, there are lockers available and nice outdoor space with table. The Bauhaus exhibit was fascinating! I highly recommend!",Cynhoff
50,Beautiful Views,"Room after room of beautiful artwork, antique furniture and sculptures. The grounds are equally beautiful. The views are spectacular. This museum is definitely worth a visit. Be sure to get a map. They offer informational tours as well. I would’ve liked to hear the architecture one but I didn’t have time on this visit. Pack a lynch and eat on the beautiful veranda overlooking LA.",ghw1968
40,Not crowded at all,"Considering that this is the #1 place to visit, it's not crowded at all. There's no admission fee except for the parking fee. It even has a tram to go up to the center. The place is beautiful! The only negative thing I can think of is that it's a bit confusing inside. Lots of different buildings with different doors of entrance and exit. It can be difficult to track kids especially if they tend to wander off.",cyeson
50,Getty Center - always captivating,"If you love art, you can't miss this place. We've flown to LA once a year for the last few years to view special exhibitions, and it's always been worth the time and cost of the journey. The Book of the Beasts, about medieval bestiaries (animal encyclopedias), is an outstanding collection, and as always, the artifacts are presented within an explanatory context. The Center itself is beautiful architecture, and the collection is simply stunning. We took the docent tour of the exhibit--if you know something about the subject already, it's not worth your time.",ccdoerr
50,Lives Up to the Reputation,"This is a museum that actually exceeded my already lofty expectations. Very well designed, beautiful example of how amazing architecture and function meet. Collection is stunning, and the outdoor space was gorgeous. This is a must see location.",NightKoder
50,You remember the moment...,"when you get your first glimpse of the Grand Canyon. Venice. A piper in the heart of Edinburgh. Mount Fuji. I expected the art to be jaw dropping (and it was, especially the Pontormo exhibit, which we traveled from Cleveland to see). But as I was waiting with a crowd of tourists to take the trolley up the hillside, I was not anticipating to be so blown away by the museum itself....the buildings, the gardens, the vista....including the privacy one could find in the most stunning corner of this place on a day when there were many visitors. You must see it to believe it and it’s unforgettable. An American treasure. Go! Go soon!",CyAnCFalls
40,A beautiful day,We loved coming here.The parking is fabulous as they make it easy to park and ride the tram up to the center.Stunning views of LALovely gardens.A pleasant day out for sure.,MarinaH

50,Place for art & garden lovers,"It's the place for art and garden lovers.Right now, all the flowers in the garden area are blossoming and best time for enjoying the garden. They have good selection of renaissance arts. Also, I love simplisity of modern design and materials of the museum buildings. Love love love !!!The admission is free but you need to pay a parking fee.",Amazing Lucca
50,Great art,"We were in town for a family gathering and had Sunday free. We decided to check out The Getty and we’re so glad we did. The beasts exhibit was fantastic and we enjoyed the whole museum. We spent about 4 hours looking at everything and walking the garden. The whole campus is beautiful with amazing views of the LA hills. Can’t say enough good things about this place. If you are in the area and have some time, it is well worth checking out.",Brianbkool
50,The Getty Has It All,"The Getty has everything: incredible views of the LA basin, architecture, flora, art, and good food. One doesn't have to enjoy art to enjoy The Getty. Take someone on a date for lunch and the views. Instagram photo heaven.",Paul V
50,The Bestiary Exhibit is a MUST!!!!,"A couple of my friends and I took a trip to the Getty for a few hours. When I was on the plane for Los Angeles, the person sitting next to me swore by this place as somewhere to visit while I was here. I then saw banners for the bestiary exhibit going on for the summer and so I arranged a trip for my friends and I. No regrets!! The staff is so knowledgeable of the exhibits there and someone explained multiple pieces for my friend and I. Lots of extra little fun facts which was awesome. Also make sure you have a lot of time to do this activity. 3 hours only got us through 2 exhibits, so we are planning a second trip! Also the tram that takes you up the mountain is so cute (and a wonderful view).",Sam H
50,Impressive collection in an absolutely stunning location.,"The gorgeous Getty Center is a uniquely varied destination. There is the collection, which is clearly world class, the selection of painting alone is more than enough for an comprehensive education on Gothic through early twentieth century painting. The sighting of the Center is stunning, the view is constantly diverting and the gardens are delightful. Activity rooms for families with young children are liberally places around the center. For those with physical challenges, the grounds are very access friendly. I have often visited the Center as well as the nearby Getty Villa with it’s incredible collection of classical works of art from the great civilizations of the Greek and Roman era. These institutions are not to be missed.",Alan B
50,The Getty - Stunning and fun for all ages!,"Whether you're pushing a stroller and just want a quick view of a gallery and a casual lunch on the sprawling terrace, or have lots of time to take in several galleries and soak in all the beautiful surroundings and gardens, you will enjoy your time at the The Getty. I've been several times with family & friends, even in the rain (they provide umbrellas!) and have always had a wonderful day.There is a scenic tram that takes you from the parking area, through the hills to the Getty and exquisite sites to see of the surrounding areas once you reach the museum. bring your camera!",smreardon
40,Great for the gardens and the architecture,"Terrific art, but the real attraction is the building and setting itself. Worth the trip. Easy access once you make off the 405. So time it to avoid traffic.",Steven W

40,Impressive views and great restaurant,"We went to the Getty Center on a rainy day and didn’t help very much. The paintings are reasonably good but not what we were expecting.An special exhibition (Book of Beasts) was really amazing and done with a careful planning and unique books that were master pieces in their own way.We decided to have lunch and the restaurant was excellent from all points of view.The views of the city, from Malibu to Santa Monica and some parts of the Valley were very unique and beautiful.",Martha B

50,The museum entrance fee is free,"You must make reservations to the Getty Center in order to ride the private tram to the top of the hill.Wonderful artwork. It is worth taking the ""review"" or intro at the entrance of the museum, so you know what buildings or exhibits to pass. Per usual of any museum; too much art too see it all in 1 visit. Summer evenings they offer free concerts. It's so nice listing to music and being outside. Because the Getty center is on top of the hill sunsets are beautiful.",loridonahoo2@gmail.com
50,Awesome Sunset,Had an opportunity to visit the Getty and this was quite the magical place. I would recommend setting up your visit around the later afternoon so you can experience an amazing sunset.,Jasser M
50,Always an amazing treasure in Los Angeles,"The Getty is one of the premier museums in the US.Firstly, the beauty of the place is breathtaking. Secondly, the exhibits are always interesting, compelling and relevant. The location is optimal as it sit atop a hill that overlooks all of Los Angeles and depending how much of a marine layer there is, you can see all the way to the ocean. The gardens are beautiful. This is justifiably one of the best attractions in Los Angeles and a must see.A hidden gem is the Getty restaurant. It's simply gorgeous, food is delicious and service is impeccable. It's certainly not cheap and you must have reservations. However, if you want a special experience, you must have lunch or brunch there.",Mako159
50,"Top notch art, architecture and gardens","Fabulous art, exhibits, and grounds - the whole complex is one big piece of art, beautifully designed. There are open air patios and a garden to wander in so it is a delightful mix of indoor and outdoor spaces. This also makes it nice for children as they can run around in a safe contained area. Then of course the art exhibits themselves are stunning - I have never seen early Renaissance works in such pristine condition, with richly vibrant colors. Highest recommendation",BerkeleySaraJ
50,A must: Schedule half a day,"An absolutely tremendous experience: The grounds and buildings are set on a mountaintop with views across the valley. Inside the several joined buildings a treasure trove of art, mostly from Europe: Greek and Roman marble statues and reliefs, church iconography, paintings and drawings up through the Renaissance and 19th century Paris.",GregMasters
40,"A Visit to the Getty: Go for the temporary exhibitions; the architecture, and the landscaping.","The Getty Center, also called The Getty Art Museum, should not be confused with the Getty Villa in Malibu (a tourist mistake). Since we live in Los Angeles, we visit from time to time. This time we met friends there, specifically to see the current exhibit, ""Book of Beasts: The Beastiary in the Medieval World."" We loved the exhibition. We didn't take the time on this trip to visit the regular gallaries, or to check out the other exhibitions - another time. After going through the exhibition, we went to the cafeteria for lunch. While the cafeteria is cheaper then their regular restaurant, it is still wildly overpriced. The reason I gave it a rating of four instead of 5 is because the regular gallaries are that impressive, and the food is so expensive. But it is nice to stroll around the grounds, and enjoy an exhibit or two. Also, if you wish, you can bring your own picnic. Worth going as a couple or with friends. Young children may be bored.",Martin C
40,Huge museum,"It's a free museum but you have to pay a $20 parking fee. Then take a train to the museum. There are many, many areas to this museum. You could spend a whole day here and still not see everything. The view from here was great today as it was a pretty clear day. The gardens are beautiful. There is some pretty incredible art work to see. There is also some water features as well. The special exhibit was The Book of Beasts. History of dragons, unicorns, elephants etc. It was very interesting. There is also a cafe and snack bar if you get hungry or need a snack. We would definitely go again when visiting Los Angeles. (Christa)",davidjensen399
50,Amazing & Free - the best museum I have seen,"Having been to national museums in at least 30 countries and several art museums in the US, this one is special- Starting from the massive car parking building with direct monorail to museum entrance- the majestic location overlooking Los Angeles- the wonderful fresh air, scented with flowers and eucalyptus- the monumental but welcoming architecture of the various buildings- the free of charge admission!!!!!!!- and all those beautifully arranged classical masterpieces of European, Islamic and Chinese art.I wish I would be living nearby and not a 20 hours flight time away, I would go there every months",LifelongExpat
40,Pretty view,"We are a young couple visiting from Europe. We had a ""leisure"" day planned and decided to check out the Getty center. It is a very pretty view and pretty garden, but we quickly admitted to our selfs that the art and sculpture part just wasn't interesting for our taste. And it was a very cloudy day, but still pretty.",Nikolaj

50,A great place for art,The Center is very nice with a wide variety of exhibits for every taste. If you are visiting just a few hours - parking is $5 cheaper after 15.00 (we arrived at 14.50 and didn't know about it beforehand :) ). A great place to spend the day or part of it depending on how much you are into arts.,Maxim T
50,"Lovely museum, very interesting exhibits","I spent a number of hours at the museum. There were lots & lots of visitors but because of the museum's size, I didn't feel crowded in. The day was very overcast so I didn't get to enjoy the view but otherwise all was ok.",Deborah M
50,Best Museum in Southern California - Must see in LA,This has been one of my favorite places in Los Angeles for years and I have had the opportunity in the past to lead my students on a tour of this jewel of L.A. and was able to do so again this year. The looks on my students faces emulated that which I had when the place opened when I was around their age. I just wished we had had more time to visit and take everything in.Booking for school tours was easy and the phone staff had my information from when I was teaching a decade ago. They really made me feel welcomed and valued as an educator.,TD Henry

50,Hours of enjoyment,"From the displays and the garden I ended up spending around five-six hours here just wandering and enjoying what was laid out. The garden was by far my favorite part, grabbing a bench in the shade and just smelling all the blooms.

50,One of the top attractions in LA,"The Getty has everything: views, events, modern art, non-modern art, stunning architecture and a fun tram ride to the main building. All of that FOR FREE. Parking is paid, but it goes down to 15 dollars in the late afternoon. I was concerned about crowds on a Saturday afternoon, but everything went smooth. At least for my standards (attractions like this one elsewhere can be a lot more crowded).",JohnFromBrazil
40,Getty Center had an interesting exhibition on medieval book on Beasts.,The huge collection is formed by mainly European painters. So for European visitors not that surprising.,AB_Stb_OZ
30,Not my thing ....But....,This place is amazing to look at and the gardens are fantastic. It has this awesome train that takes you up the hill to the museum itself. I am NOT an art lover at all but my husband is and he was blown away by the art. I loved a coffee in the courtyard and browsed the gift shops.,Rita M
50,Great Place to Visit,"I'd read all the positive reviews about this place, so we took our adult kids and 11 year old niece along for the experience. There is no entry fee, simply parking for 15.00 USD/day. A very good deal. The grounds are very beautiful and well-kept, and the architecture is lovely. You can get to a lot of great views from the terraces in the buildings, especially if it's a sunny and clear day. We took one of the free tours, very interesting and not too long to get boring. After that, we explored on our own. At lunchtime we had a little snack outside, some coffee. The prices were high but not outrageous, good selection as well. A PB&J sandwich is quite cheap, along with a banana it makes a healthy and inexpensive little lunch. In hindsight, we could have brought a picnic up, the lawn and grass was very inviting. The staff was so very friendly, many volunteers. The bright architecture gave everything a modern and pleasant feeling. There were lots of drinking fountains, and the restrooms were modern and clean. After that, we drove to Hollywood to the Walk of Fame, it's not all too far and makes for a good day trip.5 stars, all thumbs up for the Getty!",HannaBGood
50,Amazing,"The Getty Center is one of my favorite spots in LA. It has a pretty good collection of art and artifacts, but one of the most amazing things about this place is the setting and the architecture. On top of a small mountain you can see 360 in all directions. On a sunny clear day is one of the most beautiful spots in LA. Best if you plan to relax there for a bit also rather than just rush through and see the art. Bring a blanket and a bottle of wine and relax on grass in the gardens and take in the scenery.",Michael B
50,Gardens are as spectacular as the museum,"When I have an afternoon and am working on a project that requires thinking and planning, I often head to the Getty. The outdoor area is so spectacular that sometimes I only make it in to see the Illuminated Manuscripts and maybe the Museum Store for a small present or a card.The sight lines are unique. It is obvious that the architect planned on you seeing a different view every 10 yards or so. Structures pop out and disappear. Plants are sometimes seen and sometimes hide. The main garden with a Japanese Garden feel of transitioning from the mountains to the shore. The cafe has very good food, but at some point treat yourself to a lunch or even dinner in the restaurant. Well worth the special occasion.",LonngevityMD
50,Superb Museum,"What a great surprise this visit was. Magnificent collection of great masters and different periods. The museology is perfect, because it makes the visit easy and well organized. Also the location and the architecture are breathtaking. Beautiful gardens, it’s a place to spend hours not not enjoying very fine art, but a moment of peace just laying on the gardens enjoying a good coffee. Is definitely a must.",FarAway36947550667

50,A Must-Visit!,"It's truly worthy to spend half a day at this amazing museum! Whether you are a fan of art or not, there are so many memorable art pieces collected here, it's a joy to the eyes!I appreciated that the Museum is free of charge, you only pay the parking if you get to stay for more than 3 hours (which sounds like the least amount of time to spend there. I think it was about 10 dollars?). The Museum is very well organized, each collection has its own area that you can go to following the free maps. In case of need, the staff is very kind and helpful.My personal favorite was the 18th-century room, where you get to see masterpieces from impressionists like Monet, Manet, and Degas, other than the super popular Irises by Van Gogh. Also, a painting from Picasso's ""classic era"" made my day!And the view from the terrace down to the city was truly breath-taking! (and I happened to go there on a rainy day!)",Lela

50,Art for everyone,"Friend of ours recommended that we must visit Paul Getty museum in Los Angeles. We were somewhat reluctant as we were on a short visit to LA and didn’t (honestly speaking) consider it to be a priority! How wrong we were!This is a MUST SEE museum, not just for Art aficionados. It’s location on top of a hill and the tram ride from parking arcade up the hill add to the charm. The audio commentary gadgets make it a breeze for visitors. One cannot see everything in a day, but whatever you can see will be worthwhile. Excellent collection by an individual!The restaurant sells wide choice of food and drinks and we quite enjoyed a vegan lunch there. I strongly recommend that one must include Paul Getty museum in their itinerary for LA and allocate a day to cover most of it. You won’t regret!",sai gopal k
50,Wonderful for the whole family,The museum was an incredible take for my entire family.

50,AMAZING ART MUSEUM!,"This is an amazing art museum and an absolutely magical place. The shuttle ride up the hill offers amazing views. The Getty is full of amazing treasures. Even the materials the museum is built from are fascinating. I went on a master class tour with Zhenya Gershman (also an amazing and accomplished artist) and she opened my eyes to so many ideas I never even considered when looking at works of art. Seriously - what a magical place. I loved it. If I lived closer, I would be there every day.",Francesca J
50,Everyone should go and visit,"The whole experience is awesome. Parking is dim the side of the hill and you take a tram up the hill to the beautiful Getty Museum and Gardens. Once there immediately go to the viewing room to get quick 12 minute overview of what you're about to visit.Then check to see when the Tory are running. There is a garden tool and an architectural tour. First time visitors should always take the architectural tour but the garden tour is the one I love the most. Once you've done with the tours make sure to visit the Getty cafeteria, great food there. And then the museum itself is filled with work from all over Europe and the Middle East. It's an experience you and your family will not forget.",Alain B

50,first visit to the Getty museum,I had heard so much about the Getty museum and was embarrassed to say I had never visited the museum living in Laguna Beach less than 60 miles away. not only did it not disappoint it far exceeded my expectations. this is an absolute must for anybody who is visiting Southern California,Cruiser260188

50,Go on a clear day! Spectacular View,"I love the Getty! Beautiful grounds, spectacular views, fantastic art, and even some great music on certain evenings. Great date day and solo is always fun too.",Colleen K
50,Wonderful day,"I live in LA and pass the Getty Center all the time, never really paying attention to the large compound on the hill (usually because I’m frustrated at traffic). One day when the hubs and I had the same day off, we decided to make a day of it and visit the museum. My mom lives close to Sepulveda in Sherman Oaks, so we parked there and walked to the bus stop near the corner of Ventura and Sepulveda where we picked up bus #734 ($3.50 each round trip. I had only been on the bus once before. It was great!) and were dropped off right at the Getty. We rode the tram up and proceeded to have a glorious day! The collections are beautiful and varied, so people who enjoy old masters and modern art alike have plenty to admire. The food is a bit pricey, but that’s to be expected. We went on a lovely day with flowers in bloom and perfect, clear weather affording us a view all the way to the sea. The gardens are beautiful and really give the experience a very tranquil quality. All the hustle and bustle down below seem to disappear when you’re up there. I definitely recommend a visit and hope to make it back soon.",ARC
50,The most inexpensive date for young people,"All of my kids have taken their dates to the Getty. The Center has many attractions, but it free. You can bring a picnic and look at the view or if you have the resources, eat at one of their good restaurants.",RamblingBusiness
50,Location and the Museum- Worth a Visit,"From the time you board the tram to go up the hill, the city views are very interesting.The Garden is so beautifully landscaped and the museum is always very interesting. Even if you are not a Museum person, I suggest you visit Getty Center- and enjoy the coffee in the cafe with the garden view.",R S
50,Fun Family Event,"This museum is like no other I have visited. From the tram that you take from the parking area to the lush gardens, this place has something for everyone.Make sure you stop at the desk to check out the self-guide audio headphones.",Sheryce H
50,Amazing Art Museum and Gardens,Went to the Center while on vacation to the West Coast. You pay $20 to park in a garage and then take a tram to the top of a hill overlooking the Los Angeles region. There is a great sense of arrival at something magnificent. The architecture is striking and beautiful and is indicative of things to come. There are five buildings housing amazing works of art including both permanent collections and short term exhibits. I highly recommend the photography museum. The gardens are exquisite. Designed as a sculptural work of art in and of themselves. The fact that this museum is free of charge other than parking is incredible you could spend a couple of hours or a couple of days taking it all in. There are restaurants on site if you need them.,Ken J
50,Great place to spend 2 hours or a day,"This is an excellent museum that is easily conquered you can see a great variety self touring in 2 hrs or spend the whole day if you like - great art, views, sculptures and Louis XIV collection you feel transported to Versailles! Must do!!!!!!",Myka S
50,"Outstanding European Art collection, impressive site and gardens.","This is the collection of mostly European art collected by a billionaire over the course of a lifetime, and now available to non-billionaires at no charge for admission. Parking is pricey, but city buses will get you to the entrance, and if you're Ubering - it's not an issue. The art is amazing, for sure. That said, it's also a quite a site for architecture, both in building and landscaping. On a clear day, the views are something, as nearly all of the LA basin is visible.",boscoflorio
50,A very nice and exciting experience,"This is a wonderful place to visit, free entrance, just pay the parking, many amazing paintings like Irises of Van Gogh, sculptures, art objects, they have guided tours, and very interesting exhibitions like the book of beasts.Marvellous gardens and a spectacular view of LA.The center has cafe's, restaurant etc, Many stairs but also many elevators for wheelchairs .We really enjoy the visit, it was our third visit here.",IRA_LELI98
50,Great for European art and FREE,"The museum specializes in European art from antiquity to the early twentieth century. Admission is free!!!! Unlike LACMA, it lacks non-Western art—at least, I didn’t see any—but the pieces are well-chosen and well-arranged. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting collections are particularly nice, especially for Neoclassical, Romantic, and Impressionist art. If visiting LA without a car, be aware that there is no Metro train station nearby, so there might be a LONG wait for the bus near the closest train station and then an inconvenient walk after exiting the bus, depending upon which map app you choose to believe. Taking a shared ride service for the last leg of the journey—from the Metro train station to the Museum—will save you a great deal of trouble.",IvanSusanin1613
50,Amazing,"I had never really heard of the Getty Center until I started looking at things to do in LA. It has a lot to offer. We took the free highlights tour and that really helps to orient you to the museum. There's so much there. It may sound boring, but make sure to see the furniture collection. They have a lot of beautiful French settings. We also got to see Van Gogh's Irises while we were there. It's so beautiful. The Center also offers great views of Beverly Hills and the Pacific Ocean. It took us about three hours and we did not see everything, but we saw a lot. We spent the morning at the Getty Villa, had lunch in Malibu and then drove over to the Getty Center. It was a nice way to spend the day. We planned our time so that we were having lunch around 11:30-11:45 and then got to the Getty Center by about 1:30 or so that we had enough time at both the Villa (10 a.m. ticket) and the Center. Also if going the same day to both places you pay the $15 parking charge at the Villa, show your receipt and then do not have to pay the $15 parking charge at the Getty Center. Both places are free to get in.",TW-44
50,State of the Art !,Just Wonderful ! So many things to see and enjoy at this well kept location. An architectural marvel in of itself. Famous paintings and sculptures are in the galleries but there are also special exhibitions on topics such as photography. If you tire of the interior then the gardens are stunning . Lots of areas to rest easy and just relax. Even the waterfall is a piece of art. This is not a place to rush so allow at least half a day to appreciate its treasures. Plus the view from the location of the LA area is very good. Parking was in a large multi storey lot at the base of the hill which gave you access to the train ride to the Getty Center. That was the only fee we paid.,lightfader
50,Ein wunderschöner Garten,"a beautiful garden, to spend moments with the family, a lot of plants and flowers, the pure area, I strongly recomend this place",Tobias G
50,Great museum,"It is wonderful that this beautiful museum is free. All you need to pay is the parking. The architecture is especially interesting. Be sure to watch the intro video when you come in. Usually the highlight is the temporary exhibition, though the impressioninsts are a favorite (see the Van Gogh Irises!)",cookpias
50,A must if you like art and architecture,"I had visited the Getty center many years ago but only was able to see the outside and enjoyed the architecture and the views, that alone is worth the visit. I think last time the museum part was closed or we were in a hurryI did not missed it this time and had a wonderful time as I visited the gallery where they have great European paintings. Had the pleasure of seeing some of my favorite Van Gogh paintings (the irises) and one of his self portraitsA place where I will return and see some of the other galleries",Ikemx
50,Beautiful museum,"The building and grounds are, alone, worth the trip. (If it's raining, don't bother; they appear to shut down the gardens.) The art is okay but other museums (e.g., The Huntington) offered better. But, the Getty is the whole package: architecture, gardens, art, easy access, train!).",YankBritKiwi
50,Nice place to wander round for a couple of hours,"If you're very much into your art then this is the place for you. We just wanted to visit for the history of the Getty family and to see it whilst we were on our trip round the USA. The parking is excellent, and not too expensive considering that is also your entry fee and includes the ride up to the top of the hill. The gardens are beautiful, and the views over LA are stunning. The cafe has a limited selection but is very good.",BirdMarshall
50,One day is not enough,Came here twice already. I am gonna have to come again to finish everything. There is a lot to see. Ask the guides for help on where to start. I like to go chronologically. Gardens are a sight you won’t forget.,Brandon Rullan

50,Go There!,"In my opinion, this is the best day you can spend in LA. After an undercover carpark for only $25 max, everything else is free! Te location and views of LA are superb, the architecture of the buildings is stunning, the gardens are magnificent, and the artworks in the collection are unbelievable. There are plenty of reasonably-priced food options there as well. Not to be missed.",BruceVMW
50,Quick trip to the Getty Center,"We visited the Getty Center as part of a get-acquainted family visit. The views were spectacular and the art collection stunning. It would take longer than we had that day to see it all, but since you only pay for parking and the rest is free, multiple visits would be affordable. We didn't know exactly what to expect, but were astounded by some of the things we saw. It rivals many of the museums we have visited in Europe.",MikeMcFeeters
50,"big museum, long way up a mountain","The museum is unique and unusual, with great exhibits and a lot of walking. The Gardens on each level and the views are amazing, but I find it tedious to take a tram to get to it, but perhaps I am old fashioned and prefer a user friendly easier access.",Shuggiplum
20,Not so much,"The buildings are stunning. The view is amazing. But that's not why we came.The collection was somewhat pitiful. It was a hodgepodge of a little of this and a little of that.On the flyer they advertise an impressionist collection, and the photograph they give is of a famous Van Gogh painting of irises. You get to the room and there are about 18 to 22 paintings. The van Gogh is the star on the wall. There were only two from Monet, one of the haystacks that's very common and one of the cathedrals at dawn. Neither are his best work but it was nice to see.In another salon you will find a few fantastic examples of marquetry done in the 18th century in France. A commode, a desk, a chest.... A couple of tables.... A big Regal bed.Similar to The Getty Villa, there was just a hodgepodge of this and that. There might have been five or six fantastic pieces in the whole place and a ton of mediocrity.Not quite a waste of time, but oh so disappointing given the millions poured into creating this place.",FamilyMan1963
50,An essential museum to visit every time you drive by on the 405!,"This is a world class setting and museum. Read online the exhibts and spend the day. Walk up the road, forget the tram, your steps in! I love this place more so than the Metropolitan Museum in NYC.",Gary E
40,Amazing place for eveyone,"This location is just amazing! Built high in the Los Angeles hills this museum and learning center offer something for everyone. Parking is $20 at a underground parking deck. From the parking, each guest is directed to a tram that takes you to the top of the hills to the front of the museum. There is no additional charge for touring this vast museum. There are multiple buildings with mulitple floors in each building. There is a free overview movie outlining the collections and the building of the facility. Many school groups tour the facility but are not intrusive due to the massive property and buildings. Come and enjoy, this is a gem and must see.",Jerseybob175
50,World class centre- well worth the visit,Spectacular position and architecture with some fun and interesting exhibitions. Well worth the effort and time to go there. You will need at least 3-4 hours,Cakesx2
50,Gorgeous Getty!!,"Well worth the trip up the 405 freeway to see this amazing collection of art. Although you do have to pay a parking fee of $20, it is worth and if you have two people going this is cheaper than seeing a movie. If you go after 3:00 pm it is only a $10 parking fee and you can still see plenty of the museum until closing at 5:00. Walking the incredible gardens in itself is worth the trip. This is a must if you have never been. The views of Santa Monica out to the ocean is also worth the trip.",B. Darst
50,Museum full of Delightful Treasures inside and out!,"Unique experience for us as we took the tram up the hill to the dazzling buildings and gardens of the Getty Center. Only superlatives would adequately describe the incredible view all the way to the ocean, the surrounding gardens and the myriad of art through the ages displayed in several modern buildings. Also one building had the re-creations of the Getty's art filled, rather ostentatious, abode.One day was not enough for me! Hope to return someday.While you pay for tram and parking, the museum is free! We dined in the cafe(cafeteria style), which is also a tad pricy, but lots of selections and good quality. There was also a restaurant and outdoor coffee, snack etc kiosk.",Travelers2013

30,Gardens were closed and free admission belies the $20 parking fee.,"Was truly expecting more. If you like furniture and decor and glass work, this is a great museum. If, like me, you prefer sculpture and paintings of things other than biblical scenes, there are better places in Greater LA. It is possible that I missed a painting series, as there was no clear flow from gallery to gallery. Was very disappointed that the gardens were closed.",porter_osborne
40,The Getty - an architectural masterpiece,"The Getty Centre is a campus where you find the Getty Museum, sculpture gardens and other art related programs and exhibitions in Los Angeles. Opening hours are 10am to 5.30pm daily with extended hours to 9pm in Saturdays. Note that the Centre is closed on Mondays.Note that entrance to the Centre is free. However, parking at the $20 per vehicle ($15 after 3pm). There is a tram you ride from the Getty parking garage to the Centre. This is an interesting aspect of your visit to the Getty.First and foremost, there is a world-class collection of fine art that can be viewed at the Getty Museum. The artworks were the personal holdings of the late J. Paul Getty which are on display here as well as at the Getty Villa. The collection includes pre-20th century European artworks by numerous Old Masters. You'll also find American and international artworks, photographs and numerous contemporary sculptures found within the museum buildings as well as outside in the gardens.In addition to viewing art, the various small gardens that are found with the Getty Centre are very attractive. Given the hillside location of the Getty, views of Los Angeles are outstanding as well.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Getty is its architecture. Uniquely created by American artist and architect, Richard Meier, the Getty buildings and gardens are modern and sleek in design. Constructed of 16,000 tons of beige-coloured travertine stone from Italy, the craftsmanship on display is superb. No doubting that the Getty is a masterpiece of late 20th century of architecture.Visitors will find expected gift shops, restaurant and cafes and a rotating serious of temporary exhibitions complementing the art and sculpture works on permanent display in the museum.Overall, we had a nice time at the Getty, spending 3.5 hours at the Centre. There is quite a bit to do/see here and we appreciated the modern, beautiful and accessible feel of the Getty, making it a good place to visit for art lovers and novices alike. We would gladly return to the Getty during future visits to LA.",BradJill
50,Amazing collection of art works.,"The Getty center is well worth a visit, but give yourself plenty of time. There is a wonderful collection of art works set in beautiful surroundings.",Frances P
40,Wonderful Museum that requires lots of time to see,"Unfortunately, we only had a morning to visit the Getty and that's not nearly enough. We went on the Garden Tour and, while interesting, it was very hard to hear the tour guide. She'd come to something she wanted to highlight and start talking before most of the tour group caught up to her. We left the tour because we wanted to see the Van Gogh and Monet paintings. They were spectacular. I think this is the kind of place you need to see over multiple visits. There's so much to see you just can't jam it all into a single visit. But, even if you don't have a lot of time, it's well worth the visit.",CraigPenney
50,Always a treat,Its great to live close to the Getty because sometimes I just go for the view. There are always world-class special exhibits. The gardens have wonderful aromas and ever changing flowers. This is a place you want to take a little at a time. It's not a one day event. Take one day for the French Decorative arts. Go another time for the photography. Take the audio tours of the paintings and definitely take the architectural tour. What a gift to the world. You pay for parking but the entrance to the site is free. Great place to visit rain or shine.,MDSTJ
50,Spend The Whole Day!,"There is so much to see at the Getty, and the tours are very interesting. We recently took the architectural tour and learned a lot! The grounds are beautiful, there are always new exhibitions, and the restaurant is excellent for lunch midway through your day.",Fearless730216
50,Wow!!,"We are visiting family in LA. The Getty Center exceeded our expectations. There is an amazing art collection. The architecture is breathtaking and the gardens are very special. The views of LA are wonderful. We took two tours, a) collection highlights and b) gardens. A great museum experience.",Robert G
20,Hard to get over the family background,"I found it difficult to enjoy a museum purchased by the Gettys. The artwork, grounds, etc., are incredible but the family history is sad, mean and lessens the appeal. Personally, that was always in the back of my mind as I viewed the museum and the experience was difficult to enjoy. Perhaps the Getty fortune would have been better spent funding mental health rather than art.",Suzanne G
50,One of the most wonderful cultural establishments on the world,"It's simply great: the museum, the galleries, the gardens!I've been there several times and I always discover something new and very attractive. It's not far from Westwood. You can also come there by bus and the small electric train brings you fom the parking place to the property.",Vladimir F
40,A lovely day's visit,"We went to the Getty on a Friday. It is large enough that you do not feel crowded. The setting is beautiful, on top of a mountain. You park below in a garage and take a tram up to the property. There are several art museum buildings that include works by masters, an upscale restaurant (reservations suggested) and more casual eating. The beautiful garden is worth walking through, and of course there is quite a view.",Nancy E
50,big museum,"If you have time to kill, visit the Getty Center on hills above LA near Beverly Hills. They have amazing architure and you can see the panoramic views of the coast LA. You have to take the tram from the parking lot going up to the museum. The admission is free but the parking is $15. What the heck right? lol! I guess that's reasonable enough since you'll enjoy the museum if you're into arts like me. It's an absolute must-see when visiting LA!",pinaynomad7
50,Getty museum,It is a museum you should not miss. Please plan a half day at least... If you are architecture and gardens lover spent a half day here. If you art lover plan a full day at this place. You should not leave LA without visiting Getty Center. Parking is $20 but admission is free.,Mikhail D
50,It is worthy of #1 of things to do in LA,"We didn’t allow sufficient time for our flying visit. The vibe is low key, the art & galleries are epic - the mono rail from parking is fun & you feel so remote from the city. Something for everyone with with fabulous installation garden - and every vista looking out over LA is a landscape paining in its own right. Loved it.",Caroline H

50,The Art Getty-away,"Great fortune bequeaths a legacy for others to enjoy. The Getty, the attraction`s signature name, has a lot of art treasures to be savored. Arrive at the complex, leave the vehicle at the underground parking, take the elevator to the upper level and wait a while for the funicular, like all other visitors, to be brought to the starting site. Behold then the entrance for exploration of the exhibition of the exquisite. A welcoming option is the GettyGuide, a mobile device lent for free which provides audio info for the aesthetic array. One part in the complex, called the Getty Villa, will be the repository of Roman, Greek and Etruscan antiquities. In another, the Getty Center will showcase the collection of European art and international photography. It`s a tantalizing assortment expressed in different formats: paintings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, drawings, furniture and decorative arts. Then again, moving through all of them is one smooth transition from one hall to the other. In an uphill location saturated with well-maintained landscaping, there`s a lot of roaming spaces in between buildings. One can spot the sprawling vista of Los Angeles from wide windows and balconies. So, the architecture becomes a source of appreciation as well. Public programs, in addition to guided tours, are regularly scheduled by way of performances, talks, workshops, film showings and conferences. For souvenirs and other items, there`s the Museum Gift Store. Likewise, delightful choices are available at the restaurant and garden terrace café. The entire complex very well caters to everyone, whether a solitary visitor or a family with members of varied ages. Entry being free renders this visit to the art center all the more priceless.",Adven-jude-rer
50,Beautiful architecture,"The architecture of the place, the relationship of the building to the landscape, and the gardens are exceptional and truly worth seeing.

The museum is wonderful and brings you so close to wonderful works of art from the masters from around the world - Renoir, Rembrandt, Turner, Da Vinci, Monet - the list goes on. It really is a fabulous collection. I also loved the displays of antique furniture and room displays from the 17th century. The gardens are beautiful. The architecture of the building outstanding. It is a place I will remember for a very long time! I'm sure the exhibits change so don't hesitate in seeing it for yourself.",an-old-pup
50,A little bit of Europe in LA,"This is a world class museum in a fabulous setting on a hilltop overlooking the ocean on one side, and the city of Los Angeles on the other. The ride up the hill in the trackless train with no driver is enough to astound the kiddos. The art is magnificent, the atmosphere is tranquil, and food and beverages are easily available for enjoying on the grounds. We have seen many great exhibits here. The tours are easy to join and very informative. Whether you have a few hours or a full day, this is a great place to visit.",KarmaDrama

40,"LA Highlight, one of the kind in the world.","It is the 2nd best art collection after LACMA in Los Angeles.

So pretty!",Yuna Z
50,NOT TO BE MISSED,"We had the most beautiful day at the Getty Center and highly recommend as a top attraction if you're in LA. We arrived by rental car, but there is public transportation. We took in a free guided tour of the gardens and the docent was so interesting and engaged. The museum offers sunbrellas to borrow for walking the grounds. the architecture is striking (all white italian travertine). There are several very manageable art wings, some impressionists, some photography - a very nice selection - as well as a scultpure garden. We had a phenomenal lunch in The Restaurant ($$$) with beautiful panoramic views of the LA hills. the food was really good and the service was excellent - the whole expereince was very swank. it's unfortunate that they don't have weddings there, because that would be really something. My husband and I brought our 17yr old and he enjoyed it as much as we did. If art and architecture and gardens are your thing, you will not be disappointed.",jhuvos

50,The Modern Centerpiece of Los Angeles Art Culture,This is L.A.'s Louvre-scale art museum. It's vast. Unseeable in one or two days. One could spend a whole day exploring the exterior spaces alone. The gardens are spectacular and have sweeping views of the city. Then there are the collections housed there. Arguably the biggest and most diverse in the hemisphere. On a par with New York's Met. If you go to . one art museum in L.A. it should be this one.,William S
50,An LA Highlight for Any Art Lover,"I'm ot sure what was more impressive, the architecture of the museum itself or the exhibits contained within ... not to mention the beautiful vistas of the city. There is plenty of great art from any of the classic periods. And best of all the museum, the self-guided headphones sets and the volunteer-led tours were free. he quantity of art may not compare in volume to the great museums of the world, but the overall experience was first class.",nrstycz
50,Everyone should visit,"We went here at the beginning of our trip to the states last year. It's a series of galleries, gardens and cafes. Definitely a must see if you enjoy any of those things. Everything about it is beautiful and it is very easy to spend a whole day there. We also visited at the end of our trip because we had a late flight back home. At the Getty Centre you can leave your luggage! It was a perfect solution when you don't have many choices. Great views of LA, great service and lots of guided tours.",Jacinta B
50,Wonderful place,"The experience started with enjoyable train ride on the top of the hill. Arriving on top we found a restaurant with an incredible view and good service.We started by visiting the gardens and then all the other buildings and it was peaceful, instructive and impressive.You can use audio guides (free as the entrance) and listen the story of every art work.One of the nicest art museums of California.",Mike1232013
50,Not just for art lovers,The Getty Center is a great destination for lovers of art ... but also for folks who want a scenic destination in the Los Angeles area. The exhibits are laid out in a simple and direct way that engage visitors of all ages. It is a great place!,HVwriter
40,Spectacular Building on a Spectacular Site,"The architecture is astounding, there are excellent tours available and admission is free. The $20 parking charge is relatively reasonable. The art collection is broad with paintings, sculptures and decorative art. The collection is somewhat limited compared to the larger North American museums but still well worth a visit.",Winnipeg1991
40,What's better than Free other than paying for parking.,"We had family visiting from Singapore so we stopped by Westwood to see our senior at UCLA and then headed for The Getty Center. Checked out the beautiful gardens, views and saw the collections. There are paintings, sculptures, tapestries etc. This is my second time and each time something else catches your attention, so I will be back again. There is a beautiful restaurant and also a more affordable cafeteria styled food court serving different cuisines. Lots of open spaces to just relax in the midst of the urban jungle of LA!",Jimmy
50,Attended wonderful free lecture on Leonardo and saw actual drawings,"The Getty always has wonderful exhibits that change several times each year. Admission is free, but parking fee was just raised to $20.",MelWacks
50,Great place to visit,Wonderful place to visit for all ages. I specifically loved the gardens. I took my mother and my aunt and they enjoyed it.,Myrna O
50,Exceeded My Expectations,"The grounds, architecture and art were simply amazing. Go early. I learned my lesson during a previous LA trip. If you don't go early, you run the risk of having to take a shuttle and basically wait in line for the shuttle. An LA must see.",Jillnthefort
50,Nice museum,"This is really very nice place to visit. One of most amazing Museums I ever visited. Everything you can see is nice. Outside and inside. You will spend very nice time. They are changing exhibitions. So, visit there whenever you have time and wish to enjoy a day.",Edgar K

50,Beautiful museum and art,"Great experience while arring via a tram. Museum is free, it's a bit on the side of LA but def go there! YOu can relax and there's a beautiful park-like garden.",timvdv
50,impressive,"The detail that goes into the gardens is impressive in of itself. Since the center is situated on a hill, it's ideal for taking in great views of the surrounding area (downtown LA to the ocean and points between). I'm not really an art aficionado; however, I am impressed by the creativity, time, and talent that goes into creating a work of art and the collections I saw here were beyond amazing! Regardless of whether art is your passion or if you simply enjoy seeing artwork for what it is, I would recommend taking the time to go here.",EmeraldCityGlobeTrtr
50,3rd Time Is Still Like the First,"I wrote a past review, moved away to NorCal and visited this treasure again when back in town. Still a gem. Beautiful. Thought provoking. Peaceful. Epic. Besides strolling along the striking outdoor common areas and opulent art, head to the stairways opposite the entrance. Climb to floor 4 (you can handle this!) and take in the breathtaking view of LA on a beautiful day. One of the best views in the city!",Dustin F
50,nice place to visit during LA trip,"Just paid parking, discount after 3PM. Great location and many art to enjoy. Nice view of Los Angeles is bonus",Sean K
50,Spectacular location,We spent about 4 hours here and did both the garden and the architecture tours and wandered around 2 of the exhibitions. You could easily spend a whole day and probably not see everything. The gardens are amazing and if you are lucky you might get to see the ducks. Highly recommended,Tracey F
50,Great Museum and Villa,We are so enthousiastic about this beautiful museumIt has an awesome collection of paintings.The free monorail is very convenient and well organized. Friendly staffThe Getty Villa is also great. Really worth while the effort.We had a gardentour which was included. Can't remember her name but she was a former librarian. It was very nice and interesting.,ECKRtravel
50,Great place to visit,Love the paintings and the ancient furnishings at the Getty along with the beautiful view of Los Angeles. The exhibit now is particularly wonderful filled with antique oil paintings,Vegan Traveler
40,Lovely grounds and buildings and views,So worth visiting. For some reason the exhibits were fine but nothing was super exciting to me. Just stunning grounds and views if the oat has burned off. A must visit. You park below and take a funicular up!,AuntTink
50,Beautiful gardens,We went for a couple of hours and really enjoyed the gardens. The gardens have so many different beautiful flowers. It’s provided the perfect back drop for amaxing pictures,kmq2000
50,Go for the gardens!!,"The best part were the views from a top and the gardens, they are beautiful and worth the visit.The museum itself was meh, we saw a couple of rooms and left, we didn’t care to see the rest. We spend easily 2.5 hours touring the exterior.Arrive early to avoid crowds, we left around 1pm and the place was packed.The tram ride is fun too!",jcisinthehouse
30,Beautiful exterior; underwhelming interior,"The Center itself from the outside looks stunning, as were the gardens and the views you were able to get of Los Angeles from atop the hill. The tram ride from bottom to top was short and the trams themselves were frequent enough. The actual artwork for me, was disappointing. Don’t get me wrong, there were some fascinating pieces in places but there was also ‘artwork’ such as ‘my favourite dirt roads’ and ‘Line I drew in the grass I’d walked on’. Not really awe inspiring for me. Also encountered the only impolite American here (a security guard on duty) which was a shame. If you are in LA for some time then I would recommend coming here, however, if you are short of time and looking to make the most of your trip, unless you are an art fanatic, I would personally avoid.",macas90

50,I love the Getty,"Every year we visit the Getty. 2019 did not disappoint. Tip - walk up, or down, at least one versus the monorail. A unique perspective of the facility and the hills of LA...",Jonathan S
50,Amazing TIME,Went on a Saturday after 3 because parking is cheaper. Admission is free which is a plus. There was a line going onto the tram but it moved fast. The museum itself housed so many different pieces of art ranging from Italian to Impressionism. Outside they have a little garden that makes beautiful pictures. Definitely will be back.,constancescalia
50,Amazing visit,"Nice garden and architecture is impressive.Art exhibits are good and there are also free tours at stipulated timing.Free entry but parking is $20, however there is a bus stop outside the Getty for those taking public transport. The Getty offers (free) tram service from the foot of the hill to the Getty centre.Definitely a must visit in LA",Explorer T
50,AWESOME. A MUST.,This is absolutely a must when visiting LA. Easy access by Uber or Lyft. A small train will take you from the entrance to the Center. No admission fees. Stunning architecture. Beautiful landscaping. Free tours for the architecture and for the gardens (several times a day). And a decent art collection.,Hexagone6x6
50,Just WOW!!,"If you love travertine, you'll love the Getty Centre. 1.2billion sq meters of the stuff. The art is pretty cool too.",Gregory H

50,Wow - A must for art and architecture lovers!,"The Getty made our visit list so we could see Van Gogh's Irises, but wow. I had no idea just how wonderful it would be. Free admission, just pay for parking. The tram up the hill to the center is great and I love the concept of parking below so there is a great entrance to the facility from an architectural aspect. The collection is incredibly diverse and spans ancient art to modern photography. Landscaping is lovely and creative. I would highly recommend a visit.",PNW2010
40,A nice place to visit.,Although i am not a great lover of old art the building itself is fantastic and has a lovely garden to enjoy too. I found the exhibitions good and the food from there restraunt was tasty yet on the expensive side...as to be expected.,travelingman9118
50,Spectacular,"Don’t miss this whether you go for the grounds, architecture and gardens or the art collection. Skip the crowded tram and walk.",Cassandra F
50,Beautiful Views,"We were told this was not to be missed and everyone was right. The grounds, the cluster of buildings and the view were all fantastic. We also enjoyed the exhibits, though the ones we saw were fairly small (this may be a plus given the enormity of the museum). We'd definitely go back to see more as the place is huge.",QuebecBound
50,Worth a visit,Really enjoyed our visit here. Very well organized and free of charge. Spectacular views and gardens. Having watched the Getty series recently it was all the more interesting seeing what he spent his lifetime and money on. Definitely worth a visit.,Marygirl2014
50,All day and free!,"For some reason I didn't realise just how large this place is. The architecture and gardens outside are amazing, and the free exhibitions on top are well worth the visit. The fact you can see all this for free is amazing.",Heather F
50,A Nice Free Place to Go,"This was a nice place to visit. There are gorgeous views of the city. We spent most of our time in the gardens, which are Beautiful!We went to the cafe, which is a little pricey. We spent $25 for a chicken breast sandwich, sweet potato fries, and a cookie, but the food was gooood!",Abby D
50,Awestruck,This is an amazing museum that you need hours to see it all in. Some paintings are ‘extremely old and then it has the newer art. i’ve Been to the Metropolitan Museum in NY several times and have still not seen all it has to offer.

50,A must see!,"We insist that all of our Los Angeles guests spend a day at the Getty. The range of art, the gorgeous grounds and the views never ceases to impress and inspire.

50,Magnificent Art High on a Hill in Los Angeles,"This is a very special museum. Not just one building filled with art. The buildings themselves are architectural art. Sculptures, paintings, bronzes... the whole array. The museum shop is filled with unique art objects from artists around the world. Take the tram up to the museum. It is nice ride and overlooks the city. Great views of LA from the plaza on top. Cafeteria was OK, but you need to eat if you spend the day.",Barry S
50,bucket list visit,The Getty is an amazing museum! The building and the view are almost better than the art work inside. we also had a great lunch at the restaurant.,annkahr
50,The grounds are as awesome as the collection,The great thing about the Getty museum is that it is free and always changing. A weekday is preferred as the crowds are less and you can get away from everyone trying to instagram their visit. The grounds are fantastic with come wonderful outdoor sculptures amid flowers and cactus beds.,sherry m
50,Great afternoon at the Getty,"I spent an afternoon at the Getty Center on March 31. The setting is stunning! We took the garden tour first, ate lunch in one of the many cafes, then took the architectural tour. Both docents were very knowledgeable. We viewed an interesting photography exhibit and a few galleries. Definitely worth a trip. The parking fee is $15, but all the tours and galleries are free.",Kathleen W
50,Must visit if in LA,"Wow, just wow. This place blew me away. Beautiful ground, buildings, exhibitions and breathtaking views. I’m super impressed by how well kept and managed the museum is. Admission is free whilst car parking costs 20usd, which to be honest is way less than what you would pay for admission fees for comparable museums elsewhere. Would love to come back again.",1A-globetrotter
50,Stunning surroundings,Really nice scenery and a beautiful garden. The museum itself has a great variety of arts and it is enjoyable with little children as well. Free audio guide is great and the free e try as well. The parking is 20 but its worth for this half day entertainment.,gjanzso

50,Beautiful museum,"Spent a week here with my husband, who was here on business. I took an uber to the Getty by myself one morning. What a great place to spend half a day. Absolutely wonderfully laid out displays in each building. Interesting grounds. The views from the decks outside of the buildings were incredible. Do not miss this place if you enjoy art, artifacts.",MrWagnerMilton
50,"Beautiful Grounds, Beautiful Views, Monumental Architecture, World-Class Exhibits","Even with visitors at max numbers, entry to the grounds was easy and orderly. You can get there by car, uber, and public transportation. A train gets you up to the mountaintop museum. There are multiple manicured gardens, fountains, tiered 360° balconies for viewing the expanse of LA (the Pacific north to south, the San Gabriel to the Santa Monica Mountains, downtown skyline to Westwood to Santa Monica. The architecture majestically uses gleaming marble and leads the eye upward. A great place to spend a whole morning or afternoon.",Mary R
50,One of my favorite places in LA!,"The Getty..Been so many times and keep coming back! They constantly have new collections and exhibits, there are so much to see and to learn- every time you'll pick up something new!

Don't miss it when you're in LA!",Ipopchenkova
50,Absolutely a must,"This is a place in Los Angeles that everyone visiting the city should make the time to enjoy. I have been up there several times. It is free admission, you only pay for parking. Make sure you call ahead of time because space is limited and you must have approval for parking ahead of time. A mono rail train will take you from the parking to the top. The place itself/the architecture is marvelous, the art and the way every thing is displayed is just stunning. The museum sits at the top of a gorgeous hill. It could be breezy and cool so make sure you take a light sweater. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Santa Monica, the Pacific Ocean and even Catalina Island.",63beatrizm2015

50,Creative view,"This was a long awaited dream come true and I want to go back to see the remainder of the exhibitions. One day was not enough and we focused on the West Wing and outdoor sculptures. While there is no entrance fee, all leaflets point out the $15 which in 2019 is #20. It seems that you can walk up to the center from the parking area (steep hill) or wait in the security line to take the free tram to the actual center. The views are breath taking and the art exquisite. Both restaurants were closed (we visited on a Tue) but their was a cart offering coffee and sandwiches. Prices are normal for a tourist attraction. We opted to eat elsewhere.",S B
50,Amazing amazing astounding art collections!,"We loved visiting the Getty, it is an exceptional space with a really incredible collection of art. It was wonderful to see some of the great works of art from some of the most famous painters. The gardens are beautiful too.",Heather T
50,The 'Spectacular' GETTY CENTER MUSEUM,"If you're a museum buff, art enthusiast or architecture geek --- then the GETTY CENTER in Los Angeles is a MUST for you to see! Like the Parthenon in Greece, the Getty Museum - (built of glistening travertine mined in Italy) stands high atop the Santa Monica mountains, overlooking Los Angeles - giving you a breathtaking view of the city! Once the tram winds it way up the side of the hill and drops you off, the museum offers several levels and 3-4 different buildings filled with impressive classic paintings, drawings, furniture, photography, sculpture. After you've gotten your fill of artwork, you can relax and wander through a beautiful maze garden outdoors filled with a variety of flowers, fountains & sculpture. Plan to spend a few hours here! AND if you dono't get your fill - you can always visit the GETTY VILLA art museum in Malibu, CA. - which is equally impressive with it's Roman Marble Architecture, hand-painted ceilings - reminiscent of a vast Italian Villa fit for an Emporer or God!",SamuelVeta
50,"Great place for exploring, catching views and seeing art","Recommended if you’re visiting LA. It’s kind of out there in it’s own, so give yourself plenty of travel time. Allow yourself the while day, too, so that you can walk around the beautiful grounds and catch the views, eat lunch in the restaurant and see some art. Well worth the visit.",Jonathan S
50,Magnificent!,"Can’t gush enough to do this place justice. Organized parking, lovely tram ride.Highly recommend being there at 9:30 when parking opens. Yes, parking is $20, but the museum is free, so a bargain overall.You just don’t know where to look or where to go first -it’s a feast!Went to tour gardens first while it was cool, the cactus garden was zen-like with views for miles. Great photo ops there.Central garden is an inspiration to all gardeners. The waterfall, the maze in the pool, and the walking garden all amazing. Outdoor sculptures caught our eyes as we wandered around.We concentrated on the Impressionists. This is a collection of paintings not to be outdone in any other Museum that I’ve ever been to except The Hermitage in St Petersburg or The Louvre in Paris.You could easily spend all day in just these few galleries.You cannot see everything in one day and do it all justice.",Dorothy M
50,Cultural center and visual joy,"Prominent location high on the Sepulveda Pass, overlooking the worlds busiest roadway. Magnificent gardens.

50,A Don't Miss destination for Los Angeles,"Beginning from the tram at the parking lot, up the side and views from the Santa Monica Mountains, to excellent architectural structure of the Getty Center, you will have a great experience. You will see many changing exhibits and open spaces and views throughout the buildings. Plan on spending about 3 hours. The grounds are well maintained and the employees are most helpful. You can eat at the restaurant or bring your own pick-nick.",Joshua K
50,Excellent!,"The Getty is absolutely amazing. Pace yourself. Definitely bring your own water, snacks and even sandwiches in a backpack. There are lots of places to sit on the grass and have a small picnic. Take a few of the tours and enjoy a PART of the Getty. There’s too much to see in one visit so prioritize your time well.",Marie R

40,Too much for one day,Well much more than we expected on arrival at the museum. The entrance is well signposted and excellent parking on arrival. A shuttle monorail takes you up the hillside to the museum where the main entrance contains a small theatre for a short introductory video presentation and helpful staff. We arrived just in time for a guided tour which was well worth joining. Lifts are available for access to the upper floors so accessible for all.We managed only two of the exhibitions with lunch in the main cafeteria in between; great choice of food on offer and reasonably priced.Walking around the site gives great views over LA and interesting gardens and architecture.Well worth the trip.,phil t
50,A Beautiful trip through time....,"Went to the Getty center and was amazed. Started by boarding a cable like car at the parking area, which takes you up the hill to the location, (about a 5 minute ride). once at the Center, there are numerous areas and buildings to visit, so obtaining a map is advisable especially if you're looking for something specifically. We just jumped in the first building we came to. Prints, pictures, fashion, and jewelry seen through the ages there... Next sculptures, metalworks, and such... onto paintings, portraits, landscapes, still life by the masters. Then out to have some wine and cheese at the outside cafe'. The gardens are even a living work of art here. Just a marvelous day of exploring and seeing great artworks up close and in detail. I never have been a tremendous follower of the arts, but this collection impressed me and made me want to learn more. One of the top highlights of my visit to LA. Be sure you give it a full day when you visit.",Russell T
50,The Tram is an interesting ride,"There are two Getty's, the Center and the Mansion. While admission is free you do pay for parking, but you can go from Mansion to Center in the same day and parking at 2nd place is free on the same day",Belgedoc1

40,Architectilicious!,This is an architectural marvel that has some decent art. Honestly I go here just to walk around and admire the views because the architects were incredibly thoughtful and it feel so dreamy to take it all in.,James Frost
50,Architecture and art,"Free museum but they charge 15 $ to park at the Getty Center, the parking is about a mile from the actual museum and from there you approach the museum via monorail. As the place is always crowed, I recommend going early and parking before opening, so you can arrive at the main entrance when they are opening the visit,It has 4 wings and if you can go around during the morning, you can head to Getty Villa in Malibu on the same day (be sure to stamp your ticket and ask for the Malibu Villa free tickets before leaving the Center). These two museums are only a few miles from one another,West Pavilion has Getty collection’s highlights, including Van Gogh, Manet, and Rembrandt paintings. Beautiful park, garden and exotic architecture building beautiful views of the Santa Monica and Los Angeles skylines",Norma F
50,Amazing,First let's start off with it's a free entry museum you only pay for parking ! I've came here serval times it's such an amazing museum! It has painting sculptures you can see the ocean depending what way you're looking or has an amazing little garden very good place to take pictures. They have a small family center where kids could make masks and play it would be better if they made that center a bit bigger due to the fact many schools take trips there. It's a very calm and relaxing place to be,Victoria Cruz
30,"Nice, but not a must-see","It's a decent collection and an interesting architectural venue, but I really did not love the museum. I found the collection on display rather haphazard with a lot of breadth but not really depth, and I really didn't think the museum itself was well laid out. It was interesting to wander around but not really a must-see destination.",vichy
50,Really a nice museum,"I guess I forgot who JP Getty was, but I still liked the museum, my husband loved the paintings as I did as well. It was a great thing to do on a rainy afternoon, I would go back.",rrwidow

50,A little something for everyone,"Pleasantly surprised that this was a multi-faceted experience for each person in our family (parents with a teen). Nice balance of indoor and outdoor experiences.The little tram ride transports you to a little getaway, making it feel special.Just note that the free one hour parking only gives you about 25-30 minutes on the grounds because of the time taken for (two-way) tram ride and navigating the parking lot. If you miss it by even a moment, bam, $15.",FunkyWanderer
50,Best to see in Malibu!,It is amazing how many of top interesting antique exhibites Getty collected during his activity at that field. There are also a lot of very beautifull antique jewerly.,pj856
50,Phenomenal!,"I'll start with the fact that I'm not an art expert. With that said, I was truly blown away by this museum. It was otherworldly! From the moment we boarded the tram and started climbing the mountain, I knew this would be quite an experience. The campus itself is breathtaking - beautiful gardens and architecture coupled with outstanding views of the city and the ocean. The volume and quality of the artwork was so impressive. You can spend days here.",stlmouse
50,More than a museum,"This Center has changing exhibits which is the best reason to visit as often as you can. The latest on Supreme Court Justice RBG is extremely well done, with professional AND personal life stories, pictures and displays. The membership fee is well worth it, as the newer exhibits are not only timely but thorough in coverage. I like to re-visit other areas within the Getty too, so always go early.The only downside is the travel and traffic to/from, since must stay minimum of 2-3 hours to see most/all. I've taken the bus once, but it too gets caught in the traffic that is LA. The Getty is worth it!!",MaryeeMH
50,"Museum Skeptics Go for the Art, The Architecture, The Landscaping, or The Views. Take the Tours","The Getty is a treasure that can impress and entertain even a museum skeptic like myself. I thoroughly enjoyed our 3/4 day visit to this beautiful, well-designed museum. The location is stunning with great views of the ocean and the city. The train ride from the parking garage up the hill to the museum was scenic and fun. I highly recommend the art, architecture, and horticulture tours as they are very informative and not too long. You will appreciate what you see so much more. They also allow you to break up your experience so you stay engaged and alert. The docents were all knowledgeable and friendly. The art collections were impressive and very well laid out. The gardens were beautiful, very well maintained, with not a weed or errant food wrapper in sight. The buildings were impressive and fit perfectly into the environment.",DT355
50,Architectural wonder.,"This hilltop museum is a testament to incredibly beautiful modern architecture. On a sunny day, the white buildings stand out against the LA hillside for a fantastic contrast of color and form.The gardens are so inviting, many people were all over the landscape,just enjoying the beauty.The exhibits are very good, but the buildings , with their many scenic viewpoints are outstanding.Went with some guests from out of town on the first nice weekend, and the food and beverage carts closed early , long lines still at 4pm, many wanting a little break.Other than that - truly spectacular!",Sharon S
50,Art & Nature at its best,What a wonderful space Getty created both indoors and outdoors. The views as you ascend and descend are magnificent all around. There are a variety of programs and exhibitions for all ages and interests. You need a full day to just wander around and take it all in.,Pathfinder608387
50,Who needs the lourve with this museum so close,"We are not art history buffs but have been to lourve in France. The European art and paintings and sculptures were impressive and audio recordings provided lots of history, we could spend ours listening to our free audio tour and explorering the museum which can save you a flight to France and experience similar feel. Docents were engaging and broke down art in easy digestible and understand able explanations even to 1st graders.",charles n
50,Weekend activity,"I had my first date at the Getty Center two years ago. The artwork is amazing , the grounds are breath taking... you must pay the Getty a visit.",donnawP6597FQ
50,A Must See,"My wife and I visited the Getty and brought along her mother who was visiting from England. Boy let me tell you, was she impressed. I think the Getty is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the LA area and to me is a must. We go several times a year and make a day of it. The architecture is sublime, and the collection of art, including the impressionist gallery absolutely inspiring.Sit near the gardens surrounded by limestone and sip a cappuccino while eating a delicious lunch, as you feast on a breathtaking view. Just being there makes me happy",Krystofer
50,Superb and free of charge,"WHen this museum first opened it always was free but you needed dated and timed parking reservations for $5 a pop. Those days are gone. It's still free and parking still is at a charge but no reservations needed, and there is a dedicated public transport, bicycle, and ride-sharing area. I was here on a Friday (March 15) when recent rains had cleared and the views from the snowy mountains to the channel islands were in perfect vision. I had been here before and just wondered around. This time I took the free hourly architectural as well as garden tours. SUch insight finding all about the intricancies of building such a facility in the usually 'NIMBY' attitude of Brentwood. One thing for sure, on a sunny day, and the white and off white limestone, SUNGLASSES ARE A MUST. My favorite building is always the second floor of the West building (the Impressionists), but they all are spectacular with pleanty of break time inbetween with a restaurant, cafe, and of course the gardens. For a completely full and free (except for food/drink) it is unbelievable. Great gift shop in the main entry and the West building. Even the tram ride from the hidden parking lot and back in enjoyable. For any visitor to LA this is a must, and for someone who lives here, you have got to be crazy not to experience this place over and over, the garden changes with the seasons.",James L
50,Best Art Gallery In LA,"This is a beautiful art gallery wrapped in gorgeous architecture. They have it all art, sculpture, gardens, architecture, and views. Best of all there isn’t an admission fee. Parking is $15 and if you park there you can park for free at the Malibu Getty museum on the same day for free. We took advantage of the free guided tours ow the art, architecture, and gardens. They also offer a free self guided tour of the facility using headphones. If you only have a few days in LA you have to make the Getty a must do attraction.",Kevin J

20,"Interesting Architecture, Great Views, but for non art lovers - Boring","I am at a loss how this is rated #1 on Trip Advisor. It is great architecture, the views are amazing, the art is interesting but if you are not an art lover its not that great. I felt that it was good for an hour or two but since I am not into art the buildings and view and trip up the tram were more interesting that the exhibits. The teens were quickly bored as well. No one was too impressed.",sedrake

The fine restaurant was EXTRAORDINARY!!! GREAT food and wine list - I had THE BEST meal with an amazing view too. Just loved every part of the experience.",wineing
50,Spectacular Inside and Out,"Although the Getty could be visited in any type of weather, going on a beautiful day certainly enhances the experience. The vistas, from the tram and from the Getty’s many plazas and buildings, are just gorgeous.

40,Museum and grounds,"The Getty Center has a very large and diverse collection of art from different places and times, very impressive for a private collection. Even if you are not much into museums I think it is worth the visit for the building itself. You can really enjoy the views and landscape.Entrance is free, and parking is 15$. If you are also planning to visit the Getty Villa, you can do it on the same day paying parking only once.",Julia N

50,Schedule at least a half-day when the sun is out,"We had a rainy day and were unable to thoroughly enjoy the landscaping, with which the caretakers groomed for pictures and enjoyment. So you want at least an hour to enjoy the outdoor sculptures, architecture of the buildings, and the landscaping.The exhibits were enjoyable and they offered free touring audio headsets. You need time to use them to their fullest, but you'll miss the majority of why they are part of the holdings.Be sure to take at least one scheduled tour. We took the ""Monuments"" tour and the research assistant-docent was excellent. He really knew his stuff and took on challenging questions. You don't want to miss out on such expertise available for free.",DktrO
50,Art with a View,"The Getty Center is a world-class Art Museum located in a beautiful setting atop the hills in west L.A.

50,An LA Treasure!,"Between the views and the collection, the Getty is not to be missed. You do have to leave yourself plenty of time especially on a temperate day - the wait for the tram to go up (the ride itself is actually kind of great) and back down can be long. Give yourself at least 4 hours total. Maybe you'll take less but if you try to cram this into a 2 hour slot of your day you're going to be running around like crazy not having a good time.You can go for just the views and the grounds and not spend any time with the art collection and have a nice time. You can go just for the art collection and have a nice time. I can't recommend it enough.",Steve M
50,Great experience,"It’s a place ti visit. As soon as you get in the monorail you start enjoying the views and then the buildings and construction of it all is impressive. Also, it’s worth strolling through the gardens, which are beautifully landacaped and have various sculptures. It’s an opportunity to learn about art, although some are copies. It’s a great experience",Monsy G
50,Beautiful Art and stunning arcitexture,"This place was absolutely stunning. The building itself sits on the top of a hill, and we were absolutely stunning by the beauty of the inside.

50,What a wonderful museum,"We only had a few hours to spare but that was enough to remind us what a fabulous museum this is. We had enough time to take in a quick spotlight tour with a docent, looking at a painting by Pontormo, the first tome the Itians have allowed it out of Italy! Wonderful!. And then we had time to see a couple of the special exhibitions. This is one of the world’s great museums of art.",Wardieeee
50,Great museum,"We visited the Getty museum early, when it just opened so we had no problem finding parking (15$ parking fee) and the museum was fairly quite. There is no entrance fee.By the time we left, about 3 hours later, it was quite busy with school kids and other visitors .The tram ride from the parking lot to the museum is a treat by itself. The view from the tram and from the museum gardens is breath taking.Great art collection to enjoy all over .",Dr_Iris_B
50,A definite must visit,My wife and I were in LA for a few days and wanted to see the highlights and had heard about the museum and were totally blown away by the exhibits. I have been to a number of art museums and have usually come away a little bored.not this place. They did a marvelous job of describing the exhibits. That really helped and enhanced the enjoyment. The campus is large so it never felt overcrowded. The fact that the admission was free was unexpected given the quality of the museum. I would definitely recommend a visit.,Ebojoe

50,As good as it gets,"Yes! The Getty lived up to its reputation from our perspective, with a great selection of art, sculpture and interesting exhibits. As a specifically designed facility it sits proudly on the edge of one of the many ridges in the LA region. The building design and accompanying gardens provides a preface setting for what is on offer",mwhzzi
50,Mass Effect 1,"It reminds me A LOT the Citadel designed in Mass Effect 1, very minimalist, white, with curves. If you are a particular fan of the first game and intend to visit L.A., I suggest you to go to The Getty Center (do not confuse with The Getty Villa at Pacific Palisades, that has more of a God of War atmosphere). I recommend you as well to sightsee DTLA and after going back home, playing L.A. Noire to try to see the street you saw in real life portrayed in the game.",Marcos Davi
50,3 hours isn't enough!,"The Getty is an awe -inspiring malgamoth of galleries/garden's with a good cafe serving practically anything you could want to top it off.There is so much to see from the beautiful medieval galleries to photography which I missed to French Louis the something bed's to rembrandts and a delightful section on books.There also quite photogenic views surrounding the garden. Ensure you catch the monorail going up or it's a long hike to the top!Side note: It seems LA is excellent for galleries. I wasn't very impressed with Hollywood itself, by the Chinese Theater but it's worth a quick look just to take a picture of your favourite entertainer/actor/ musician. Otherwise head to santa monica you won't regret it.",andyb8176
50,Wonderful,This is a super place to visit so much to see and so well laid out. The buildings are light and bright the grounds peaceful to walk or sit in. the contents of the collection are magnificent. We only spent an afternoon here but it could take many visits to see and appreciate all the collection.,libby990
40,Excellent except for the tram,"A late Saturday afternnon visit in winter. Round and round the underground car park, deeper and deeper, until finally getting a space.Not the place for claustrophobics.The tram to and from the car park to the museum appears to be a bottleneck in the operations. Trams run every fifteen minuted and were dispatched far from full capacity. This resulted in a 45 minute wait to use the tram up to the museum. This resulted in us deciding to walk rather than wait. It's a 3/4 mile uphill walk that took about 20 minutes. We were not expecting to walk. It was not the best introduction to the museum given we were also not intending to stay that long.We came mainly to visit the exterior gardens rather than the interior exhibits as we had evening plans. The views of Los Angeles were great. The gardens were well landscaped but nothing had any particular wow factor. There was then a quick detour to see the Iris painting before we had to leave.The tram to go down had in excess of 30 minute wait so it was another walk, at least it was easier going downhill.",clifton123
30,"For those that like historical paintings, statues, books and furniture",A beautiful place with lots of things to see. Nice view over LA also. But if the history of all things is not something you like regularly then this will be a nice walk through the buildings only. The artifacts is nice and beautiful but this was not the place for me and my brother. But as I said. A must for those who like these things more.,Janne

50,Overwhelmingly Beautiful!,"This is probably one of my favorite museums in the US. There is no ticket charge but it costs $15 to park. There is a tram that takes you from the parking garage to the museum compound, high on a hill with spectacular views stretching from downtown LA in the far distance to the Pacific Ocean. There are several buildings divvied up by periods of art so you easily determine where to go, based on your interests. Scheduled guided tours are free as well. The restaurant has good service, great views and good food as well.",maryel998

50,A must see in LA,Mightily impressed by The Getty Center from the architecture to the gardens and of course the exhibits. The center occupies a prom8nent position in the hills affording great views of LA. Take advantage of one or more tours conducted by volunteers and count on spending a minimum of three hours here.,Roger F
50,Worth the day visit,"My Aunt lives in LA and had never been to the Getty or the villa. As I was visiting she decided it was our time to visit, if driving from LA, the museum is a short trip off the motorway. You are charged per car which is $15.00Parking up is straight forward, once you exit the park follow the signs to the tram which is free up to the museum. Sit back and marvel at the views of the highway as you soar up the hillside in the driverless train.A short walk up the steps takes you to the foyer where information is held for all exhibits. As time was a constrain for us, we decided we wanted to see the masters. The museum holds a good selection of the european masters such as Gaughin, Van Goghs waterlillies. Earlier artists such as Turner and Constable, worth the walk around.We visited the cafe onsite which in my view is grossly overpriced, take note, you don't actually make savings by purchasing drinks in the courtyard. My advise pack a picnic if you are able to. Plenty of seating outside.Once we had walked around, we decided it was time to head to the Getty Villa of Pacific Coast Highway. A drive of around half an hour took us there. Before you head off though, go to the office near the tram and have your parking endorsed. Saves you paying for parking at the Villa. We were also told you usually have to book tickets to the Villa in advance, however were given tickets which we didn't even need to show when we arrived.Just a hint if you do have to pay for parking, after 3pm the cost drops to $10 per vehicle. We presented our endorsed parking ticket and headed toward the carpark.Once you arrive at the carpark it's a short walk toward the ampitheatre and the Villa itself. Here you really do see the obsession Getty had with the afterlife, Instead of the artwork, here you mostly see Greek and Roman mythology and beautifully landscaped pool and garden. So worth a visit and my aunt and her friend also marvelled at how much they enjoyed their day. So worth the visit.",matu64

50,A must during every visit to LA!,"We're long-time supporters of the arts, so anytime there's a world-class museum and arts establishment like The Getty Museum that offers FREE admission and access to the arts, we are so there. I love the gallery layout of the museum and pavilions, with paintings on the second floor and 'things' on the first floor; the scope of artwork and history represented is marvelous. Every single security guard and staff member I talked with was happy in their job, which I find very telling. The gardens are lovely, the views breathtaking, and the fee, again, radical.",the_3_adventurers

Please check the website for the schedule and for special exhibitions. They also have special programs for kids. The views from the Getty are truly gorgeous of the LA basin and on a clear day they are stunning. There is a nice cafe to get a bite to eat and there is also a fancy restaurant that requires reservations. You should not miss the Getty if you are visiting LA!!,danielle m
50,Just go for the view!,"I don’t know a thing about art. To me, art is like wine. You either like it or you don’t - and it doesn’t matter how much it costs :)The Getty Center is spectacular. It houses some of the most precious pieces of art in the world. This you expect. But if you’re on the edge about going or not - as an Angeleno - I would tell you to pick a sunny day and go for the view!!! The view is stunning. One of the most beautiful views in Los Angeles!! You can relax outside on the grass. Have a bite to eat and drink and enjoy the sprawling City of Angels from an amazing location. Go. It’s worth it. Even if you don’t know a thing about art :)",Dilhan Suraweera
50,Wonderful museum containing art of high quality from many periods.,This is a must do in LA for anyone with taste. The collection of impressionist work is outstanding. The exhibits are unique and well presented. The grounds are lovely with carefully designed gardens. A great 1/2 day attraction.,David C
50,Quick trip,"If you spend less than an hour there, you don’t pay for parking. We arrived just before opening time, caught the tram up, looked at the architecture and views and were out again within the hour.

50,Wonderful art in a fabulous setting,"My husband and I have visited many art museums in Europe and the United States, but were blown away by the art, architecture, and outdoor setting. Typically in museums, you enter through one or two doors and spend the rest of the time inside a building or possibly a courtyard. The Getty has multiple buildings connected by plazas, walkways, stairs, and gardens that all compliment each other. We expected to spend about three there and had to leave. We came back a few days later and spent a whole day there -- and we could have spent another day there and probably still had things we didn't see. We took the Garden tour and it was excellent.",TravelLightDot

50,Starry night,Going to Griffith Observatory is a must-do whether you're native to California or you're visiting Aunt has to be on your to-do list! I've been so many times I can't count I went recently it had been remodeled and there are so many interactive features their shows in the auditorium and it's just so informative on every astrological and Celestial event currently and in history. Movement of the earth what season we're in what Equinox with moon phases are you name it they explain it. There's also a large section that contains specimens of each element and gas and mineral on the periodic table which is helpful to me because I'm a jeweler and I specialize and minerals crystals fossils stones and elements. I can be found on Google by typing in periodic gemz and there you will see me. But have fun in Griffith Park it is so worth it no charge to get in very small fee to watch the shows!,Periodicgemz
50,Absolutely beautiful place to visit,"If you have a few hours to visit this place, it is gorgeous with great view of L.A. Parking is at the bottom of the hill. They have tram to take you up to the museum. All free of charge. Very gracious donation. It can be windy up there so bring a light jacket. Children did not enjoy it as much as the adults.",made2worship

50,Truly Memorable Expereince,"We had heard the Getty was great, but feel so fortunate to have experienced it ourselves. Parking was easy and good signage got us to the tram that took us the gradual incline with nice views before delivering us to the entrance. We went on a Sunday morning and were glad we got there when it opened at 10 a.m. (When we left at 1 p.m., the lines were significant!) We actually spent the first 20 minutes of our visit walking around the grounds and taking pictures of the incredible architecture and breathtaking views. It was nice to get oriented with the very well done 12 minute video to really take in the magnitude of what all is here. The exhibits were all very interesting and easy to navigate. We didn’t choose to do the audio tour, but several people were using the devices. On our way out, we found ourselves spending another 20 minutes or so exploring the incredible garden sculpture, which is an exhibit all by itself. I imagine the place has several other incredible gems that we didn’t even see in our three hours.

50,Massive collection!,"Free entrance, beautiful views, nice crowd, the beautiful place itself with plenty of masterpieces to see. Highly recommended if you love art and sculptures!",Cameron James
50,The Best collection anywhere!,"We have been to the Getty and loved it. Even the building is a beautiful thing. The Marble is from Europe and is used throughout the Getty. The art is wonderful, and different from the other Getty in Santa Monica. The Art here is newer and is kept up to date. The grounds are a sight to see and worth an afternoon on a pretty day in Los Angeles.",Bill Curran
40,"A great indoor activity. Massive art collection, stunning views.","This place is a must-visit if you like art. The collection is massive, and spread out over several buildings. We had horrible weather the day we visited, and this was the perfect indoor activity to indulge in while the storm blew over. The sights from the various terraces and viewing points are gorgeous, and you'll find yourself taking more photos than you need.",Dhruv Shanker
50,Purpose of your visit?,"My wife and I live in Los Angeles and visit the Getty, in Brentwood, quite frequently .. sometimes to see a special exhibition .. sometimes to have lunch in the excellent restaurant .. sometimes to show friends and family, who are new to Los Angeles, the glorious architecture housing its permanent collection .. the exquisite gardens, which on the right day, are dazzling .. and did I forget to mention the views? .. they are spectacular .. the Getty Center is a special place .. if you are in the mood for art (and love in a warm climate) .. pay a visit",ajmrussell
50,So beautiful. As beautiful outside as in !!,"This was the second highlight of our brief trip to LA. The Lyft driver was routed on Sunset Strip and we ran into UCLA b-ball game traffic ! Still , you could see such big beautiful homes and it was not a terrible wait at all. Got to The Getty around 5p so we had enough time to see the sunset over the Pacific and catch about an hour and a half of the art exhibits before our dinner reservations there.Had a mediocre dinner (reviewed elsewhere ) at least for me. Most every California restaurant I have been to has been gluten savvy and delicious. Not so here. The scallop and mussels “ stew” was watery and tasted of Miso. Not advertised that way ! The waiter could have cared less about not being able to eat it. Oh well. I’m getting sidetracked from the beauty of The Getty. The architecture is stunning. There are no bad views anywhere. None. Art works are world class. Will definitely return. Word to the wise. On site parking is $$$ if you can get it but the Lyft/ Uber works well. They drop you off and you ride an elevated train to the museum.",Celticcutie
50,Wonderful art museum + beautiful views of West LA,"Getting to the Getty is a fun experience itself - you park underground and get to the top on their monorail. At the top, the views are spectacular, as is the Getty's collection of art. Skews a bit classical perhaps (versus modern) but there are usually an eclectic mix of exhibitions including art, sculpture, photography, cultural artifacts, and more.",John H
50,Gorgeous views,"First time at the Getty even though I live in LA and boy was I missing out. First of all, I went on a Saturday so expected alot of people and was right. There was a long line of cars to enter the parking garage. First hour was free or $15 for the day. There are several levels with helpful digital signs to indicate how many parking spaces are available. Even with all this parking is a pain, suggest rideshare as an option. After parking take elevator to the tram area. Line looked very long wrapping around but actually went by very quickly. It’s a quick ride up to the Getty with space for folks to sit and stand.Once you walk up the large stairs to the Getty, admission is free and you’re free to take a tour and walk around yourself. Such beautiful art, gorgeous views and so much to do see. It’s a great place to sit, relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of LA. So much to see in one day so it’s great that there is no admission fee so it’s easy to return.I decided to walk back to the parking garage. It’s a nice downhill walk but it’s an uphill hike if walking up to the Getty.Definitely going back but probably on a weekday.",Katherine P
50,One day In LA The Getty center,"I had one day of transit in LA and I decided to visit The Getty center. Free entrance, beautiful views, nice crowd , gorgeous place itself with plenty of masterpieces to see. Recommended if you have time to kill or spend a day with great paintings and sculptures.",Olga G
50,visit,decided to visit today (friday) as unusually it was raining in LA. It's a fantastic museum with so much to see. This was my second visit so I made sure to see things I'd missed the first time last year. I took an uber and it was very easy to get there and also the Ubers were allowed into the underground parking so we didn't need to stand in the rain - very considerate.,446anjums
20,Most staff helpful & friendly except for one,"Definitely go for the lovely views of the city and shoreline. The introductory film was short and perfect. There are three or four buildings all connected with multiple floors. It was a grey day with showers and the outside garden was closed due to weather. There were many field trips with groups of children of all ages. Throughout the museum there were small group talks with the children which were very entertaining. The staff really enjoyed working with children, placing them close and practically touching lots of the art to discuss composition, impressions, and meaning.Our unfortunate incident with staff happened while walking through the South building on the third floor. There are security and staff posted at each small room. It was during our second pass through the same room as we were trying to navigate our way out of the South building to end our visit that a guard reprimanded the male in our party for walking too close to a painting hung on the wall. It really was his demeaning tone in his voice that resonated with our entire visit. Perhaps if this was truly a problem a rope or rail would be the way to go. But....then we realized that we were wearing a Redsox jacket.I guess some in LA cant get past Boston beating them in the World Series and the Super Bowl within four months. So here’s a tip if you are visiting LA in the next few months of 2019 - bring your Redsox and Patriots championship gear snd proudly wear it throughout LA. There’s a lot of wounded LA fans who need some desensitization. Just trying to help them.",Big Red of Boston
50,Peaceful,The Getty always offers breathtaking views and extraordinary art. I like that there is a vendor for food or an area to picnic. You can spend a few hours doing into every exhibit looking at the vast artifacts and art. I thing the Getty is a must see whether you are visiting or live in Southern California.,FavoredbytheKing
40,Chillax’d,"Great place to exercise (several steps) as well as relax w a book/WiFi on a lawn in addition to art appreciation. Coffee and dining options satisfying, can even get wine there. A great day trip /meetup w friends, family, entertaining out of towners, date day for couples.",Aileen A
40,Stunning views,"We took a metro rail and then a bus to the base of the train up to the top of the Getty. Those with more stamina would have enjoyed a walk up. The views of the coast from the Center were glorious, and the cactus gardens on the roof of a building below made a nice abstract. The artwork not as good as the building, one of those collections where it seemed more about quantity than quality, and the cafe was really not very good, however the trip up and the views make this a pleasant outing.",VancouverViolet

50,What a Gift to SoCal!,"Just had family in from Boston. They wanted to take in the Getty Center and LACMA while they were here. You just can’t beat the views at the Getty Center. Also we were able to take in a couple of really great exhibits. Usually I drive over since I live in the Corridor, but decided to UBER over. Brilliant! They have a perfectly situated drop-off and pick-up for UBER, LIFT, taxi, etc.",psicokitty
50,Wonderful experience!!,"This is an amazing place with all kinds of things to do either solo, with friends, or family with small kids. The architecture, gardens, art, and food court are all fun to visit. It's hard to get to everything in one day, and well worth the trip.",gr8fish2017
40,Beautiful and lovely setting.,"And it's all for free! Well, a modest, for LA, $15 parking charge. Everything here, from parking, headphone guides, tours and the art are first rate. But the place lacks the charm of the Norton Simon, a real class act. Relatively small galleries (compared to palaces like the Met) try to add some intimacy, but the throngs interfere. Hoards of pushy noisy Asians remind one of being in the large artistic venues in Paris that are overrun with rude Asian tourists. Not being ethnocentric, just a fact.Cafe well done with a huge (for a museum) selection of fresh and previously prepared lunch options and it's hard to beat dining al fresco with the Pacific Ocean and LA as your backdrop.Overall, the hillside setting overwhelms the art. Small but representative Impressionism collection. Large Dutch representation. Nice introduction to Southwest Art.One nit: the headset introductory tour could be much better organised. Literally, make it step by step and simple, i.e.- ""Enter the North building and turn to your left going into room 101. Here you will see stained glass from the 16th Century. Stand in front of number 101 and push the play button"". And so on.But from parking, tram ride up the hill, greeting, ease of access, dining and exiting via pre paid parking, The Getty has done a first rate job.",JohnnyGWestport_CT
50,One of the best Art Musems and Gardens,"The Getty is for Art lovers of all ages plus Architecturally it’s one that takes your breath away as it sits above the hills of Beverly Hills & Los Angelos. It is completely accessible via wheelchair. From the parking lot a tram takes you to the top of the hill where the museum and beautiful gardens are situated.The variety of Art from the old masters to contemporary is expansive. We knew one visit could not cover it all. However, this gem of an Art Musem is one you want to comeback often.",rosy

50,Beautiful inside and out!,"From the minute you ride the tram up to the Getty Center you are awed by the extraordinary views of the city below. Once you disembark, the wonder grows. As you stroll around the grounds, you are drawn into the architecture and diverse gardens surrounding you. Oh, yes, there's the art, too! Special exhibits motivate one to return often. The volunteers and staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. This has become a must see attraction for our LA visitors, and it never disappoints.",marianne3827
50,Great Family Day,"This is one of my favorite places to be in Los Angeles. I have brought my children regularly, all ages, for years! We would pack a lunch, walk up to the third floor where there are tables outside with the view of LA and sometimes all the way to the ocean, and just BE. Then there is the garden with the wonders of the water works and how the water makes a different sound at every crossover! And my children's favorite part is the hide and seek with the tours The Getty offers with the ipods you can check out. The kids love to search for the art pieces and listen to the pieces talk to them in the headsets. There are so many wonderful experiences to share, why wouldn't you try a day at The Getty?",Karie R

After perusing the wonderful gift shop we discovered a coat check which was a life saver..third wow.After viewing unbelievable paintings.silver.marble statues and photography in various detached buildings we realized umbrellas were provided as we scurried between viewings..fourth wow.Even in the rain it is a place not to be missed.There is soo much to see and the view from the hill is the fifth wow.",frankie57salinas
50,Take your grandchildren...,"There are a lot of choices here for kids 6 to 16. They'll enjoy the trip from the parking lot to the top of the hill on the people mover (pulled by cables). The architecture is stunning and worth the tour. The kids rooms are fun for younger children (making masks, kinetic art, goofing around). The bio of Getty in panels across is interesting for kids who like biographies. The views of LA are, on a clear day, amazing. There are sandwich and coffee carts and a nice lunch venue. Better to visit in the morning before it gets crowded.",donuthole15
50,"Nice day activity with art, architecture and gardens","The Getty Center has an awesome and vast art collection. I suggest picking a period of history/style that you like and start there.My favorite gallery is the one with impressionist art showing work from Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and others. I also recommend the Architecture Tour and the Garden Tour. Those are 45 minutes long guided tours where you get to know interesting facts and history about the place.Admission is free and parking is $15 and $10 after 3 pm.If the day is clear this is also a good spot for a nice sunset. If you like photographing the architecture here will definitely inspire you.",Tamara Arroba

40,Learn about Art and Artists,A beautiful and interesting place to visit both indoor and outdoor. The gardens are very well kept and a delightful place to stroll and simply relax. The view from the museum is breathtaking and you can view a vast area of Los Angeles. It does not matter what time of year you visit - there are always numerous exhibitions on display. If you are truly interested in art it will take you hours to make your way through it all. You can take a break and visit the restaurant and have a wonderful lunch or just sit in the garden area and have a bite. Your trip will be well worth it.,Gratitude09
50,One of the best museums in Los Angeles,"J.P. Getty collected some of the most important pieces of art in the world and a great deal of them are displayed here. Permanent collections included a fantastic display of Impressionist art, as well as the classics. Rotating exhibits include Photography and many other interesting subjects. Admission is free, but they do charge $15.00 to park. (This is how the trustees got around Getty's requirement that there be no admission charge to see his collection!) One tip, if you want to spend the whole day checking out his vast collection: Your parking ticket is also good on the same day at the Getty Villa, his other museum in Malibu, where his collection of Antiquities is housed. Be advised, however, you can easily spend the whole day just at the Getty Center; it's that huge. If you do plan on museum hopping, check the days they are open, as there are a couple of days during the week when both museums are not open on the same day.",Jim_Abney

50,Breathtaking views,"I visited the Getty for the first time this year with some of my cousins from out of town. The architecture itself is one of the best parts, but I also love the guided tours and you can also get headsets for several exhibits. The courtyard outside is my favorite part, you can grab a bottle of wine or a few glasses and sit on the deck overlooking the city. The flower garden is gorgeous and really takes you to a zen place.",Taylor W
50,IT'S NOT MY ART... BUT THE GROUNDS ARE STUNNING,"I have been to the Getty on rainy days, sunny days, cloudy days... it's an all-weather awesome place to visit. The grounds are stunning, the restaurant serves a mean cocktail, so what if I don't love the very classic collection of art. The use of stone and the gardens in my mind are the true artistic endeavors of the Getty.",marnie l
40,Worth a visit,"Stopped here on a road trip from San Fransisco heading to Yorba Linda to see Nixon Library. Parking is $15 but admission is free and a tram whisks you up to the entrance in 5 minutes. The art is in 4 different buildings and chronological. Enjoyed the medieval art and Italian Renaissance and the Impressionist paintings.Ate lunch in the cafe and it was ok. Self service and we had soup and half a sandwich. Curried tuna good but bread a bit dry. Carrot ginger soup pretty good but not enough ginger.Would say it looks spectacular and has some pretty good art but it certainly does not rival the really great art museums like the Louvre and Prada e.g. So if you have seen those, adjust your expectations.",maapar

50,An Informative Day at the Getty,"As a long time fan of the Getty in Malibu and with the understanding that more than 90% of J Paul Getty's collection was in storage , the opening of the Getty Campus and Museum Halls was an enlightened treasure to experience.The Campus is a sprawling property with 4 distinct halls each focused on specific time periods in art . Paintings , manuscripts , scriptures , sculpture, photographs and even furniture are on display.Rotating exhibits mean there is always something new to experience.The grounds also contain walking paths , seating areas and beautiful gardens all with beautiful views of the city , hillsides and vistas to the sea.A cafe , restaurant and coffee carts keep you nourished as you explore on your own or as part of a guided tour.The vibe is slightly less formal than the Malibu Villa so dress comfortably and wear your walking shoes.",James P.
50,The Truth about the Getty,"I have nothing negative to say about the Getty nor would I claim that it is a museum to end all museum experiences.Literally.... not a hair out of place - but if you’re already well versed in the big leagues; such as the Louvre, London Tate, Smithsonian, MOMA and the like - this is much the beautiful, trendy teenage sister of those - you’ve been warned.HOWEVER.... if grand adventure is a rarity this is a great all in one Los Angeles marvel - if you plan it right.... if (YOU) plan it right.I don’t recommend an impromptu visit.Plan at least a week or several days in advance and pair your museum visit with any one of its after dark activities or revolving displays or events.GET HERE EARLY and squeeze every inch outta this place.Lest it’s easy to WANDER around and wonder “what the big deal is”.It’s very easy to get lost in all sorts of odd spaces, rooms and traps.This place is utterly designed to get lost in and you will.It’s entirely possible to lose a day walking in circles and even worse... the same circles.PLAN EVERYTHING around any evening museum activities, possibly do the gardens and balconies in the morning for “golden hour” photo ops and partake in as many free guided tours as your stomach can handle.With your spare time - then wander aimlessly if you insist.ALTHOUGH they boast that parking is valid for both museum locations the same day - DON’T DO IT!Do the Getty Center MUSEUM with honor and valor - and call it a day, don’t half ass both wilts adding in LA traffic in between the two.A recipe for a disappointing sucky day for sure.",Shawn G
50,Great artworks and fantastic views,"We took an Uber here from our hotel in Hollywood which allowed us to see surroundings which included Beverly Hills, BelAir, etc. Upon arrival we took the tram up the hillside to this great facility. It was spectacular to view the grounds, building and surrounding countryside. We then entered the 4 galleries and enjoyed the art. You can easily spend the day here.",John P

40,Nice space,"The gardens and views are very nice. I enjoyed the art more than what lacma had to offer. The drive from Beverly Hills isn’t bad. Once you park in their subterranean garage for $15, a 5 minute trolley will take you to the museum. Great way to spend a few hours.",fishingchic

50,Getty Golly!,"Got there early on a Saturday. No lines and no waiting. Late afternoon, there were lines, but we were on our way out ... no problems.",Flinhart
40,Incredible--we'll be back!,"We visited the Getty in early January and experienced big crowds and a long line for the tram. We were advised to walk up if we didn't want to wait. Not a good idea for someone with MS. Yikes. A very steep and long climb even for a healthy person. We wonder if we had mentioned that to the line attendant if we might have been allowed to take one of the many parked but unused buses sitting empty.The museum is great--much more to offer than can be seen in one day. The highlights tour was well done. The kid zone was fun for our 9-year-old, and the grandparents loved the garden tour.

50,An Evening Out,"This place is fantastic!!! My Son and I were on an excursion and chose this place. The cost is minimal. Just $15.00 for parking and a quick tramm ride up to the property. The atmosphere is perfect for learning different cultures, historical events, and just an all around perfect place to experience the arts. As an added bonus, there are a couple of restaurants that you can choose from and there reasonable. I would caution you to be watchful for coyotes. Seriously, while we were there standing on the platform waiting for the tramm, we overheard one of the attendants say there some coyotes...true story (smile). This is truly a magnificent place to visit...read a book...eat a bite...relax on the beautifully manicured grounds. The Getty’s were truly on the cusp of something spectacular. You will be glad you took the time to visit.",TbSott

The location is exquisite, the panoramas extensive, and by the way, there is also terrific art and many rotating exhibitions.I recommend walking up or down at least one way (instead of taking the train). Gives a nice perspective on the location as well. The cafeteria is excellent; the kiosks around the main plaza are OK. The staff members are unfailingly helpful and polite.",Francisco G

I just can't say enough GREAT things about the Getty Center.",Debra P

Perched atop the hills overlooking all of Los Angeles, the Getty Center gives breathtaking views of the city. This sprawling estate has everything you could want: world-renown paintings and drawings, one of a kind sculptures, and majestic gardens. The best part of all: it’s completely free admission! The tram makes parking and getting up to the Getty Center a breeze. Tip: get to the Getty right when it opens to have best access and easy navigation of the site. I especially appreciated the specific ride-share pick up/drop off section near the entrance. The Getty was an unforgettable experience and I would definitely visit again on my next trip to Los Angeles.",SUBZEROSKIDD10

We took an uber andappreciated the designated pick up/drop off area. There were quite a few large locked storage areas to put our shopping bags. It was big enough to even fit suitcases.The museum was free which was a very nice perk. A tram takes a person up to the actual museum from the security area. A person can also use the path up to the museum.The view of the snow capped mountains, the ocean and especially LA was spectacular.To me, that was the highlight of the Getty. The Irises by van Gogh was an impressive painting. Overall, we walked out of the museum feeling like the selections needed more depth.",minnesotans4
50,Always a treat to visit,"I have lived in LA for many decades and visit the Getty Museum at least 3-4 times a year. This is a world class art museum with art works spanning several centuries. If you are interested in antiquities, that is s separate museum in Malibu, called the Getty Villa. The special exhibit now is Renaissance Nude. Very well done with paintings including Michelangelo and Rubens. Winter is not the best season for the gardens, but it is still worth a visit. The architecture, designed by Richard Meier, is worth a tour on its own. There are several options for dining. Most popular is the cafeteria. There is also a pricey formal restaurant. Delicious!! Beautiful views of Los Angeles. Museum admission is free. There is a $15 parking charge. Plan on spending several hours.",Annette M
50,There and Back Again: Riverside Metrolink to Subway to Expo Line by Bus to the door,"We went there again from Riverside using public transportation all the way. A day of fun and adventure (as it always is on mass, public transit). But from anywhere that Metrolink reaches, you can visit the Getty for 10 bucks each no added charge, no tax, no parking, no tickets, no lie.It goes like this:Weekend Day Pass is $10, it covers all of Metrolink (not Amtrak) and MetroRail (Red&Purple subway ""heavy rail"" & the light rail lines of Gold, Expo, etc. And all the LA buses.From Riverside (or whatever Metrolink you're near) to Union Station Los Angeles.Red or Purple line to Metro Center.Expo line to Sepulveda Station. From there, there's an LA bus - right off the platform that will drop you off right across two lanes of traffic from the Getty. Push the button, walk past the cars waiting in line. Get on the tram up to the museum. Ten dollars. From Riverside and back again on $10. The (included in your Day Pass) bus-ride goes through a lot of cool places you probably wouldn't drive, but you don't have to worry about a thing: traffic, parking... just know ahead of time where you're going to get off...I didn't include bus numbers and schedules because they change, and if you can't look them up and figure them out then you probably shouldn't do this.But public transportation is absolutely possible from anywhere that Metrolink trains reach. And on the weekends it's a deal.We, lately, go from Riverside - park for free at the (relatively) secure, downtown station, leave at 7:50 or 9. trains leave Union station for Riverside at 3:15 or 7... something. Check your schedule... You get back to Riv at 5 or 9 rounded off.",Paul B
50,"Perfect for tourists, couples, or families","The Getty is a great spot to hang out or go on a date. It’s free to go (except parking), and has exceptional architecture, a unique garden, and interesting art, sculptures, and exhibits.It fun to just grab a coffee and sit among the beautiful buildings. Like most places, I recommend going early to avoid the crowds.",NWebLA
40,Great view and art,"The Getty Center is one of LA's best attractions. It is Visually stunning entirely made of marble at the top of the hill that divides the city. And it houses some of the most extraordinary pre 20th century european art in existence. Form Van Gogh and Monet , to ancient Roman artifacts and tapestries and everything in between. There are also traveling exhibits that feature more modern work. The art is divided into 4 buildings that can be visited in the order of your preference. There are special family rooms as well as activities for kids to stay entertained and learn about art. Another amazing feature of the Getty is the Garden. The beautiful labyrinth-like garden features flowing water and changes with the seasons. If you get hungry you should go to the cafe to samle the amazing daily menu. If you are looking for an exceptional dining experience try the restaurant, since it gets full you are better off making a reservation in advance. If you need want a special treat stop by the first floor of the reseach library and look at the available literature. Getting there is simple and you should check the webpage for specifics. Take a light sweater and sun glasses. It gets pretty breezy up there, and the travertine marble reflcts insanely. Parking at the Getty Requires reservations and cost $5 per vehicle. My suggestion Get dropped off or take the bus. But the Admission is Free for everyone everyday. Tours are available daily and are free as well. If you need to drive try parking at their lot on Constitution avenue. It is three miles away, free, and offers a free shuttle to and from the museum. Or you goul show up after 4pm when the crowd dies down and you no longer need a reservation to park. Once you are there take the tram up to the marvel at the congestion of the 405 freeway and be happy you are not on it. Then when you step off the tram and begin you fabulous time at the getty, remember to take a look outwards at Los angeles, Beverly hills, Brentwood... youd be suprised thats much a part of this museum as the art that decorates the walls.",Sheryl T
40,Was expecting more....,"don't get me wrong, it's a cool place to visit, but not awesome. I had a hard time understanding the flow of the property with different levels etc. The outside garden & pool is lovely, but adjacent gardens needed work. It's easy to get to and only $15 to park so check it out if nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",Yates26
40,Stunning views,"This is worth the trip. I have been here before and they always have great exhibitions, grandiose appointments and a stunning view.",Outalot307
40,Wonderful museum experience,Scenically situated with a lovely garden and beautiful views. We loved the 19th century art. It was a shame that there wasn't a permanent photography exhibit as the temporary exhibit wasn't impressive. So much to see though and we enjoyed our visit overall.,Ros57
50,Lovely place,Had a great time visiting the Getty Center on the weekend. A bit crowded but that was expected! no complaints. great views of the city and the place is amazing.,Joe Aver
50,Wonderful museum,"What a wonderful experience. The museum, the buildings and the grounds are spectacular. The day we went you could see the water in one direction and the snow covered peaks in the other. Amazing views. You should definitely take the architectural tour.",Mark H
50,A Day Long Excursion,"There is so much to see with just in the exhibits but there is so much more. Free guided tours throughout the day staffed by enthusiastic and knowledgeable volunteers. It’s hard to believe they are volunteers because they do such an incredible job. There are multiple buildings and the site itself is attractively laid out with gardens, sculpture gardens and the architecture of the buildings themselves is also part of the attraction.",DABSMO
50,Astounding - and Free,"It is difficult to find fault with the Getty Center. An astonishing architectural marvel filled with invaluable Renaissance and other European art.We spent a few minutes upon arriving figuring out how to pay our entrance fee. After fruitlessly looking for the ticket desk, we realized that entry is free! Wow, just like being back home in the UK - how unAmerican!We picked up an audio guide and spent a few productive hours exploring the various galleries. Many of the pieces have a number that you can key into the audio guide to hear some expert analysis of the painting or sculpture.The only improvement I would suggest is that a simple sign near the bottom of the tram explaining that one has the option of walking up to the museum rather than wait ages in the impressive queue for the tram would be a very good idea. It would have saved us a frustrating 20 minute wait.",Stephen F
50,Huge complex and well worth your time,The Getty Center is huge and well worth most of a day to really experience all that the Getty has to offer. It is located up on a hill so the views are excellent. The architecture is amazing. The various buildings have a variety of art forms so there is something to please most people. Highly recommended.,Travmama
50,3-4 Hours for a real wonderful experience,Amazing huge place with very good wifi all over! You need time to see this very big place that is not just a museum but complete with cafe and restaurant and stores. Staffs are pleasant and very helpful. I highly recommend this place to old and young people,Helde2014
50,Great!,"It's far from the center, but totally worth. It's a great place with lots of interesting and beautiful things to see. Art and lovely gardens. We didn't see the gardens because it was raining the day we went. The structure offered to visitors is exceptional!",robsonjordao
40,Must see when in LA,"This place is a must visit place if you are a culture enthusiast, lots of sculptures, paintings, photography and drawings. Don't miss it!",Svenja Lange
50,A really fine museum,"This famous Los Angeles landmark is well worth a visit, and plan to stay for at least 2 hours. It has wonderful collections of art from many places and centuries, including modern photography (a special exhibit by Sally Mann while we were there); wonderful 14th Century Italian and 17th Century Dutch paintings, two pinnacles of painting in my opinion. Also wonderful gardens, fascinating architecture, great views of Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles (the latter better on clear days). A thoroughly fine experience.",David P
50,What a Stunner!,"How had I not visited here before?! It’s like an oasis high above with knock out views over Los Angeles.The architecture of the buildings is a wonder and there is so much to see and do. We were on a limited timeframe so picked some artwork that interested us, but more so enjoyed walking around the premises and gardens.So well thought out and I was pleasantly surprised there was no admission charge. Great spot for photos, and there’s a handy ride-share point if you’re getting picked up or dropped off there. What are you waiting for?!",Nicholas B
50,For the art lover a must see,This review will be short and sweet.If you enjoy art and history this is a definite visit for you.Great gallery's of many of the great artist's throughout history.Wonderful garden in the center of Musueum for relaxing and enjoying a beverage.Gift shop with reproductions of the works on display.A thoroughly enjoyable adventure.,seedtime
50,Just great !,"This museum has been on our to do list for some years now. Finally we have made it. Great LA location, vibrant and visitor/display friendly architecture. Delightful gardens and restaurants. Great support group of volunteers. And....free entry. The major works on display are just fantastic. So too the garden sculptures. When we were there the Renaissance Nude exhibits were interesting so too the Japanese Lacquer but I have to say I really didn't think the Sally Mann: ""A Thousand Crossings"" worth any wall space in any gallery.Too many positives though to be grumpy. VERY glad we went.",John K
50,Pretty Spectacular,"This was my first time to The Getty Center. There are at least five buildings with displays to see .... indoor sculptures, paintings, drawings, and photography. In one of the buildings, there is a small area dedicated to Mr. Getty’s legacy. This collection is quite impressive, and the buildings are beautiful. The grounds are nice... especially the Center Garden. The outdoor sculpture garden is minimal. There are a few shops throughout so you can purchase some books and/or souvenirs. We were short on time, so we did a quick browse and we were very impressed. We spent 2 hours here but we could have easily spent more time. You probably could make a day of your visit here if you enjoy art. You park in the multi-level garage and take your ticket with you so you can pay $15 for parking at the machine before returning to your car. Catch the free tram for a ride up to the buildings. There is a place to eat here, too, but I did not dine while here. The Getty Center is free...you just pay to park. Very worthy of a stop! Very impressive place!!",2doglady
50,Fascinating place but get the audio tour,Try to arrive early enough to get the personal audio tour device as it explains what you are looking at and is much more interesting than reading the signs since it seems to have more of a story included. Sometimes the audio tour devices are all checked out. If you bring your own lunch do it as it is probably more satisfying and costs a lot less. We also went to the Getty Villa a few miles away and found it was even more interesting.,Dav-o
50,This is a Must See Place,This place is a real gem of a center it has it all wonderful art work and a garden like no other you have seen. All I can say is go!,Rhino32713
50,Los Planeros at the Getty,"We specifically came to the Los Planeros perform, but, of course, we picnicked in the garden area and checked out the Sarah Mann photography installation as well. Personally, I have never been partial to their installations always wondering who chooses the works on display. . The sculptursculpture garden also makes me wonder, but still always a nice view and other events which are pleasing including the beyond splendorous sunset.",Raq S
40,Good,The building is quite ugly but the exhibitions they had were very good. I went when it was raining and There wasn't much of a view but it was cool to see the clouds half way up the hills,Gsl

50,BEAUTIFUL!~!,"If you haven't been, you need to make a visit. I just can't believe it is FREE!! You need to eat at the restaurant that is at the museum and make sure you walk around the gardens. It is a must see.",Schultzie
50,LA Art Museum Highlight,"Visiting LA? Love art museums? The Getty is a must see. The galleries span art from old Europe to contemporary. Check their website for current exhibits. There is always something new that you can be sure will be curated to the highest criteria. I am an avid photographer and there is usually a photographic exhibit which is always inspiring. The facility itself is an art exhibit. Be sure to go on the architectural tour which will explain why the buildings look the way they do and why the are situated as the are. Fascinating. Oh, and did I mention that the price is right? Free, although you do pay for parking.",Neal J
50,Beautiful Museum with Gorgeous Views,"We visited the Getty during Christmas Break and it was very busy! I will avoid holidays to enjoy it more in the future. If a holiday visit is a must, I would advise getting to the museum when it opens. As the day goes on, it is difficult (traffic) just to get into the parking structure. I also advise leaving well before closing. We had to sit in the parking structure (level 5) for 45 minutes before we could pull out.This is a stunning museum and I cannot wait to go back. The landscaping, buildings, and view are amazing! The exhibits are breathtaking. The Getty is a must! My teenage daughters fell in love with it and we will be returning in a few months when some exhibits change.",mmm10
50,Getty's Gift,"Visiting Los Angeles; you must go to The Getty Center and Museum! You will h ave to pay for parking, which was reasonable. You must allow yourself time to see all the exhibits.

50,Get Some at the GETTY!,"Inside and Out, this place is gorgeous. We go not even knowing what's going on or being displayed. The architecture and the grounds lend themselves to wandering, day dreaming and fantasizing ~ very inspirational. The exhibits are well presented and the tours or special events are a must if you have any interest or absolutely no knowledge about something; very informative and entertaining. I think I just talked myself into going back tomorrow...",jb321gone

40,Two for one,"After a visit to the villa, we had some spare time and were told not to miss the center as well, so we didn’tNot as impressive as the villa but definitely has more art",rantlv
50,Spectacular collection of European art,"I extended a business trip to LA to include a few vacation days and brought along my wife. Several people in LA recommended going to the Getty museum as a must see while in LA. The Getty is a beautiful museum and provides some of the best views of LA. The collection of art is spectacular. I especially enjoyed the Impressionists. The Louis XIV collection is also impressive (I've been to Versailles 30 years ago; this collection is presented in a way that takes you back). Be sure to research their website before your trip, to map out what areas you want to be sure to see. I would get their early and make a day of it. Have lunch in the cafe or restaurant there. Admission to museum is free. You can't beat that!",Rick J

The building is magnificent - so well positioned to make the best use of the sun and the city and the surroundings. The gardens are beautifully designed and maintained. And then there is the art works. Varied and well explained. The special exhibitions were great.Oh, I almost forgot that it is free. I would have gladly paid $50 admission.Next visit to LA we will try to get there for a whole day as that is what it demands.",Glenn
50,Fabulous and free,"The Getty has many buildings and lots of pre-20th century art. I don't think you could cover it all in one trip, so pick an area or topic and go back again another time to cover more.The grounds and gardens are beautiful and worthy of time just walking around. We took a tour which gave us interesting background into some of the paintings. When in LA, definitely include the Getty in your plans.",wineanddine32
50,My visit at the Getty Center in Brentwood,"The changing exhibits are very impressive, the views from the different areas allows clear views of downtown Los Angeles,Century City, Santa Monica, the ocean.The architectural tour very enlightening and informative; all the exhibits are free, you only pay for parking which allows two museums (the center and the Villa in Malibu) for the price of one if used the same day.",thomasrainville

50,A great place to hang out...,"I am a veteran museum-goer & always enjoy them but this one is different. Look at impressionist paintings for awhile; then go outside and check out the great view. Visit an exhibit of photographs or illustrated medieval manuscripts... then go have a coffee, or a snack in the cafe, or a dinner in the restaurant with the view. Or, go for a walk in the garden and soak up some rays. Or, shop in the gift shop. It's whatever you feel like doing on the day, a perfect California experience. Love it.",wiley0e

The art museum is a hit for the art lover as well as those whose interest in art is only to see something they have not seen before. A great visit for the tourist who wants to see some of the beauty that Los Angeles has to offer.

50,A great days visit to an amazing place full of art,"The Getty Center is a futuristic building clad in travertine stone and on a clear day you can see most of LA south around to LAX and the sea. The outside areas are huge so you can see the full design of the building whilst also relaxing on the lawns or strolling through the gardens.Entry to the Center is free, as are the exhibits. However car parking for the day is about $15 which you pay for before leaving. Disabled parking is available. Getting from the car park (underground) is done by getting an elevator from the car park to the mini train. The driverless train then takes you up to the Getty Center in a few minutes.The Center has huge amounts of artwork on display in different climate controlled sections. Normally there are a number of different special exhibitions on at any one time and most of these have free entry.There are regular tours of different parts of the building (gardens, art work, architecture etc). Details available at the reception in the main building.There are a number of cafes and different restaurants serving all sorts of different counties food styles. The food is good, although some items are a little pricey.I have visited the Getty Center at least twice each year for the past 10 years and never get bored there:)It is best not to leave the Center between 4:00pm and 6:00pm as the I-405 is a nightmare at rush hour week days.",Beverlyhillsdude

They also have some great programs there on occasion and the trip from the parking lot ($10) to the free museum is cool. However, for the actual art selection, check what is on display at any given time, as I find the Broad, LACMA and MOCA, along with some of the better galleries around LA, often have better installations. It is worth a visit if you've never been, though the Getty Villa near Malibu on the Pacific Coast Highway is really nice as well.",rvanheertum

Then you get to experience the height of architectural design, including the use of water and landscaping that are truly unique and amazing. The view of all of Los Angeles helps make the experience even better. And that's just the exterior. Then the building houses great art that is beautifully curated.P.S. You park your car at the base of the mountain that the Getty sits atop and take a clean white monorail up to the museum. Very cool!This really is a must see on any LA itinerary.",artemis51

The architecture of the buildings too is so pretty and so well maintained and clean. The grounds are massive. We only had time to see the Nude Renaissance exhibition and part of the Torah, Bible & Koran exhibition which were very interesting. Would have loved to have had more time to look around here.

There are 4 wings all of which are extra ordinary and filled with sculptures, paintings, scriptures and artefacts. I particularly enjoyed the section showcasing ancient European furnishings and decorations. There’s a small cafe and a restaurant and a really beautiful garden.

Highly recommended.,DennisG50
40,Incredible,"The place is huge and except for $15 parking and expensive food it is free. Filled with art you saw in class at school. Antiquities, oh yeah. Do you prefer your antiquities to be more recent like 18th century Japanese Lacquer Boxes from Marie Antoinette’s collection or are you more of a BC person? A lot of the stuff is swapped with other museums (boxes from Louvre) - I assume the Louvre doesn’t trade with just anyone. Museum perched on a hill not far from LAX and on a clear day from one of out door decks I thought I could see Las Vegas. Just kidding but it is nothing short of spectacular. A few hours and it was time for lunch. After lunch when I was listing the stuff I wanted to see, others rolled their eyes. There is a limit to how much you can take. There is a tram from parking garage to the museum or you can walk. We walked and it was a 10 minute trip downhill. Up might be another story. Navigation was a challenge but there were lots of docents and guards to point the way if you are looking for something specific. This isn’t for youngsters. Even teens hold it to an hour or two.",Joseph H
50,Iconic Museum,Please don’t come to LA without going to the two Getty Museums.... you can make a reservation the same day and if you’re feeling really ambitious you can visit both for the price of one save your parking pass it will be good at the second one. They are close enough together that you can actually do this with two completely different vibes one facing the skyline towards Los Angeles and the other facing the Pacific Ocean.... One modern and one classic Italian Villa.... Who needs my review oh my gosh everybody knows you have to go to the Getty!!,CaralinaBalerina

To take a family on a really enjoyable and educational outing to one of the top art museums I've visited at very little cost in Los Angeles is an opportunity not to be missed. The views of the city were incredible, and the place was incredibly maintained and structured.",jessepisors
50,No words for it,"How can you possibly say enough about something like you have never experienced before. How can you make unbelievable art, unbelievable friendly volunteers, and a tram to deliver you to the front door from your parking lot better? You make it all free!Unbelievable.",Randy S
50,Such a wonderful museum,This was our second visit at the Getty and it was just as magical as the first time. We spent 3 hours just catching as many exhibits as we could with the audio guide app. The visit of the Getty was my parents’ favourite activity in LA.Recommended.,SilverBull8t
50,A World Class Museum with great views!,I have been visiting the Getty center for many years. It’s a world-class museum that has a lot of ?ART from Europe . The Getty foundation has a lot of money and they are always acquiring new pieces. Plus they always have the standards which are phenomenal. If you’re in Los Angeles I highly recommend that you go here. I believe the only thing you need a reservation for is the parking. The parking is the only thing that cost money other than the food if you decide to buy lunch or dinner.The tram that takes you from the parking lot up to the Getty Center is very cool as well. The view from the top looking at the city on a clear day is nothing less than astronomical.,Richard L
50,A Shining Los Angeles Diamond,"The Getty Center is a ""SHINING LOS ANGELES DIAMOND"" -- NOT in the ""Rough"" but glittering set in the Santa Monica Mountains in West LA for all to see and enjoy! YOU MUST visit the site and the collection. Los Angeles sprawls out before one's eye from the Getty's point of view, from the Pacific Ocean to downtown. The landscaping itself is worth a day's trip, just to meander and enjoy the majestic architectural artistry of the structure itself -- and then to wander the treasures of the inner rooms provides an enthralling experience for young, middle age and old. DON'T MISS IT!",stephenmZ5558TM
50,"Everything was amazing: architecture, exhibitions, organisation of visit","The Getty Center is an amazing place. The architecture and landscaping of the museum and its grounds are breathtaking. We only had half a day, by far not enough to explore the wealth of exhibits. Loved that audio guides were offered in addition to guided tours, the appliances were easy to handle and provided excellent guidance. So enjoyed the exhibition 'The Renaissance Nude'. Many of the paintings are world-famous, so wonderful to see them in reality. You can get really close and admire the colours and texture and the audio-guided tour places the exhibits very well into the context of renaissance world-view and beliefs.",windywelli
50,Wonderful Art Collection in Architecturally Stunning Buildings on Beautiful Grounds,"This is a not to be missed museum. The collection, buildings, and grounds are all captivating and well worth the trouble to get to the top of the hill. I didn't take the tram and found the walk to be manageable and pleasant. This is definitely a place you can spend a full day at. I was glad to have traveled there by Uber as parking was difficult and the traffic poorly managed.",KAS_QU_NYC
50,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful museum that has many great exhibits. I have visited many museums, and the Getty is just as beautiful as the ones I have visited in London, NYC, and Paris. The views of LA and the ocean were stunning. I loved the modern architecture. The exhibits were also amazing. I was only there for a few hours, but you can easily spend a day there. I will definitely visit the museum again if I go back to LA.",Staci B
30,Thought there would be more,"The Getty is huge in size and stature. You park in a garage then take either the tram or a bus to the top to avoid a 25 minute walk uphill. Parking is $15 but entry to the museum is free. Pretty well organized at the entry, where they search bags and scurry you to transportation.Once on site, you will admire the unique architecture and great views. It reminded me of Epcot because it is so spread out with different buildings. Truth be told though, the art was just not that captivating. Even the special exhibits were rather small and nothing was interactive or required more than just looking. For example, they mention Marie Antoinette’s lacquer box collection and it was in a tiny dark room most people will miss, with only a few boxes. All that hype for such a tiny exhibit.The descriptions often left me wanting to know more — and some had no description at all. Sad because there was no context at times. I wasn’t moved emotionally. Perhaps because it is so spread out. There seems to be tons of space but not tons of art. The exhibits lack depth and heart. They could learn from the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA which truly envelops the visitor into the exhibits. Simple yet well-thought exhibits there make us feel the art, become part of it, as well as see it. I was really surprised that a museum with the popularity and history of the Getty would be so cold and uncaptivating.Be prepared for lots of walking and wind gusts. The gardens were just ok. The cafeteria is very pricey but I suppose you can’t complain since you get in for free. There was a large variety of options though.",Donna D
50,Very impressive,"Everything about the Getty Center is impressive, the location, the size, the views and of course the artwork. $15 per car to park but then entry is free. We walked up the hill instead of taking the tram and it was a lovely walk. The artwork was wonderful and extremely impressive as were the gardens and fountains. Definitely worth a visit.",Travellover6128
50,Getty Museum - Don’t Pass Up!,"The Getty Center (Museum) - for which there is no admission fee (small charge for parking and the shuttle from the garage to the Museum - is an incredible experience. The Museum consists of four or five buildings on various levels, above a spectacularly beautiful garden area which affords panoramic views of LA. But of course the primary attraction is the incredible collection of masterpiece paintings and sculptures. There are multiple places to eat but “The Restaurant” was an unexpected dining experience.",William C
50,A Superb Collection,"We are so glad our family brought us here. We enjoyed every minute of our morning checking out as much as possible. The architecture is inspiring, the gardens are beautiful and the art is amazing. The white stone building is fascinating from every angle.The permanent art collection is fantastic. There is a large amount of art in a variety of mediums. There is something for everyone here. We loved the Renaissance paintings and the Neo-Classical Sculptures. The artwork rivals that of the world’s best museums --- Originals of Rembrandt, Renoir, Van Gogh – Wow! Our favorite was the marble bust of Pope Paul V by Bernini. The sculpted detail in the face is mind-boggling. The furniture of Louis X!V was another collection that we admired.We lucked out getting a sunny day when we visited. The panoramic views of Los Angeles from the rooftops were breathtaking. We could even see the Pacific Ocean in the distance. The Cactus Garden also viewed from above was amazing.The best thing is that this museum is free – just costs $15 for parking. A tram takes you up to the museum on the hilltop. Everything else is paid by endowments and grants.There was so much to see that one morning was not enough for us. We will certainly return on our next visit to this area,",TheExplorerFamily
50,Amazing in Every Aspect,The museum is incredible. It has so many great works of art on display. The Renaissance Nude exhibit was very well done. Outside the museum the garden is a great place to relax and enjoy the surrounding nature. The views from the Getty are spectacular too. It is a friendly place for children and adults.,Bob C
50,Art and Friends,Enjoyed an afternoon walking around the Getty Center. Time out when you go because it can get very crowded.,Jessica S
50,"Dramatic setting, wonderful collection.",The Getty is one of the world’s best museum. The collection and the setting are beyond compare. Worth a trip to L. A. Just to see this.,Carroll S
50,Great place to visit,"This is a must for anybody visiting LA.Firstly the building and the views of LA are just jaw dropping. Worth a visit just for this.For young kids, there is a family room for kids to play and do activities. This provides them with an opportunity to explore their creative side.The art work within the building is amazing.",Andrew M
40,Amazing collection of art work,"The Getty Center has some amazing collection of European and American art work from medieval times to present displayed in four different pavilions of the museum. Other than that there are special exhibits which changes from time to time and often involve collaborations and loans from museums around the world. The Renaissance Nude Exhibit is currently on view featuring works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Dürer, and others, tracing the nude’s gradual emergence over 130 years in Italy, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The magnificent architecture, the breath taking views of the surrounding area from up above the Santa Monica hills, and the view of Robert Irwin's Central Garden is really spectacular. And best of all, it is FREE! Even the tram ride to go from the parking lot / Uber drop off point up to the museum up on the hill is free. You only have to pay $15 for Parking if you drive your car.They have a good cafeteria; however we had packed a picnic lunch. But since it was quite windy, we decided to enjoy our picnic lunch inside the cafeteria instead of sitting outside in the garden. No one seemed to care that we used the cafeteria to eat lunch that we did not buy there.One can easily spend the whole day in the museum and the gardens. However, based on our experience, I have couple advice -1. Reach there earlier in the day to avoid parking nightmares especially during busy times (holiday season or summer break).2. Instead of driving there, it is advisable to take Uber. The parking spaces seem to run out by afternoon. We saw many cars being turned away due to the parking lot being full.Also, we felt that the road leading to the parking lot and the Uber drop off point could be managed a little better. There should a dedicated line for the Uber pick up/ drop off so that those cars don't have to be stuck in the long lines of cars waiting for parking spot to be available.",chak1014
50,Top shelf Museum!,Spectacular site and museum collection! We've seen many museums all over the world but the Getty is a magnificent place in a category by itself. Being so well funded makes all the difference. The way the site was designed you are able to have spots to refresh your eyes and mind in between the buildings. There was a big crowd but they moved us through quickly and all the staff were friendly. Warning though- there are terrific shops throughout the museum for gifts. We loved it!,SORork
50,Wonderful History,We were visiting Malibu and went here with the grandkids and had a great time walking around and going into the inter-active room for children as well. On my second visit there my husband could typically does not do this type of venue was really enjoying it. We sat and had a bite to eat and we would definitely come back here for more be sure to take in the video on the history,zelda
50,Kindness,"I took a “dignatary” woman from Cameroon, a very poor country and she was by the generosity of Getty, she couldn’t someone would donate something as special as the Getty Museum so all mankind can enjoy it. Her comment is the most special thing about the Getty- it’s free for all to enjoy. What a gift to Los Angeles this is!",jaye939
50,Amazing!,The museum is so well maintained and houses some amazing pieces of art. The paintings are definitely the highlight but the bronze and marble sculptures aren’t to be missed. The French cabinets and other furniture are so well displayed and it gives a peek into the opulence of the past . A day well spent!,travelislife28
10,Worst experience in any museum in 62 years!,"This is listed as TripAdvisor’s #1 attraction for Los Angelos and I was thrilled to see their collection of Impressionists paintings but I never got to see them bc of horrid lines and the time spent waiting in line to park. I’ve been to over a dozen world class museums and never had this type of experiencePros: Fantastic setting on a hill overlooking LABeatiful buildingsCollection of art is varied and high qualityCons: ONLY ONE WAY into the parking garage meant 1 hour wait. This was worsened by the parking/traffic directors allowing people to drive up in the right lane and cut across and turn in front of those who have been patiently waiting. We saw this happen a more than a dozen times when we got within 10 cars of the turn. Also, they let huge tour buses come up the right lane and turn left in front of the left turn lane.This aggressive attitude of cutting in front of others and not waiting continued throughout the use the tram that takes you up the hill. I had a dad in the back of the line tell his daughters to race in front and counted 1,2,3 and they raced in front from the back nearly tripping me to get the seat that I already had my hand on.In the gift shop, haughty young clerks looked right past a 62 year old lady to ask others standing 8 feet behind if they were ready. I was verbally attacked by a 6 ft 3 man saying he was here First Lady, when I had not said a word, but was waiting probably with a frustrated face.Lastly, the Impressionist paintings are a large draw and the clerk at another gift shop said she wasn’t surprised at the line. She said another museum in Pasadena had a larger collection anyway.So if this is a major draw, why doesn’t the Getty arrange the collection over several rooms so that more people call see them at once instead of bunching them in a one way in and out setting?Sounds like the parking situation doesn’t it?And why don’t they have shuttles or something to spread out the parking?If you go, take an Uber and have them drop you off across the street.Do not be surprised at aggressive driving, or aggression in the shops and shuttle. The Getty seems to condone and support cutting in line.If you want to see Impressionists, either be prepared to wait, again, or else go to the Norton Simonin Pasadena.",LJMK1
50,Great art and great environment,"Very family-friendly, great ambience, lovely food in all the venues. You can come just to hang out in the gardens and enjoy the view. One of my favorite places to visit.",Jennifer P
50,Beautiful gardens,"We didn't have much time so, as it was a pleasant, clear day, we spent most of our time in the gardens. Very pretty, with lovely views. It's $15 to park, but entrance is free. There is a little train that runs regularly to get you from the parking garage to the museum, which is up on a hill.",MS06
50,"Amazing, unique and wonderful","If you have any interest in decorative arts and painting, this huge hill-top museum complex is not to be missed. Try to go early and plan to spend the whole day there. If you want a proper lunch, book ahead at the Restaurant. Even in fairly warm weather, bring a jacket as it can get very windy up top and chilly waiting for the tram or shuttle bus. There is no entrance fee to see the collection rhough they will collect your money on parking, food or souvenirs.Because the Getty is not based on a historical legacy, it's collection is biased by what was available for purchase in the market. Consequently, its painting collection has only a few true masterpieces by great artists. However, this is complemented by masterpieces of perhaps less famous artists (for example Spring by Alma-Tadema) and good works by artists such as Masaccio. While this means the museum cannot match the greatest painting collections, such as the National Gallery, there has been a strong focus on decorative arts, including one of the world's best collections of French furniture and a good display of Meissen and Sevres pottery. Many people rush to the 19th century paintings and miss many gems as a result. I understand the photography exhibition is also excellent.NOT TO BE MISSED!",Jules060617
50,The best thing to do with out of towners,"Free - the art is great - but the building and views are outstanding. On a clear day there is no better place to take an out of towner (once you have taken them to the beach.)As someone from LA who no longer lives in town, I brought my significant other to this place for the first time - he said it was the most amazing museum grounds he had been to and beat his already high expectations.Even when crowded, the venue has plenty of space for its patrons to enjoy a nice day of art viewing and in the gardens.",N D G
50,"An LA ""Must Do""","If you are an art lover, the Getty Center is a ""must"" on a visit to Los Angeles. Built by the J. Pau Getty Trust high in the Santa Monica hills overlooking LA, it offers sweeping views of the city and area. (Note that the Center is closed on Mondays.)Access is easy off I-405, just north of Sunset Blvd. Parking is in a structure at the base ($15 cash or credit as you exit); the Center and grounds are free admission. From the parking structure you'll ride a tram up to the Center itself. Wheelchairs and strollers are available on a first-come basis at either the lower tram station or in the Museum entrance hall.Start your visit with a short film in the Museum Entrance Hall, where you can also obtain a map of the Center and access restrooms. The museum itself includes four main pavilions -- North, East, South and West. These house sculpture and decorative arts on the plaza level while paintings are featured on the upper levels. A separate ""Exhibitions Pavilion"" houses special exhibitions.There are four venues available for eating -- 2 ""coffee carts"" with light food, a cafe and a full-service restaurant. We enjoyed a nice lunch int the cafe.The gardens below the Center are beautifully laid out and cared for; they deserve your attention, as well.Bottom line, the Getty Center is one of Los Angeles' special places, costing only a modest $15 to park your car. We spent five hours here and could have easily spent more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Enjoy!",Marty F
50,Outstanding art museum - don't miss it1,"We have visited Los Angeles many times and always wanted to see the Getty but just never got around to it. Well, finally after many years of procrastination we spent a whole day here. It was so worthwhile. There are numerous great and famous works of art on display - and displayed in an organized and attractive way with good visibility. A lot of information about the collection is also available.",frequent-traveler777
20,Over rated.,Go to the Huntington Library and Gardens instead.I was not a huge fan of the building and the garden was small in comparison to the size of the site but very nice .The permanent collection of European artists did not hold much to impress the European visitorGreat lunch venue if you can stick the security check.The museum shop didn't impress either.Great views of LA.Pity the Getty Foundation didn't stump up for Frank Gehry.It coulda been great.Go see the Huntington.,LBJDublin
50,Breathe in the view,"The Getty is a marvel-even in the winter. The beautiful art collection aside, the architecture alone is worthy of admiration. This is an art lovers and photographers dream. I took my son’s girlfriend there for an afternoon and I was telling her how beautiful the garden was in the spring-imagine my surprise at how beautiful the contrasting colors were between the winter foliage and travertine. There’s a spot on the observation deck where you can see the snow capped mountains and the coast to the west.",Kelly K
50,Just wonderfull,Highly recommended. We took the garden tour and was very interesting. Admission is free of charge. Best to go using Uber.,Fabian M
50,Free!,"Cannot believe this place is free. Amazing. The car parking is quite pricey but it’s probably worth driving and it’s a fair price I guess considering the center itself is free admission.If you are an art buff, you will loooooooove this place. Just go!",George salmond
50,Beautiful Space and Great Exhibits,"This visit was my second time at the Getty. Both visits left me feeling happy that such places exist. Medieval/Early Renaissance art is one of my favorites, and there are some lovely pieces there. We were lucky enough to be there when there was a retrospective of the photographs of Sally Mann, an extraordinary contemporary photographer. While there were enough people at the museum to fill the parking garage down to level 5, once inside the museum, I was able to move freely among the exhibits with plenty of room and time to read the well-crafted explanatory texts and spend time with each painting/photograph. Check online for the current exhibits, but it's well worth a visit anytime to see the permanent exhibits and enjoy the beauty of the structure itself and the surrounding gardens. BTW, grab a bite at the cafe there—lots of choices and good food.",mmmerrimac
50,"Great art, and cool views of the ciy.","Great destination, even in the dead of summer. There are plenty of indoor exhibits to view if you need a break from the heat. The outdoor installations and landscaping are awesome. If you enjoy walking, skip the line for the tram and walk up the hill.",Jacob B
50,You have to take the tram,The large parking garages are a ways from the museum and you take a free tram to get there. In addition to the collection also see the Gardens. I especially liked the Turner's.,Mark P
50,Great for everyone!,"I absolutely loved this destination. I took the transit here and it took about 90 minutes to get here from Universal City area. Upon arrival, whether you drive or transit, there is a free tram that will take you to the top of the hill to The Getty Center.There are tours available, which I believe is every hour for architecture and/or the garden. I did the tour that included both. It was fascinating to learn about the design and how much nature played a role in every element of the design. The tour was 45 minutes and I added more time outside on my own. I probably spend 90 minutes outside and finally went inside to visit the exhibits.Be sure to eat at the cafe! The food gets bragging rights!!!If you only have 2 hours here, it can be done in that timeframe. I spent more than 3 hours.",isabel4
50,Worthwhile experience,"Great experience and a must on your list in Los Angeles. It’s free to enter but if you go by car it’s $15 parking. If you spend 5 hours (which is the minimum) you will have to eat as well. awesome restaurant with quick choices and not too expensive. Good variety of art. The pavilion with the Van Gogh Irises has some very good other paintings as well, but overall much more than paintings. Most breathtaking all around views of LA. The campus itself is worth to see. The garden not too big but a great treat. Will I go again? Yes.",Henry Venter

50,Architecture Tour,"Being a docent at Hollyhock House, a Frank Lloyd Wright house/museum in Hollywood, I was particularly interested in the history of the building of The Getty. The Architectural Tour they give is as fascinating as the exhibits, themselves, and it did not disappoint. We were told of the stipulations the city imposed upon the builders in order to get approval for the project and most of them seemed insurmountable. Hearing explanations of how they were able to complete this museum in the sky is in and of itself, worth a trip to the Getty.",Dbozz

50,Sensory Overload,"I attended this museum with my family and I can tell you that one day devoted to this museum isn't enough. In hindsight I would have taken about three days to go through it all. I think if you have only one day, you find out where all the various collections are in advance and make a plan of attack to attend only those, because trust me on this, this place is HUGE! And it's easy to get distracted. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking, and layer. In winter California is not the warm place depicted in the movies.

50,Stunning,"What an extraordinary place! The architecture and views are worth the visit on their own, but when you take in what may be the best collection of European art in the USA, it is worth a full day or more to visit. I highly recommend that you take the highlights tour, which,in our case, was led by an extremely helpful guide. Give yourselves lots of time to take it all in, because this is a truly exceptional museum.",Dapper1
50,This place is amazing,My wife and I visited the Getty on a Friday. The ride up the site was great on a train rail system. When we got to the top we got our selves oriented to the site. We then started to walk our way around. The site is so big it will take you awhile to see everything. We were there for four hours and still didnt see it all. We hit all the high points we wanted to see and it still took the four hours. The architecture of this place is amazing. All the wall look like they were hand carved and hand set cause all of the panels fit perfectly. I was very impressed with all the items they had on display. I would highly recommend visiting The Getty.,David L
50,Best Views in LA,"Come to the Getty Center for the drop dead gorgeous views from downtown LA to the coast!

50,Take a break from the craziness!,"I had to move away from Los Angeles before finally taking the time to visit The Getty Museum. I visited during the week, by myself. The parking is easy, and a tram will take you, stress free, up to the top of the hill. It is a museum, but it is also an island of calm above the crazy world below. The space is expansive, and will offer the best view of L.A. that I can remember. Peaceful. The gardens, beautiful. Take a break from the crazy. Visit The Getty.",William L

50,The Getty,"Spent a day at the Getty in November 2018. An absolute must see. I was there on Saturday, Nov. 24. It was very crowded but not unmanageable. The exhibits were fantastic. Got to see Van Gogh's ""Irises"" . The campus of the museum is high up on a hill with a fantastic views of Los Angeles. I was told on a real clear day one could see Catalina Island. ""Nudes of the Renaissance"" was the featured exhibit while I was there.",mark n
50,definitely go,"The Getty is an absolutely stunning property with an amazing collection -- even if you never went inside, standing on the outer walk ways looking out over the gardens over the city is reason enough to go. The Van Goghs just add to it.",mpedicone28

50,Excellent,"You will need several hours to quickly see most of the exhibits at the Centre. A day would be better. It holds many hundreds of wonderful items from sculptures, paintings, drawings and furnishings as well as special exhibits which could contain anything. The Centre is a large collection of buildings, all with easy access, especially for persons with mobility problems. All have elevators.There are a number of restaurants and cafes and the restrooms we visited were spotless. (A credit to a six star hotel)From the main entrance a tram will take you uphill to the Centre. Enter the first building up the steps from the tram stop, see the good folk at the Information Desk and grab a map. Guided tours are available.Highly recommended",Richard T
50,Not to be missed,Loved our recent visit to the Getty. Great value with ni entry fee and charges for parking only. Stunning sculpture gardens and diverse galleries. Loved the painting gallery in particular. A wonderful place to spend 2-3 hours or more depending on your art interests.,mpin
50,Do not hesitate to take the time to visit,"The Getty Center is incredible. Some basics: easy to get to, easy to park at and inexpensive. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Maps are provided to navigate the exhibits.And then there is the architecture, the gardens and the art work! We only had part of a day to spend there and I wished I could have returned a second day to spend more time. Definitely on the list for my next visit to L.A. Don't miss it.",wilson207
50,"Fabulous in every respect, An absolute must see","The best art museum I've been to a n a long time. Why? The art itself is excellent but there are many other better collections. The sculpture gardens and the formal gardens are stunningly beautiful but I've been to better and larger. The architecture is wonderful and at times breathtaking but I've seen more interesting. What I've never seen a better combination of all three like this Centre. Plus it has the absolute best, not to be missed short introductory film that most people see before viewing the museum. Absolute must see every time you go to Los Angeles. And it's FREE.",Chinapjs
50,The Architechture Though,"This museum is amazing. It's one of those places that you want to go just to read a book, even if you're not in the mood for art that day.Obviously it's free. (But you do have to pay for parking)They have an amazing art collection, but I can honestly say that the architecture alone is worth the visit.",M H
50,Fabulous architecture and views,"Really, really pleased we took the time to visit the Getty Centre.

40,Just before the fire,Amazing views. Amazing experience. Get there early. There is a secret discovered in every room. Just ask!,Rubten
50,A must see,We have visited the Getty twice now while in SoCal and have enjoyed it both times. There is so much to see that it can’t be done in a single day if you really want to take it in. Great thing is it is free other than a parking charge ($15?).Has some static displays and some displays that change from time to time. Really enjoyed the photography displays.,L T
40,Views and art,"The Getty combines different experiences. Besides the usual art experience, there is the garden and the view. The decorative arts exhibit is breathtaking, but it was the only permanent exhibit I saw. Of the travelling exhits we say the Renaissance nudes was enjoyable, the photographs were mixed. The gardens with its maze in pool. The problem was that the exhibits were spread out with many stairs and hidden elevators. We spend a full half hour finding our first exhibit. Not a good place if you have mobility problems. My friend used an umbrella as a cane and had to leave it outside of every exhibit. The cafe was also pretty good and rasonable.",risinggr
50,Incredible Views And Art,"We went earlier in the year when there were some interesting exhibits of religious and Egyptian artifacts. We also enjoyed the impressionism room and more. But the best part was the fantastic views of LA, it was so great to just stand in the gardens and look out at the ocean",Chrisounds
50,Could spend all day here!,"We spent 3 hours at the Getty & saw 2 of the exhibits and walked around the gardens. Wow! What a beautiful place! Wish we would have had longer so that we could see some of the permanent collections & spent more time in the gardens.We started the architectural tour - but I being as these are run by volunteers I can see that they would vary greatly depending on your guide. Ours was quiet, and seemed new/nervous.Get a map as we did get a little confused on buildings, but i'm sure after a couple hours there you'd have no problems navigating. Such a wonderful place and the fact that it is free to visit is just fantastic!",Steph&BenTravel
50,Awesome Trip,"Really interesting place, the scenery was beautiful, the ride up was awesome, and the architecture was absolutely amazing. Definitely sit in on one of the guided tours if you have time, there is a ton of information to add to the experience. Bonus, it was a free trip! Highly suggest checking it out!",Kelsey W
50,"Beautiful, worth a visit","Beautiful museum grounds, highly worth visiting. The views of LA are great from here. There are a number of tours that can be taken to add to the visiting experience - architecture, garden, or of specific exhibits. We took the architecture tour to learn more about the style in which the museum was built - it was very informative. The exhibits rotate around also; we checked out a couple of them. It's a fun place to take visitors. You can easily spend the whole day there to see all the exhibits. If coming on the weekend, I recommend coming as early as you can to beat the afternoon crowds! Bring a picnic to have in the gardens. $15 parking, museum entrance is always free.",Karolina N
50,Picturesque,The museums and gardens if the Getty Center are absolutely stunning. What is amazing is that to visit this beautiful place it costs you absolutely nothing to get in. We spent a whole day there and enjoyed every minute of it,Berdy64
20,Best museum in LA but BE ADVISED,"There is no question The Getty is a spectacular place, but our experience was severely diminished due to the wildly inappropriate advice of one of the museum's employees.While waiting for the tram in a very long line, we realized we only had about 60 mins to spend before having to leave for a family event. So we asked an employee how long it would take to walk up to the museum, thinking it might spare us time, since we saw others leave the line specifically to do this.She replied, ""About 10 minutes."" I asked if it was a difficult walk and she stated, ""No, not a problem"". Bear in mind my 78 year old mother was with us and in high heels, which we noted.But still, there were no discouraging words or even a basic heads-up that this was a LEGITIMATELY uphill trek -- that took my mom at least 20-25 solid (cardio) minutes to complete. By the time our group reached the top of the hill we were all sweaty (and furious). Had it just been young adults that would have been one thing. But we had an elderly woman with us and this was our 1st time at the Getty, so we had no idea what to expect. Around every turn we hoped to arrive at the museum yet the walk just went on and on, as our mom was struggling and embarrassed she could not keep up.So we are asking the museum to please post signs or STRONGLY discourage elderly guests from considering this climb. Please clarify to visitors that only those of certain fitness levels (with appropriate shoes) should walk up this mountain. Please advise employees of the risks they are enabling -- especially if there are visitors with heart conditions.This was not an easy or leisurely 10 minute affair and I sincerely hope no other guests are made to feel this wiped out before even arriving. Our mother spent the remaining time in the cafeteria because she was so tired afterwards -- she did not even get a chance to enjoy the museum itself.This should never have happened.",roxyv3000
50,Most beautiful museum on the West Coast,"This is an amazing and beautiful museum. The architecture, landscaping and location all combine to make this a spectacular visit. Then they pack the place full with, currently and probably usually, a lovely art collection. Do not miss the garden. This is a must visit for all architecture, art and landscaping enthusiasts. Plus it's free! Get the ipod-audio tour, but bring your own headphones. Only bummer is that the food is ho-hum.",philboyett
50,Fantastic place for art lovers!!,"A nice place with numerous art collections, especially paintings!Van gogh’s Irises itself can eat an hour of yours if you are a van gogh lover!Young girl defending Eros painting is an another masterpiece!!Soft warning-Better not to go with age of children who could not interpret/understand nude art!

50,Great afternoon at the Getty Center,"Too much to see in one afternoon. We enjoyed the special exhibits we saw, and the impressionist art. The setting and architecture and view are all beautiful, as are the gardens. We really enjoyed our visit here.",Patrick S
50,Architecture & Gardens!,"If I were a Getty director and the architect would have shown me structures all faced in monochromatic stone I'd have said ""What?!"" And I would have been so very wrong! It's visually stunning! And there's a garden with views of Los Angeles to the sea that is unparalled. They have tons of money and consistently buy up art auctions. Some is quite nice. But don't expect the actual art to match L'Ermitage or the Louvre or the entire center of Florence. But for Los Angeles this is a must visit!",MediaByte

50,New favorite art museum—worldwide,"It took me 5 years of periodic visits to LA before I got the chance to visit the Getty. Wish I could have gotten there sooner so I could go there more before my LA visits come to and end. Anyhow, this is my new favorite art museum—worldwide! I drove there myself and with god assistance had no trouble. It’s $15 to park and there are no porking options besides their garage. From parking it’s a walk or pleasant tram ride up to the majestic museum. Stunning hillside views all the way. Once at the museum the view of Los Angeles and beyond are stunning! Getty knew what he was doing when he picked this spot. The building(s) are artwork unto themselves. The collection here is both broad and deep. It amazes the viewer at the extent of the holdings. Multiple visits would be required to fully appreciate all of the artwork, but an initial visit with well chosen pieces on which to focus is extremely enjoyable. The exhibitions are very well curated and are interesting and inspiring. The Pastels exhibition was particularly enjoyable. I can’t say enough wonderful things about the Getty.",C H
50,Beyond Amazing,Even if you are not an art expert this is a fantastic place to visit with beautiful gardens and views over the city with an excellent cafe. The art is mind blowing and acres of beautiful Italian marble and vistas at every turn,Karribubbles

The qmqxing story around the building and the selection of the travertine marble, in and of itself, caught and kept the attention of my wife, me and most remarkably, my three teenaged children. The idea that the investment in the quarry in Italy was so large that it completely revitalized the quarry and created a complete revival of the surrounding town. On top of that the views and the exhibitions, in particular,the displays of entire living rooms/bedrooms from periods gave the kids a whole view into an era gone by.

50,A great cultural outing on a nice day.,"High above the 405 sits the majestic Getty Center. Full of paintings, sculptures, gardens and architecture. I have been here a handful of times over the years and always discover something new. On my last trip I strolled through the gardens, which until then never knew they existed, since I was always focused on the indoor exhibits on previous visits. On a clear day you can see forever, however a cloudy day takes just as nice a photo as well. I only visit when they have a exhibit that interests me but it was a very nice visit. Free admittance, but it is smarter to car pool for $15 parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142lp

50,A Must See in LA for Art Lovers,"Plan a day at the Getty. The collection is simply world class and the research and exhibitions never fail to deliver. A very wide spectrum of periods, nations and selections of art objects. All presented in a manner that one can get personal with the objects and explore the culture that produced them. The audio devices are very effective and if your group gets ready for a break there a choices for food and/or light refreshments. The views from the terraces are unique and deliver up that excellent view of the Pacific. The garden is also well worth the trek to tour. The elevators make the garden accessible for everyone.Take a lunch, or choose one of the food options there. One can pace so that an entire day can be spent here without getting exhausted. Be sure and take time to relax, enjoy the scenery and the incredible collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7275MXpauld

50,Amazing teen getaway at the Getty,"It's not easy to engage a teenager, on a weekend afternoon if you're their parent. We're not exactly high on the priority list. So I was delighted when I took my 17-year-old son to see the Renaissance exhibit at the Getty. Within moments after exiting the tram and before entering the doors, he stopped and took in the incredible surroundings. ""Wow, it's gorgeous here,"" he said as he exhaled. It had been at least five years since he'd been there - an eternity had passed through his point of view. The Renaissance exhibit had a through line about women and their role and power from the perspective of the culture at that time. It was curated in such a way that the parallels with our current times did not go unnoticed for either of us. Very powerful and stirring. Afterwards, walking on the grounds and into some of the collections would have been welcome, but we had so much to digest and share with one another, that we decided to head to the restaurant and debrief instead. A favorite afternoon for the record...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture564539

There is a shuttle train that takes you up the mountain to the museum.The day that we were there was absolutely perfect weather wise.

We had a docent tour, seeing the gardens, and then watched a short film. Then we used the headsets they offer, to tour the other areas. Enjoyed our lunch here at their patio cafe but, as might be expected, lunch was pricey-$19 for a wrap, a soda, and bag of chips. A very ordinary lunch at extraordinary price.

50,"Take the [free] ""architecture"" tour - a highlight","We found one of the highlights of a visit to the Getty is their 45 minute (no charge) tour that takes you through the history of the construction and structure of the buildings. Gives a really good overview of the five different functions of the Getty Center. Runs about 8 times a day, on the half hour, up until about 3:30; meets outside just opposite the main entrance, under three large trees.Note that, while the average museum visit runs about 2.5 hours, the Getty is designed to have multiple different areas and settings, and a relaxed atmosphere that supports visits of 4 to 5 hours without exhausting the visitor.[ I leave specific descriptions of the good collection to others who present a more detailed description of the works]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickdoestravel

50,"Good permanent collection and great exhibits, fantastic property","The Getty Center is always a must visit. Here is an important note though. First, if you're an avid museum-goer, please realize that while it has a good collection, you need to adjust your expectations. It's not your typical European style museum. Second, yes, it's not your typical European style museum, so do make sure you enjoy all the extras, such as breathtaking views, beautiful architecture and gardens (tours of the grounds and gardens are a must), sunsets are to die for. If you strategically plan your timing to sit outside and dine right before the sunset and through the sunset, you will not regret it. Note: try to avoid weekends, it gets really crowded. The tram from a parking lot to the museum doesn't have any a/c. Yes, you heard it right. It's a short ride, but on a hot Cali day... you know what I mean. The Icons of Style exhibit was fantastic. I personally never manage to cover the whole museum, I prefer to make targeted visits and focus on certain exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lana_Calif
50,Gorgeous architecture and garden,"The building and grounds are gorgeous. I spent at least an hour walking around outside the museum, taking pictures of the beautiful buildings and trees, and sitting in the garden.

The tram from parking to the center afforded a beautiful view of the area and then once up at museum itself, we were able to see the city and the ocean. We had lunch at their cafe. The selection of food was varied, but the cost was on the higher side. Was very pleased though that they had glasses for water and we weren’t required to buy bottled water.

40,A must see museum in LA,"The entrance is free but if you arrive with your own vehicle you have to park on the premises and you have to pay for it. Apart from that, it is a very nice experience. It is more than a museum in a sense. There are several buildings with different concepts. There is a beautiful garden to stop by. There is a nice restaurant and there are several kiosks where you can get coffee and snacks. It is better to check out its website to learn about the current exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sakaerka

The only fee is $15 for parking. The art displayed is stunning. The Getty Center was so worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopstickmama
50,So LA!! You get in free; your car needs a ticket!,"If you're from Europe or the East Coast, don't bother going inside The Getty Center's museum areas as you will be disappointed. However, no matter where you are from, saunter the grounds of the Getty, enjoy its landscaped gardens, its hardscape, its views from terraces at various levels facing different directions, the outdoor sculpture gardens (one is almost hidden), and its amazing restaurant.The entire experience is worth a 3-4 hour visit, including lunch.

50,Go for the Art and the Views,"This is a must see and do during a stay in Los Angeles. We only had one full day in LA. You get incredible value for your free entry into the center. During our visit the center opened at 10am. We had read about limited parking so we arrived early. They do not open their garage until 9:30 so I would arrive just after or at the quarter hour. The parking garage is not free and was $15. After a tram ride up the hill explore the grounds as you are elevated to great views of the city, especially from the terraces of the pavilions. It had rained that morning so the central gardens were closed. We spent about 4 hours and was able to see all the exhibits excluding the gardens. They have rotating exhibitions so repeat visits will go rewarded with new experiences. They have free tours and a free audio guide on a iPod Touch. Be sure to visit the European Paintings which included Monet, Manet, Degas, Van Gogh and others. They have multiple areas to purchase food including a sit down service, cafeteria style and grab and go sandwiches and salads. We walked right in at 10am with zero crowd. When we left at 2pm it was crazy busy and the line to get onto a tram was jam packed. This is a great way to spend the morning of a limited stay in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urbanacheiver

We had all our luggage with us, but this was no problem because they have a left luggage facility where we could drop our cases before hopping on the monorail up to the center. The staff were really friendly and helpful.Like a lot of places in LA it has an uber drop off and pick up point, which makes things a lot easier too.The center itself was amazing: the art, the architecture, the gardens and rooftops. I was particularly taken with the cacti. There are some fantastic views of LA too.Food wise, the cafe was great (didn't go to the restaurant) - canteen style with multiple options, including several veggie and vegan choices. There were also several coffee carts dotted around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teacatten
50,Wonderful place - great museum,"The architecture of the buildings and the gardens is already worth going for, and it is for free ! Very nice exhibitions and good for lunch as well. One of the nicest museums we have visited (with family).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGC14
50,It feels like your no longer in LA,The Getty Center is truly a gem in LA. Aside from being a museum that’s worth checking out it is a great location to get a great view of the LA area. The architecture itself is outstanding and the sorrounding campus has a very relaxing ambiance. It almost feels like it’s a place among the clouds rather than a place in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1677CVjosep
50,Fantastic!,"This museum is fantastic, and the view, especially on a clear day, is breath-taking. Free parking. Free entry. Can't be beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseR3184
50,World class location,"The museum blends American architecture and European art in a perfect way. There is a very efficient parking system and already the scenic trip with the cablecar to the entrance of the museum is worth the visit. At the entrance, you will be delighted to be informed that there is no fee for tickets. It makes sense to join one of the many available tours or to get a guide system. Calculate to stay two or three hours. There are different lunch options. Most elegant is the restaurant which offers a great menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulSalz
50,Amazing!,"Best art museum in Los Angeles County! Not to be missed. The outside building is art, and inside the collection is fantastic. They often have rotating displays of both local and international artists from all over the world. Beautiful place to come visit. I cannot recommend this venue enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
50,Unique experience in the middle of LA,"The location is amazing. Who would expect this place exists in the middle of busy LA.The architecture is artistic and allows plenty of sunlight in the most beautiful garden.This is all just to house one of the best art collection in the USA - from the fine arts of the pre and renaissance periods, I'm not much of a modern art person, but even those are amazing.It is all free. This is a must if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funholiday70

50,Amazing,"There was nothing to fault, the presentation, the guides, everything was perfection. We used the baggage check function and were grateful to store our bags for the day. We struggled to see everything in a day, it was just so amazing, standing in a room with a Van Gogh, a Monet, a Renoir, a Rodin and a Gauguin, it takes your breath away. The audio guide was excellent, the gardens were art in themselves. This is food for your soul. I reccomend if ordering a ride share do it 15 minutes before you want to leave",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMinAdelaide

50,gorgeous gardens,"The Getty Center takes a little patience to get to, but once you're there, it's a beautiful place to be. The view of the westside of LA is great and the gardens are the reason a lot of locals visit regularly. The buildings themselves are architecturally as beautiful as any of the art housed inside them. Exhibits change so there's always something new to see--or to just spend an afternoon surrounded by flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288lollier
50,As beautiful outside as inside,The Getty is a wonderful place to spend a summer afternoon in LA. It's a little cooler in the hills and the gardens and outdoor spaces are beautiful places to have a picnic. There is also world famous artwork inside that has many traveling exhibitions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapman62
50,Jewel on the top of the hill,"It sounds trite, and it may have been said before, yet it can't be said too often: the Getty Museum is a wonderful place. Pay for parking (slight discount after 3 PM) and then transition from the ordinary to the sublime museum that is the Getty. They will check your bags for security before you board the monorail, or you can walk up the pedestrian walkway. You arrive at a plaza with amazing views along the perimeter. Italian travertine is one of the major materials on the lower walls and covering the plaza and walkways. Enamel clad aluminum is featured on many of the walls as well, The openness and views make it a wonder if you ever go inside to view the artworks! And then there are the gardens....save a few days to visit this museum, and to save some money on parking, take the bus and a picnic. But the museum is free to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4831NRruthm
50,Always Something Interesting to See,"There are several buildings to visit. Depending on the time period or artist, you can target an exhibit to explore. Audio tours are available, but I prefer doing without and reading the placard with the information about it better. There are two places to eat, one is a restaurant and the other is like a cafeteria. Prices are a medium to high and the food is good. Plan on taking a whole day to explore and leisurely enjoy the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlorenceW609

The art collections were impressive. The gardens are lovely. Cute tram ride up to the center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros_Mel2014
50,"Great for art, architecture and a view of Los Angeles","I can never really get enough of The Getty Center. It’s like the MET was in New York for me, an endlessly fascinating source of inspiration that I look at a bit differently every time I visit. LEED-certified and designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Richard Meier - it is like a beacon on a hill at the edge of the Santa Monica Mountains. Just one of the many legacies left behind by eccentric J. Paul Getty, the millionaire oil tycoon and philanthropist. From the road it looks almost small at times, with half of most of the buildings that make up the site hidden underground, in order to comply with height restrictions; but when you start to read about how it was constructed or you see aerial photos - it’s clear how big it is. 16,000 tons of travertine stone from Italy cover some of my favorite parts of the complex. The panels are fascinating because, having been split along the natural grain, they reveal fossilized leaves, feathers and branches. It’s all so modern and yet so grounded once you take the time to look closely. I love their temporary exhibitions, which right now include on outstanding one on fashion photography and another with all the treasures of ancient Egypt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana

40,Art is outside too,"When I thought about the Getty the Picassos, Rembrandts, etc, are what came to mind. However there is a whole world of art outside in the garden. It was nice to be able to spend a few hours outside walking through the gardens, listening to the water, and just sitting and contemplating in a lush oasis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimn843

50,Beautiful gardens and view of Los Angeles and the ocean on a clear day.,"It was my first visit, which is embarrassing given I've lived in Los Angeles all my life. From the moment we walked up the steps leading to the main building, I felt we were entering a rarefied environment reminiscent of Greek and Roman architecture combined with modern building styles. The highlight of our trip was the tour of the gardens, led by an experienced volunteer guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreapandria68
50,The Getty Center - Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is a great place and spectacular location to take visitors to Los Angeles. It's perfect for family trips too and inexpensive. The beautiful, well-tended gardens and design, and plazas with art and terrific cityscape views are captivating and fun to experience. There are many areas to sit to enjoy these views, so you can bring children and elderly visitors.Of most interest to me, are the special exhibits that feature world class artists. There are superb photography exhibits, and interesting prints, drawings, painting and sculpture shows. To see the art and have a leisurely stroll through the garden, especially when in peak bloom, is an unforgettable experience. I highly recommend it to all visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wing_11

The museum has pieces from all eras and schools. Truly amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsJ9312VU
50,Gorgeous place!,"It is always hard, traffic-wise, to get to the Getty Center. But, wow, is it worth it! The place itself is magnificent. Unlike many other California venues, no matter how many people are at the Center on any given day, it never feels crowded. It is spacious, airy, light, with amazing views and many places to sit outside and enjoy life. As for inside, I have visited more than six times, and I have not yet managed to see everything there is to see inside! This is a MUST. Do not miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndavis2019

50,One Fine Day,"One of the most iconic things you can do in Los Angeles is visiting The Getty Center. Set aside all the fantastic art and special exhibits, which are stunning, the museum itself is an architectural masterpiece that perfectly compliments the California landscape in which it is uniquely nestled with incredible gardens and sweeping views. It's worth your time just to take in the beautiful vistas on a nice day. I always enjoy having lunch in the cafeteria and taking a bit of time to sit on the grass and take in the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W44YGdavidf
50,Getty Yourself To This Prime Free Attraction,"What an enormous and unexpected delight. Truly more magnificent in person than any reviews you will read. Delightfully top heavy with staff and docents eager to please. Make time for the free group tours. We took two - one on French Impressionism, the other on the architecture of the complex.

50,Beautiful Visit,"Spent a short afternoon at the Getty which just left me wanting more time. Got to see what I wanted, impressionists and the palace rooms. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of Monet paintings on display. In addition, the views of Los Angeles are not to be missed.My regret is that I wish I had more chance to explore the gardens and other galleries. Since the Getty has free admission and inexpensive parking, I will definitely be coming back to check out what I missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trueanomaly
50,Appropriately #1 in LA!,"Outstanding art, architecture, views, and gardens! It is pure joy to be able to visit The Getty Center! This is the most wonderful place to introduce friends, family, or children to art. It is so rare to be able to see so many famous paintings for free. It is absolutely worth the drive.

50,Just an amazing museum,"Everything about it made for a perfect day. Between the architecture (which is art in it's own) to the stunning panoramic views, to the art (probably the country's finest collection outside NYC or the Smithsonian) to the unique and delicious dining options, everything about it was breathtaking. When you travel to LA, try to remember the city has world class culture outside of cinema, dining and Sunset Blvd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodiega

I kept telling them, it's not just about the art, it's about the space...and they totally got it - the gardens and the courtyards, and the buildings, and the cactus gardens were all our favorite parts of our visit.The STAFF is AMAZINGLY friendly! We museum quite a bit, and I have never had such nice interactions with staff, everyone from the awesome guy in the gift shop, to the super fun people cooking and serving the food in the café. I noticed several security guards checking in with people in the nicest way. I hope someone from the Getty HR department reads this - because it was just one more little thing that makes the Getty such a special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisaeck
40,Not to be missed,"I spent a really interesting 3 hours visiting the Getty Centre. I particularly enjoyed the impressionist art in the West Pavilion and also the photo exhibition there about fashion. The latest acquisition in the North Pavilion, a 12th Century Torah acquired through the Rothschild family, is spectacular. The Centre is spacious and well laid out. Entrance is free, and easy to use audio guides are provided, also free of charge. My only complaint is that when my husband tried to drive to the Centre, he could not find the way into the public parking. Much clearer road signs for visitors trying to drive there would be very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephineF999
50,Recommended by a friend,Good parking facility and a small train / monorail will take you up the hill to the museum. You can spend as much time in the gardens and around the museum as in the museum itself. It is a beautiful place you can easily spend 2-3 hours there. You can get a good cup of coffee and sit in either the sun or shade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_satulagi66

40,Great European collection,"Since this is mainly the collection that Jean Paul Getty collected himself, it is mostly European art. It was his generosity left in his will of creating this place to showcase his collection. As with other museums, there will be temporary exhibits that are not in his collection. His personal collection is very impressive. Depending on what temporary exhibits comes to town, those could be just as impressive.I went there while the Egyptian art a small collection from Versailles were visiting. I'm not into that a whole lot but what was exhibited was nice and they did a good job with the layout.The garden is also very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razorwan

40,Lovely gardens and views,"Let’s start with the view - it’s amazing. As the Getty Centre is placed on a hill, you can take photos all around giving you a 360 degree snapshot of LA. It would be best to go on a nice sunny day, as there is still a lot of smog.The outdoor garden area was my highlight. It has beautiful plants/trees, as well as streams, fountains and seating areas. All of these areas are great for photos. We spent most of our time outside - try and walk around the space as much as you can as there is a lot to see.Inside is clean and spacious. To be honest we aren’t the biggest art fans so we only went to a few exhibits but were impressed with what we saw and it was all very interesting. There are clear maps and the special exhibits were done very well.What’s free: entry to the museum and gardens, self audio tours with an iPod touch & headphones, umbrellas for shade/protection, and wifi.What costs: parking ($15), food and drinks from the cafe, museum merchandise, payphones, and guided tours.I’m glad we went as we weren’t planning to, and would go again for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb

It's a truly wonderful place, with an impressive art collection, located in a surrounding of amazing architecture, beautiful gardens, and the peaceful sounds of running water from the many fountains on the grounds. There is also lots of outdoor shaded space to enjoy when you want to take a break from the galleries, and although there were many school groups visiting while I was there, it never felt crowded.

50,Went for Egyptian Exhibit - Stayed for the Gardens,"Decided to go to The Getty to check out an Egyptian exhibit. You park at the bottom and take a tram up to the top where the Getty is. The exhibit had a free audio tour curated by employees of the Getty. The audio tour was full of insightful information. The Getty is a big museum. Give yourself plenty of time for the exhibits and to explore the grounds. The Getty has wonderful gardens for photos, exploring, or just reading a good book. There are also wonderful views of the surrounding hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidFrmTexas
50,The Getty Center is a Amazing Museum,"Well, if J. Paul Getty had ""All the Money in the World"" during his life, his family has sure put it to good use after his death. This is quite a place, an architectural gem to be sure. While I'm not a huge fan of anything but modern art, the original Van Gogh and a couple of other paintings were fantastic to see. There was a special exhibit on women and art which was also pretty cool. It's a huge place that could easily take 8 hours to see, we spent about half of that and saw quite bit. The museum overlooks LA and has spectacular views all around. There is a garden on one side that is also unique and original and worth a visit. You pay for parking and the museum charges no admission which was another benefit. It's easy to get to from downtown LA. I'd put this on my ""Must Do"" list for anyone who visits LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megson310
50,Quick visit to see Impressionist paintings,Enjoyed Irises by Van Gogh and other works by Impressionists. There is much more to see here than can fit in a one-day visit. Staff are very helpful and cordial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethB5156
50,Much More Than A Museum,"You need to visit and experience The Getty Center to discover that it is much more than a museum. The Getty Center encompasses several buildings of modern design, open spaces, and breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside and the various internal fountains and gardens separating the buildings. The food available at The Getty Center is made with locally sourced ingredients, served with incredible views, and is very good. There are also various museums to tour, one includes European and American art, from medieval times to the present.

30,Beautiful Gardens Great Exhibitions,"A short easy drive from our hotel in Hollywood. When you arrive you are directed to a large multi-storey car park, other than food this is the only thing we had to pay for. There is a tram which takes you from the car park to the centre, you can walk but its a steep hill to take on in the August sunshine.There is a free audio tour which is worth taking it gives lots of additional information about the exhibits. The volunteers and staff are all friendly and helpful.The gardens are beautiful with parasols provided. We spent a long time admiring the works of art on display, there was also an Egyptian exhibition which was fascinating.In total we were there for about 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959melaniea
50,Tale of Two Cities,"From the Desert to the Sea the TWO Getty Museums of Art-Architecture Design tells the story of a Man SO RICH that he Never Visited either one! So? You say! J. Paul Getty had a simple plan. Buy or make offers No One would Refuse...EVERY piece of Ancient to European Art that was not nailed down! First, One Must like Art. Art of the Ancients and Art the French parlayed for Two hundred years. If looking at naked cherubs or discussing impressionistic Monet’s is not on your palette. All is not lost! Though not through the eyes of JP Getty. The docents at the museum will expand and demand your attention to the Architecture-architectural designs which are only limited by what THEY know. From the rise and fall of sculptured eating areas. To how Roof-floor beams can motivate your eyes as never before! The Getty Museum got it Right! This is a MUST SEE in L.A. and best of all.... IT IS COMPLETELY FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesR2784SM

50,Forever LA Gem,"The Getty should be re-named “The LA Forever Gem”, since besides the marvels of art the grounds are exquisite and the price for admission is outstanding. The Getty is magical for me as a mature person who enjoys all forms of creativity, but if paintings or photography or sculpture don’t entice you, relax on the lawn and take in the beauty of the garden. Come prepared to spend the day and immerse yourself in the splendor of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370junew
50,Awestruck,"Words do not give this center any justice. It is a place that inspires one to be more creative, more observant of people and soak-in nature all whilst moving through exhibits and educational bookstores and shops.I also enjoyed the brunch at the restaurant, where the staff was so professional and polite, I left a 40 percent tip for my waiter so he would end the end feeling as good as he made me feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytoousa

40,A beautiful place!,"We visited here in August 2018 on the last day of our holiday. The parking was easy and free, plus then a tram up to the centre. We chose to walk up as the queue for the tram was quiet long. It was a 15 minute walk on an easy pathway.The centre is a imposing but beautiful building. The art work it contains was very impressive. My favourites were the impressionist works of Monet, Manet, Renoir and Van Gogh. The fact that the centre is free to visit makes it all the more impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3269CEsarahb
50,Outstanding museum and grounds.,You pay to park but there is no fee to enter the exhibits and walk the grounds it's a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. There's so many design features to the building you can spend all day just looking at the buildings. The collection of antiquities is amazing .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hendersoned
50,Take the whole day,"From the architecture, to the view over LA, to the collections, to the gardens, this place is worth every dollar. O wait, admission is free (apart from the parking)! We spent the whole day here, and were surprised that they were ""suddenly"" closing.Absolutely mesmerizing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knightshift
50,Not just amazing but its FREE,This place is huge and the lay out is beautiful. We didn't get the chance to cover the whole museum but you can easily spend the entire day there. I can't believe it was free. Can't wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janete933
50,A wonder of its own magnificence!,The Getty really speaks for it self. No review can do it justice. I especially like the setting and the grounds. It’s so well done and you can just take your time enjoying the exterior space as well as the fine arts within its walls. A couple of hours here will really do the trick and feed your culture vulture. Make reservation this place is popular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcalkid

50,"Always Alive, Fun, Educational, & Free","We went on a sunny, hot Saturday afternoon in August as did many others, but I would go again. In addition to quality exhibits and superb objects, the crowd control made our visit worthwhile. The tram and security lines moved along and visitors were given the option to walk to the center; we did on the downhill return to the parking garage. Along the way were posted guides to answer directional questions, help everyone make the most of their visit and keep folks away from the outdoor sculpture. At one point live music wafted across the complex. And it's all free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
30,Beautiful gardens but exhibits too Eurocentric!,"I visited Getty with my daughter who loves museums and it was a wonder to watch her delight for the beautiful grounds, the wonderful floral arrangements, but sad to see her disappointment as a fashion designer, at the lack of representation of Black fashionistas and designers as well as those from other races for the installation on ""ICONS of Fashion"". She also felt that the Egypt exhibit reinforced racist exclusionary ideas of Egypt being more European than African. We were delighted with the pictures within the student exhibit and were disappointed that there was no small cafe near the entrance as we waited for our Uber since the day was HOT and we had had no time to get a drink at one of the inside stands/cafes. The average assessment is because of the lack of overall diverse representations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184pb
50,Fabulous Museum!!,"First visit here & only had about 2 1/2 hrs, but was able to see a lot in that time. I thoroughly enjoyed the Icons of Style special exhibit. All kinds of wonderful fashion, photos, paintings, and history thru the years. The permanent art collection is very impressive with all types of art & sculptures. I would love to return soon & spend more time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifersX1519IE
50,Fantastic (and free),"Definitely this is a place to visit in LA. OK, I love art -- I love paintings from the past... so, for me, this is much more important than a lot of other places in LA... if you are like me -- go there.NOTE -- GPS (like G...in and others) may not know where to go to go to the parking lot... better use Google Maps and your GPS in your head!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcinDrP
50,A worthwhile stop!,I believe it's a must stop to visit this beautiful museum while in LA. It offers a great collection of the arts that is spread out in various buildings not a typical museum where everything is house in one gigantic place. It makes it less stuffy where you can go out for fresh outdoor feel and a coffee break and later continue on to other collections. I really enjoy the outdoor layout of their gardens which is always well maintained. The view once you at the top is spectacular of LA. People picnic on grass or just in soak in the sun. You can easily spent a half day here without noticing the time. Admission to the Getty Center is free but parking is $15 per car and $10 after 3 pm. Closes on Mondays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryn496
50,Beautiful Art and City Views,What a great way to spend the day! Stunning city views! A great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Have lunch and enjoy all the art. A must do when in LA.With free admission how can you go wrong?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisalisa111
50,Best Museum In Los Angeles,"This is one beautiful well thought out museum. Stunning views, playful unique gardens, decent food and classy art work. Museum is free but you pay for parking. You catch a tram up to the museum, again check out the views as you ride up. I suggest when done if you have energy hike down, you will be treated to a sculpture garden and a nice stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kai-Surfrider
50,Great place to visit...even if you're not a big art fan,"My wife drug me there with some friends. It was actually a nice place to spend a couple hours. I am not much of an art fan so I poked fun at a lot of things I saw. Monet's Irises was there and I thought it was amazing to see the THICK paint and the way the light/shadows looked. It was free, except for the parking, which always costs too much in LA or any other city.I enjoyed the wood sculpture of a bird's nest and grape vine. The leaves were incredible. There was even furniture on exhibit. A word to the wary: They don't like you to lay in any of the beds or sit on any of the chairs or couches! They will actually BAN you from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrSpudd007
40,Lovely afternoon at the Getty,"We went to the fashion photography exhibit at 2:30pm on a weekday.Parking was an issue as we were Ina larger SUV and the parking spaces were very tight. We had to keep going down further and further into the garage to find a space we could fit into.The exhibit was gorgeous; amazing work from amazing photographers, however we wished there would’ve been more rhyme or reason to the way they were exhibited. Perhaps, by decade or some sort of theme per room would’ve been great.Other than those very minor issues, we absolutely loved our time at the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vetski
50,"A Los Angeles ""must-do""","I didn't know what to expect but so many people had told me to come so we did. So worth the visit even if you're not particularly interested in art or architecture (me). The attraction is free but parking is $15.00 (as of August 2018). That's a deal. You park then take a tram up to the center where you can get all the information you need. The tours are free and many are every hour. You can take specialty tours of the architecture, the gardens, and the impressionist paintings, among others. If you get a clear day I'm sure the views are outstanding (we didn't have a clear day). The gardens are lovely. There is abundant food and drink and places to sit. I came expecting to stay two or so hours and ended up staying five hours.One thing I really enjoyed about the Getty was that even though it got quite busy as the day progresses it never felt really crowded to me except in one room. I felt the planners did a great job thinking about space and how it would be used. Everything worked well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelviapurple

40,Worth to go and famous for a reason,"The Getty Center is famous for a reason. Besides the beautiful art and the special architectural designs, there is a lot of history behind the construction. It definite worth to rent the audio tour guide if you cannot join their alive walking tours. Both will give you plenty of information about the history of the construction and different meaning explanation about the art and different aspects of this place. Remember to wear comfortable shoes for plenty of walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/890vmk

Fantastic place for young and old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozziekeron
50,Great Taking,"Just lov this place. I think this is the best place to go for a few hours with my child. It's so nice, the weather is great durning the spring & we sit outside on the grass & have lunch. The garden we spend at least an hour is walking around. I bring my own lunch, it's free to get in and the tram ride up is nice. I like to go early in the morning for better parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natural1sumr
50,Get to the Getty,"Many years ago I visited the Getty Museum and it has changed for the better. The tram ride, visible from the highway, was less than five minutes. Wheelchairs were available for visiting the different levels with elevators conveniently located. The gardens were superb. Breathtaking views of LA are another plus. The sculptures were placed in the gardens were quite interesting. The featured exhibition, Beyond the Nile, was quite interesting and informative. Two papyrus scroll pieces talked about recipes for that time. A lot of history was there. We plan to go back when we have more time, but suffice it to say you should get to the Getty and see well-kept grounds and relaxing floral displays. Next time we will visit the Villa at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda

Parking is at the bottom of the hills, and a free tram takes you up the impressive structure overlooking the LA skyline and 405. The only cost to visit is parking ($15/day as of August 2018), charged because of LA by-laws. There are several restaurants and cafes in the complexes.

50,Calling all Art Lovers!,"If you are in California and have a penchant for all kinds of art, the Getty Museum cannot be missed! It has a variety of exhibits ranging from ancient Egyptian art to Impressionism. There is also an exhibit that rotates the type of art it displays, but unfortunately, it was closed when we got there. In addition to the art, the museum offers an incredible view of Los Angeles because the museum is situated on top of a hill. Speaking of which, there is a trolley to take to get to the museum. Admission is free. Parking is $15 before 3:00, after is $10. The meals are a bit pricey. Headphones can offer an enhanced audio experience and for people that have a visual impairment. A tip when going to the museum is make sure you look at the descriptions of the artwork and see if there is an icon that say ""no pictures allowed"" because the guards will stop you if you try to take a picture. I would recommend visiting Lilies by Van Gogh since it is beautiful with the colors of the flowers, and it's no wonder that there are quite a few people surrounding the painting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngtravellermc

Also, the kids area is fun and interactive... even for adults.Another great feature is it’s beautiful garden area. And look out for some fossil remains on the walls of the museum.Be sure to check out the sights of Westwood (you can see UCLA from there), Los Angeles, as well as the Pacific Ocean. You should also check for lectures that take place there, especially in the evenings because the museum is pretty majestic at night, especially when the numbers die down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AniGarib

You'll get some exercise and you'll get up there much faster!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erudite_journey
50,Truly magical,Highlight of my trip to LA and wished I could have stayed longer. The architecture is magical and you understand why it took 19 years to plan and build.

I want to go back for a full day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinb554

50,Getty Magic!!,Getty Museum Magic is waiting for you. You will love the Getty Museum so much you will want to join and go time and time again!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55Mickey
50,Wow 😮,"Perched high above Los Angeles is the magnificent Getty. Housing some of the most incredible artworks from the 1300s to 1900s, The Getty has something for everyone. Unless you are looking for female artists. Then, you might have to concentrate a bit more to find the only two on display out of hundreds.Despite that, The Getty offers a perfect day out. Tours run throughout the day and with five main buildings, you won’t run out of things to do!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blush1992
50,Family visit of The Getty Museum,"We spent a wonderful morning visiting The Getty Museum in LA. The architecture of the building is very appealing and the gardens are immaculately designed, groomed and kept.The access is easy and well organised. The art collections are beautifully displayed. We obviously did not have the time to visit all the pavilions but have browsed through few European collections from the 18th and 19th century. The whole experience is free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500alexandrek
50,Incredible!,"I spent a wonderful day exploring the Getty Center. I LOVE that it is free to the public. Everyone that works or volunteers there is so welcoming and the grounds are amazingly beautiful. I did four tours: Architecture, Garden, Beyond the Nile and Collection Highlights. All the tours are free, were excellent and the tour guides were very informative. The tours are a great way to see the Center if you are not sure where to start. I also saw the Photo exhibit which was very interesting. I did pick up the free audio tour when I arrived at 10:30 am, but because I did the tours, had lunch at the cafe and walked the garden, I never actually had time to listen to anything on the audio tour. There are also great views of Los Angeles. I left at 5:30 pm. It was a full day. Thanks for great visit. I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellermama
50,For the Art Lover,"The Getty Center is one of John Paul Gettys Collections of various forms of art. Very well maintained and beautifully designed. You may want to order your tickets online ahead of arrival, or they may ask you to go outside and reserve some and come back in, that happened to us, but luckily there was a long line and we were told to go ahead in. Lucky us, a free visit. There is no charge to visit but there is a parking fee. So if you are an art lover, this is a great place to stop and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15receptionist
50,Made my own perfume!,"We really enjoyed seeing the visiting exhibitions from Egypt and hands on perfume making. Had a chance to relive our visit to Italy with those pieces on display. The chance to see some of the priceless paintings was worth venturing into the heat. (Degas, Picasso, Monet, etc..) And it's FREE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paeshaw
50,Art collection & art destination.,What an adventure to drive here from LAX. Great parking area with shuttle up to entrance. Outstanding building houses amazing collection. Don't forget to step outside on balcony to view the skyline of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeisle17
40,Pretty cool if you like ancient Mediterranean cultures,"Poor jp Getty, he loved money so much he loathed to part with it. Part of his scam to avoid paying taxes and such he built a grand home and filled it with antiques. Most of the artifacts are from ancient Mediterranean cultures. Great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinSuz
50,"Spectacular setting, beautiful gardens and great exhibitions","The Getty is really a world class set of buildings - almost a modern day Acropolis, set well above all of Los Angeles, with views out to the ocean. The architecture is really compelling, airy and unexpectedly textured. The gardens are a big surprise - lots of plants that shouldn't really be next to one another, yet work well in this setting. A bit of a fairy tale.The permanent collection has some spectacular pieces, but what the Getty really excels at are special exhibitions. They have a great working relationship with museums and collectors from around the world, and can pull together some of the greatest shows you'll see in a museum anywhere. In addition, they have a continuing parade of special lectures, given by the greatest art experts in the world.Because the Getty is a major stop on the L.A. tourist route, you have to make sure you get to the museum early, to ensure that you don't get turned away at the garage (they frequently get full). There are also a couple of restaurant choices - one features cafeteria style dining, with foods from around the globe, and one is finer sit-down dining. Both are great options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chappsnet
50,A Must See Museum Experience,If you love art you must come to this museum. My son and I took an Uber from Burbank to visit the Getty. It's an unbelievable site. Beautiful grounds and gardens. And amazing art collections! I wish we would have had more time but we will definitely return again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistiMorningstar
50,Simply extraordinary!,"Earlier this year, I visited the Getty Center. I did and will never regret it. It is one of the nicest museums I have ever seen! Everything was great about it. The general atmosphere, the exhibits, the staff and it’s gorgeously beautiful gardens. I got to see amazing pieces of art by world renowned painters including Vincent Van Gogh, Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. On top of all of that, the admission is free of charge.Ps: from the top floors, you get one of the best views of LA’s mountainous and city skyline!Overall, amazing visit! The Getty Center is definitely a must see!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb3003

50,Amazing Free Museum,"In order to save money on Uber costs I went to this museum with three friends that I made while on a G Adventures tour. It was about $30 USD each way from our hotel.This museum is just beautiful. It is on an amazing site overlooking LA. We only had about 2 hours to look at this museum as we went to the Griffith observatory earlier in the day and some of our party had flights to catch.I took the tram to the museum as it is a 3/4 mile hike up a hill. My friends hiked it. Even though the line to get into the tram was long in both cases, it only took about a half hour.I concentrated on the permanent paintings collection whereas my friends looked at the special Egypt exhibition. We all enjoyed what we got to see.I would highly recommend going to see this museum if visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2torontotraveller
50,Checking out LA,"This is a must place to visit….A bit way out, we had to bus and train our way there… So glad we took the time and effort to visit it. Coming back to Downtown LA we got a taxi from the center to the train station. Should have done that going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350jimmyn
50,Never Disappoints!,"The Getty is one of those ""have to"" places for people of any age. As an adult I have always loved simply everything about it, but I took three teens basically disinterested in art who found the architecture, grounds and food options a real treat and then they saw the views of the entire area we had been visiting for days...breathtaking. I love to watch the sunset and then see the lights of the city come one. Even the 405 is beautiful from this vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39candyn
50,Great Museum and it is for free!,"It is a must see museum in LA! Parking is expensive ($15), but you can get there by bus. Very interesting architecture and a great view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HMO2013
50,Must see if you like museums,"We live in the L.A. area. I visited here as a tourist and a resident. Have to say, if you even halfway like museums, this is a must see. The building alone is fabulous! And the view is really nice! We visited for our 2nd anniversary and dined in the upstairs restaurant. Food is excellent. It was a wonderful experience! You might want to make reservations. But might be able to get a table if it’s not too busy. They keep weird hours so check ahead of time if you plan on dinning there. For families, there’s another restaurant downstairs that has really good food also and isn’t as pricey. Arrive early as you park in a garage and take a tram ride to the top of the mountain. Takes a little time to get up there. Wear comfortable shoes. You will walk a lot. With the changing exhibits, I never get tired of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimtravelnut
50,A Great Los Angeles Treasure,"I was told about the Getty Villa by a co-worker. Free to get in, you just need to make a reservation on-line. $15 to park. Very interesting history of J Paul Getty and his collection of antiquities. Beautiful grounds. Nice eating options. We spent 3.5 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbys701
50,Beautiful grounds and wonderful art,Set outside of LA a bit high on a hill lies these impressive buildings with lots of art and beautiful gardens. Wide open spaces and great views of the water and LA make it a great place to visit. Bring some food and sit outside with the view then go inside and enjoy art from around the world. Food can be purchased but as expected is not cheap. Accessible via a city bus or ride share it’s definitely worth visiting for half a day. Kids will enjoy parts of it too. Grounds are free but parking is $15 per car yet still worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh79b
50,The only view in LA!,"I don’t much care for LA. Street tacos are good, but it’s not my scene. The Getty, though, was unforgettable! The range of art inside is a lovely diversion, but the architecture and fauna outside is just glorious! I could’ve spent all day, so make sure to go earlier than mid-afternoon (which was my mistake). Parking is pricey but considering that the rest is free, I consider is worthwhile. Enjoy the gardens, don’t miss this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_looblue28
50,"Inspirational art, architecture and gardens!","It’s easy to see why The Getty Center is so renowned from the moment you arrive. There is plenty of car parking and the fifteen dollar all-day parking fee allows you to park at the Getty Centre and Getty Villa on the same day. A monorail takes you up the hill to the entrance plaza. Here helpful staff are on hand to answer questions, there are restrooms and you can collect a free guide map or audio book (available in a variety of languages) and leisurely view the permanent collection of paintings, drawings, manuscripts, sculpture and temporary exhibitions. The lush central garden is a must see and the city views spectacular! Facilities are modern and clean. There is a plaza cafe, a serviced restaurant, a museum shop and small gallery shops. All competitively priced. There are plenty of spots for picnics for those wishing to be romantic or on a budget. A feast for the senses and free entrance just tops it all off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetjustine
40,The building is more special than what’s in it,"The building, garden, and setting are really fantastic. The content of the museum (the paintings) is not so special, especially in comparison to the building. The catering is mediocre; any coffeeshop on a California campus is better. Parking is 15 usd but entrance to the museum is free, pretty amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthijsK67
50,Best Museum in LA by far,"The best museum in LA, both in terms of the quality of art on display and of the facility itself. It was a pleasant surprise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adyescu
50,beautiful day out,"first off its free! with a shuttle up the hill to the museum another great start with views as well of l a . set in white stone with glass, a modern setting it most certainly was,! the guides [free headphones] were ever so polite and enthusiastic about this wonderful place and that shone thru, set out on aa couple of floors with a rooftop view to boot was awsome",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selky
50,Beautiful Art in a Beautiful Setting,"Everything about the Getty center seems very well thought out, planned, and executed. And it all comes together for a beautiful effect.My appreciation of the Getty center was greatly increased by taking the free hourly architectural tour that explains how the campus was designed to take advantage of the natural terrain,sun, ocean breezes, and views. The tour also explain the choices of colors and materials and the landscaping to give you a much deeper appreciation of the design.While expensive, lunch at the Getty center restaurant was also quite good, and since you need to spend at least three or four hours at the Getty center, you should consider stopping in enjoying something at the restaurant.Even if art doesn’t hit your sweet spot, walking around and being at the center for a few hours is a great way to see Los Angeles and it’s most magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMcLeanVAFive
40,Great,"I personally like the fact that there's do much going on in the museum. You can have sculptures from France, real life sized rooms from Italy, photography from American photographers, paintings from Greece, exhibitions from Egypt...whatever your preferences are you'll probably find it at Getty.I also love the dynamic way it was built. It allows you to walk from building to building through bridges and get a view of the beautiful gardens too. It's great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_salmaeliela
50,Fantastic place and great tour,I think this is a fantastic place to visit - great views over LA. Did the architecture tour and loved it! Recommend this visit to everybody visiting LA! The gardens are also really stunning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2113BSjuliaf
50,FUN!...Even In The Rain,"Make no mistake, you are going to a castle that overlooks the cities and the sea. No matter how you arrive, you will have had to contend with traffic and you'll have to reckon with a personal security search. But Security will handle you with good humor. Afterwards, you get a nice ride up the hill in a roomy tram with a smooth glide and a lovely view. Once you're up there on the castle level, the tram opens onto a large plaza that makes you want to run all over the place to look at everything as though you just got brand new eyes! Over one parapet, there are mansions in the distance. Over another, Santa Monica Bay. Beyond the next, Interstate 405 stretches out for miles, rolling through buildings, lights, smog and hills. And finally to the east lay two gleaming financial centers: Culver City (media) and Los Angeles Downtown (money). All that human endeavor and you're still outside!There before you are stairs that hardly seem so. Gentle ramps too. As you approach the white stones, the sheer size and angles of the building are impressive. At this point you might be content to remain outside. Atop the stairs is another, more intimate plaza that treats you to waterworks, arcing fountains, pools of champagne-colored water, sculpture, and gardens with places to sit and simply take it all in. And you haven't even opened a door...yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
50,Allow enough time,This is an attraction that should not be missed. We planned for three hours in the museum and an hour in the garden. We made it 2 1/2 in the museums before hitting overload and 1/2 hour was enough for the garden. Don't planned for a short time as there is a lot to see. Highly recommend if you art or history. Don't miss the Monet and Van Gogh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmE1362ED
50,Finally made it- wow,So I have been to LA many times over the years and never made it to the Getty. Finally made it and was very impressed. The building and grounds are so enjoyable and truly are a magnificent piece of art by themselves. Great views of LA and wonderful exhibits. We spent a nice 5 hours and just left because we were tired. Parking is $15 onsite and you ride the tram up. Many guided tours are available every hour. We did find the cafe food limited and expensive but typical for museum environments. We would recommend going early too. We got there right at 10. Things were definitely more crowded after lunch and closer to 3. Worth it. We will go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawgmc
50,Impressive,"We loved our visit to the Getty Center. We were so impressed that it was free admission to this remarkable site! We arrived at 10 am just as the center was opening and the tram (free as well) was sitting there waiting to take us up to the Center. Note that you can walk up if you like, however it was an extremely hot day and we wisely chose to take the air-conditioned tram. The architecture and the surrounding grounds, including sculptures and gardens, are extraordinary. The center has an impressive collection including some artwork from Van Gogh, Renoir, Cezanne, Monet and Manet. In addition, the Getty Center provides some pretty spectacular views of the Los Angeles area. It would take quite a bit of time to see everything here. We only touched the surface in our 2 hour visit. If you have the time, we would highly recommend visiting the Getty while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller547
20,The Worst Work of the Best Artists,"This appears to be a museum of the big names of art, but their most inferior works. The campus is impressive, and the staff is serious and dedicated to their jobs. The tour of the book exhibition I joined was led by an informed and enthusiastic book specialist. But the art on display was lacking in inspiration or profound beauty. I never felt like I was seeing truly quality art.My wife and I usually leave art museums, even ordinary ones, feeling spiritually nourished and invigorated, or we have at least seen something that we want to talk about and debate. We left Getty feeling empty, debating only where to get dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9571ATnicholasw
40,Beautiful inside and Out,"It is a beautiful building full of beautiful and interesting works of art. We enjoyed it a lot. It was a very hot day, which made it uncomfortable. I would make sure that the day is cooler next time, it made a difference. It especially made a difference when something was wrong with the tram and we had to walk all the way down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khattykathy

50,Huge and Wonderful,"In some ways it may be unfair for me to write this review because I have been to the Getty Museum so many times I am biased -- frankly, I love the place. I go several times a year or more. I go for the new exhibits. I go to meet friends at the Prominade, I go to enjoy the Sunday or evening concerts. I used to go just to take my 3-year-old granddaughter to the art workshops. Sometimes, I'll pop in for a few hours to enjoy the tram ride, the fountains, long walks around the grounds and a healthy ""international"" lunch in a garden with beautiful views. The Getty is huge, the stone walls are ancient, filled with fossils from prehistoric seas and the juxtaposition of million-year-old fossils with great art and photography is very humbling. As I said, I love the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lollydepaulo

20,Noise and neglect destroy beauty,"Such a terrible noise for such a beautiful place. It's very sad that from such a marvellous place as The Getty what you take back to treasure and remember is not the free and awesomely retorfuturistic acces, the incredible views of the Pacific and the bay, the glorious collection, but the buzz and the cackle of voices of adults, not kids, shouting, not just talking loud. How can you appreciate the subtitility and grace of Monet's The Rouen Cathedral or Friedrich's A Walk at Dusk if there is a party full volume going on in the Rembrandt's room. And what acn you say of the powerless grimace of the hall's guard when he confesses that the partygoers are none others than... the staff of the museum! I hope they understand some day that they are ruining the once in a lifetime opportunity for some people that flew over half the globe to see waht they despise. And there is no redemption, according to the information counter ladies there is no way appreciate the works in their full brightness and respect, just to raise the volume of your audioguide to ""Deafening"" and vent your bile on a written reclamation that nobody will care for or answer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/never12surrender

40,Frank Lloyd Wright meets the Smithsonian,"The Getty Center is by any standard a world class museum- full of incredible paintings, sculpture, and furnishings that defy comprehension all set in buildings that the architectural master mentioned in the title would have approved of. While it qualifies as a must see while in L.A., there are a few things that hold it back from five dot status. While the museum is free, parking is $15, however it is the garage itself that is the issue- very tight and incredibly difficult to maneuver your way out of since there's a near constant influx of vehicles to contend with. The wait for the tram that goes from the garage to the museum can easily have a 45 minute long line to wait in or you can walk uphill for 3/4 of a mile (they do loan you umbrellas for shade while you're there- a nice touch). The biggest negative though is the ""security"" which I put in quotation marks because all they are is a bunch of people whose sole qualifications seem to be the ability to stand for hours and fit in a dark blue blazer. If you have so much as a large paperclip on your belt, expect one of the ""guards"" to make you go back to your vehicle to remove it even though the lack of x-ray or metal detectors means I could have snuck an Uzi in undetected. And heaven forbid you appear to get too close to an object on display or take a picture of a prohibited item because you didn't see the tiny camera with a slash through it in the corner of the title card, you can be sure to experience the wrath of the Getty brigade. That said, most items can be photographed without flash (another unforgivable transgression), and not all of the guards there are azure clad phalluses (keeping it clean for the kids here). Despite the hassle factor, the Getty Center has treasures to make King Midas look like Oliver Twist and should be seen by everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unavid

It was a joy to be able to view grand masters so closely we could see every brush stroke. The collection included Michelangelo, El Greco, Goya, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Rembrandt, and Van Gogh. We also happened to be there when there was a special exhibit of illuminated manuscripts as well as a collection of furniture of Louis IX. Outside there are modern sculptures set against the backdrop of the building's contemporary architecture along with beautiful gardens. And the view of LA is special.

50,Must see while in LA,"The Getty Center is one spot we always take visitors to when they are in LA. This is a wonderful place and deserves an all day visit. There is so much to see in the way of art that it is best to plan your visit. Before you go visit their website to see what new exhibits and programs they have available. In addition to art they also have musical and other cultural events that will require reservations. The Getty is free to visit but parking is $15 and $10 after 3pm. After parking you will be directed to a tram that takes you up the hill to the Getty Center. They also have a place to check bags. Food is available there as well with a very good cafeteria and a very nice restaurant (make reservation).The views of Los Angeles from the Center are stunning so you will want to bring a camera to capture the impressive backdrops. There are also some beautiful gardens that add to the surroundings such that the beauty of the art on the inside is graced by the beauty of the flowers, trees and shrubs on the outside.A visit to the Getty Center is a day well spent. Under no circumstances should you miss this on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589fernandoh

It's arguably top 3 museums in town, the cost of entry is only your parking and it gets you to the west side, which is the best side of town! JP Getty's endowment is so rich that even as they siphon off 10% of it a year to buy art, it continues to bring the noise.

We particularly enjoyed the photographic exhibition of fashion throughout the decades it was awesome.We underestimated the time required so left before we saw everything, this ensures we will return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464carolineh
50,Californian perfection,Architecture is fantastic - spectacular views around every corner. This white marble property beats most of the worlds white marble buildings.

50,"World Class Art and Architectural Masterpiece, in Itself!","The Getty Center is a memorable lifetime experience! I loved taking my children there in their formative years, and it has enriched all of our lives. I've watched it getting built for many years, and I'm proud to say that it has surpassed any expectations! The magnitude of it's size is as impressive as its' beauty. The tram ride up the hill already builds the anticipation as this Architectural monument draws nearer. Art and History exhibitions, combined, will have you transcending into another space and time. The sunset views across L.A. to the Pacific ocean are breathtaking! Even the sunlight dancing across the shimmering limestone walls of the museum, are gorgeous at anytime of the day. I enjoy the live music and savoring a glass of wine while seizing every moment. It is free admission, so the money you save can be used towards a delicious meals, refreshments and souvenirs. This experience will awaken the Artist spirit to all who grace the majesty of the Getty Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikiln
40,Beautiful,"Great views, gorgeous architecture, exciting art and surprisingly good food too. Parking is expensive but the tram ride has really nice views as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessarnl
50,Relaxing and educational,"It is a place where you feel peace and enjoy the beauty of Los Angeles. If you love beautiful and rare paintings and sculptures then you will love it much more. It is free except the parking and even parking is very cheap in this area, just 10 or 15 per day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epycpa
50,In a word..Awesome!!!,We spent most of the day there and could have spent more. It has a wide variety of history and special exhibits for everyone. Recommended for anyone 10 and older. You just pay for parking as admission is free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwmeyer31
50,Skipping the Getty is Not an Option.,"Along with LACMA and the La Brea Tar Pits, the Broad, the Geffen and the Hammer, the Getty Center is not to be missed when seeking world-class museums in LA. The views are unparalleled, the architecture as moving as the exhibitions and the gardens and grounds a showcase for Southern California horticulture. The programming, from lectures to traveling exhibits offer true enrichment and the fact that admission is free is rivaled by very few institutions of this stature in the US or abroad. The bonus of using your parking validation both here and at the Getty Villa, also highly recommended, just provides a little additional grace to the experience. No matter the programming at the time of your visit, you will find something of extraordinary value and the permanent collection is nothing to sneeze at either. I've visited numerous times and while the Getty Center (and Villa) are not set in the midst of other attractions, your day is well-spent focusing on them. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhQ2206ZA
50,You'll love it even if you hate museums.,"I've lived in LA for over 40 years, been up and down the city and the county, from the beach to the mountains, from the old Hollywood Wax Museum to the stunning Getty Villa in Malibu (not to be confused with the Getty Center). I can safely say that the Getty Center is one of a handful of places in this town the likes of which you would be hardpressed to find elsewhere. This isn't so much because of the art collection or the exhibits, which, to be honest, aren't much to write home about. What is exquisite about the place is the wide-open, away from the city, light and airy and easy and serene atmosphere that is a result of its location and architecture. I've gone there alone, wandered the grounds, dropped into the exhibit halls, and come back feeling lighter and more grounded. I've taken small children and seen them run around and eat and play. The last time I was there was with my father, who's wheelchair-bound, and with my 31-year-old son who's a music producer. My father can't stand museums, but he couldn't get enough of the spectacular views, the beautiful buildings, the great food. It's true that the food is expensive, but you don't have to eat there or you can bring your own. I would avoid eating in the restaurant because it's overpriced and a bit pretentious, but there are other places to buy food or to eat. Parking is easy. The tram ride is a lot of fun. There are lines for the tram on Sundays, but nothing major. Attendants went out of their way to help us with my father because of his handicap. You'll see all kinds of people--old and young, tourists and locals. Finally, in the words of my friend's 20-year-old daughter, ""it's great for your Instagram.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovesagoodhotel2018
50,Must see...over and over again,"I've lived in LA for many years now, and make it a point to visit the Getty Center at least a few times a year. It's wonderful for family outings and for taking guests to see not only the consistently superb art exhibits, but also the breathtaking views. The restaurant is excellent, as well. The Getty never gets old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrDLA
50,Getty Views,"The views are exceptional; the air tram ride is splendid. The collections are pleasant and interesting. My favorite getty is what we locals (still) refer to as the ""Old Getty"" in Malibu.

It was great but rather small so we ended up with a lot of extra time.We grabbed some food from the outdoor cafe which was fairly good and surprisingly affordable. The best part by far is the garden. It was so lovely. I suggest bringing a blanket to sit on the grass for the view and people watching. Also if you go after a certain time, parking is cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenap766
50,Awesome!!,"The Getty Center blew our socks away! The architecture was so impressive, the views amazing, and the museum itself was top notch as well! Admission is free due to the generosity of Mr. Getty, and they even offered a complimentary 45 minute architecture tour. There are two eating spots with reasonable selection and prices - the view from the patio is great. The location is difficult to get there with public transportation, and the parking structure looked tight, we took a ride share to the Museum and there is a convenient dedicated drop-off/pick-up area, so it worked quite well.A MUST SEE when in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCM10_11

It was extremely hot outside, but the exhibits were nice and cool. We didn't see everything bc we got hungry and hot fast, but plan on going back.

10,Don’t expect to get accommodated too much for handicaps from Getty Museum,"We were a group of 4 adults, one 90 years old grandma on wheelchair, and 5 little kids to visit Getty Museum. On the way up to the hill, it was helpful that a Getty Museum let all of us in the priority line. On the way down, they let only one of us to escort our grandma. We refused this little offer for handicaps from Getty Museum. We did our way:one adult walked our 5 kids down the hill and other 3 adults escorted grandma down from getting in regular line under the heat of 93 degrees.I guess if we take care handicapps, we will understand how much help we need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614trinhh

50,Amazing!,The Getty is simply amazing. I arrived earlier in the morning around the opening time of 10am. I’m glad I did as the line was long to get on the tram at 2pm.

50,Well designed museum on a hilltop,I came in on a weekend and the lines were long for the tram both ways to leave and come back. Get there early since you can easily spend the whole day there. You can opt to walk to the top uphill which is about a 10-15 minute walk. They do provide umbrellas for shade for those who do opt to walk up hill. The Getty has great art and exhibits. The building designed by Meier is spectacular and very well thought out since every nook and cranny is designed to enhance the views of the garden and the 360 view from the hilltop. Some areas were not ADA accessible esp. the special exhibit area on the third floor and I saw someone walk up and down the stairs which could have used an elevator or ramp. I gave extra points since this is the only museum that I saw that had a charging station for cell phones. More museums should consider having them since it is such an issue with the younger generation and adults who are anxious about having enough power for their cell phones and spend more time worrying about charging instead of enjoying the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phatgus
50,Give oneself up to the wonder of it all,"The world renowned Getty Center is located just off the San Diego freeway, above Brentwood, in the Santa Monica mountains. The campus is home to the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation and the J Paul Getty Trust. The J Paul Getty Trust lays claim to being the world’s largest philanthropic body dedicated to the visual arts.The Center’s campus of 24 acres is enveloped by 600 acres retained in its original state. The hilltop is 270 metres above sea level – we gather that on a clear day, one can see the San Bernardino Mountains, the San Gabriel Mountains, the Pacific Ocean and of course the Los Angeles skyline.After the land was purchased in 1983, Pritzker winning architect Richard Meier was entrusted with the design of the Center. Fourteen years of design and construction followed and the Center finally opened its doors on December 16, 1997. Architect Meier’s Getty Center is an invaluable contribution to the repertoire of the world’s most striking architectural masterpieces.The Center’s seven level deep underground parking accommodates 1200 vehicles. Two Getty Center Trams take visitors from the parking at the bottom of the hill to the Center on the hilltop. The Center is clad in Italian travertine stone shipped in from Bagni di Tivoli on the eastern outskirts of Rome.Meier and his team reportedly worked for over a year with the quarries to invent a process that gives the stone its unique textured finish. Indeed, the beige coloured travertine is what gives the building its striking appearance, catching and reflecting different hues as the sun strikes its surface at different times of day.Structured around a central arrival plaza, the design seamlessly blends the building’s curvilinear structure with its beautiful gardens, open spaces, natural light and panoramic views. Exterior courtyards are dotted with fountains and a variety of trees and vegetation. Sunken gardens, terraces, huge expanses of glass walls and fluid floor plans that bring the outdoors indoors and vice-versa give the building a wide-open feel.The J Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center has a permanent collection of European paintings, drawings, classic sculpture, contemporary and modern sculpture, manuscripts, photographs. These are distributed over the North, East, West and South Pavilions. Modern sculpture also adorns the grounds of the Getty Center.No less striking than the Getty Center building is the Central Garden at its heart, created by artist Robert Irwin. We were told that it has over 500 varieties of plants and covers a massive 134,000 square feet. Its multi-level design incorporates a natural ravine, a stream that ripples through tree-lined walkways to an open plaza and down a waterfall over a reflecting pool, bougainvillea arbours, all set against the magical views that the Center commands from its amazing location on the hill.Apart from the Central Garden, there are several smaller gardens – a collection of shaded hideaways and peaceful sanctuaries. The cactus garden at the South Promontory is a magnet for the eyes. The fountains in the Museum courtyard inspire a sense of calm restfulness.Five years in the making, Irwin’s garden is no less than a living work of art – a treat for the senses offering visitors a bouquet of amazing sights, smells and sounds. It continues to evolve with new additions and changing design – Irwin’s philosophy “Always changing, never twice the same” is etched into the plaza floor to constantly remind us that this is a living, breathing, ever-changing work of art.Walking through the buildings and the gardens can work up a powerful appetite. Dining options are many – from the Restaurant offering beautiful views of the Santa Monica mountains to the self-service Café or the Garden Terrace Café overlooking the Central garden.If you’d like to take a little bit of the Getty home, head to the main store just inside the Museum entrance hall that offers a choice of items including sculpture replicas and hand-blown glass work. The Getty Store is also online if you prefer to shop from the comfort of your home.The Getty Center is open 10am-5.30pm on all days other than Monday which is closed. Extended hours on Friday and Saturday are seasonal. Admission is free and no reservations are needed. Parking fee is $15 per vehicle. Be prepared for spotty mobile phone coverage although the Center does offer free Wi-Fi. Photography including mobile phone cameras and video camera is allowed but without using flash.One cannot help but feel that visiting the Getty Center is a privilege – and be thankful to this billionaire who chose to share this magical place with everyone, totally free. Here a sense of calm permeates one’s being – a feeling that it is a wonderful world and a good life after all. It is difficult to choose between the magnificent building, its striking collection of art, its beautiful gardens, its mesmerizing vistas – and it is just as well that one does not need to. All one needs to do is give oneself up to the wonder of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Excellent day out,So much to see We didn’t get to it all which is great because we definitely want to go back. Beautiful architecture and outstanding art. The food wasn’t fantastic at the cafe but otherwise a perfect day. I suggest arriving first thing if you’re driving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pquintana
50,Great Collection,"On a cloudy L.A. day, with fog over the coast and over the Getty. It's a great day for an outing to the Getty to see the awesome collections. As other reviewers have said, the buildings themselves are pretty cool. They put out umbrellas so we could get from building to building. We spent the entire day there, even walked through the garden in the rain. If you get a chance, the restaurant at the Getty is expensive, but the food is wonderful. Sometimes, I think it was the best thing about the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiKershaw77
50,Great Collection Of European Works,"This is the wealthiest museum in the world - and it's free. But you will have to pay a parking fee. Note for those traveling under their own steam, public transit stops across the road. When you enter it's always best to ride the tram because the walking path might take you 15 to 20 minutes. If you arrive before Noon you should have no problems with lines. But by later in the day, the audio sets tend to be gobbled up, and some of the exhibits will crowd. There are about 6 buildings on the campus with ongoing exhibitions. Most are permanent but others are date defined. Head directly to your highest priority and then work through the rest of the works. You probably won't get to see everything, but you'll make a significant dent. Americans like Impressionist Art and so does the Getty. So you'll find a room devoted to those works. Some buildings connect for easier passage, with paintings on the second level and decorative works down below. On a nice day it's enjoyable to sit in the garden areas. Food is available on site and you can picnic or eat in a cafe or restaurant. There are big views of LA and some nearby Southern California communities, but they're often marred by smog",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti

We had a lovely visit and waited out rush hour traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MvStory
30,Just don’t try to drive here during rush hour....,"The Getty Center itself is amazing but plan your journey carefully. We couldn’t get there at 3 PM on a Wednesday because the rush hour traffic onto the 405 blocked our way., driving west on Sunset Blvd. We finally got there on a Friday driving east on Sunset. They put everyone in a long, snaking line like TSA. Why? To take the tram up the hill. There was only one tram working and some small shuttle buses that take 20 people at a time. We got out of the line after 15 minutes and said we would walk, but the guard was holding people back from walking, which was dumb and senseless. Finally, we took the museum parasols and walked uphill a bit more than one mile. We lost so much museum time due to traffic, finding parking, waiting in line and walking. In hot sun, not everyone can walk uphill for 20 minutes. Not a problem for us, but wanted to let you know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinr516
50,"Worth it just to be there, but avoid Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday if you can","The building, the gardens, the exhibits, the views: Everything about the Getty is worth the hassle of getting there and parking. As many have said, get there early! We commented to the guards that we were surprised at the crowds on a Tuesday and they said that was their busiest day other than the weekends. Seems pent up demand from the weekend and the fact that the Villa is closed makes the Tuesday crowd huge. The formal restaurant has great views and the food was divine. Delicious and attractively served with attentive waiters. Go online and make reservations! It's worth all the effort even on a brutally hot July day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236kathrynb

I was there on a sunny day and had a great time photographing the white stone of the museum against the crisp blue sky.As someone else posted, the permanent collection is somewhat smaller and doesn't go much past 1900. There are some nice Impressionist works by Monet and VanGogh to see though. Check out the special exhibitions before you head out. I was there during a nice photography exhibit and another one on ancient Egypt art.It's easy to get there by car or ride share. You can take the tram up the hillside or walk. I chose to walk up and it was a pleasant uphill climb. The views from the grounds towards LA are great - even with smog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyC554

There is a cafeteria and fine dining restaurant on the premises.We went on the free Architecture Tour and Leik was a knowledgeable guide. We really enjoyed learning about the construction of the building.The gardens were beautiful as well. It was a great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2817Traveler
50,Highlight of our vacation!,"We wanted to visit the Getty Center last year but the day we were in LA, it was closed! This year we planned around this visit! Great place, beautiful architecture, and the art is incredible. Restaurant has a good choice of food and they had snack areas as well. Parking is in a big parkade and you take a light rail service up to the Center. Well organized, they had umbrellas throughout for visitors to carry around as it can get very hot and the sun is always out. Outdoor garden is also a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itrvl4work
50,The grounds are amazing!,"As much as I love the art held within, the grounds were beautiful. Perched up on a cliff the view of LA is pretty amazing. The gardens outside were just as beautiful as the art inside. The interior space is well laid out given the amorphous architecture with lots of room to move about the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0312chloe
30,"Please get your names right, tour guide!","This is the Getty guys, please get your names right! Beautiful site, Beyond the Nile is an amazing exhibit, the tour guide is very entertaining but keeps adding extra syllables to the names! Benevento is suddenly BeneveNEnto, the emperor Domitian is now Dominitian, and DionySUS the god of wine became DionySIUS with an extra i (the tyrant of Syracuse or a christian saint). Certainly not up to Getty standards.Also some of your employees in the children's store could be more polite when I had temporary credit card problems.Still a very nice experience. Best views of LA. Beautiful setting. Take the kids. Make sure you teach them all the names correctly though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prsks
50,A wonderful way to spend a day.,Take the family or just yourself to the Getty and spend a day in amazement. Always some interesting exhibition to view. The park is wonderful as well to spend some time in contemplation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurohandsofsteel
50,Extraordinary museum!,Amazing. The architecture is great and the exhibits are even greater. They provide a headset that give useful information. There is also a nice cafe in the building. Wish I could have more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodjin
50,"Art, Architecture and Gardens will totally wow you","This really is a not to be missed moment in LA and entrance to the museum is free - though you do pay $15 per car to park. The Richard Meier designed building is awesome - bright with all sorts of shapes. There are tours just covering the architecture - recommended. There is a magical collection of art especially 19th century and Impressionists. The gardens wow too. We really loved the Avatar style rebar trees, the man made stream and the box maze. We enjoyed 2 temporary exhibitions too - one about 100 years of fashion photography and another about Egypt and the Classical world. There are several different eateries and a large gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm442
50,Fantastic museum,I love both the Getty Center and the Getty Villa. Both offer a different unique museum experience. The Getty Center has wonderful grounds to have a picnic with wonderful views of the city. They also have a more diversified art exhibit. I never get tired of this place. I highly recommend visiting the Getty Center and the Getty Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewels1999

50,A Beautiful Place to Visit!,I went here this winter with my mom who was visiting from the East Coast. We had an amazing time strolling through the entire center and going through the garden as well. Beautiful views too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caseym357
50,One of The Best Spots in Town,We have been visiting the Getty since it opened. Majestic and you really feel like you are outside the city and transportated to another universe. The art and grounds are so beautiful!! Easy access from the 405. Would love to have a party there!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaRobledoGart
40,Getty Beverly Hills,"A LA landmark. Beautiful grounds and an amazing location. Very well organized. The exhibits are interesting, keeping in mind this is a personal collection of an individual. It is a wonderful way to spend a day all year round. The formal restaurant is a great way to spend a special occasion from where you can enjoy the city lights in a summer evening. It is a family friendly place with plenty of green area for children to play and for adults to hang out with friends and family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RRCLA
50,A must see in LA,"If you’re visiting town, stop by and enjoy the museum collections, architecture and the spectacular city views ( of course on a clear day).Also try the museum restaurant, don’t be afraid of the prices there normal prices and the food is amazing w more awesome views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bondgirl10

50,What a surprise!,"You pay for parking which is $15 or $10 after 3pm and that’s it. The museum is otherwise free. After parking you catch the tram up to the museum area. The museum consists of several buildings and several beautiful gardens. The museum has plenty of sun umbrellas to make it easier to walk around outside in the gardens. You also get a great view of the LA skyline. Each of the buildings has a different theme with paintings, sculptures, and other related artwork. Very interesting and impressive. On way back we took the shuttle rather than the tram. We also saw people walking up to the museum and walking back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,Go Visit!!!!,"What a wonderful experience it was, to visit the Getty Center! The artwork and the Egypt exhibit were exceptional. The gardens are truly a sight to see. We were only there for two hours and wished we had had more time. Plan for a day trip when you go. There's so much to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslieb80
50,Incredible displays,The Getty Center is a must visit for people who love museums. Incredible structural architecture and always top notch art displays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_jedb424
50,Worth the trip,Helpful tip: the museum is closed on Mondays. Those people who missed out then go on Tuesdays. So it’s busy. Avoid Tuesday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotlandj
50,I totally enjoyed Getty Center and Getty Villa,"We should thank Paul Getty gave us such wonderful gift and insists open free for public so many years with beautiful valuable collection and at such good locations, The service is super too. You only pay $15 for indoor parking (electric car has free charge station), you take free tram to site. There are free stroller and wheel chair to borrow. There so many free tours are available with guider and audible devices. And also you can get free audio guide companion your visit.

50,Even better than Huntington Library.,"2nd time at Getty Center. FREE admission compared to Huntington Library and Museums at $25. Relatively small circular garden but ornate. Outstanding architecture, Greek, Roman antiquities, Irises painting, choice examples of Tiepolo paintings. Family priced cafes; 1 on terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haigow8
50,Among the best views of LA,The Getty Center is a main LA attraction and makes for a lovely day out when you combine their always changing exhibits with the beauty and architecture of the center itself. Be sure to allow idle time to take in a drink and a snack on the rooftop overlooking LA and the infamous 405.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalew2014
50,Beautiful Hillside Location,"Went to visit family in San Diego. Had briefly visited the Getty before, and I was determined to spend more time there. Parking in the garage is $15, but the museum itself is free. Be sure to check the hours-when we visited, the museum opened at 10am and closed at 5;30. The Getty is located high on a hill, and is a series of buildings done in travertine and other white stone materials. The landscape s just beautiful-be sure to visit the gardens.The gift shop has wonderful books. I am no expert on Art, but anyone can appreciate the beauty and talent of the paintings and sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol-201474
50,Amazing place!,"Totally dumbfounded by the beauty of this place, the architecture is stunning. The 5 pavilions contains a huge array of artifacts, too much to see in one day. Must come back. And all this art and beauty is free! Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelling_canuck_50
50,An LA Must See.,A lot of art by the masters. And a lot of history to go with the displays. Impressive large facilities & campus with great views of the Los Angles area. My wife and I are very glad we took a day to see this. Will probably come back again as we would also like to see the Getty Villa as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18GaryF18
50,A MUST Do attraction,"My aspiring architect teenager son, suggested we visit here, and I can honestly say it was fabulous, it is a Must to include the Architect Tour as it gives a detailed perspective of the design of the building, entry is Free, which is an added bonus, I would happily pay to experience this, we only had a couple of hours but if you have the time- a whole day could be spent here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP4130
50,"Amazing museum with fine art, sculptures and wonderful architecture","Our kids and nephew and niece really enjoyed the Getty museum, also due to the activities for kids. But most of all my wife and I enjoyed the architecture of the buildings, the Dutch masters (amongst which Rembrandt and Vermeer!) the French Louis XIV contemporary exhibition, the garden with its sculptures and so much more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marko_van_der_Smitte
50,"Art, Gardens, Architecture","What a wonderful experience! A tram takes you from a parking area high up to The Getty Center, which is kind of a fun little trip, just for the views. The actual Center is beautiful. I definitely would recommend the guidd intro tour, especialy if you are interested in arcitecture. There is a lot to do and see. They provide umbrllas/parasols on loan if you are sensitive to the sun, which was very nice. It is bright and warm in LA, after all. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finklemoore
50,WOW!,Everything is magnificent and free. Apart from parking. Amazing architecture. Make sure to walk the garden trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claytoro
50,Can't believe this is free...,"One of my favorite art musems yet! Beautiful grounds with a fantastic view of LA.Take the tram up to the musem, as the walk is uphill is longer than it seems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255katherinep
40,Great building and well displayed exhibits,"This museum has been designed with the visitor in mind. The exhibits are displayed extremely well and spread very comfortably over four separate buildings. The location is absolutely fantastic. Where it is let down is in the quality of the exhibits themselves. Yes there are some world class items, but many are second quality - perhaps because when the Getty Foundation came into all its money, there were less masterpieces available to buy. It is still well worth visiting, but we would recommend the Huntington as being better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annesA334NI
50,So much to see,"With 5 pavillions, there's so much to see here, and then there's the other part of the museum at the Villa! We only spent about half a day here and only really got a good look at 1 and a half of the pavillions, so make sure you know what you're looking for and where it is, or plan on spending a long day here or coming back to take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ms971
50,Much more than a museum,"The ""Getty on the hill"" as we initially called it, is more than just a collection of paintings. There are great events, lectures, and traveling exhibits. And, if you wanted to make a little vitamin D on a pleasant day, the gardens aren't your grandmother's idea... The wandering through the plantings and pop-art pathways is free. During the day, midweek, the grounds can be focusing quiet and peaceful.If you are there for the art, it is the premier exhibition in southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PickyBaer
50,A 'Must See' for locals and visitors,"The permanent exhibits are some of the best in the world, the traveling exhibits are varied and interesting. The architecture is stunning and the view is unbelievable.Plan on more time than you think you'll need. There will be things to see and experience that will surprise you at every turn. Eat at the Museum's restaurant (it's wonderful) or bring a picnic and enjoy views of the Pacific Ocean or Downtown LA.Parking requires finding a spot in the enormous garage then riding a tram to the museum, be patient and if you have a tour to meet, allow at least 30 extra minutes. It goes quickly, considering the number of people entering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partypoodle
40,Getty Museum,"The Getty is great way to spend a day in LA if you are waiting for a late flight. Easy parking, amazing exhibits, beautiful gardens and views of the city and reasonable food outlets in the complex. It can be anything from at least a good half day to a full day experience. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16philb
50,Fantastic experience,"This was perhaps my 6th visit over the last several years. The Getty is awesome. While the exhibits are great, with friendly docents who are full of knowledge, it’s possible to enjoy a visit without even entering a building. Take the time to explore the gardens and enjoy the vistas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Popovova
50,Exhibits,Great view and fantastic items to see. It can be s little busy but it is well worth it. We will be back our next time in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toohuge
50,"Art, Architecture, Gardens, Scenic views, this place has it all!","There is a $15 dollar parking fee, and the the restaurants are your typical them park prices. You can take in your own lunch and have a picnic but no beverages are permitted. Everything there is amazing and you can easily spend 5 or 6 hours there seeing all there is to see. People of all ages will be thoroughly amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel-Mendoza-5
20,I would rather go dumpster diving,"Welcome to the famous Getty Center just west of the 405 freeway off of skirball Road. Parking in the parking lot off of skirball you can take a ride on a monorail that will take you directly to the Getty Center.The Getty Center the Getty Center is a spectacular Museum of Fine Art but I would rather go dumpster diving since after 10 minutes after I arrived I was so bored I wanted to go to the car and take a nap.You will need comfortable shoes there is lots of walking here, the price for admission is reasonable but you'll pay more money for parking than the entry to get in.Have you ever gone over your grandmother's house like Easter around Christmas time? And she tells you to make sure that you don't leave your clothes on her clean couches and be careful not to touch anything well that's the way the Getty Center is you can't touch anything this place is like going to Grandma's house only ten times worse.I have been to the Getty Center more than once on different days and found it to be 100% boring. There are other wonderful museums like the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena the Huntington Library in Pasadena and the Los Angeles Science Center where the Space Shuttle Endeavor is being held in the Samuel Ortins Center.2 ☆☆ Star Rating",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick
40,Disneyland for the better educated,"While you cant compare the collections with the likes of Centre Pompidou, it is certainly a gem of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlads750
40,Well worth the effort,"Quite unlike anywhere else we've been. Very interesting, beautifully designed gardens and, even if not massively into art, some great stuff to look at. We comfortably spent a couple of hours and didn't see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446grahamh
50,One of my Favorite Museums,"Getty Center is one of the richest art institutions in the world and was built as a legacy of Billionaire Philanthropist Paul Getty, who left his wealth to build this museum over a span for 12 years spending over a $1B+. It has the paintings in the upper level and sculptures at the lower level. The paintings are in chronological order from 12th century to 20th century. Some of the my favorite paintings include Van Gogh's Iris, Rembrant's Abduction of Europa, Jeanne ( Spring) and they are worth hundred of millions!! The sculptures are unique and they also have them for every season. Recently they have collections of egypt and mughal paintings by Rembrandt. The entire place is very spread out. Once you park the car, there is a tram car which takes you to the museum. There are several gardens, architecture designs, shops, restaurants. Overall Amazing and it would take at least half a day to cover most of the sights. No wonder it is ranked consistently as the #1 attraction in LA and one of the top museums in the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrupesh
50,Awesome museum with beautiful views,I visited the Getty Center this past weekend while I was in town. I highly recommend checking it out. It is gorgeous. The gardens are beautiful and the exhibits are all very cool. Admission is free but you pay $15 for parking. It is on top of a big hill so you either take a tram or a shuttle up the hill which is included with the free admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kel_armstrong7
50,Sensory overload,"This place is free to get into but it costs $15 to park for all day, this makes it very inexpensive to gain the knowledge and beauty of the exhibits.From the car park you get into line for tram to take you on five minutes ride up the hill to the centre.while in the line you have to have any bags checked, this delays things a little bit, but a necessity these days. We got there at about 10:30am and we walked straight through to get onto tram, when we came down, around 1:30pm,there was a sizeable line.Once you are in the main reception hall you can get your free map and guide, you can also get free audio guide. There are a number of guided tours at different times, so you can plan your visit around them or use the free audio guide and do self guided tour.We chose self guided tour as we were not going to see all exhibits.The gardens are magnificent as are the views and the buildings are stunning and that’s without going in to any of the exhibitions.We had soft drink and biscuits in the courtyard area which was about $14.This is a must visit for anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blc45reb
50,Beautiful grounds,I didn't get to see the collection here as I was captivated by the beautiful architecture and landscaping. The cactus garden was my favourite. The view of the city from here (on top of a mountain) is breathtaking. This would be a perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee away from the huzzle and buzzle of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0c0w0ng
40,Improved Amenities & Logistics,"I've been visiting the Getty since it moved to LA. Over the years, there have been major improvements in terms of logistics as well as amenities for guests. On this trip, my adult son agreed to go with me after having hip surgery. I mention logistics because he was in a wheelchair! It was easy to navigate the tram and the docents couldn't be nicer. An improvement is needed whereby doors can open automatically. Too many doors !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisedZ8763LC
50,What a Gem!!,"This was our second trip here, there is so much to do and see--if I lived in SoCal I would come more often. You pay for parking and all the guided tours are free. We did the Garden Tour a few years ago which was excellent, this trip we did the art tour, and our guide was excellent as we know nothing about art, and she took us through the different periods, and pointed out interesting things the artists did in their works. I never really liked art, but after this tour it gave us a new appreciation for art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quasimoto559
50,Architectural Splendor,A must visit. The site and architecture are superb. I was so taken with the building that I did not allow nearly enough time to view the art. I suspect that I am not the only one. I would recommend one visit to enjoy architecture and a second to enjoy the art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/me0h2017
20,Harshing the mellow,"The Getty had always been my go to place to get away from the bustle of the city and enjoy beautiful art and scenery. It’s definitely still beautiful and the views are still great it but, wow, the staff was very unfriendly and aggressive in each section we visited. We got to the library just as the clock turned to 10, their opening time, and barely had the door opened when a woman yelled at us that they were not open yet. We asked if the hours were different for the library and she aggressively stated it wasn’t 10. When we corrected her she argued then one of the guards corrected her telling her we were right. Only after that did she let us enter. We were rewarded not with an apology but by being followed around the library gallery aggressively until we were so uncomfortable we just left. Later, walking into a gift shop, we were loudly and suddenly barked at, such that others turned around, for having water. We weren’t drinking it just holding it with the cap on but the lady said it needed to be put away in a bag. I thought, ‘what if I didn’t have a bag? should I be kicked out of the shop?’ Just unfriendly and overly aggressive behavior that ruined the overall vibe of the place. The topper was getting stuck on the monorail trolley on the way down the hill in 100 degree heat with an automatic voice stating over and over to wait for instructions. 20 long hot minutes later we were escorted down the hill. No apologies or hey let’s take care of your parking for the ordeal, nada.I won’t need to return to the Getty anytime soon after this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coconut_H2O
30,The buildings are more impressive than the art!,"I was more than a little disappointed with my visit to the Getty Center. The architecture is impressive, which is more than I can say for the art collection displayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrR4144SG
50,Blend of art and architecture,"A beautiful place, both inside and out! Even our 2 boys (ages 20 and 14) who normally tire of art museums in about 30 minutes, were interested and engaged. The architecture itself is impressive, highlighted by sweeping views of the city and the ocean. And such a nice surprise that admission is free (the $15 parking charge is well-worth it, especially if you are bringing a family.) Highly recommend for anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabee467
50,Definitely worth it!,"Loved that place, especially the gardens and views. And it's free!!! The little train that takes us up is also nice with breathtaking views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellkity
50,Take the whole family.,"The Getty Center is very educational and family day all in one, you can browse the historical artifacts and then move to the grass area for a nice picnic, there is a restaurant if you prefer, it’s a wonderful way to spend the day with family or friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shooshana
50,Amazing architecture housing artworks from all over the world,"I have always enjoyed exploring LA via public transport and this day was no different. You can easily take a Metro bus which will drop you off directly in front of the Center's entrance, from there you can ride a train or take a walk going to the Museum. Admission is FREE but parking fees do apply. There may be a line for the train but its a nice experience especially if there are kids with you. I would advice one to arrive early to avoid the crowds and to maximize ones time, as there will be areas you would be tempted to linger at whether it be the beautiful view, the gorgeous architecture or the wonderful collections.As you exit from the train you are welcomed by open areas with landscaping, beautiful gardens and of course, the amazing buildings...There are several tours both outside and inside the buildings. I had time to attend one of each. I loved the Architecture Tour. in which the tour guide gave a history of how the museum was built, the various periods of architecture reflected in the structures, as well as the materials used. Do stop by the information booth where you can borrow an audio guide, the museum has free wifi and you can browse the web for information regarding the exhibits, and of course, flyers are available. There are scheduled tours for the collections, one can choose based on individual interests.There are strategically located restrooms to serve the visitors, with water fountains nearby. The museum has a restaurant, cafes, and even food carts. The gift shop is a good place to get a souvenir. I would suggest spending a whole day, as it is best enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere. People often linger at the gardens and the breathtaking view overlooking the city of Los Angeles. Do not forget to take your photos.. what better way to remember the day by?Where else can one enjoy a beautiful day immersed in art... and to think its all free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372pamelas
50,Amazing,I absolutely adore this place. It is one of my favorites. So much culture and history here. I would go every week if I could.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ginahanna2016
50,BEAUTIFUL,"Stunning views, Amazing art collections and surprising good temporary exhibits.

50,An unexpected surprise,"We had a few hours to spare before our hotel room was ready and our Uber driver recommended taking in the scenic views.There's an easy dropoff/pickup location for ride sharing.We arrived mid afternoon when temperatures soared well over 110°F! There is a tram that takes you to the actual center, but the line was super long. I noticed a road alongside the dropoff and asked the employee how long the walk was. He informed us it was about 15 minutes. (It took about 20 when we stopped and took pictures along the way, but trekked up the winding hill to begin our journey. ) The views are amazing and there is plenty of shade on the left side of the road.We arrived to the top and coincidentally walked up as the people who had gotten in line in front of us arrived via the tram.Lunch was our first goal so we went to the cafe on the lower level. (It cost $28 for a kid's burger, fries, water, apple and ice cream.)I then recieved a text that the hotel room was ready so we're opted to just take in the views.Gorgeous mountain- side views and greenery along the path filled is with great photo opportunities. Free to visit so if you love pictures and have some free time.. enjoy the outside...My son was so happy to be able to use their provided umbrellas for shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreastcancerRN
50,An experience which is an art in itself.,"You cannot just slip in and out of the Getty Center, but once you have parked your experience begins. You are wafted to the top of the hill, breathe in the airy expanse of the limestone plaza, mount wide steps with glimpses of sculptures and enter a campus of elegant buildings each holding and exhibiting treasures, some permanently so that you revisit your favorites, and some excitingly new but fleeting. OR you can just wander around, people and architecture watching, or descend to the remarkable gardens. A must for any tourist and any local at any time. Good coffee too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaHepner

Never fails - the Getty testch Center always has a remarkable in depth presentation to loose yourself in and the galleries seem to never tire.When you need to get some air, the gardens and the views are cool so great- and when you get hungry the foot too is fantastic!!

50,Lovely museum with a great location,We love taking our kids here. They have amazing music performances through the summer. We always bring a picnic with us and the kids really enjoy having a nice lunch outdoors and then running around. It would be a suggestion for them to have more exhibits geared towards younger audiences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenitachka
40,Beautiful art - half-day activity,They have great art collections and exhibitions - You can easily spend 4 hours or even more here. The view is amazing - I recommend taking a book/magazine as well to sit back and read while facing the Santa Monica Mountains - check their calendar before you go(parking used to be $15 - not sure about the current price),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217pariyat

50,Comprehensive,"A must see if you're in the area. Plan to spend the day and bring your walking shoes. Off-season and weekdays will minimize the crowds a bit. Every nook and cranny of this place is worth seeing. If you don't have all day to spend here, choose one area to focus on versus rushing through all of it -- and come back another day to see another part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8471MQlauras

50,Great architecture and beautiful view,"I take tourist around the city and the Getty is a must. Art, architecture, beautiful gardens for everyone to enjoy and a lovely panoramic view. There is a cafeteria and you can sit outside and enjoy the outdoors. It is inexpensive as you only pay for parking. You park down the hill and take a tram to the Getty. As a resident of LA, we sometimes skip the art and just go to enjoy the gardens and the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afrikaanspoppie

50,Paul Getty Museum of Art,"The Paul Getty Museum of Art is a must see if you are in the area. Upon entering the museum there are beautiful gardens and archaeological design.

50,A Visit to the Getty,This is a fascinating place to spend time on a weekend day. There are many interesting exhibits and if you need a break there is a place to sit and have a soda or a cup of coffee. It is relaxing and educational at the same time. You don't have to travel to other parts of the globe to see beautiful works of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimaE1598UN

50,Great !!!!!,"Great architecture very interesting special shows as well as outside entertainment, outstanding food at reasonable prices. Parking is a pain......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishandjim
40,Very Good Art Collection in a Modernist setting,"As a museum collection, the Getty Center is very good. My standards for museums are very high, and while the Getty falls short of the very best I've visited (Met, Louvre, Prado, Uffizi, Vienna) it is still a remarkable collection, well worth visiting if you are in Los Angeles. It has some unique masterpieces, most notably James Ensor's ""Entry of Christ in to Brussels"" from 1889. The architectural setting of the museum is unique as well, on a spectacular site overlooking Los Angeles. The design itself is unusual for a museum, with separate but interconnected pavilions that house the various collections by historical period. At first I thought the architect (Richard Meier) was alluding to an Italian hill-top village, but then I realized he had more lofty ambitions, and was going for the Acropolis. Very user-friendly, free admission, good food concessions, lovely sitting areas, a wonderful garden, and of course that spectacular view. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609chrisp
50,Stunning architecture,"We visited last month with our out-of-town relatives and it was lovely. I have a particular challenge because I have three children under nine. Pay for parking ($10, I think?) and take the shuttle up...the museum is free. There’s even a kid-friendly location where I could relax and let them roam. Trust me, if you have smalls (like my two yr old), you’ll want them contained so they don’t accidentally touch anything. The gardens are beautiful and peaceful, but a bit toasty in direct sun.Picture shows one of the family play zone rooms where they have foam noodles you can connect to make a net/fence",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skatebay
50,Not to miss,"I’ve lived in the LA area for a significant period in my life and would consider this one of the top attractions in the area. Besides the world renown art collection, it’s an architectural marvel. The garden area is a work of art. The views of Santa Monica and Century City alone are worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronhJ6113XH
50,The View!,The art at The Getty Center almost takes 2nd place to the views of LA on a clear day.As locals we often go just for the view it's so good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertyL9969PB
50,Getty trip,"If you love art, this is a must see. Even blocks to build the buildings have been imported. It’s an architectural masterpiece. If you can get a guide to show you around and explain everything it’s even better because everything your looking at has a story behind it and a meaning.It sits up high enough on a hill that it gives you great views of LA on a nice day .The way they have positioned the art work for display, is no less than elegant - you can get close enough to the work to touch it. This place is immaculate a lot of care and love in this place even the garden is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609suzannew
50,Great View,This has a lovely small collection and is really a must-do visit when in Los Angeles. The architect did a stunning job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariang293
50,Never a reason not to go,"No matter who's visiting in Los Angeles, or the time of year, the Getty Center is at the top of my list of recommendations for the location, the price (only parking!), the art, and the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
50,A very attractive place to visit in Los Angeles,During our recent visit to Los Angeles we had the occasion to visit Getty Center which is spread over a large space and is located atop a hill giving it a panoramic view from the city. It has very well kept garden and a huge museum where the exhibits are exquisite and attractive. A good place to spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BPB2012
50,The grounds are gorgeous!,The art work is spectacular but the garden and stunning architecture are just as stunning. He restaurant is very good and may be worth the expense but if that is not your thing bring your sandwich and take in your surroundings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cafegirlreva12
50,Absolutely Breathtaking!,"The Getty Center was a last minute adventure on our trip and I'm truly glad we decided to go! The art was mesmerizing, the views were beyond beautiful and it's free to visit. We went later in the day so it was so very nice to see the sunset from above LA. I hope to visit again sometime, it was a wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyreviews
40,Beautiful!,"Definitely worth a visit to the Getty Center. You pay a nominal fees for parking; however, the bus ride from the parking lot up the hill to the center is free along with free admission. Pack a picnic if you like as they have beautiful picnic ground. Beautiful sculptures, oil paintings and much much more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hathanhh2018
50,One of the best and inexpensive attractions in Los Angeles!,"This attraction is free to visit which pleases art enthusiasts, beautifully landscaped and amazing architectural accomplishments. Only fees required is for parking.Nice place to take your family for relaxing day and visit amazing art collections. If you love Roman period history, visit Getty collections in Malibu which is also free excluding parking fees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ben22744
50,A must see,Beautiful center. Great location on the top of a hill overlooking LA. Interesting art collection. Plan plenty of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sis12018
50,Beautiful inside and out,Spent a lovely day exploring the artwork and enjoying the gorgeous outdoors at the museum. Restaurant food very expensive but tasty. Wait time for the tram from the parking garage to the museum can be long; you can also walk up on a sidewalk next to the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesao2015
50,Gardens in full bloom!,"Great time to see the Getty as the gardens are in full bloom. Go early when they open to beat the crowds. Parking is $15 or $10 after 3pm. There’s so much artwork to see here including paintings, sculptures, furniture, etc that you’ll need at least 3 hours minimum. If you get hungry they have snack carts and a full restaurant and cafe. After about 7 visits over the years, this is still one of my favorite places in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Wonderful surprise!,We were looking for few hours to kill in between plans - checked trip advisor and found Getty museum and so glad we did. Was concerned about pricing when we paid $15 for parking but then the museum was free. In addition to the interesting art and exhibitions - great views of LA as well as beautiful gardens. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperMom48
40,Spectacular Location,"This museum is located on a breathtaking bluff which is worth visiting for the view. The architecture is incredible. I was a bit disappointed in the painting collection. It is good, better on pre 1800 than post 1800. There is not a large emphasis on the Impressionists, so if that is what you favor, the collection is not large. The museum is worth visiting for an enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmorelli39
40,You like art? Come.,"Very impressive modern light stone coloured buildings on the hill near Belle Air with great views of LA.The fours main buildings house paintings, sculptures, photographs and more.This includes some of the Masters such as Ruebens, Gainsborough, Turner, Cezzanne, Monet, Manet and maybe the most famous of all; Irises by Vincent Can Gogh.Get to the bottom of the hill and a tram takes you to the top in 5 minutes. The centre is free, the bottled water $4.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTripAdviser
50,Amazing,Spent 5 hours here and didn't see it all. What an extraordinary place. Dout it is much fun for young children or teenagers unless they are into art. Might consider taking your own food as food is overpriced. Check parking before you go. It tends to fill up on popular days,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda55555
40,Splash of culture on a frenzied coastal vacation,"Before heading out west on our southern California coastal exploration I checked out the top places to visit and the Getty was always near the top. We were looking forward to seeing the masters and variety of art on display. We were not disappointed. A very nice museum reflecting a wide spectrum of art styles and periods. This was an oasis of culture amid the beaches, zoos and amusement parks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469MarkQ
40,Worth a visit,Went on a hot summers day and the trams weren’t working but shuttles were still being ran. Lines were longer than usual and the parking is typical of any other attraction in LA.Once getting into the museum it was informative and have many pieces to look at. Not a great place for young kids though. A lot of older pieces of work. If you don’t have a keen interest in art you might lose interest quickly. It is free to get in but parking is not. If you buy any drinks there be prepared to pay amusement park prices. Interesting none the less.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc33
40,Art and culture,Great place to visit! Views are great and the grounds and gardens are beautiful. Spend the day taking in the works of art and the changing exhibits!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0rralm

50,Wonderful museum,"I spent the day here. So much to see! Beautiful medieval manuscript exhibit, 18th century pastels, fashion photography history exhibit, plus 18th and 19th century European paintings. The buildings and grounds are exquisite and there is a cafe, restaurant, and food carts. They provide umbrellas for sun shade which is a nice touch. I also really appreciated that there was a phone charging station. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauran658
50,#1 attraction in LA,"Absolutely must-see! Perfect art collection covering various areas of art, along with the beauty of personal choice of the multi-millionaire. Top class Impressionists’ paintings, including Van Gogh and Monet! Interesting and rarely seen object of decorative art. Last and not least, absolutely amazing architecture of the Center – an object of art to admire in itself. PS. Your visit will be even more interesting if you watch Ridley Scott’s ‘All the Money in the World’ prior to it – a true story-based movie on Getty family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjk226
50,Definitely a must go,"If museum is something that interest you, this museum is a must go in LA. Situated near Beverley Hills, this museum has free admission. Note that parking is not free.There are loads of exhibitions. At the time of visit, we visited the Special exhibition of Egypt and the Classical World. A very good collection.The Center has a nice garden and good view of the neighbourhood. The food is quite pricey with decent quality. I would recommend packing your own lunch prior to visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blues_3000
50,Fantastic Museum,"The Getty Center has a fantastic art collection, and also a great view of LA. I was surprised to find out that parking is not close to the museum: you must take a tram from the parking lot to get to the museum (so plan your time accordingly). One of the painting highlights was Van Gogh’s Irises, but there are so many other great works of art, including fabulous paints by Renoir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andi55_13
50,One of the world's greatest museums,"The Getty Center is simply breathtaking, both inside and out. It constantly has outstanding special exhibitions and the permanent collection has many great pieces. (I'm rather partial to their illuminated manuscript collection, which often rotates.) An extensive exhibition of 100 years of fashion photography was a standout this visit, and I'm not particularly interested in fashion. The whole place is beautiful and the free admission, with $15 to park, is a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WithAnchovies
50,Beautiful,"The Getty is such an LA jewel. It is a spectacular setting, architecture, views and views, exceptionally great food options. The art isn't bad either. We enjoy visiting some of the rotating exhibits and make a point to eat at the restaurant each time we are there. The parking, while there is a charge, is underground and efficient from and to the freeway. On a beautiful clear LA day you cannot go wrong spending the day there. We think it rivals anything we have seen in the EU.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,Amazing facility,Huge museum with an amazing range of exhibits. The current exhibition on the history of fashion is very interesting and well worth a visit. The acccess is a bit long - queues for security and then a tram ride to the main pavilions. But its free apart from the parking. - 15 dollars. A nic3e way to spend a Sunday afternoon in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S0par
50,An Amazing Place to Visit,"This museum is amazing! To be able to see the exhibits and participate in some guided tours, definitely go in early and plan on spending the whole day! There are many options for visitors: you can wander around and look through exhibits, you can get an ipod and earphones to tell you more about certain items and have an at your own pace guided tour, you can join the volunteer docents and go on guided tours of specific areas and exhibits. I participated in all three options. Some of the tours with docents give you a great starting point to look at art in a specific time period or by a specific artist and then you can go back at your own pace and look more carefully. The tour we did for the Egypt exhibit was excellent! Our docent had a wealth of knowledge about the time and area and I felt like we saw all parts of the exhibit thoroughly on the tour. The only area I did not have time to explore were the gardens but from what I saw of them, they are beautiful! There are various options for lunch/dinner dining - quick coffee carts, cafeteria style grab and go, a cafe, and a fine dining restaurant. I would say a visit to the Getty is a must while visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraa124
50,"Amazing Place, not only the art, but the architecture and views are stunning!","My only negative comment is that I wish we had more time. I think you could EASILY spend an 8 hour day here. We got there in the late afternoon, it was a long wait for the tram to the top. We spent all of our time in the building that holds the impressionist paintings. It is quite a collection! There was a special exhibit about style which I really enjoyed. Don’t miss this gem in LA. I wish we had more time, but I believe it would be comparable to the Louvre had I done everything. Also, take time to step out on the verandas for some amazing views of LA and Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyPTraveler
50,Art and Architectrue in LA,"One of the best museums I have ever been to. Perched on a hill with spectacular views of LA, the beautiful Richard Meier designed campus takes your breath away. You park at a huge carpark upon arrival then take a tram to the museum. The museum is free. Parking was $10.Van Gogh’s Irises is on display as well as works from other masters. Take in the orientation film before seeing the exhibits and pick up a free audio guide.You need at least 2-3 hours to appreciate this place. I could easily spend the better part of the day here.We will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ntrekker

50,"World Class Museum, Garden and View","Probably the best thought out attraction in LA. Easy to find, easy to park, shuttle tram, free admission (parking $15)....what's not to like? Oh, forgot to mention that the views are spectacular, the gardens are interesting, excellent architecture. The two exhibits we viewed were both well laid out...A must see in Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryw205
50,Nice day out from the city,"It’s quite far away from the city, so we took a bus. From the bus station you only walk a few minutes and then take the shuttle train (it’s free) to the Museum. The architecture is beautiful, especially on a sunny day without clouds. They have a kids room with tasks for the little ones (our daughter was too young for this). Food and drink over there are quite expensive. Insaw people bring their own which was clever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prophet_s1976
40,Beautiful garden and nice exhibits,"There is a tram to take you to and from parking to the Getty, but it was so crowded, we walked up. It’s a nice walk on a nice day. The gardens are gorgeous and the views spectacular. There was an Egyptian exhibit when we were there that was very interesting. I gather the exhibits change. Good availability for food and drinkand places to sit. It’s a lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelagentreplies
50,Perfect!,The Getty is wonderful and amazing! We went there at 9:30 am. The underground was open. We took the tram to the center. The staff is friendly and helpful. The arts are impressive. The gardens are wonderful. The views are beautiful. The buildings are modern. We spent about 5 hours at the center. We paid $15 at the pay station for parking. 1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BangkokSachse

50,Rochelle,This museum is amazing. Ample on site parking. World class fine art. And exhibitions. The staff is courteous and kind. They have dining options. This museum could take days to go through. Plenty beautiful things to satisfy all interests. This should not be missed when visiting LA. Very family friendly and wheel chair friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochelleg709
50,Gorgeous property and views,"Had time for a quick visit to the Getty Museum before our red-eye flight back home. It is worth it just to see the amazing buildings, gardens, and views over LA. The art is also great with good special exhibits. Great impressionist collection and well displayed.This museum is near the Bel Air and UCLA areas, which we we glad to have a chance to experience since our other tourist stops had us mainly focused on Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. This is really a beautiful and quieter area of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murfb
50,Outstanding Museum,"This center has a parking lot which is $15, but there is NO charge for the Getty Center. You take a tram up to the Center with views of Los Angeles. You go to Visitor Center to obtain a map and check for various free tours of the day. We were able to take an Art Tour where the docent was Excellent and informative. The Egyptian tour was only OK. You could spend days here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lukeanthonywflorida
50,A true gem,A beautiful museum and gardens. The docents on the tours were very knowledgeable and friendly. The collections were beautifully displayed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ponydoc4u
50,Simply Wow!,"Having recently watched the FX show TRUST and read John Pearsons book ""Painfully Rich"" about the Getty's I was anxious to visit The Getty Center. It does NOT disappoint! It is architecturally stunning and very well appointed with beautiful, classic works of art, furniture and sculptures. Parking is $15 (or 10 after 3:00 p.m.--- they close at 5:00 pm so it's not worth saving $5 to race through the museum in 2 hours.)Parking spaces are narrow, very, very narrow. Our Prius was a tight fit and we had to be ever so careful to not touch the cars next to us. Folks driving an SUV will definitely be snug.10 tips for other first time visitors (based on our first time visit):1) Arrive early and plan to spend at least 4 hours, 5 hours is a more comfortable pace and you won't miss hidden jewels like the Lower Terrace sculpture garden or the South Promontory Cactus garden.2) Enjoy lunch in the cafe and walk the grounds. Food is a little pricey (think Disney fast food prices). If you get a sandwich, a full sandwich is large enough for two and cheaper than getting a half sandwich for each person.3) Spend some time viewing the interactive J Paul Getty display. The docents will point you to the building that houses the interactive touch screen monitors. It's one of the few modern and ""digital"" displays. It's informative and provides background and insight into the man who made this possible for us.4) All buildings have displays on the first AND second floor, be sure to take the elevator to the second floor before crossing into the next display hall. It doesn't matter what order you complete them in. Most people start at the North Pavilion (moving clockwise through the Pavilions). If it's a busy day I recommend you start with the West Pavilion and work your way counter clockwise. Be on the look out for any traveling displays. We were there for the treasures of the Nile. Special exhibits will be on the 2nd floor of the ""Exhibition Pavilion"" closes to the West Pavilion.5) Bring water and a camera because pictures ARE allowed for almost all displays. If photography isn't allowed you'll see a sign (e.g. the painting ""Christ Entry Into Brussels"" can't be photographed). If in doubt ask a security guard. There is one for every one to two rooms.6) Take a moment to take in the views of Los Angeles from the second floor. The architect did a magnificent job of bringing in ambient lighting and maximizing the views from high atop the hill where the museum is located.7) Take advantage of the headsets. These are audio guides provided in exchange for your drivers license. I wish I would've picked one up early in our visit. By the time I realized their value it was too late. Next time, it'll be the first thing I pick up.8) Inside the Map and Highlights brochure (pick one up just as you enter the main entrance) look for the ""Collection Highlights"". The Getty Center owns many famous paintings and sculptures and have them on display. Want to see Van Gogh's Irises? The Collection Highlights tells you that it's in the West Pavilion in display #W204. In other words, if you want to see a specific famous piece the Collection Highlights tells you exactly where to find it. If it's not listed ask a docent or the security guards. The security guards are very well trained on the Pavilion collections and I heard them fielding and answering visitor questions about the pieces.9) Watch the orientation video, it's quick and a good introduction to what awaits you.10) Finally, do NOT leave until you walk the gardens. You'll find sculptures and beauty within the gardens.Next up for us is the Getty Villa in Malibu. I only wish The Getty Center was closer to home because I would definitely be up there more often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399
50,World Class!,"The Getty Center is impressive on so many levels. The parking area is well lighted and clean and will only cost $15 dollars. This is the last fee you will have to pay, as the entire visit to the center is free. After parking you are nicely directed to a light rail type tram that delivers you up the hillside to a setting of true impressive design. The view of the all the white stone and block buildings along with the many landscaped grounds and gardens is awesome! And then there is the city of LA and surrounding areas below. The staff directed us to the tour the grounds first and then take in the many great works of art in several of the buildings. A super collection of works by Rembrandt and his take on a time in India, plus two outstanding paintings by Van Gogh were on hand. Mid-day lunch was on the outdoor patio of the cafe that served excellent soup, salad and sandwiches. We spent the day here and it was well worth it. My only advice, if you are here as a tourist, would be to visit The Getty Center last because it will spoil you for any other sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdfsdaz
50,Number one in LA for good reasons,"I've visited art museums and galleries all over the world, and this one is totally amazing. The location and architecture alone are worth the visit, and we spent happy hours just wandering the grounds. But the collection really blew me away. It seems like everything is here. I couldn't get enough! The only problem with the place is the parking -- a little hard to manage. I can't imagine trying to visit here on public transpo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karmor2014
50,Allow a full Day or Two,"We arrived shortly before opening at 10am after parking ($15) and tram ride. Admission is free and be sure to stop by the tour desk for a list of daily events and suggestions. There is so much to see and do, and the first tour of Egyptian artifacts was cancelled, so we opted to get the free audio and do it ourselves along with the garden tour. We shared a chinese chicken salad @ $17 for lunch on the patio.We opted for the ""Collection Tour"" of major art works and that was excellent. We never would have learned as much of the history and personal details of the artists on our own. However, there are so many amazing works on site that we still toured the various galleries for several more hours!Unfortunately, we didn't realize the Getty Villa was in Malibu and 30 minutes away without peak afternoon traffic, so we didn't have time to see it. But we will return and allow a few days as there is the Skirball Center and other things to do. It's wonderful gift to yourself with no admission fee, just parking or an Uber ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bchgrl9

50,Remarkable Museum,"From the beautiful grounds to the impeccably laid out displays, this place is a real gem. Children and adults alike were enjoying the varied exhibits. Two members of our party are disabled, but we had no difficulty navigating the galleries and the grounds. This admission free venue is good for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5761ULcarolc
40,a wonderfull way to spend a summer evening,"A summer Saturday night accompanied by live music at one of los angeles prime location.Listen, look around and take in the atmosphere .It truly is a special place. The only missing ingredient is a better quality of food available at the outdoor vendors.Hope they solved this shortcoming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S502VUDavidH
40,"Entry tickets weren't looked at, so no worries!","We carefully planned our trip, so that we would arrive on time and by bus, having got the bus driver to clip our tickets, to enable us to get the lift up to the museum, along a steep drive, as per the instructions online. We needn't have bothered. Plenty of taxis and Ubers entered and sped up the driveway, to drop off patrons. Meanwhile, we baked in the sun for half an hour at the entrance gate, waiting for the minibus to arrive..and I mean half an hour. I was worried that our timed ticket would mean that we would be denied access, as we were already a little late. The tickets weren't even looked at, even the hole punch, at the ticket kiosk, halfway up the drive. Patrons are not allowed to walk up the drive anyway, so we had no alternative but to wait. When we arrived at the drop off point, I wasn't 100% sure where to go. Generally, the place could do with a few maps dotted about and a regular minibus, because there was more than one minibus load of patrons waiting to leave at the same time. We ended up being taken down in an employees utility vehicle, complete with baby seat. Luckily, there were only 3 of us, so there was room, which I suppose is why the driver didn't ask the other groups if they wanted a lift. Now for the museum! Fabulous and many, many works of ancient antiquity. Fabulous, fabulous ponds/water features. Highly recommend this place, but just take an Uber/taxi, I really wish we had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
50,Don’t miss it!,"What a wonderful place! Incredible vistas, architecture & gardens—plus world class exhibits. Something here for all of your senses around every corner. We spent a half-day here, and felt we saw a good portion of the collections, but you could plan for the entire day if your schedule allows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243sandran
40,We prefer the architecture and the vistas,"We're not much for museum pictures on the wall. We're sort of uncultured in that way (though we do like art). But the architecture and the sensational views from the Getty are really wonderful for a few hour visit. We are not big fans of their restaurant, which has proven to be disappointing on a few occasions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2583IHjohns
40,Art Musuem for Mothers Day,"I am so glad my daughter drove to the Getty. L A traffic is a nightmare. but we got there promptly at 10 am just in time for the opening. Parking is $15 and no reservations just get there early. Beautiful ground/garden architecture., the rooms seemed a little sparse of art work but there was a Rembrandt showing . He painted pictures of eastern India using Indian painters as his muse. Wonderful. It probably took 2-3 hours to see the majority ( I could have stayed all day if I had driven )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gallaghera416

50,"Amazing place, impresive art collection and architecture concept","The Getty Ceter is a must see. If you like the art, you will enjoy their impressive art collection. If you like the architecture, you will like the architectural achievment of the center and its inteligent and beautiful conception. If you simply like the beauty in general, you will love the views from the top of the hill, overloking LA, Santa Monica and the ocean as well as the garden of the center. Am amazing please which should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bogdan2005
50,You must go here while in L.A.,"Absolutely fantastic! Everything from the tram ride up, to the grounds, to the exhibits themselves was wonderful. Just one day does not do it justice. This is a must-see when visiting the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
50,Great displays of art and architecture,"Added this to the end of our trip and so glad that we did. Got there at opening and easily could have done a second day. Loved the Garden and the art. The buildings and grounds are very captivating with views of the city. So much to see and with the special exhibits, could see it as a regular stop if we lived in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6992LIjohnl
40,As much the location as the collection,"The collection is not great, but the location is.Parking is expensive, and tight, even in a compact rental car. A free cable car takes you from the parking garage to the museum. Situated on a hill overlooking the LA the location is fairly spectacular, which adds to a visit. The restaurant is decent, but not a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurr4

50,Amazing Exhibitions & Beautiful Views,We took a leisurely stroll through the “Beyond the Nile” exhibit. Taking our time to read all of the information included with each artifact. We had a bite to eat and finished our quick visit with a walk in the “Central Garden.” Everything around this creation was in bloom. It was an explosion of color.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homecoming80
50,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"First of all this place is free!!! I can't believe that especially after you get there. It is just such a beautiful complex with a gorgeous garden. You park at the bottom of the mountain in a parking garage. It is $15, totally worth it. Then you take a tram to The Center. We walked around their lovely garden area, with views of the city. There is a place to eat outside. Though it is windy you can't beat the views. The galleries were lovely. They had amazing statues and in front of them were windows that overlooked the city. It was a wonderful afternoon! I would definitely visit again. Did I mention it is free?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm502
50,SKETCHING AMONG THE ARTISTS,"Obviously the museum is beautiful with something for everyone. If you have young child along, the sketching room is a must do. Your child will sit quietly and intently sketching while you look on with great pride. They will be inspired to create their own masterpiece in charcoal which they can then take home!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95bonnier
50,Amazing Place! Wonderful Location and Architecture and beautiful collection,"It was a fantastic experience!Me and my wife traveled from Houston-TX to California and one of the goals was to visit the Getty Center. We were delighted with the visit. Starting with the parking experience. They have lots of parking space. The access to the Getty Center is then done by a small train that takes you up the hill in which top the museum is located.Once on top you will see a beautiful set of modern buildings with surrounding magnificent views!Be sure to check the surrounding gardens and sculptures!It was quite interesting to learn about the creation of the Getty Center at the Plaza Level interactive media.The collections are amazing! The paintings and sculptures are fantastic.We had the opportunity to check the Egyptian exhibit ""Beyond the Nile"" (until Sep 9, 2018) where several interesting objects and data about the Egyptian people and their contact with the Minoan people! Amazing!The paintings are phenomenal with several Renascence and Impressionist examples. The sculptures are also amazing.The views from around the main building are wonderful!We had lunch at the Cafe with many options for the meal!They provide audio guide which is very convenient, although the only complete guide is in English, they provide in other languages but only covering the most relevant items.They also provide guided tours which I did not have the opportunity to engage but it looked very interesting since I could hear some explanations from the guides during my visit.I definitely recommend this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4599TNpedrob
50,Great Art/Culture Museum,Well Curated Exhibits and beautiful outdoor spaces make this a must-see for those that enjoy culture/art museums. Unique perspectives show the borrowing of techniques and/or themes from other artists and cultures. Everything curated to give a new or or unusual relationship between art/artist and the bigger cultural impact.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/illysez
50,Tuesday it's museums day!,I went with a friend of mine. It's a beautiful place. The exhibitions are always very interesting. You can choose your favorite artistic period. They have all of them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraLeeloo
50,A hidden work of art,"Amazing museum, I've seen some of the finest artwork from the Medieval Era imaginable there. They constantly have new exhibits being showcased, and it's always a treat to go there. Plus there are stunning views of the surrounding Los Angeles era from all around the museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardD1871
50,My go-to spot for entertaining guests from out of town,"Art lovers, the Getty is a must. I love to bring out of town guests to the Getty for the day. Admission is free, and the only fee is for parking. I like it easy, so I make sure that we go first thing when it opens - parking galore, and no time waiting to have your bags checked before getting on the shuttle. There is also no waiting for the shuttle. The shuttle is a fun experience in itself, but you can also walk to the main building from the parking lot (just be prepared for a steep hill going up). Inside the Getty, their rotating exhibits are usually thought provoking and inspiring - I long remember these exhibits after their gone. The permanent collections offer a wide array of art, and the multiple buildings that make up the Getty help to ensure that crowds are well dispersed. The most famous works will be mobbed, but still accessible. My favorite part of Getty is the outdoor gardens. All are gorgeous, but the main large garden offers beautiful lawns of grass that I take full advantage of. (My family from the east coast doesn't understand what a lack of grass and rain does to a person!) Anyway, the views from the Getty are spectacular, and I find that I spend as much time outdoors at the Getty as I do inside. The only criticism is the food - the cafe is just ok, and a bit pricey for just ok. I love to watch people walk up to the menu for the sit down restaurant, review the menu, then walk away. I am sure the food is delicious - just a bit ambitious for the general person. But I suspect foodies would enjoy it. Oh, the Getty has three gift stores, and I visit them all each time. Each has their own vibe and offerings, but many items do overlap if you have only time for the main gift shop. Plan to spend anywhere from 3-5 hours for art and outdoors, it is a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lehowley
50,Getty Center A must!,Got off airplane and went straight to museum with Uber/Lyft. The whole staff was very friendly. Beautiful pieces and free tours. No food or drink in the museum. Also very expensive food and drink. Definitely should be on your list. They have lockers for your suitcases.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdomsmom
50,Great Experience at the Getty,It's a beautiful museum in a beautiful location. There are pleasant places to relax outside and have a bite to eat. Best of all is it's FREE! It does cost $15 to park but what a bargain if two or more go in one car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89sandil
50,Beautiful view at the Getty,Great Friday evening visit. It wasn't crowded so for me that was a plus. Exhibits were great we were there for several hours and only got through 2 of the 5 exhibits we wanted to see but we were completely okay with that. The view were awesome! Will make all my visits there on Friday evenings. Wonderful experience when visiting the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ardettel

50,Favorite museum,"The Getty is one of my favorite museums of all. There is no admission fee you just have to pay for parking. The premesisis is absolutely beautiful. The outside architecture is amazing and I can go on for days for looking at it. The art selection is magnificent, arts from all around the world. The French furniture they have display is always awesome to look at. The outdoor garden is breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nana2266
40,Prime location,"The exhibits themselves are rarely the real draw at the Getty--go early in the morning when the fog is rising from the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains and the sunlight casts majestic shadows across the modular, sterile walkways and walls in order to get a full sense of the beauty of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samwN771KC
50,What a museum,"Can’t even describe what an enjoyable day we had at the Getty! The Egyptian exhibit there now is extensive plus the paintings, the photography, the gardens and even the cafeteria food was fun and plentiful. The cable car ride is is breathtaking looking down at LA. Probably need a car to get there or uber/Lyft/taxi as I didn’t see bus stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyl240
50,World class location and collections,"Its hard to know whether the Getty is one of the most beautiful views of Los Angeles complimented by a world class art collection, or a world class art collection surrounded by one of the most beautiful views of Los Angeles. However you view it, it is a cultural Mecca; a must see and experience venue unlike any other modern museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldwT5420YM
30,Good Location for being close by off of the #405,"Big place , lots to see and do. There is a lot of walking. It can be confusing to where you want to go if they don't have signs or postings. You can get lost in the buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goshop58

50,Dinner and special exhibition of Egypt,Love every time we visit the Getty. Specially dinner during sunset. New Egypt exhibition is wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546hildat
40,Amazing view and lovely grounds,"The art seems somewhat secondary to the grounds and view. It's totally worth the trip and time to spend a morning or afternoon here. But the collection is also good. If the kids get a little squirly inside, the outdoor garden is perfect for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elauinc
50,Definitely worth a visit when in LA,"The Getty is an architecturally beautiful, modern art gallery. With a range of rotating visits, you can visit a couple of times a year and see plenty of new art from different genres. This is not the Louvre, the Met or the National Gallery, but rather a more intimate venue with carefully selected and curated collections. Overlooking the LA valley, the views are wonderful, with outdoor gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsH451UU
50,Incredible art museum,This is an incredible art museum with lovely gardens and amazing views of LA.A must visit while you are in LA and the best thing is it’s free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atanum
50,A Must for Any Visitor to LA,"We live in Los Angeles and have been to the Getty Center many times, either on our own or with family guests from out of town. And it has always been a pleasure for adults and children alike. This is a quintessential LA experience with the spectacular setting, modern architecture and cool vibe throughout. This is a half day's worth of enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluestoneparkview
50,The Getty,This was so amazing. I truly enjoyed the place and found it most educating even for a Canadian. Lots of walking between sections though. Disappointing on the photographers one. Thought it would be more history of the cameras and the developing process of the years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225debbiec
50,Don't miss,"This is the third visit for me. Love the architecture, exhibits, and gardens. Attention to detail and customer services is wonderful. Don't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kt1405

Not only does LA show some of its most interesting art collections at this place, it is also a fantastic place to get a better view of the land form the top of its imposing hill. The Getty has a reputation for being a work=ld class museum, the temporary exhibits it shows are up t the level of any world class museum. Dont miss the Getty villas as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2561APjuliom
50,Let's Getty!,"Not enough time...so much to see. This is certainly a day's event but optionally you can stay as long as time permits. There is something for all to enjoy, however, I recommend checking to see the schedule to see any special exhibits first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choiceonela
50,Beautiful inside and out!!,"The Getty is a beautiful piece of architecture, that houses so many wonderful works of art. The views are incredible, the lawn and gardens are sublime. You will not be disappointed if you visit this lovely museum. The kids loved the furniture rooms-all decorated as if you were stepping into a room at Versailles. The paintings from the masters are on display and the stunning marble statues are not to be missed! You must check it out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batchic2018

50,"Absolutely stunning buildings, landscaping, gardens and art","All of the beauty of the Getty is the only thing that minimizes the WOW factor of its incredible collection of art and furniture. One could spend the whole day here and have more to see! Or, one could just hang outside all day and be completely sated! All for just $15 a car load. Plus, they are open late on Saturdays. This was definitely the highlight of my last trip to SoCA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrairiewomanfromCA
50,The Getty Upstairs Restaurant for Dinner,"We’ve been to the Getty Upstairs Restaurant for Dinner several times before and it is always EXCELLENT!! And the views are fabulous!

50,"Inspiring Architecture, beautiful artwork and stunning views of the gardens, city & ocean!","The Getty is such an uplifting experience ~ from the stunning architectural entrance, to the excellent art collection that can rival many other museum collections. When I have taken out-of-town guests to the Getty, I always walk them straight back the to gallery of paintings in the South Pavilion on the 2nd Floor. Then just outside of the back doors of that gallery are some of the best views of Los Angeles you could find. One should also not miss the Rembrandt Paintings in the East Pavilion 2nd floor. Also a walk through the gardens to the west of the building is a must see for the full Getty experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slampat
50,The Getty Center is Fabulous in Location and Design!,"Because it is situated on a hilltop overlooking downtown L.A., The tram ride from the parking lot to the museum is wonderful as well. The parking is about $15 but there is a public bus (cheaper) that drops off at the front of the Getty and you can take the tram to the museum. Always take a wrap (scarf or light jacket) because the museum is slightly out doors with open passages and tables an chairs to sit. An enormous garden is available for a stroll and can have hot or cool temperatures. The Getty Center is really a feel good beautiful space and a place to spend a few hours or the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelo640
50,"If you're looking for the best unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean, this is the place.","The art the feature is always top notch, but I love brining a blanket, a good book and wandering around the gardens while I enjoy the California sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waterknight36

40,Love the Getty ❤️,"I love this place. Tram 🚋 ride is so much fun, museum is excellent and a true architectural gem. This place is so beautiful and sophisticated- a great place to take your children. Food is very very good. Only complains are that parking is expensive and ladies working in the various gift shops are RUDE - I purchased items in 2 gift shops and the very rude ignorant woman working in the gift shop did not want to give me a bag for my purchase!!!!! Unbelievable- do the take the cost of the bag out of her paycheck ? Beyond ignorant- a deterrent to spending money At Getty Gift shops which are expensive. How obnoxious can you get?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morgankelly876

It is not just the art that is wonderful here, it's everything--the setting, the architecture, the landscaping. It is as overwhelming as it is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THD
50,Amazing exhibits worth the time,"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and really enjoyed it. You only pay for the parking which is $15 before 3:00 and $10 after 3:00. There is a tram that takes you to the center and it takes about 30 min with parking and bag check. There is a brief intro movie and audio headsets that you can get for added information. There are also guided tours. The ground, gardens and statues are lovely and the architecture alone with beautiful views of LA are worth the visit. The special exhibits included Marie Antoinette’s lacquer boxes, Rembrandt and India and an Egyptian exhibit. We also saw a very good selection of impressionist paintings and renaissance paintings. The photo exhibit was nice as well. Overall the place is clean, serene and a wonderful display of art from around the world. Most pieces are on loan from other museums so you will be limited on picture taking for anything from the Vatican and a few other museums. We would definitely return as they change the exhibits and we didn’t even see half of it. It is a full day if you want to do it justice. We rushed through 3 pavilions in about 2.5 hours. Kudos to the center for keeping the admission as just the parking costs. Overall a lovely experience inside the center and outside as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy007
50,Beautiful setting.,"I have zero interest in anything related to art but I loved this place. The $15 for parking with free entry to the museum was well worth it just to be there. The buildings are immaculate and the views across LA are breathtaking. The views going up in the tram was amazing too. We had lunch in the cafe, reasonably priced and lovely food. We did the garden tour, the story of how the gardens were planned from the trees to the water features is so interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJAllen16
50,Beautiful place!,"My family and I visited on a rather chilly day, so many beautiful things to see here! Amazing objects and grounds, couldn't believe there wasn't an admission charge for this place. While I didn't get to spend as much time here as I would have liked due to rest of family having enough, I would highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munttel
30,"Nice setting, mediocre collection","Their special exhibitions are worth looking at, but the resident collections are meh. If you're an art lover, go to LACMA. The setting is nice overlooking the valley, but the architecture is really dreary modernist conformist to me. Not one of the great museums, I've been to the Met MOMA, Guggenheim in NYC, British Museum in London, Louvre in Paris, Prado in Madrid, Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh in Amsterdam, Pergamon and Neues museums in Berlin, others. This isn't even in the ballpark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
50,Great Museum,A must for to see at least once. Amazing art in a beautiful setting. The building is amazing to see. Make reservations and also make reservations to the restaurant its a nice place to go. Wear comfortable shoes a lot of walking and a lot of up and downs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorona653
50,A must see,"We took an Uber from West Hollywood and back again . Ride shares have a designated drop off area. Museum entry is freeThe museum is amazing in both its architecture and contentWe did a tour of the gardens which were probably the main highlight. The guide was knowledgeable and also talked about the architecture and how the two went together. We also did a highlights tour of the collection as there is so much to see. Currently there are 2 special exhibitions, an Egyptian and a Rembrandt which looks at Indian influences on his works. Both are worth a lookThere are plenty of areas to have a break and have a drink or something to eat. It’s a full day so get there early",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255060Charlie10
50,Love Love Love,This is such a special place housing so much great art from around the world and over the centuries. Definitely plan a trip here and to the Getty Villa housing the antiquities and expect to spend all day and still not get to everything. Heaven!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denali5540
50,Exquisite Museum,This is an amazing museum where you spend inside and outside. The architecture and gardens are one of the time. The artwork is reminiscent of artwork that you see in Amsterdam or other places in Europe. The museum is free to the public only have to pay for parking. Take either a train to the top the museum or is easy easy three-quarter mile beautiful walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzyk106
50,The architecture is magnificent,"My second trip here, my wife's first visit, she was stunned by this place. We spent a little time inside at the exhibits, it was the outside setting, the architecture, & the gardens that kept us enthralled. Well worth taking the free guided tours to get a full understanding of this magnificent place.Paul Getty may have been a notorious skinflint, but he has left a breathtaking legacy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2107LJkenm
50,Fascinating museum and gardens,"Firstly it was free and secondly even if you had to pay it would have been worth it. It has wide open spaces and plenty of room to roam. Full of interesting artefacts, furniture and fabulous paintings. When I went there was a couple of exhibitions the most interesting to me was an Egyptian one. The view is amazing right out to sea. In fact I have no words just go and see for yourself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazelbeal56
50,Beautiful museum,"Have a day off in Los Angeles and decide to spend a few hours in the Getty Center.Avoid the crowd and arrive in the Getty Center at about 2:30pm, which has less people than expected. Since it is a summer time, the Center open till 9pm and therefore, there are still lots of tours (including exhibition highlight tour, architecture tour, garden tour, etc) available. Would recommend both the garden tour and architecture tour that are awesome and would provide you more background about this museum. The exhibition highlight tour is also good especially for those new exhibitions.There are lots of parking space but I take Uber to the center and public bus (743 in the weekday, 243 in the weekend) from the center to metro.

50,"Not an Artsy-Fartsy kinda guy, but my wife and I LOVED Getty Center!","Ok, I've gotta tell you, art shows and museums aren't really my kinda thing, but since I'v learned ""Happy Wife, Happy Life"", we took a visit to the Getty Center. I've gotta say, I was bowled over by the exhibits! They were featuring an Egyptian and Greek section that was stunning! mummies, crypts, sculptures, carvings, jewelry, and a whole lot more. We got our $$$ worth in that portion of the Center alone, but there was TONS more to come.The paintings were incredible. The sculptures magnificent! We stayed 2-21/2 hours and barely scratched the surface. Next time in LA will certainly revisit, and plan on a lot more time there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickW11111
50,Spectacular Grounds,"Our group of 4 visited on a sunny cool Wednesday. We arrived at 11 am and found parking expensive but easy. The tram ride from the parking area to the museum entrance provided nice views. We watched an excellent introductory movie which helped get us orientated. Our first tour of the gardens was wonderful, guided by a superb docent. Friendly, knowledgeable and eager to answer questions. The scenery and views are gorgeous framed by magnificent architecture. Then we did a collection highlights tour, guided by another wonderful docent. The art is spectacular. We topped off a lovely visit with a relaxing lunch at the terrace cafe. The food was ok and the prices were not outrageous. The best part of lunch was the lovely garden views. We departed after a great 4 hour visit. Short but sweet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joinbill
40,"Beautiful grounds, interesting museum","I've definitely never been to another museum like the Getty before -- getting there is half of the fun part - you take a tram up a hill and at the top, on a good day, you can see a good part of Los Angeles and the ocean. The grounds are beautiful and so fun to walk around - it really feels like a special place; despite being in the middle of Los Angeles it kind of feels like you're somewhere far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The art was nice -- honestly I've been a little more impressed with the art collections in other smaller museums around LA (I'm not an art snob! I just thought I would see more ""recognizable"" pieces at the Getty since I had heard so much about it), but the experience of visiting the museum itself and spending a day wandering around the grounds is definitely worth the $15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessica32115
50,Incredible beautiful museum extraordinaire,"I can’t imagine why I had not been here on earlier visits to the area. It will now be at the TOP of my list always.Normally at museums it is the collection that one has in memory. Granted, the Louvre, the Met and other museums also have grand buildings. But at the Getty, the building is a gem of unsurpassed beauty with gardens and terraces, ponds, fountains, terraces and views, courtyards and lawns , there is no end to the variations and features of the buildings that make up this jewel. Incredibly, admission is free and covered parking is a mere 15 bucks.Park, takea tram up the hill and arrive at the imposing, yet inviting structures. The collections are exquisite but not overwhelming. Explore the buildings and gardens as much as the exhibits. Guided tours, audio guides, interactive exhibits and more hearken you to explore.Imported Italian travertine is used everywhere, sometimes polished, rough hewn walls, tumbled ... a veritable Taj Mahal right in LA.Well maintained and the gardens too show beauty, expertise, pride and artistry.Visit, go back, hangout, eat , play , marvel, shop in the gift shop enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27shankarr
50,Another Major Los Angeles Cultural Center,"The Getty has been a major addition to culture in the Los Angeles area and has become a must see for any visitor. The collection has improved over the years. The Getty has been a major contributor to museums all over the world, and as a result has been able to obtain masterpieces for wonderful special exhibitions. One should take docent tours for BOTH the highlights of the museum, and also the outside of the museum which features magnificent garden.In the event of long lines to wait for the tram and you are physically fit, you can walk the path up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/springpa
50,Amazing,This place is amazing. The buildings are worth a visit with spacious walkways and plazas and magnificent views of Los Angeles. Then the collection of art is outstanding. This is a must see if you visit Los Angeles and is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikehayes45
40,Fantastic buildings housing a wide ranging collection,"Great place to hang out in LA. Super easy to get to and loads of lovely volunteers and tours of the collections.They have Van Gogh, Monet, Pissaro and Cezanne. All housed in architecturally superb surroundings. What is not to like? A great starting point for someone who is new to art galleries, wants to bring their kids, date, Mom or Dad and enjoy some culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaM331
50,Beautifully California,Such a great place to bring your family and friends. Skies are so blue here and the views are amazing. Beautiful architecture and fantastic works of art.

50,Make a day ofay of it,We drove up from San Diego for a day trip.It was a wonderful experience and could not believe how we were treated. It was as if we were very important guests rather than “another tourist”. The docent was knowledgeable and entertaining. The grounds were fabulously groomed. Selection of lunch alternatives were excellent. The views gave us us an entirely different vantage point of LA. This is definitely a “must see”.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4364UPpatm
50,Simply Unmissable if you are visiting LA,"Do not visit LA and miss visiting the Getty Center. The art collection may not be as extensive as some of the larger European collections, but it is still very representative.The combination of this, the amazing architecture by Meier, and the views over LA make it as close to perfection as you can.There is no entrance fee and you just pay $15 or $10 for the parking and you can’t beat that. I visited on a Saturday afternoon so their were some lines but it was very fast moving and efficient so don’t be disheartened if you find a queue when you arrive.Take time for the visit to enjoy the exhibits but also the architecture and the views, so don’t rush it.There was a very good vibe with entertainment for children going on as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADXBS

There is something for the whole family to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericuchon
50,Gorgeous views,"I've been here twice and must say it's gorgeous and you should go even if you aren't interested in the current exhibition. We went on a Saturday and there were long lines for the tram up so if you go weekends be sure to factor in at least a 20 minute wait for tram. There were live dance performances that were SO special and the docents are lovely and it's FREE! Don't miss a walk in the gardens. A bonus is a set aside Uber waiting area under an umbrella. Good job, Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EasternTraveler1921
50,Quite a surprise.,"Although I'd been in LA a few times before, I had never visited this museum. I had a couple of hours to kill and took an Uber there and I was certainly in for a surprise. The museum is quite amazing in many respects. Architecturally, it is quite wonderful and the location is incredible, with breathtaking views over Los Angeles. However, I was not expecting the picture collection to be of such a high level, with an extraordinary collection of paintings by old masters, impressionists, in addition to religious art, sculptures and other outstanding works of art that made me feel like I was at an important European museum. I will definitely need to return as I only had enough time to look around very quickly and this place absolutely deserves a more detailed visit. I cannot recommend this museum enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgernst
50,Perfect architecture,"This is our third visit to the Getty Center. Even though we didn't have enough time to see all the exhibits, we went just to enjoy the space. We love the architecture. You can point your camera everywhere, there is always a vista. Even if you just came out of an exhibit room and looked at the hall way, the proportions are still perfect. The buildings are built for people – i.e. it didn't matter that there are crowds in the photo, the composition is still great to look at because the buildings work for people. We love the garden and spent time just looking at the views of the building, of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762paulines
50,Spectacular architecture and design,"I think I enjoyed the scenery outside of the grounds and architecture even more than the exhibits inside! This is such an artistic masterpiece, with great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noxgear
50,"Great buildings, architecture sbd grounds and art","Beautiful location, architecture and gtounds to along with very good art collection. You park at the bottom of yhe hill and a monorail takes you up to museum grounds. You get a spectacular view of LA , so be sure you allow time to explore the grounds as well as the artwork. There are several tours that guide you thtough the art, the architecture of the buildings and notanical gardens. The self guided audio tours was also excellent and highly recommended. Could have spent much longer than 3 hours we had. Also areas for food, drink and outdoor seating to take in the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliespal2
50,Arrive Early for Easy Access,"My wife and I visited the Getty Center on a Saturday morning. We arrived around 9:30am and were able to park with ease. The tram was also easy to access and had very few people when we arrived. We spent the first part of our visit waking around the gardens. The view and the weather were both fabulous.We did experience many of the exhibits but as it got later the crowds increased exponentially. We left around noon, and by this time the trams and parking lot were overcrowded with people. Arrive early to avoid the crowds, and be sure to visit the gardens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmB7615TW
50,The best day during my stay in Los Angeles was the day I visited the Getty Center,I spent eight hours in Getty Center. It has very good facilities & amazing exhibits. I enjoyed my meal in its restaurant too. The service was very good and the waiters very kind. I recomment you to visit it! You gonna love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VasilikiMachias

50,A Must do!,Fantastic museum with free audio tour & gorgeous gardens! There is no charge for the museum but $15 charge for parking. Well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystalinkc
50,Absolutely Wonderful,I visited the Getty Museum on May 27th and it was a wonderful experience. I arrived at the parking center about 10 minutes before the museum opened and I got a parking spot quickly and only spent around 10 minutes in the line for the tram to the museum. I would recommend getting there early because traffic to the parking garage was backed up to the street when I left. I was pleasantly surprised with the gardens. I had no idea that the garden was there and it was beautiful. Take the time to walk around the front of the building for great views of LA and a unique cactus garden. The museum itself was nice and well labeled. I really enjoyed the Impressionist room and the special exhibits on Egyptian art and Rembrandt in India. All of this beauty and art for free. How amazing! The Getty Center is well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Replevin
20,Average at best,"I don’t know about the hype but this place is average from every point of view. People flock here but why? The art is average, everything you see is low quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drink50fifty
50,Beautiful gardens!,Beautiful Museum and the gardens outside are exquisite! Make sure to visit there on a day where the sky is clear because the view is absolutely breathtaking. Definitely recommended as one of the top places to visit while you are in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkyRuby
50,UNIQUE,"The Getty is more of a destination than a museum. Go for the buildings, views, landscaping, gardens and the experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477traveller
50,Beautiful Grounds and Museum,"The three hours we spent at The Getty Villa were not enough. In fact, we only got to see two of the five galleries. The museum is free (except for parking) as are the several tours available. The grounds and views are spectacular, and the vast amount of art is astounding. We will definitely return to The Getty Villa on our next trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBS661
50,Gorgeou art in a gorgeous setting,"The art is stunning, especially Impressionistic paintings. The setting almost steals the show from the art. In a world of extra charges, the free Getty Center is a gem. (If you drive, take surface streets and arrive less tense).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noyesville
50,This time having lots of money WORKED for the good,This is the most beautiful museum both inside and outside. I took the Central Garden tour and learned so much about the 'plan' behind the design.This provided me with a much better understanding of what I was seeing and experiencing. The gardens were in full bloom and I found it hard to go inside but am glad I did. This is not a fast paced tour. Please allow yourself time to really appreciate the Center and the gift that Mr. Getty has left for us to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandi20170
40,Only pay for parking,Great visit to the Getty. I had previously only been to the Getty by the beach. I am left wondering if you can bring a picnic for next time . The food is great but gets expensive if you eat there . Only pay for parking they don’t charge admission,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlejandroRodas032809
50,Art art art,I thought I was visiting a museum and I found an astonishing art complex.From the highway a private train took me up a hill to marvellous stone and water green gardens .The water beds are sculptures which give more movement to the moving water...beautiful!!!And of course inside the modern building you will find masterpieces.It is a must in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elklix
50,Sandhus at The Getty,"What a brilliant placeThe day we arrived the tram was full, so we walked up. Should happen everyday, the view was fantastic, the architecture of the museum is brilliant.The Giacometti in the entrance hall is resplendent, the Egyptian exhibition is an acquired taste. The permanent exhibitions are wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the Monet’s. Impossible not to get overwhelmed.One of the highlights of my trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899sarbs
50,Exceeded expectations,"Arrived straight from the airport and the staff was great about securely storing our bags. It takes a few minutes but if you only have a short time in the area it was worth it. The Impressionists room was very nice. A few pieces I was very familiar with and looking forward to seeing, as well as a few surprises. The grounds are quite lovely, as are the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizabethb78
50,Top of the hill,"The Getty Center, perched atop its hill overlooking Los Angeles, is among the best places to spend a day. Whether you're a local, a frequent visitor or here for a special occasion, this is the one place that should be on your itinerary.Visitors with young children: they will love the train ride, the sculpture garden and the many areas to run and play. Next to the train platform, there is a garden that schools often use on field trips, with picnic benches and a nice open space. Ask for a child friendly docent to show you around.Visitors with limited mobility: this museum is built with you in mind. Ramps and elevators are part of the architectural style and not an after thought.Visitors looking for a high-art experience: many pavilions for you to choose from. Impressionists, modernists, classics. This museum has it all.Tip: check out their website for evening talks and special events which are mostly free to attend and feature limited access to the museum after hours.Food: there are multiple options-- a casual cafeteria serving popular locally sourced food like burgers and pizzas; a restaurant that takes walk-ins and reservations featuring a spectacular view; and several food carts serving snacks and hot drinks.The Getty does not disappoint. The architecture and vistas are unmatched.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoShoEli
50,The most fantastic selection of major artwork from around the world,"The architecture and gardens are a highlight in themselves. The collections are stunning, well they would be with that amount of money being invested. All free to see. This would be the best LA attraction for aesthetes to visit. There’s nothing like seeing the work itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieannac2018
50,A gem ... take the time to visit and bonus... it's free!,Friday evening visit due to extended hours was wonderful. Plenty of room. Self guided or you can use audio tour. We explored the garden first in order to beat the sun. After the Egyptian exhibit was awesome with lots of unique pieces and many borrowed from other museums. We explore the photography section as well as Mr. Getty's personal collection. Stunning! Huge pieces! Take some time to explore. We paid a mere $10 for parking after 3 p.m. and easily spent 3 hours or so here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flblondee
50,Great Museum in LA,"Had a great few hours there, admission is free and the views are spectacular. Exhibitions were very special and unique... had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stavi2014
50,One The Best Free Things in L,This is by far one of my favorite spots to visit when I lived in LA even though I am not a huge art fan. The Getty has some of the best views of LA and the grounds the garden and the little hedge maze all make it an amazing place to visit. Now they also last when I was there this is of course they had for only a couple of Buck a little box that acted like your guide and told you about the differ art and artist when you enter different rooms and about some of the pantings. Yet worth it alone for the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheapbadtardtraveler
40,GETTY,Went with my sons to Getty Center recently. Very nice. Interesting art work from various time periods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/groverm146

50,Free and phenomenal,"What a wonderful day! We spent 4 hours here, with no break, and loved it. The volunteers are knowledgeable. The parking is great. There is a big parking structure and everyone takes a tram to the museum. The views from the surrounding decks are beyond beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauriec144
40,Impressive Museum and views,I never realized just how large and spacious this museum was. Our favorite area was the West Pavillion where we saw Van Gogh's Irises and other impressionist paintings. The central garden was lovely and a nice place to just relax. Cafe was a bit expensive. Only cost is for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripsrfun07
40,A must see,"Spectacular views, great art and interesting architecture-free admission, parking fee of $15 if you drive -well worth the visit-do not miss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCgirl
50,Spectacular!,"Amazing place – striking and beautiful, with great vistas, gardens, huge open courtyards, and world class artwork. Not child-oriented, although the kids did enjoy the small family room with fun interactive exhibits. Admission is amazingly free, although you pay $15 to park and take the tram from the parking garage to the museum. Would return in a heartbeat, since our three-hour visit gave us only a taste of what the museum has to offer. Do not miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyRiver
50,We spent the better part of two days here - must see on a visit to LA,"This was the main focus of our weekend visit to LA and we had a great time. We took an architectural tour of the grounds before launching into the collections and are glad we did. The buildings themselves are masterpieces. To understand the museum it's helpful to understand the buildings, the site itself, and even how the center created terrific views of the LA basin. The collections are quite diverse. The main collections are older European art, but there was an exhibit of Egyptian artifacts while we were there and it was world-class. This is one of those great museums that is worth visiting every couple years to see the traveling exhibitions. I should add that the museum also has a very nice cafeteria with a wide selection of food choices, good for both grown-ups and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrancer
40,Picturesque and Pleasant,"Breathtaking views, especially from the deck off the top floor of the west pavilion. The travertine stone buildings are airy & grand... so beautiful!!! No expense was spared in construction. The grounds and gardens are unique, colourful and artistically laid out. The art collection can’t compare to the famous museums of Europe. The architecture and grounds are the main attraction - absolutely heavenly! The value is incredible - it’s free admission and includes a ride in the tram. A great day trip above Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vista888
50,One of the best museums in the world.,The Getty Center is a must visit if you are visiting Los Angeles. The architecture of the Getty Center is beautiful. The gardens are gorgeous.

50,Wow! An excellent adventure!,"The architect, the view and oh, the art collection they have here!!! This is a great place to bring groups of all ages. The exhibits are world class and I really enjoyed walking around the floating gardens, while sipping a really good cappuccino. Parking can be difficult, best to take a car service to the trolley that takes you up to this amazing complex of treasures. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmichaelcampbell
40,Nice museum,"We visited for a quick look around as time was tight. The car park is $15, museum free. Food in the cafe was decent and reasonably priced. The museum is nice if art is your thing. The views are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
50,Allow at least half a day here++,"We only allowed ourselves 3 hours which is just not enough time. This place is a Campus and we went on two free tours. The architectural one was good but lacked depth, still worthwhile though and the other on the main exhibition with an Egyptian Greek theme.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoAust
50,The views are the biggest draw (inside and out),"The Getty is a cluster of imposing, almost domineering buildings looming over the 405 Freeway just above Sunset. The scale doesn’t feel daunting close up, though, and there are pleasant galleries spread among several buildings. Do walk around the place.Watch for special shows of interest. The host or help produce some excellent ones. The Getty’s own collection is a little uneven.The food service is unusually good for a museum. Plan for a lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91craigc
50,The Getty,"Fantastic experience, compares to the Met in NYC. Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, etc. all are here.it can get a bit crowded, we went mid afternoon and it wasn't too bad crowd wise..visited mid week.Best of all, there is no charge for admission! Allow a couple of hours to really enjoy it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertO727
50,Nothing better,"Don’t get me wrong, the art inside is awesome BUT for me, the attraction is the grounds! The gardens are nothing short of breathtaking and the views of the hills and the city is off the charts. Love having a picnic in the gardens. You can totally relax and unwind here. Not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129colleena
50,Stunning and Memorable!,We are so fortunate to have philanthropists like Mr. Getty leave gifts that change the lives of people from around the world! Forever!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1286LFpaulb
40,Slightly Disappointed,"I enjoy museums and was expected this one to be outstanding given the financial base it has to work with. I was a bit disappointed with the current exhibits. Having said that, the grounds are archecturally fabulous; the gardens and grounds superbly designed to flow with the archecture. I did enjoy it. The staff and volunteers very helpful. The museum is is totally free but there is a $15 parking fee. Overall a well-worth day spent on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247barryr
40,Interesting if you enjoy painting and architecture,"I visited this place on my 3 days stay in Los Angeles. There are different buildings featuring paintings from different ages and cultures. On that day, one of the building floors was featuring collage photography which was very interesting. LA city view is best from this place. If you are big fan of arts, you need at least 6 hours to see the whole place. Otherwise, just as a tourist, you need a max of 2 hours. I bought a couple of children books from the souvenir shop. I should say that, price is way higher than expected just like any other souvenir shop throughout USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Makshum
50,Impressive Art Collection,"Visited the Getty Center on a weekday. It was not that crowded. The Egyptian Art exhibit was featured. Also, Rembrandt’s paintings on India.Was able to see two of Vincent Van Gogh’s paintings and also Monet’s. Very much awed.The facilities and management is also laudable.You have to take a train up to the museum building. Wheelchair access available.Al fresco dining area is available and Snacks can be bought.No entrance fees, all for free.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajiea2016
50,Gorgeous,"Bring $15 for parking and a picnic lunch, and you’re set for the entire day. The shop requires more money -the stuff ain’t cheap, but it is cool.

50,Exceptional displays and knowlegable staff.Free entry,The permanent displays are exceptional and thought provoking. We saw two special exhibits which were also exceptionally well presented. Staff was attentive and knew what they were doing and could help with questions. Exceptional value as it is free.

50,Kindergarten approved!,"I took my kinder class here and they had a blast! Everyone loved the musical river, gorgeous gardens, and fossil hunting.

50,Not to be missed,"Spend an entire day here. Wonderful exhibits, beautiful gardens, great city views, decent restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barm5
40,A bit of heaven above the Hollywood Hills,"The Getty is one of the few havens in LA that transcends race, gender, age or politics and simply allows you to enjoy beauty in all its forms. From the quiet gardens and pathways that encircle the grounds to the galleries displaying timeless masterpieces, one feels as if they've stepped into another world once they've ascended the hill. Parking is typically the only fee you'll pay most days, and the rail ride up and back gives you a great view of the LA basin. The courtyards are both modern in design and classical in feel. As you walk the white stone and marble courtyards you'll feel a bit of heaven might have landed here. Whether viewing interior or exterior exhibits, everything flows naturally into each other. Occasionally live music and events can be discovered or attended, but you really don't need a special reason to visit. It always feels fresh and we always find new areas and exhibits to enjoy. If you need a location to bring your out of town guests or just want a day away for yourself, The Hefty is an excellent option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816gleng
50,Classy and Chill,"This is a must see when you are in the LA area. We were actually only passing by, but had to stop here... the traffic in the area is very congested. Parking is $15 and we came early so there was no problem. The lot seems very big. The experience on a whole is so unique, riding a tram up and then spending the whole day in a centre steeped in arts and culture. We used the free audio guides, which allowed me more information on certain pieces, which I loved. I had a picnic lunch on the gorgeous patio overlooking the city, while my companion decided to have a lunch at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okhazel
50,A Lovely Experience to Feel the Real Los Angeles,"I love this place and it is one of the nicest museums I have ever visited. Its free admission and you pay $15 to park which also gets you parking at the Getty Villa In Malibu if you want to head their later that day.You take a nice tram ride up the mountain and everything is well planned and clean. The museum is huge and has great healthy restaurant options and nice art, expect to spend 3-4 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Wonderful complex,This is a really excellent place to visit while in Los Angeles. The buildings are spectacular and the art is incredible. There are also beautiful gardens; we enjoyed the garden tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janemT6535TL
50,Absolutely Spectacular,"One of the world's greatest museums. To really see and enjoy it all, I recommend going two days. Parking is $15 but the museum is free.The number of priceless art pieces is astounding and rotates frequently with other Museum pieces from throughout the world.The grounds and the buildings themselves are one of a kind.The Center's Cafe and restaurant are excellent and pricing is reasonable.Really good for kids with hundreds of well behaved students when we were there.I could go on but go to their internet site and watch The Getty 360 and other videos.Only negative is getting there as I405 seems to be grid locked 24/7, so plan for that or stay close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LodiWineBob
50,Huge amount of great art,"My wife and I just spent several hours enjoying the Getty and possibly saw half of it. It is large and lovely! Paintings, sculptures, period furniture as well as beautiful gardens. The free ipod audio commentary was very useful. Be sure to check out the family audio tracks as well as the regular ones as the info is different and interesting. We will have to explore more another day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyleandrene
50,Plan to spend the day!,"Admission to the museum is free, there is however a 15$ parking fee. EV parking is available. A tram takes you from the parking garage up to the museum that sits high on a hill. The views of LA are beautiful. There are also several cafes, kiosks and a restaurant at the Getty Center. The outdoor spaces are lovely as well as the Central Garden. There is sculptures throughout the outdoor spaces. There are several buildings (east, north, south and west)connected by interior walkways, outdoor walkways and steps. These house Medieval art, Renaissance art, art from the 1700’s thru 1800’s as well as the current but changing exhibit about Egypt. We enjoyed looking at the Manets, Gauguin, Rembrandt’s etc. There are tours given by volunteers throughout the day so pick up a schedule as you enter and spend a minute to see the introductory film on the Getty. It is looped so it runs frequently. We enjoyed our visit thoroughly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carylgb2020
50,Fantastic museum!,"The Getty Center is a very accessible place for those with disabilities with lots to see. There are traveling tours along with some of Mr. Getty's own collection. When we were there, there were some impressionists from the likes of Degas, van Gogh, and Monet. There is also a beautiful garden outside to relax in between museum excursions. There was also a great Egypt exhibit at the center while we were there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24shawnd
10,Gerry Center Santa Monica,"Not trying to be mean here with 1 star. The problem is that this is the #1 activity to do in Santa Monica and that's just not true and relative. It is a gorgeous facility with very expensive art, but if you are not into art and are just planning your day based on the best thing to do in the area, you may agree with me. Yes it is free to gettin but they charge for parking or you need to take an Uber or Lyft, so it's not really free to you as you can't walk to it. Then plan on being the only one under 60 as long as there isn't a school field trip going on.There is so much better for a young and able bodied traveller so had to knock that down a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonchuckersmom
50,Beautiful Museum,"Beautiful Museum! Lot of history and art pieces. Very scenic campus to walk around, have a bite to eat and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake
50,Favourite place in LA!!,"I spent a day by myself at the Getty Center and couldn't recommend it enough! I wasn't expecting to have such a wonderful, calm day walking around - I went on a few of the walking tours and would really recommend them in order to get a real understanding of the building, gardens and the exhibitions. Lots of good options for food and drink and spots to refill your water bottle. I couldn't believe it was free and has free wifi. It was also easy to get to on public transport (I took a bus all the way there from Santa Monica).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sneth123
50,Magical Getty gardens,"This place is truly a ""gift"" to the people of Los Angeles and it's the gift that keeps on giving. I have to admit, I have been well over a dozen of times and have only twice actually walked through the interior galleries. What is so magical to me is the gardens and exterior spaces. Each vista, each perspective, each different garden area is so well designed and so stunningly gorgeous. Even the light seems different here, as it reflects off all that italian imported stone. There are lush garden areas, there are alien-seeming moonscapes, there are water areas - I can't even list them all. By the time I have wandered through all the exterior spaces of evolving, natural ""art"", I have used up my entire afternoon and it's time to leave - but with no regrets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanShea
50,Beautiful,"A must see , lovely museum. I enjoyed a lovely lunch in the restaurant overlooking the city. Great view and a delicious salad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathymackey
40,Arts and Interests,"The Getty center has some delicious food options. There is also a ton of really great artwork. Sometimes you can get lost in all the different rooms and I would assume I probably missed a lot of stuff because I wasnt sure where I was. The battery on my ipod audio tour also died within 2 hours, so that fun was over quick. Best part is the price - FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,A lot to see,Came all the way from Missouri to view the museums and center.. loved the garden area! Many buildings with all different type of art! Beautiful place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsBCostello
50,Absolute must!,"This is one of the very few museums which is not overwhelming, and I saw quite a few of them. There are four pavilions of arts (sculpture, photo, paintings etc.), great collection of garden sculptures, wide variety of activities for kids while you enjoy arts (kids can actually learn how to be an artist), and when you are tired and cannot absorb any more of culture, there are beautiful green fields of grass, where you can simply sit or lie and have a nap. Relax and enjoy. Plus you have those beautiful views of Santa Monica and Westwood below. If you are lucky and have some access to those who work for Getty Center, visit the conservation team, what they with the pieces of arts is absolutely amazing!It is easy to get to the Getty Center - you can either go by car, park in the parking lot for $15 and then take a tram to the top of the peak the Center is located, or a bus can bring you straight to the tram from Westwood. There is no entrance fee (except for the parking lot).If you are hungry, go for nice choice of snacks served outside or in a little cafeteria, if you are more on a fancy side, visit their really great restaurant - they have a nice selection of good food and wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
50,Love The Getty,"If you love the arts, you definitely have to come to The Getty. I've been here a couple of times and just love it. Great selection, nice interiors/exterior. When you're tired, you can sit, relax, they have restaurant/cafe. Wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustlivinglife
50,It is always a pleasure,"This museum works so well. From the creativity of the curators to put together wonderful exhibitions, to the helpfulness of all the staff and the quality of the information found on the recorded information that you can use when you rent the headphones. Everything is so PERFECT!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savvypatricia
50,Layover,"We took the tram (free) from uber drop off point to the museum. A spectacular view of LA greeted us at the end of the ride. The architecture and layout of the various buildings were stunning as were the various exhibits and works of art. iPods were offered free of charge and this proved to be very helpful in describing the wonderful things on display.As we had luggage with us, we were thrilled to discover a coat check area just off the front entrance where we deposited all our bags. A phone charger station was also right there where you could safely leave your phone to be charged.We were so glad that we visited this museum and not some glitzy Hollywood tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merlew917
50,Worth Your Time,"This is certainly one of the better cultural experiences in the LA area. Although it takes a bit of time to park (onsite pay parking), then take the tram (sometimes there is a lengthy line as bags are searched), it is definitely worth the exertion. You will need at least half a day to do this place justice. The view, architecture and gardens are by themselves amazing on their own, before even getting into the remarkable exhibits. The rotating exhibits were in my opinion far superior to the permanent ones, but that is just my taste in artwork... so check their website and go at a time when their rotating exhibit piques your interest. Far superior to the MOCA or other LA museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barzinji
50,Spend a full day here and you still have more to see,Getty Center is a fantastik place with amazing art. But to me the best part is the architecture with all the limestone and the garden. A place to return to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2rolfh
40,Interesting place,"We went to the Getty Centre on a recent trip to LA; the building itself is very impressive with cool architecture. There are also a lot of view points where you can get a nice view of the city. There is a nice cafe area, but the food on site is pretty limited and very overpriced. Also, bear in mind that though the museum itself is free, if you drive you'll be forced to park in an expensive multi-storey carpark! You should also factor into your trip that you may have to queue for 1-2hours to get in on busy days (as we did last weekend!)Overall, though I personally don't go out of my way to visit arts museums, I think the architecture here and the views themselves are worth a look if you have a free half-day when in LA. If you're only visiting to get good city views then I would say Griffiths Observatory and Oue Skyspace are far better for that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aamnas-Travels
50,Great museum,Be prepared to walk and spend the day if you want to see everything. Except for the $15 parking fee which includes a tram ride to the center the museum was free. We were able to visit the Egypt exhibit which was outstanding. The museum consist of several buildings each having several floors of exhibits plus the gardens and the views of the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4823WMjohnw
50,Fantastic collection and great views,Could easily spend a day here going around the art collection and gardens. Great views over LA out as far as the ocean. Quite busy so get here early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewKen
50,Sunny Saturday,"We have lived in the LA area for decades. Being ""not the museim kind"" vizited it for the first time recently.Parking is convenient. Tram then takes to the center. Tram ride itself is breath taking with views of the neighboring hills and greenery right in the middle of megalopolis.The museum is well sectioned. The building is architecturally soothing.For a break there is a food/coffee stall in the courtyard.Well manicured garden and greenery. Beautiful photography.Looking forward to another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbstentmd
50,Fantastic and Free,"If you prefer art over glitz this is one of the best ways to spend a day in Los Angeles. The building and collection are both well worth a visit in their own right. Moreover it is entirely free, apart from the bus trip or drive out there. This was our highlight of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKA255100
50,Free Museum- Pay for Parking,A beautiful new Museum with gorgeous Gardens. Sometimes they have special exhibits-check the website. A wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markclewis
50,"Want something nice to see, come here","Big wow for what they created here, and all this for free, pure education. I was surprised, positively, especially as it's huge. Incredible, how many sections and exhibitions they have over here. The gardens were nicely put in shape and more, the Egypt section was very interesting. Sculptures, stones, decorations, impressive of what they present here. Bring some small snacks as you can get hungry over here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luchsabka
50,Worth it!!,"Just to be able to see part of getty’s collection is simply impressive!And then... that beautiful building, although constructed like 20 years ago.... on a mountain top, surrounded by gorgeous gardens and fountains... with a superb LA scenery!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimiMexico_df
50,Hard to believe it's free!,"While I wouldn't say the Getty should be the #1 sight in LA, it certainly deserves its 5* rating. Even if, like me, you don't care for art, the Getty is well worth a visit. The best part of the Getty is the garden, which is unbelievably pretty, but the architecture of the building and the grounds overall is what really stands out. It's a beautiful building, that's for sure, and offers variety of things to take photos of. I love the cactus garden at the back of the building with the city as a backdrop!A lot of people rave about the views from the Getty, and while the views are great, there are better views from either Runyon Canyon, or even more so, Griffith Park. As such, I wouldn't recommend the Getty if views is what you're after, but for the stunning garden and architecture it is definitely worth a visit.The only issue I had is that without a car it can be a bit of a pain to get to/from. I took two buses each way from Hollywood to get there, which take about an hour each time, but really it is worth it, especially when this is a free activity. If you're not an art fan like me, expect to spend around 2 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewK508
50,Private tour of the Egyptian/Greek exhibit,"The Getty Center is huge so make sure you allow at least a couple of hours. After parking your vehicle, you take a tram onto the property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmy6_12
50,First thing you should do when you go to LA,"The Getty Center is a beautiful place I will definitely visit again when I'm back in California.I've entered the Center with an Uber, so it was a very easy system for Ubers/Lyfts/Taxis to get into the Getty. Easy drop off and pick up! (Don't have to wait too long to get an Uber when leaving)It is free to go to the Getty! When you first enter you wait in line to go onto the Getty Tram that takes you to the Center that is on top of the hills. It is a very spacious museum so you never feel like you are too close to other visitors.I recommend visiting the exhibition: A Queen's Treasure from Versailles: Marie-Antoinette's Japanese Lacquer. (Running from January 23, 2018–January 6, 2019) This was very memorable because they did such an amazing job staging the whole exhibition. You really feel like you have been transported to the times' Marie-Antoinette was in power and go through this beautiful journey, seeing her private Japanese lacquer collection.If you aren't a huge fan of Art I still would recommend going because of the beautiful architecture, views overlooking LA and the garden that is there. It's a great place to take photos!I would recommend taking the whole day if you want to take your time to go through the whole museum or half a day if you want to go at a faster pace (and aren't as interested in the Art as some people) to visit the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannev92
50,"Fantastic Museum, Gardens, Views for FREE!","This is probably the best museum I've ever been to. It is so large it is virtually impossible to see it all in a single trip but that's not a problem because there is no fee to enter other than parking which came to about $15 for about 4.5 hours. A tram carries visitors up/down the hill to/from the Getty Center from the parking garage in about 5 minutes. The museum features all kinds of art, furniture, china, sculpture, silver, pottery, tapestry and much more. There are plenty of restrooms, cafes and even an outstanding restaurant on the grounds. Be sure to bring your comfortable shoes as there is quite a bit of walking involved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawU2175DY
40,Calm and relaxed,The venue was beautiful and the gardens were very nice. I did think the collection of art was limited. But maybe I have been spoilt in Europe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLocalSquire
50,"Stunning architecture, art and gardens","Loved this place. The architecture and gardens themselves worth a visit, and that’s before viewing any of the art inside. A lovely quiet spot in a busy city. And what a gift with free admission, really enjoyed The Getty Center and could Easily have spent longer than the 2 hours I was able to have there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionafromaustralia
50,Getty center,"A must see in life it's just one of those things every person must do in there life . Everything from the great masters to furniture . Plus they let you get up close . The gardens outside are amazing this is truly an amazing place . Plus it will bring an inner peace to u . For me it was the thought that the human race I sent so bad after all .I'am extremely thankful to the Getty family for creating such a place its peaceful quiet and a wonderful experience . Plan on spending a full day there .One more plus it's free , I think there is a parking charge but not sure .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatorm
50,BREATHTAKING,"Spectacular place for its location, for its architecture, for its views, for its artworks, for EVERYTHING. Special mention to the area dedicated to Impressionism, including works by Monet, Renoir, Degas or Cezanne. My favorite, La Rue Mosnier aux drapeaux by Edouard Manet... too much meaning in it. Many thanks to The Getty Foundation for their incredible work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luruizla
50,Wonderful architecture,"Even if you’re not a big fan of art, then you must experience this place if not purely for the outstanding architecture and gardens. It’s free to enter but you have to pay for parking.They have a vast collection of art including Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Degas...to name a few.We easily spent 3 hours looking in and at all the buildings. And there are spectacular views of LA from this location. Really worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didge432
40,Highly recommended,"Beautiful place with a lot of beautiful art. Some of the paintings, statues and exhibitions alone are worth the visit, but the location on a hill top overlooking LA and the great architecture and garden make the visit residually worthwhile. It's not easy to get there by public transport but there's a convenient drop off/pick up place for Ubers, that works well. Also, I recommend walking up the hill (10-15 mins) instead of taking (and queuing for) the electric tram from the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158wietsev
50,Serenity and Beauty,"I live in LA, but make sure that at least a couple of times per year I make a visit to the Getty Museum. On a clear day you have a wonderful view of the ocean and the city, the gardens are impressive und the exhibitions interesting and varied. I love to sit in the courtyard and enjoy the beautiful white stone buildings and sip hot chocolate from the concession stand in the center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isaus2018
40,Nice place to visit and the view up there is outstanding.,The facility is very nice and the views of LA are great. I think the museum has some interesting pieces but overall it's not a great museum compared to other world-class museums in Europe of New York.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/costaricagregg
50,Always something new to see and fabulous views of LA,We have visited twice now all the way from MO while staying in LA on our way to HI. We just love this museum and its hard to believe there is no charge. The art collections are numerous and you can just sit down and take it all in. They have great food and various locations to eat at for lunch. The views are spectacular and even the tram ride from the parking garage is fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonn331

50,Outstanding and affordable.,"I definitely recommend. The place is gorgeous, the art collection is out of this world. We planned to spend a few hours but stayed the entire afternoon and had to leave because we already had plans. We went with 3 children ages 10, 9, and 5.They appreciated all the art, the gardens, and the architecture.I was finally able to explain to my 10 year old the different painting styles.Must visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RapiroSan
50,World class collection and site,"Not to be missed, go early and get the touring/audio device and see as many things as you can. Stunning views, fantastic art that is presented with some context, interesting entrance to museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reidt858
50,"Wonderful art gallery, plan for several hours","My only regret in going to the Getty was that I didn't stay longer! We thought we could see the Getty thoroughly in a couple of hours and boy were we mistaken! It's absolutely beautiful on the outside, and worth exploring the grounds and the many works of art set within them. We did not do the audio tour, nor a guided tour, we managed to see what we really wanted to without it by using the very helpful map they provide, though I think it would be worthwhile to take a tour. The views of the city that people speak of are excellent, but I wouldn't go there for those. The real views are inside. Taking the tram up is a bit of a pain in the butt, as its a long wait to get on. If you arrive before the heat of the day, and you're in good shape, you might want to walk up but be warned, its a steep climb. We walked down rather than waiting for the tram again when we left, and it was a pleasant walk but took about 15 minutes. If you want a relaxed visit, plan for about 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cate13
50,Wonderful Visit to Beautiful Museum,"Went to The Getty Center located on a hill above Los Angeles. The museum has so much to offer. Numerous exhibits, vast art collection, breathtaking views, and exquisite gardens. We chose to do audio tour which far surpassed my expectation. It was easy to use and very insightful. We also visited the cafe and had a great lunch with wine. The most surprising part of museum was the cost-a small parking fee. Time did not allow for one the many guided tours however we will return to take advantage of on our next visit. The staff were attentive, helpful and pleasant. Thank you Getty Center for a wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/menhb
30,For everyone that 5 stars this come to Cleveland,"You park and take a short tram ride to the entrance. Parking is $15. pay as you leave at the tented parking office. They offer free headphones and ipodish listening device. It is very hard to get you bearings, N, S, E, and West buildings, plus on loan exhibits building. 3 floors. As you are walking and listening to your device, the sounds of school children 3rd to 12th permeate you ears. They all seem to be going on a high speed guided walk thru, with an osaccional pointing and laughing at body parts. I can't see that grade school kids could gain a thing. We visited Friday at 10am, left at 12:30. Tried taking pictures of a city I guess LA, but smog kept from getting a view. This is rated 1 of 600 places to see in LA, we stopped after 1, and went to hotel to wait for Saturday flight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMandSM

Uber cool. If you have kids, they will love it more than youOnce you enter Tony Starks ex playpad, the myriad of art exhibitions and collections is stupendously amazing.I dont need to, nor can i, spoil the experience.

40,Gorgeous Building and Art!,"The whole facility is beautiful, calm, and restful. I only had time to see a portion of the art, but it was well displayed, and I love the natural lighting in so many areas. I will definitely be going back when I have more time. The museum is free to everyone (which is great!), but the ADA accessibility is lacking. Although there are elevators, none of the doors had automatic openers, and most doorways were a set of two doors to go through. Would have been difficult without the help of other visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2016QZlisaf

We visited the Getty Villa last week-end, so this complete the whole Getty experience. To ensure a great day, plan enough time to visit the galleries, a nice lunch/snack (make sure you get some wine and enjoy the views), then finish with a walk around the gardens. We spent 6 hours but could be done quicker if you do not read everything. Not to be missed if you are visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294dannyv

It's convenient that Saturdays are open later. Definitely a must for art and architecture lovers as there's a multitude and variety of pieces, exhibits, and much to revel in every corner and detail of this brilliantly designed place. The Getty Center's various landings, windows and balconies allow you to see vast views Los Angeles and its magnificence. The garden and courtyard are also a great place just to sit, enjoy the weather and views. Worth the revisit the next time I'm in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluehalo11

50,A must see in LA,"WOW make sure you give yourself easily a whole day to experience this place. The gardens are stunning not to mention the best views in LA of LA. We only took 2 1/2 of the FREE art tours-Renaissance & Baroque, Collections. Gail & Rose were so interesting to listen to and the stories they told made a lasting impression. World class is an understatement of the art work. They are experiencing their 20 year anniversary and you can sense the excitement of everyone who works and volunteers there. Lots of opportunities to shop and eat too. If possible take advantage of the FREE tours or at the least get an audio guide. Can't wait to go back there is soooo much there to see. The museum is FREE. You pay $15 for parking[a real bargain considering]. You can walk up the hill and enjoy the peace or you can take the FREE tram up the hill. Very well coordinated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyLou2013
50,The museum itself is as spectacular as the art work it holds,The Getty took 13 years to build and cost a billion dollars. It consists of five buildings made of marble and limestone. The architect Meier achieved a light and airy feeling throughout with many windows and open spaces. A tram takes you to the top of the hill where this group of museums is located and there you will find the best views of Los Angeles. And may I mention that admission is free. A beautiful garden space and water spaces add to the tranquil creative endeavor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811victoria
50,Put an Entire Day Aside for the Getty Center,"When planning a trip to the Getty Center, don't overlook the fact that, on a nice day, you'll want to spend extra time wandering the masterfully landscaped grounds and admiring not only the Getty's impressive structure but also the scenic views of Los Angeles. And then there's the artwork inside! Free admission compensates for the $15 parking fee, although that, too, can be avoided by taking the bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul_Har
50,"Just beautiful... art, gardens, views","Plan to spend 3 or so hours (or more!) exploring the beautiful art and gardens. We took the gardens tour and recommend it highly! (included in admission) I wish we could have taken the architecture tour as well, but couldn't due to time constraints (it was closed until 2p due to a private event). Fortunately, our tour guide was incredibly informative and included aspects from the architecture tour in our garden tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ITravl4Fun
50,Beautiful grounds and artwork,"Just a relaxing place to visit. It's free (you do pay for parking which is $15), and the ride up to the grounds is via a tram. The site is perfect for a half-day visit, and you can take in the art work, the gardens, and the LA cityscape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etravelhome
40,Nice Art and Archtiecture center,"We went there during Spring break , my wife wanted to see it and i was pleasantly surprised , i have passed that place many time but never gone up.Its a beautiful setup with a wonderful contemporary architecture.I saw the few sculptures and Rembrandt inspiration of India section. its a must see( I think its on till June 18)we didn't have much time but will visit again next time to see other sections.you will need almost a day to visit it, paid parking is available and their is nice train which will take you up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641vineets
50,"AMAZING facility, artwork, and OMG the views.","The Getty Center is a marvel in so many ways. The setting, perched high on a hill in the Sepulveda Pass above the 405 Freeway, is surreal. The views alone are worth the time and the $15 parking. The architecture is astounding, simultaneously futuristic and natural. But the star(s) are the art collections. Works by Van Gough, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Rembrandt, and even a few Michelangelo drawings adorn the walls. We allotted 3 hours, which was woefully inadequate. So we will absolutely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillO311
50,Great way to spend a day - be there at sunset,"I had put off going to the Getty Centre for a number of years, not sure why. Now I wish I had gone a couple of times with I lived in CA. There is an amazing array of art to be seen and the views from the patios at sunset almost steal the show. Was great to see Monet's Haystacks. Allow at least a few hours, if not a whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianH40
50,Truly amazing place and well laid out. A must visit,"This is place is a must see location. Fantastic use of audio & escorted tours. All free!!! Wonderful selection of paintings, and art pieces and presently there is a section on Egypt. The guided tour is well worth the time. Learned a lot through the tour and audio tour, and guided tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceC944
50,Nice day out,"Spent pleasant few hours there, joined 2 free tours, the lady tour guide of the garden tour was very knowledgeable, we also browsed art collections, walked around the cute garden, it’s free entrance apart from parking which is $15. Will definitely recommend especially with children, my 5 year old enjoyed listening to the introduction of collections on the iPod provided by the museum which is free as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eylondon1

40,More To See Than I Had Time To Look At,"I met family there as one wanted to spend a birthday there. The 1st thing that struck me was how personable and helpful the staff is...from the parking lot attendants to the docents to the staff in the restaurant. The parking was $15 and the museum was free. The directions for parking were clear and there was a lot of parking. I ended up on the 6th level underground, but there was plenty more. Getting all the people from the parking area was well organized and surprisingly fast moving line to get to the tram to the museum. The grounds were beautiful and the facility was well maintained. Yes, even the bathrooms were clean. I was short on time, and I actually saw very little but the things I mentioned convinced me to go back when I have some time. Family members that stayed longer than I did said everything was wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982BarbaraS
50,Superb - hope to return,Everything is so well organized here.We much enjoyed a scheduled Architectural tour and then wandering over to see the cactus garden afterwards.The rose garden was well presented though less extensive in area or varieties than expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
50,getty center,"Really good museum with beautiful gardens, a must visit if you go to Los Angeles. So much history and knowledge, good design layout and free to enter. Parking was 15$ in peak and 10$ after 3pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1242DLnicolas
50,Wonderful!,The Getty Center has everything for the art lover regardless of what type you enjoy. Our day there was full travelling from gallery to gallery and the view overlooking the entire LA area is absolutely spectacular! So worth spending a day there. Will certainly go back should I ever get the opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halsey501
50,just breathtaking,"The Getty have an embarrassment of riches on offer. Lovely to see a Van Gogh, a Cezanne, a Degas and not have to pay a penny for the privilege - 10 years I have been coming to LA - and I have had never been. WHAT ON EARTH WAS I THINKING ?????another great suggestion from sister",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q646URmattb
50,World Class Museum,"We have been to nearly all the great museums of the world, and this is their peer. It really has it all. The setting is spectacular, set atop a verdant hill, with a 360 degree view of the L.A. Valley; you can see the Pacific, Catalina Island, Port Reyes, downtown LA; it really gives you perspective. The grounds are stunning, with reflecting pools about, fabulously manicured gardens, outdoor picnic areas with stunning views. The building themselves, designed by Richard Meier, elegant structures sunlit marble, both polished and raw, glass, and steel. Throughout, you come out of a dimly lit gallery into blazing light, with stunning views to the surrounding hills. It is a place in which wherever you look, you only see beauty. The collection itself is massif, and of the very highest quality. We visited on two days, saw about 15 galleries, and they all left us breathless. There is a wonderful, first class dining room, called The Restaurant, with floor to ceiling windows with panoramic views, and not a bad table in the house (make reservations). The menu is sophisticated, and excellently executed. All American winelist. Great service. Entrance to the museum is free, but parking is $15. Take your parking ticket with you as you go to the tram, which will take you to the museum entrance, as you can only pay the parking fee at elevator to the tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nefelokokigia
50,Amazing collection,"I wish I had more time, a lot of art from different eras presented in an interesting way. Clean safe and in a good, easy to get to area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevewesterby
50,Worth the Visit. Beautiful Grounds. Great Collection.,Billionaire J Paul Getty's massive wealth and art collection are on display at The Getty Center. Getty makes the arts accessible and this museum is free to all visitors. We took a complimentary guided tour of the museum collection highlights which included a Van Goh. The museum is designed as an indoor / outdoor experience with beautiful gardens and the BEST VIEW of LA. Arrive early for the best experience. I would visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike1indy
50,Wonderful place to spend the day,"Beautiful setting, fabulous views, terrific architecture, great art and gorgeous garden - and it’s free. A fab place friends, families and solos. The volunteers efficient and helpful. Looking forward to the next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/143janetr
50,fantastic place,Been here twice and planning to visit as much as I possibly can. The museum's constant changing exhibits are just wonderful and educational. We love to take our time looking at various displays knowing we can always come back another day. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because you will cover a lot of hard surface not counting stairs. You can bring snacks and water but they have restaurants to choose from. On a clear day you can see downtown LA and the ocean. Very observant staff but friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50
50,One of the Best Attractions in LA,"The Getty Center is amazing. Other than the $15 parking fee, admission is free. The buildings and grounds would be reason enough to visit this place, but the art and sculpture really make it a place to enjoy. After riding the free tram from the parking garage to the Center, you’re treated to 360 degree views of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and the Hollywood Hills. The sprawling gardens are full of color when the flowers bloom, and the architecture of the buildings themselves is awesome. While the scope of the art in the Getty’s collection is somewhat focused (mostly pre-1900 European), many pieces are still worth checking out. There are also several food options at the Center, as well as a few gift shops and a research institute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gooseboy54481
50,A nice museum to visit.,"A decent collection of art; you can't compare with the European museums, but nonetheless and nice place to visit and spend the day. You'll need to go for dinner somewhere else though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeznikk
50,Awesome Museum,"Love the Getty. Not just a great museum, but a beautiful place to walk around and enjoy the LA views. Defnitely wroth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NBere
50,Gorgeous,Fantastic museum with a wide array of art! Plus gorgeous architecture and spectacular views of the city and ocean from the top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffrogee
50,A must if in LA!,"This is probably one of the best art centers that I have been to so far. Stunning architecture, great location, enough space - and a great collection. Even on a Saturday, it did not feel crowded in spite of a lot of people. There is enough space for wandering around, the cafe areas are large enough (and have decent food!), and the collection is great: something for every taste. I particularly enjoyed some of the 19th century paintings, but of course there is everything else too. No matter what your plans in L.A. are, it is worth spending half a day at the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinrummel
50,First rate museum,"In addition to an excellent collection of artworks , the museum is also an architectural wonder. The garden and the panoramic view are breath taking. Check the calendar for free admission days and education related events for kids. Best to book tickets in advance. One can easily spend an entire day roaming the facility and enjoy every moment of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dod2015
50,The Gettin' gets good at The Getty!,"The Getty Center, located on a wonderful mountain in Los Angeles is one of the world's most beautiful places to see great art. The getting there (drive) is straight on Sepluveda Boulevard to Getty Center Drive. The museum is on the top of the hill which can be accessed by tram or by small buses that run up the hill. The works in the collection are top notch and the exhibitions are always curated in a way to engage you, the Viewer. The light is fantastic and the displays are spacious and very well designed. The Getty takes pride in showcasing the best of the best and they do a great job of that. The collections are varied, so you can see gems and photographs, books and maps, furniture and sculpture along with paintings and drawings. All of the highest caliber. The building itself is an architectural jewel of Italian Travertine where you can amuse yourself finding prehistoric fossils embedded in the stone. The Center offers a few very nice places to eat, such as a ""white linen"" restaurant, a cafeteria style dining room and a few small kiosks for coffee and a nibble. This is an ALL DAY place to visit. If you are not up to looking at art, you can look at the wonderfully planned and maintained gardens from various levels of terraces. You are also treated to the most spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean from this eagle's nest vantage point. A great place to see our spectacular California sunsets. Some of the water works have been shut due to the water crisis, but that does not diminish the calm atmosphere that the grounds offer. Parking is AMPLE and the cost for all of this is the single cost of parking which is $15.00. You can stay there until you are ushered out! There is a great gift shop that offers many nicely appointed items, books and catalogs of both past and present exhibitions. Do not miss The Getty Research Center, which houses small specially curated shows drawn from the collections. If you are coming to Los Angeles you would not have seen what this City has to offer if you don't spend at least a few hours at The Getty Center! All ages, welcomed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kejaro526
50,So much to see,"This museum is huge, and it’s especially amazing when you remember that visiting it is free (other than the $15 for parking). We arrived late in the afternoon, so we only had time to see the highlights. We made a beeline for the west pavilion, room W204 to see Van Gogh’s Irises, and then wandered the second floor to see the other European paintings (Monet, Renoir…). We also walked down through the gardens, which are beautifully designed with colorful foliage, succulents, and water running down throughout. We unfortunately didn’t have time to visit the three other pavilions, but definitely want to return.There are also great views of Los Angeles throughout the complex- try to go on a clear day. The architecture of the buildings is stunning. Note that security will check your bags before you can enter. Also, there’s a tram from the parking lot to the museum, or you can walk there, ¾ of a mile uphill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerfromsj
50,The gardens and building are amazing,This entire place is amazing. The actual grounds and gardens are truly unique. All day long it is like an evolving art piece. The shadows cast and lighting the plants and flowers get were designed to specifically change throughout the day.Of course the collection here is wonderful and you could easy spend an entire day soaking it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1608MCsarahv
50,An amazing act of philanthropy!,"There is a reason the Getty Center is #1 in TripAdvisor for the LA area. It is a must-see world-class museum featuring world-renowned artists' works from many eras. JP Getty's vision was to build a fantastic complex like no other in the world, featuring art work that is viewed free of charge forever. What an act of generosity! For people who are already well-versed in art work, surely the Getty center is a treasure. For those who not-so-well versed in world art, we recommend that people do an online preview of the Getty Center so you know what to expect. Preview the Center's layout so you know where to go when you arrive at the Center. Also, preview the artists and their artwork. We were newbies to LA and the Center and were awestruck by the immensity of the museum and its displays. After about three hours of taking in the Center, we were overwhelmed by what we experienced. It would have helped us out if we had followed our advice to future visitors and previewed the Center before we arrived! In the future we will be more strategic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allicron19
40,Getty a great place to visit,Spent a really nice morning at the Getty center on the hill. This place is more than just the collection; it's an experience unto itself. Worth doing. You will discover what you like about it when you are there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benofgoodtaste
50,For the Love of Art,Mr. Getty has given a tremendous gift with his donation of the Getty Center to the Greater Los Angeles Area. There are many art form variations on display. You can spend a day or just a few hours. Admission is FREE! For just the cost of parking ($15) you can visit and be surrounded by creativity and beautiful art forms. The mornings are especially busy. It was very crowded the day we visited with lots of school children on a field trip. I was told by a docent that school children often visit by the bus loads so if you can go after 1:00 pm its typically a lot less noisy and crowded when the kids head back to school. There are guided tours that are very interesting. We only had time for the architecture tour of the facility which was informative but not great. Next time I visit I’ll take an actual art tour. Definitely worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brendavig
50,Wonderful and iconic,A world class museum complex. So much to see in a beautiful setting. A can't miss for visitors to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyrnyc
40,"Beautiful building, setting and grounds","This was a worthwhile stop on a visit to Southern Cal--incredible building, sculpture garden and setting. On a warm, sunny day, it would be especially great but even when the temperatures were cooler, we still got a feel for the location. It is logistically clunky...we waited a very long time in security and I was surprised that even on a super-busy, spring break day, there was only one security line with one very over-worked security guard checking bags. Hopefully that's not the norm!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mketraveler2018
50,Amazing architecture and exhibitions,"You only pay for parking. There is a free tram ride up the hill from the parking to the center. The view is beautiful, the kids loved the 5 minute ride.

We only went into a few exhibitions, the temporary Egyptian was very nice, the kids loved the mummy and the big hippo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viganiko

50,The Getty,"STUNNING VIEWS, WONDERFUL TOUR. We had an absolutely spectacular afternoon at the Getty Center. It was a sparkling sunny day and we drove up the coast. We enjoyed the very beautiful landscape design and amazing top view of the city. The entrance was free though you need to pay for $15 parking.You pay when you park, and then you take a tram up the hillside to the Center. Before you get on the tram, they give you a list of free guided tours for the day. The tram ride is fun for kids and it provides grown-ups with a chance to take in the views and appreciate the grandeur of the location.The museum cafe is perched on the terrace and has really nice snack options. We enjoyed Sat in a breezy sunny spot outside overlooking the gardens. Must go if you visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/photoWestDE

40,Great collection,"Got to the Getty Center just before its opening at 10am. Still plenty of car park. So here is a tip. Go there early. 10am is a reasonable time to be out.Parked the car at down hill. Free tram took us to the Center. Just a few minutes past 10am, all staff were ready to welcome visitors.I have to admit that I don’t know much about art. But I was still quite surprised about the collection.Building itself is amazing. Outdoor garden was even better.When we arrived back down to the car park by tram, people were waiting and lining up for the tram up.So yeh, got in early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason526
50,Amazing museum in the hills,"An amazingly beautiful architecture structure in the hills by bel air, the art and specially the painting collection is magnificent.

50,When everybody agrees,"After living in LA for so many years, I am wondering, is this ""the best"" thing to do in LA? No, definitely not. There are so many other things more exciting to do. But it so happens when everybody agrees that Getty Center is a flawless piece of architecture, a rich museum, a masterpiece in landscaping, a heavenly blessed place where you can relax, enrich your knowledge, admire fabulous pieces of art and ultimately for the locals, recharge your batteries for another hectic week of work. Thank you, Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12
50,Love this place. Unsurpassed Art Museum in LA,"The is a free museum for most exhibits, but you do need a reservation for parking as that is limited.

50,Such a great place,"We have been here a couple of times and I have never written a review...time to correct that!The changing exhibit at the moment is about Egypt and the influence of other cultures...super interesting for all of us and especially my teenage daughters. The information happened to match up well with what they knew from school, and added depth. They were my tour guide!The place is, of course amazing to see (check out the pictures on other posts) and it is a great place to just hang out and take in the view and people watching if you are not into too much museum time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5Americans

50,Beautiful architecture,"One of my favorite places to visit. They offer great artworks, but mainly a beautiful outdoor experience. The grounds and architecture is what I mostly enjoy and yes, they have some world class exhibits that pass through. Parking is free and I love the picnic lunch option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diafedgia
50,Great views of LA basin from the heart of a Classic Art collection,"The Getty Center is easily accessible for a half day outing or you can spend a whole day enjoying all the exhibits, from ancient Greek, to modern photography. The only thing you pay for is parking (around $15). Once a month, it's open late in the evening, so you can stop by after work and avoid the rush hour traffic on the 405. Enjoy the tram ride to and from the parking structure with its views overlooking the freeways, Bel Air and the Santa Monica mountains. On clear days, you can see the Pacific!The cafe has good food in a brightly-lit eating area with views of LA from all the windows. If you're there in the evening the sunsets are spectacular. The gardens and fountains areas are fun places to take selfies. (If you want to avoid the hordes of field tripping kids, note that they usually depart the exhibits around lunch time).Kids have their own touch and explore area of the museum, but it can get crowded. And if you plan ahead, check out the variety of interesting musical acts or lectures about special topics.I was pressed for time, but wanted to explore a particular area of the museum, so I chose to join a docent-led tour. It was a good way to get a concentrated amount of info in a short tour. We got to see the Michelangelo drawings--There aren't many of them, but it's impressive that the museum paid as much as they did for them.I highly recommend visiting the Getty. Even if you're not into art, or architecture (the whole place is built of travertine), it's a must-see LA destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpmwriter
50,Wonderful diversity of art!,"Brought my sons for a half day (12 and 14) and it was a beautiful place. The Egyptian artifacts were wonderful. We should have taken a break and eaten at the cafe half way through but instead powered on to see everything. It was well worth the drive, easy parking in the garage below, beautiful views and gardens, and a lovely day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnSB
50,Allow enough time to totally enjoy this!,"The paintings and artwork are spectacular. The free tour we took of Impressionists was excellent. However, what I most enjoyed was the reflections of the buildings in the surrounding pools. The architect was a master artist, himself.We ran out of energy before we ran out of wonderful things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bevhr
50,Art Escape,"Fabulous escape - art, architecture, views, gardens and people Watching! Love it. So enjoy the special exhibits but also the permanent collections.

Not to be missed if you are visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne7Losangeles
50,Be Inspired and Awed,"If you are visiting LA, this is worth your time to visit. The museum is free but you pay a small fee to park. The tram takes you from the parking area up to the museum area. There are gardens and many different exhibits to visit. Lovely views as well. Places to sit and places to eat. Just a lovely way to spend a few hours or an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryhP167ZV
50,"Great museum, great space, great view","It's a tad tempting to rate the Getty one level down because it's a little hard to get to. But honestly, if you don't want to deal with the sometimes long lines of cars waiting to get in and then finding (paid) parking, you can park north of Ventura Boulevard and then take a bus. In which case, the cost of parking disappears, as well.Otherwise, the Getty is, first of all, one of the most serene spaces in Los Angeles. I go there as much to get away from the hustle and bustle and too frequent banality of most of the city as to see actual art. You can simply walk around and look at the astounding view, or nap a bit on the grass, or meditate in the unique garden (itself a work of art). While museum eateries are always pricey, you can get a decent lunch here for a reasonable price and kick back on the terrace while you eat it. And for music lovers there are often events.If you're an architecture buff, a friend once pointed out to me all the architectural ""quotes"" which make the buildings themselves a study in that art.Oh yeah, and they have art too. Typically there are several major shows at once and it's pretty likely you'll find something that really engages you. That's in addition to the varied permanent collection, which will keep you pretty busy if you've never been. Some shows are more spectacular than others (the recent one on South American gold was stunning), and there are slow periods at times, where I find myself waiting impatiently for the next really gripping show. But overall it's hard to go wrong just showing up, which I try to do every few months. Oh, and unlike the (original) Getty Villa, you don't have to reserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chezjim
40,Perfect combination: art and food.,"We have been regular visitors at the Getty Center since its opening.We always go for special exhibits and each time revisit some of the permanent collections which are of high quality.For some visitors the tram ride to reach the museum is an hassle, but my husband and I always enjoy the short ride with a beautiful view of Bel Air, Century City.The galleries are easily reachable, you can stroll from one to the other, stopping to look at the amazing views: on the East, overlooking LA all the way to downtown, on the West to the pacific Ocean, the Palos Verdes peninsula and Catalina Island.The beautiful gardens are a must, the tour very interesting. You can even bring a picnic.We love to go with friends, see one or 2 of the exhibits and finish our afternoon with a nice, quiet and delicious dinner at the restaurant at the Getty. Service is impeccable, atmosphere very relaxing and food excellent, plus if you have an early dinner you can eat watching a beautiful sunset on the surrounding mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arghis

40,Liked but didn't love it,"I think we were spoiled by other places in LA with better views and gardens (e.g. Griffith Observatory, Exposition Park rose garden) such that while still lovely it didn't rank at the top for outdoor spaces. That left us to focus on the art. My favorite piece was the Van Gogh irises. The Rembrandt in India exhibit was interesting in a quieter way. I also enjoyed the sculptures. The Getty is also very spacious with plenty of outdoor space to sit and you are almost never crowded even near famous pieces - the only major chokepoint was the tram entrance and we avoided that by walking up the hill which was pretty easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MN_on_the_road

40,Things for Kids at the Getty,"Arrived around 2pm. Parking is $15, but if you can come after 3pm, the fee drops to $10. As the museum is open late evening on Saturdays, it becomes a good deal. Short wait for the tram.We brought our 6 year old son, and he had two toddler friends with him. We did not visit most of the regular exhibits, but we took the children to the family section. There were a few interactive exhibits, which is good way to introduce the kids to the other art in the museum.One exhibit had the kids draw with markers on an erasable display of an ancient Latin book. Another room had foam noodles that the kids could move to create a 3D jungle gym out of a 2 dimensional photo.The kids also got brochures in the main lobby asking them to find things in the paintings and exhibits in the North Pavilion. After the ""scavenger hunt,"" we talked about what the artist was trying to create.The kids enjoyed the garden the most. Besides enjoying the view, there is grassy area where the kids can roam around.My son also enjoyed the tram ride to and from the parking lot.Two hours was the most the kids could handle. Hopefully it was a good experience, so we can go back and explore more of the museum someday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles

50,What a Brilliant Masterpiece of a Museum!,"Bravo to the brilliant architect Richard Maier, who designed and created this unbelievable and stellar museum. My boyfriend and I were only there for around 2.5 hours, which wasn’t nearly enough time. All of the buildings connect, which is beyond amazing! We saw an excellent exhibit on gold and also saw some impressionist art. The best part of our visit was spending time in the massive outdoor gardens with stunning views of the city of Los Angeles. The varied flowers, trees, plants, and cactus are a visual delight. Also have outstandingly stunning sculptures outside. Different levels to walk around. Can’t wait to return next time in LA! You pay for parking but no admission charge to the museum thanks to The Getty Foundation. Convenient and reliable trams/monorails which run often to take visitors from parking lots to the museum. The entrance to the museum is also stellar! Gorgeous statues abound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281valerie
50,What a beauty,"What a beautiful place. It doesn't matter if you like architecture or not, this is a must-see type of place. I wish I had more time to explore, but everything was amazing there especially if you are an architecture lover. There are also some fantastic views of the city of LA from the Getty.

50,Well worth visiting,We know nothing about art and knew little about Getty so we decided to find out. We weren’t disappointed. This is a magnificent centre from which to learn so much regardless of your interests. The architecture is breathtaking and worth going for even if you don’t go into the galleries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleStork
50,"Spectacular setting, great gardens and soR pretty good art too","Worth the trip. Special campus atop a hill with amazing views of the city, hills and ocean. The center is worth visiting as much for the architecture as for the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marc624

50,Stunning building,"I am into my architecture so came here more for the building and it didn't fail to live up to expectations. The whole area is beautifully designed with some amazing views of LA. The building itself is a work of art and that's before you step inside and see the countless Monet's, Renoir's and the Van Gogh.In a city that charges you for everything to have this free is an amazing treasure and definitely worth a visit.We were told that the building was used in the latest Star Trek films as the Federation HQ and being a Trekkie that was an added bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shan4179
50,Great visit,"We arrived late and did not have time to visit the whole thing but the Getty is a pretty amazing arts museum. The architecture and location of the building is pretty amazing as well. They offer free tours during the day, we could not take one but would be worth it as the place is big and you could waste time looking for where to go. The downside is that it is difficult to access via public transport so you have to go by car and to pay 15$ to park . The entrance is free though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chagallvoyage
50,Every detail is perfect.,"Whenever my wife and I are in LA we try to go to either Getty Museum. From the parking to the ride up the hill to the museum, the gardens, views and the many buildings full of art. I also recommend getting reservations at the sit down restaurant. Outstanding like everything a the Getty. I would strongly suggest a docent tour. There are three or four a day. No reservations are necessary. Check in at the front desk and see what is available, then show up when they tell you for a guided tour with a knowledgeable museum volunteer. Like the museum itself, these tours are free. The only cost, unless you buy something, is parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StanleyJ182
40,"A state-of-the-""Arts"" Museum! A must-see","The Getty Center is a great Institution and it is state-of-the-art presentation from the moment you arrive. Who comments on a parking garage? - but it's clean, well lit, and efficiently managed. Admission is free but there is a parking fee of $15 per car. The museum facilities are at the top of a very steep hill, making the tram ride up much appreciated, although you can walk up as well. The museum offers great exhibits that change frequently and more permanent displays as well.The focus is on European and American art from the middle ages to current times. The architecture is spectacular with a focus on natural lighting in the interiors that blends the building and galleries with a calming, natural feel. The outdoor art offers impressive and intriguing sculptures and the gardens mingles culture and nature throughout the facility. The flowering plantings are as spectacular as the art and the architecture. The experience is mostly for adult solo, couples, friends, and families with teens and older, although strollers and wheelchairs are available at no charge.There is a range of eating options from simple (but top quality) cart purchases, a cafe, and an elegant restaurant. The views over Los Angeles are really impressive from the museum's perch on a Santa Monica Mountain peak looking out over beautiful gardens and water elements.You really need much more than a single visit to see everything and it is really worth just sitting outside in the garden spaces to relax and soak in the views. The crowds can get large so arriving early or later in the afternoon / evening is advised. You can an audio guide in 10 languages and a printed map in 9 languages. Cell phone coverage can be spotty due to the hills and there is free Wi-Fi in some of the garden areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJRB1
50,Days and days worth of art,"I'm sad that I got to only spend an evening here, because I could explore for hours. There is a wide variety of exhibits, and the staff is very well informed. I took a guided tour on the 21st century acquisitions, but it didn't cover everything and highlighted only early baroque/renaissance pieces, so be wary of the tours you choose to go on and choose what you want to see first.Definitely go on a Saturday for extended hours if you're into art, parking is discounted after 3 PM. You take a trolly up to the museum, and make sure you go outside when you get there to take in the breathtaking landscapes. Definitely a highlight of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSarahb501
50,Stunning views and architecture,"Although other museums have much more extensive collections, the Getty Center has the best view of any museum I have been to in the U.S. or Europe. The view of LA is outstanding. Also, the grounds and architecture of the Center are first-rate. This is a must-see on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armass

50,An LA Must-do,The Getty is an amazing art collection in an unbelievable setting. The architecture of the building is really nice and the views of the surrounding hills and LA are fantastic. The museum itself is free but the parking costs $15. There's a short tram ride from the parking area to the museum. I recommend taking one of the free tours offered by the museum. I took the museum highlights tour and it was a great introduction to some of the museum's best known works.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonW2274

50,go as often as you can,"Been there a few times and still haven't seen everything (ok, they also change exhibitions frequently). It's a great place to view art of all ages.

It’s an oasis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithc951
50,One of the best things to visit in LA,"The Getty Center, in my opinion, is one of the best places to visit in Las Angeles. In addition to seeing beautiful art work by world renowned artist the center itself is a work of art. The center is located on a hill overlooking Las Angeles and on a clear day offers some wonderful opportunities to take pictures of the city. Also, there are beautifully landscaped areas that are great for walking and viewing different types of flora. We got to the center late and were able to spend about 2 hours enjoying the exhibits. My suggestion would be to have lunch on site and spend at least 3 to 4 hours enjoying The Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishcitric
50,A must see in Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is fantastic in so many ways. The architecture, art and gardens are all amazing. I also really enjoyed the sweeping views of Los Angeles you could see from several outside balconies.

With their devices and earphones , we can view the galleries at our leisure and easily spend several hours there. And it is free !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LathaRajagoapalan
50,Amazing and even more amazing,"I have been blown away from the magnificence of The Getty Center.Everything is to die for: the pieces of art (wonderfully and tastefully displayed so that you are not overwhelmed but can enjoy every single piece), the buildings that form the Centre (beautifully cladded in ceramic tiles and “fake” stone in earthy nuances), the grounds (so artistically laid in colour and planting ), the sculptures, etc.Everything is...perfect.Incredibile interesting is the little part that explain Getty and his legacy.The way you live the place make you think of a new experience for the word “museum”Amazing is not enough!!!P.S. Free WI-FI throughout the whole place...what else you need?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelaround59
50,A museum worth going out of your way for,"The Getty Center is spectacular. Entry to the museum is free although it costs $15 to park. A little tram takes visitors up the hill (you can choose to walk down for a different experience.) Allow loads of time, especially if the garden is open. (It had rained a lot before we arrived and the garden was closed, although the view from around the entire building is spectacular.) We took a couple of docent tours to put some structure to our visit. Do that... The docent who led us was extremely knowledgeable and interesting. Both the cafe and restaurant offer decent choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/810deirdreb

50,Consistently Beautiful,"This is a wonderful museum, with consistently great exhibits, and at a manageable price.It's a wonderful place for some down-time; explore and picnic in the gardens or in the fountain area before meandering through the halls. There's also some great views on different balconies throughout the complex. I wouldn't necessarily put it on a ""must-see list"" for tourists, but for locals looking for some leisurely culture, or tourists with a few more days in the city, I would highly recommend it. If you are looking for something more classical/grecian, the Getty Villa along the coast is also worth a visit.Admission is free, but there is a charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gabrielles

The exhibits themselves are well presented. I'm thankful for this institution in LALA land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmc
50,Superb,"We spent five very rewarding hours here today and plan to be back for more. The museum is not the most comprehensive we have visited — the Metropolitan, the National in Washington, and the Art Institute of Chicago are all ahead of it — but it is certainly the most beautiful. Moreover, the collection is well-curated and presented. As if that were not enough, entry is free, as are the audio guides and headphones. This is an absolute must-visit except for those who don’t like paintings and sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
50,"One of the best free LA attraction esp. for art, architecture & nature lovers!","A very relaxing place to soak in all the art and the history of Paul Getty. You will see great views of Los Angles, fantastic art works and it is free other than the parking fee. Just be aware of the awful traffic surrounding the Getty Center and Getty Villa. We went on a Thursday and were stuck in traffic for almost 3 hours in the late afternoon hours. Go earlier in the week and earlier in the day will help avoid being trapped around the 405 freeway and west side traffic. It is a must for those who loves art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_anyday2world

Just the trip up to the top is fun since you ride in a monorail tram from the parking area, up the side of the hill to the top where the center is located. Be sure to be there when the sun is setting for amazing views of the sunset and city. There are many places to catch the views so don’t linger too long at one - meander over to another look out. Beautiful grounds and garden, and of course art! Pay to park but free to enter museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sames2018

50,Spectacular views and architecture,"I love going up there just for the view, but the art and architecture are equally fantastic!The restaurants are quite good and the tram ride up to the museum adds a special touch of being futuristic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raine20671
50,Fantaistic art gallery,"Of course, it's well-known the Getty has a great art collection. The entire gallery's architecture is also simply amazing. And the views of Los Angeles are stunning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellin_Paul
40,Nice,The place is huge. Its free to enter but just pay for parking. They allow you to bring food and water from outside. But they do have some small kiosk and restaurant inside.You can do either an audio walk with the ipod and headset to rent for free just give your id or on your own.

50,World Class Museum and Architecture!,"What can I say?! The views, The gardens, The architecture (took 13 years to build!) AND... World Class Art and antiquities! Great place to spend the day! The eateries on the property are very good and have a variety for selection. Have a glass of wine and enjoy the amazing views and Gardens. When the weather is nice (most days in LA), it's a wonderful place to spend the day. They even have music and entertainment on certain evenings. A must visit while in LA! Great for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9384MVjohnk
50,Pre-Colombia art exhibit,Our book club read 1841 and this wonderful exhibit complimented it beautifully. It was put together so that it was easy to follow. 2 hour minimum to appreciate this time period.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkromas
50,Field Trip Anyone?,I always organize an annual field trip to LA for my visual arts students. This is one of my favorite places to visit with my students. The kids feel immersed in LA culture and get a good dose of art. We’ve even celebrated student birthdays with birthday cake in the sculpture garden. Love this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaleiw
50,Getty Villa,Beautiful museum with the perfect combination of indoor and outdoor attractions. Perfect place to spend a couple hours on the weekend. Great for dates!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diedra2016
50,One of my favorite places in LA,"The Getty Center is art and architecture gem on a hill providing a spectacular view of much of Los Angeles. It is place apart from the traffic and congestion of the city, reachable by a monorail from the parking garage. The museum is free but the parking is expensive, but the place is also reachable by public transportation. Once on the hilltop, you can choose to view the Getty stellar permanent collection, or among several special exhibits that range from photography to archeology. The modern gardens are unusual but very pleasant and attractive. There is good food in beautiful settings ranging from cafeteria style to haute cuisine, with prices and views to match. The exhibits change so it is a wonderful place to return to again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomasG765
50,Bucket List Attraction,"The Getty Center is remarkable. Five Pavillions, beautiful garden and stunning architecture. Spectacular views of Los Angeles and the Pacific. Frequent, rotating exhibitions. Wonderful European art with a grand collection of European Masters. Spectacular room of Impressionist paintings from Monet, Manet, Caillebot Renoir and more. We ate at the café for lunch. Diverse options including, deli, soups, salads, warm entrees. Admission is free. There are docent guided tours. Check in advance. Definitely secure free headsets. They will provide excellent perspective on the art collection. Park in an underground garageand take a short tram to the center complex. There is also a Getty Villa in Malibuthat specializes in Etruscan, Rome and Greek artifacts. Definitely a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiseppeGord
50,Educational Plus,"Entrance , brochure , informative materials are free except the parking. Be there as early as possible to get a good parking spot and spend time in the museum it is really very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
30,We go rarely,"Pain in the neck to access, collection is not that interesting overall nor is the architecture. Nice views, but there are many nice views from elsewhere in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbY4985XX
40,Great art. Difficult venue.,"Whoever did the layout wasn't concerned about ease of access. if you are limited or handicapped, this is s real challenge. Even elevater locations are difficult.The place is more a monument to the architects than prectical for visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rjreiser
50,A wonderful place to hang out,"The collection is often fragmented but a great time. You can park down below for a fee, but the rest of it is free. Pack a lunch for the gardens on a nice day. A great place to meet and hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johndegolyer
50,Recommendation from a former Getty guide,"This is one of our best attractions for visitors to L.A. It's a car-free zone, so it's a wonderful respite from city traffic. Do make reservations in advance as the parking lot has limited spaces. Then take the tram up the hill and enjoy the views, the art, the architecture and the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaD90265
20,Lacks the warmth of old Getty,"This museum certainly has more exhibition space, but feels cold, and makes one feel that quantity of art is never a substitute for quality. We liked their Malibu location much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418olegd
50,Always Amazing,"Although I like to visit in warmer weather due to the access one has to the beautiful grounds..every visit is lovely to this architecturally interesting place.The exhibits are well displayed and there is something for all tastes. The choices for dining are also an attractant for me. (As I like to take in art slowly, take breaks, eat a bit while looking out at nature, and then meander on.)Can’t recommend more highly as a must visit for Angelenos and visitors alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetHotels
50,Fantastic music night.,"We viewed the arts and then were able to hear the live music. You are allowed to bring your own food, but they serve alcohol as well for you 21's and over. Beautiful evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessopr
50,Amazing Property and Museum,"The Getty Center is an anazing combination of a great art collection, stunning views, incredibly gorgeous well maintained walkable gardens, and an excellent restaurant. As a frequent visitor I strongly recommend visiting on a clear good weather day. The views are stunning, buildings besutiful.Art collection (including masterpieces, furniture and a large photography collection) are worthy but not huge.Coincide your visit and have lunch at the restaurant, a great site, very good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcd509
30,Outstanding Art but Wet Weather Fail,"This is a truly spectacular place. The views, gardens and of course the art work are world class. But there are a few problems. The map to guide you around the centre is confusing and the signage wasn’t entirely helpful. The place is a maze! Staff however were helpful. However, the BIG problem with the Getty Centre is when it rains. The tram wasn’t running in the rain, so small shuttle buses were ferrying people, including numerous large school groups down the hill. We waited 20minutes in the pouring rain. There is also no shelter from the rain at the passenger pickup area once at the bottom of the hill. I suppose it doesn’t rain much in Los Angeles but it made our visit today pretty miserable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelley010593
50,So beautiful and a must see!,"We have been to many museums, but this is by far the most beautiful setting along with wonderful art, gardens, and buildings. The view alone is worth the trip, but the architecture is just so stunning and so well laid out to take advantage of the views. We spend a hour just in the gardens before going through the buildings. We could have spent more time there and would like to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9807YFirenes
40,Amazing views!,"You park in an underground car park and then have to take a little monorail up to the museum, leaving every five minutes or so. Once we got to the top, we headed straight for lunch at the cafeteria, which had a beautiful view of the Santa Monica hills, before checking out the art. The highlights for me were seeing Van Gogh’s Irises (he’s my favourite artist!), as well as pieces by Rembrandt, Rubens, Gauguin, Monet and Degas. Even more than the lovely art, I was so taken by the architecture of the building, with windows letting in lots of natural light, amazing high ceilings, and beautiful travertine tiles in whites and tans contrasting with yet another super blue sky Californian day. The architect, Richard Meier, has also made the most of the Center’s position in the hills, with a really large balcony where you have almost 180 degree uninterrupted views of the LA skyline. We could also see our hotel, just down the hill! We finished checking out the art, and then headed down into the gardens. There are fountains and flowing water everywhere, and lovely pops of colour from the flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeonVenables
30,Review is solely for the Saturday evening dinner,The Getty stays open until 9 PM on a Saturday - extraordinary atmosphere outside as the sun sets. One can also make a reservation for dinner in the restaurant (not cafe). It was SUCH a disappointment. The service was abominably slow; 45 min between the time that we finished our appetizers until the entree was served. The food itself was just okay. At more than $60/person it was entirely overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ps816
30,"For an older, more appreciative patron","I took two teenagers with me (one who is really into history) but they both got pretty bored by the end of the morning.It's ok but once you have seen a room full of artifacts, you have pretty much seen them all. I wouldn't rush back, nor would I think of this as a place to bring people who visit with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickwarrilow
40,Amazing Views & modern feel,"My friend & I decided to visit the Getty. I had heard how beautiful the gardens were & thought it was time to go. I wasn’t sure what to expect, so here is an overview. You park in the parking structure (spaces are tight.) Then go up to the tram platform. Before getting on the tram go through a security check. The views as the tram climbs are photo worthy. You can also see how close the fires came to surrounding homes & the 405 freeway. Before you get on the tram there is a schedule of the days tours & where to meet as well as the times. If you missed a tour not to worry. By providing a photo ID you can take a self guided tour with the help of an electronic device & headphones. Different art pieces have a number you enter on the device & it will tell you more about that piece. The information desk is fully staffed & has maps in various languages. There are plenty of staff members if you have questions about which pieces you can take NO FLASH photos of. There are a lot of stairs, but also elevators. We did not eat at the restaurant or cafe, but did get coffee and a snack from the coffee cart. It’s so peaceful to sit out & listen to the water from the fountains. The views of the ocean & LA are fantastic. The gardens didn’t disappoint. I was told Spring Is ideal for seeing different flowers in bloom. It was a peaceful way to leave behind all the hustle & bustle for a few hours. The museum is free, so you just pay for parking. Your first hour is free & after that $15. Prepay before heading down to the parking deck. There is no parking attendant on duty. It you are an art lover I highly recommend a visit to the Getty. If you aren’t I still recommend going because the location is just so beautiful. You can sit & people watch if that is your thing. There were three different exhibits on display when we visited that are only for a limited time, so if there is something specific you are wanting to see check out the website to see what exhibits are being featured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reneetravels2
50,Must see for Architecture and Art enthusiasts,"Great overall experience at the Getty Center - beautiful grounds, stunning buildings, wide variety of art provided a full day of enjoyment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesfa2015
50,Do not miss,"While I did not love the architecture, the exhibits and gardens are tremendous. And, on a clear day the views are sweeping.Saturday morning at 10 (opening), perfect time to arrive. Heating up but not overrun.Plan to spend at least 1/2 day, especially during good weather. Bring a blanket and relax on the grass with a book and/or go to one of the restaurants.Great place for kids.NB waiting for the tram inna giant line is silly. WALK up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritz1165
40,Stunning views of LA,Gorgeous setting and impressive displays. The garden walk in January was still great even without too many flowing plants to see. The docent was very knowledgeable of the architecture and gardens. Get here early as parking can fill up quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenlindab2016
50,Wonderful museum,"This is an amazing museum. It sits atop a hill that makes the views of Los Angeles breathtaking. It is FREE...yes, no fee for admission. The art was beautiful and the sculpture garden was great. The grounds and flowers were amazing. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattyd531
50,Great collections,We couldn’t believe what we found on this mountain. There were lots of free informational tours to choose from. We enjoyed one on the architecture and building of the center. Although it was too early in the year to see most of the gardens in bloom there was a lovely cactus garden on one roof. There was a lot of different exhibits in each building and the views of LA were unbelievable. Make sure you have a full day if you want to see it all. And you do want to see it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kat-kat2007
50,A must when in LA,"This place is amazing! The views are incredible along with the art, whenever my friends visit LA I always say this is one of the spots we need to stop by. StarTrack was filmed here in the garden. They have a Vincent van Gogh painting which is nice to see in person. Not as good of MOMA in NYC but still on point. It's free to go visit other then parking $15. 100000% worth it the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDrDarlington
50,Love this place.,"We have been to the Getty center numerous times, and it is always a joy to visit. The garden seems to be the favorite part of our visit every time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Btrfly123
50,Sinply Fantastic,This must be Gehry's best building. Sound is impeccable. Design is exquisite. Garden on rear side a jewel. We simply had fun....at the symphony no less.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9269JDmichaelh
50,Beautiful collection set in a spectacular building,Extensive and varied collection of European art including many of the masters. The collection is housed in a series of architecturally significant buildings and surrounded by beautiful gardens. It's located on the top of hill with spectacular views of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLguyTampa_FL
50,Wow,This museum is absolutely stunning. We went to see the art but were blown away with the setting and architecture of the buildings and views! We visited on a cold day but the gardens and outside areas are definitely as beautiful as the art itself.There is NO FEE to enter this amazing site and is definitely worth the time. You will have an amazing day.There food and wine for purchase so plan on spending a few hours - it’s so worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesF670
50,Fantastic day out.,"We had to visit over the weekend and joined a long queue to get into the car park. We feared the worst. However, once parked it wasn't very long before we were at the Center, the organisation is fantastic with getting people onto the small train to the top of the hill. There is so much space here that even though there are a lot of people, it doesn't really seem that there are a lot of people. The exhibits are well organised into their specific genres so it you have a particular interest you can go straight there, we particularly liked the French impressionists. There is also a nice little cafe that sells decent, reasonably priced food. Overall, a great day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanWhickersMate
50,Amazing place,"What an experience!Great views, wonderful gardens, amazing architecture and unbelievable art collections. This was well organised and just a very enjoyable day out. There is a $15 parking fee but no other charges. Cafe food was a little expensive but that can be forgiven as you don't have to pay for entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theedges2016
50,The Getty,"The Getty was a very good day trip. Parking is $15 and $10 if you go after 3pm. Don’t take the tram up , walk instead you will appreciate the views. There is so much to see... oh and the art and their history are totally amazing. It is a beautiful museum. There is a restaurant, several gift shops and the employees are really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aishany1
50,Must visit in Los Angeles,"If I have to make a list of must visit places for LA, the Getty would rank the same as Disney and Universal. And it's free! (not for parking but it's only $15).When you are done, on a nice day (i.e. almost every day in LA), take a drive from Sunset to Santa Monica. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTT
40,Where the setting betters the collection,"This indeed is one of the best settings in the world for an art museum. It is also extremely well organized and of ease to visit. Since arrival to their parking at the base of the hill it is the only place where spending money is required. The tram to the top is free and so is the absence of entrance free included the self controlled audio material. The grounds are extremely well designed and the views outstanding. On the other hand ,the masters collection is limited. In some cases much of the touted names consist of only one piece. The visit , like all good museums can be exhausting so we did not have time to explore their very good manuscripts collection. Part of the issue visiting the Getty is the guided tours. The well meaning guides are too loud contributing to the noise level. They have not learned to use modern technology that we see in many places in Europe where the whispers of the guides are transmitted directedly into the audio system of the participants. The undisciplined school children roaming are no help .Food is not easy, or cheap, to get access to. The karts outside are limited to low variety fast food, but the restaurant has a good reputation that we did not have time for.Overall it is well worth to fight the LA traffic to get there, and take relief in the thought that the worse is over when you leave toward the Ventura Freeway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinezcm
50,Great Museum and Great Tours on offer,Definitely worth the visit and if you get a chance take a few of the tours. The architecture tour was particularly good and the guide was very knowledgeable and engaging. Couldn't believe they had three Caravaggio's on loan from Rome!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvertd
50,Masterpiece!!,"What can I say about the Getty? Words escape me. You just have to go and see it. Plan for half day. Take a book. Have lunch there. Have enough time for the art but more time for the place, the feeling, and the experience. It is a one of a kind! The most beautiful place in LA by far. A place for the whole family. For everyone and anyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96shadik
50,Buildings & Grounds are Marvelous,"We visited the Getty Center on Friday, 22 Sept. 2017. Parking is $15 in the underground garage. One takes an elevator up to the ground level then an automated tram to the museum. I wish the orientation movie would have done a better job of explaining the vision/goals of the museum. Many galleries are sparsely filled and we walked through them relatively quickly. We enjoyed the amazing Mayan Gold special exhibit. The cafeteria dinning room was beautiful and the large platters of food were very good. We arrived at the parking garage at 10 am, saw 90% of the galleries, had lunch and departed at 1:45 pm. Four and a half hours would do it.Did this review earn a “helpful” vote?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnAnnColumbia_MD
30,A spectacular setting housing a relatively small collection.,The architecture and the setting on top of the hill were breathtaking. The art collection was not large or particularly unique. There were some nice pieces from a wide variety of artists. I guess I had hoped that more money could have been spent on the collection and less on the buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahaskell
50,Curiosity,If you love arts this place is a place for you. I don’t really appreciate arts before but when we visited Getty Center I would have to probably change my mind. A fine place of fine arts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelmatt1968
50,Wonderful place,"It was one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. The view is simply amazing and it is so relaxing to spend your time in that gardens! I was very surprised to learn that it is free to visit such a beautiful place. I didn't know about this place before I arrived in LA, it wasn't on my ""schedule"", but my friend insisted to visit it, and I'm so happy that she did. We didn't have very much time to visit all the areas of the center, but that is a good reason to go back as soon as possible. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradR5718XZ
50,What a great place,"Second time there; a masterpiece with lots of masterpieces inside, and out. Fun for art/architecture lovers. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drschmitt193
50,A GLORIOUS sunshine filled day at the Getty!,We visited the Getty Museum on an early Friday morning. Parking was easy. We took the tram to the top of the hill. The view of the city was remarkable. There was plenty of space to wander with benches along the way to review and reflect. The exhibitions were varied and impressive. I hope we can visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2VisitPlaces
50,"If you are in LA, go here. Period.","This is a FREE MUSEUM. You pay for parking, but you can take an uber or bus here as well. Based on the architecture only, it is my favorite museum in the world. Based on the art collection alone, this is my favorite museum in the world. Seeing a trend? And then there are 360 degree views of Los Angeles, a monorail ride to the top of the mountain, and amazing fountains and gardens. I have lost myself in these buildings for whole days many times. The exhibits here are world class, and the private collection is the most amazing ever assembled.There are a few spots for food while you are up here. The restaurant is a bit pricey, the cafeteria is what you would expect from a cafeteria with reasonable prices and a great variety of food, and there is also a food cart in the middle section of the outer part of the museum that also has coffee, beer and wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiasnerfherder
50,Worth a visit by all,"Very impressive collection of art and antiques. Better than any public display or museum I have ever seen.Even those not into art can get something out of it. Some will think 2 hrs is enough, others would need a couple of days. (Children will probably get bored, but there is the outside gardens they might like).Free entry but we did have to pay a little for parking, and the food and drink was very expensive. The car park was very full and the tram was broken when I was there so it was a 10min walk up hill if you didn't want to wait for the shuttle bus (usually a tram).A must visit for everyone. Wear good shoes and byo food and drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtravelled3
50,Very Easy to visit,Is a great surprise is very easy to visit and cheaper with great view to the city and Ocean. For sue I will back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellovers1983
50,Beautiful in every way - a must visit!!!,"One of the highlights of my family's trip to Los Angeles! What an incredible place - and so awesome that it is free!!Loved our group tour - so many of the world's best and most recognizable artists' pieces are in this special place.If you have time, would highly recommend getting a bite to eat at one of the restaurants on the premises - the view of Los Angeles is just as magnificent as the works of art inside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahTravels86
40,Artsy,"The Getty Center is beautiful, I noticed a lot dates and not many families. The landscaping is stunning and the art is hip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry
40,"Great garden, good museum","Most of the time I spent in the Getty was in the lawns, gardens, and balconies of the museum, which were, in my opinion, the best part. There was lots of space to lay down, have great views of LA, and to have an all around relaxing day. The few hours I spent in the museum were not nearly as fulfilling, with some of the sections I went to being mildly interesting at best. I do recommend a trip to the Getty, as Long as you are in LA for multiple days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krishnasreenivasan
50,The Most amazing Art Gallery I have ever seen,"I've been to museums and art galleries in NYC, various cities throughout Canada, Berlin and Munich in Germany, London, Paris, various cities in Italy, and my hometown of Buffalo, NY. This is by far the most impressive collection of art and history that I've ever seen. You must go here. It's wonderful! The Getty Center consists of 5 galleries in one complex so plan for an entire day. As an added benefit the cost is FREE. You will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Upset-Dog
50,Awesome visit,We just spent a fantastic day at the Getty Center. The art was amazing. It was so awesome to see in person one of the prints we have at home Irises. Just stunning to see this in person. We had lunch at the restaurant and it was some of the best food I’ve had in California. I can’t wait for out next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway580183
50,Easy Sunday Visit,I am amazed of the artwork and sculptures! Make sure to wear comfortable shoes. There are many exhibits and places to sit and admire the art. Teenagers were not as amazed! They offer options for small children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martha777lv
50,A Must Visit when in LA,Do yourself a favor if you're visiting LA and have half a day to spend here. The place is beautiful. It's a trek to get to but so worth it. The design of the place is inspiring. Whatever event they hold it's always interesting. Great for kids and people of all ages. There could be a lot of walking but in LA the weather is always great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChadS2038
30,For a selected audience !,"Go here if you love art, paintings, history. Nice view of the city. Garden is nice. Definitely not number 1 attraction in LA. Number 1 attraction should be the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankurs386
50,A don't miss for art lovers!,"I'm an art lover who is primarily interested in pre-20th century European art, so that was the part of the this large complex that I spent my limited time (3 hours) perusing. The collection was WAY above my expectations. Fabulous art works, beautifully restored, including the bonus of a temporary exhibit of THREE Caravaggio masterpieces! You usually have to go to Rome to see any of these. There are Rembrandts, marvelous Zuburans, and wonderful 17th century still lifes. The grounds are beautiful, even in February. Admission is free, but parking is $10. A fun tram ride up the mountain from the parking area to the museum is included. Just go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebM377
20,No available parking Sat afternoon,"- Arrived on a Sat afternoon at 4pm.- Parking is full with no alternative options.- Asked to return in 2 hours, but as we had an evening flight to catch, left instead.- Disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATravelingSushi
30,Yawn!,"First of all, I'm not an art person, but can appreciate good art. The Getty has rooms barley filled with art, just a few items per room. 1000 yr old rugs and china just not my thing, although it may be appreciated by some. I guess it was worth seeing once.. This is definitely NOT a place for young children. All in all, it was boring. The Peterson Car museum was very interesting if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683bs
50,A must Museum Visit,This was one of our museum visits while staying in Hollywood. It's a must for your museum outing. Interesting exhibits and very comfortable for seeing the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjacksond
50,Impressive collection and art display,"Absolutely stunning well curated and designed facilities that caters to families, school children and people of all ages.The train ride and free admission are nice.

The views were very nice. At the center we decided to use their free electronic tour Gide audio/video mini tablet system and left a piece of ID as Security.The facility is really amazing, fantastic art from world renowned artists, awesome views, and very affable Museum attendants. Parking was only $10 since we arrived 3:00 otherwise $15.Absolutely Fantastic! A must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123edk

Also, the aerial tram ride from parking to facility is calm and smooth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokce
50,Fabulous!,"We arrived a half hour before opening time on a Sunday morning and got right on the tram up to the museum. A coffee/snack bar was open before the museum, so we enjoyed a cup of coffee and the views while waiting.We really loved learning about the structures on the architectural tour which takes about 45 minutes. Next we joined the highlights tour of the museum which was so informative. The gardens are beautiful even in winter.I would love to go back for a visit in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldspun
50,Day at the Getty Center,"An amazing museum with a beautiful series of interconnected buildings and gardens, and a world class private art collection. This was built after the earlier museum, now known as the Getty Villa, became unable to hold the growing collection. The Villa is also worth a trip, to see a museum in the form of a grand ancient Roman estate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446mitchellm
50,Even if you don't like fine art it's worth a visit.,"The Getty is another must do whenever we are in the area, usually about once a year. Admission is free and all you have to do is pay for parking.They have many galleries to visit and what I appreciate is they are well designed and you rarely succumb to what we term ""Museum Fatigue"" like at some museums and galleries where you are presented with endless rows and rooms of things to see with no break. At The Getty there's always a way to pop outside and get some fresh air and relax.There's something here to see for just about everyone but even just going up to walk around and look at the amazing architecture and views is more than worth your time and they have a really nice cafeteria with a varied menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonkW8371OL
50,Getty museum,"It was nice. Great views, art and all things that I saw there were awesome! Bus # 234 goes there. I really enjoy this visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nat7717
50,Well worth the trip,"Fabulous visit for our family of four. Beautiful....Restaurant on-site was wonderful. Very pricey, but excellent food and wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heno100
50,Like visiting a world class European museum in your Los Angeles back yard,World class European art: paintings / furniture and accessories / some sculpture / wonderful unique architecture / did I mention FREE! / late hours on Saturdays. Multiple food options. A must visit if you spend much time in SoCal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artthiel
50,Truly World Class!,"Everything about the Getty Centre is exceptional!The setting is spectacular, overlooking the City to the South and the Pacific to the West from a prominent bluff.The architecture is amazing, modern and soaring, but fitting into it's environment perfectly. This is enhanced by the beautiful gardens throughout.We only had a day there and feel that it will take many more visits to fully appreciate the Center. Perhaps most surprisingly, is that with the exception of parking, which is $15 per day, and food and drink, its free! Guided tours and audio tour equipment is all complementary.I found the collection to be relatively small. As a ""non-arts buff"" I found the collection to be broad, rather than deep. For example, the Impressionist gallery contains about twenty-four pieces. Having said that, the collection appears to be well considered and curated. The pieces, especially the many sculptures, are beautifully displayed and integrated into the buildings and gardens.We ate in the cafeteria, where there was an excellent selection of great food at very reasonable prices.Overall, an outstanding attraction that is worth many visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913alg
50,Excellent.,"Admission is free, but parking is a tad expensive at $15. The tram takes you up to the museum. The cafe is well worth a visit after hours of strolling. The musuem also offers an excellent view of Downtown LA. The staff are friendly and helpful and the art collection is great. Such a great place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracepachuau
50,Great experience,Nice place to spend the day. Parking is a bit hard to figure out how to get in and out. The exhibits are well done but a bit hard to figure out what is where. The garden area is a delightful surprise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3549SYjohnr
50,Incredible,"A highlight of my trip. I wish I had given myself more time here!! Excellent visitor experience with iphone audio guides, and very friendly and knowledgable tour guides. I took the Collection Highlights tour, and the Architectural tour. What a rich cultural experience, I highly recommend and consider this a must-do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eleanor_Rose_W
50,Wow! This is now my top must-see attraction in Los Angeles!,"The views are incredible, the art is spectacular and the grounds are amazing. If you have a few hours, this is definitely a must do activity while in Southern California. We went on a very clear day with little smog and no clouds. We could see from the ocean to downtown LA and beyond. Even the 5-minute tram ride up to the campus offered amazing views! I was disappointed that many of the staff (mostly outdoor) were not very friendly and gave curt 1 word answers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardLevel23
50,"Good art collection, Great environment","This is a special museum and one that we visit often. In addition to their art collection, they have great exhibits of furniture and illuminations. We are photo collectors, so we visit for their changing exhibits. Entrance free, parking $15, but you can park cheaper away and take a shuttle. Go here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whetherperson
50,"Beautiful building, lovely art and fun tram","Great art, beautiful building, lovely outdoor space, and affordable cafeteria food. They have wonderful summer concerts that are not to be missed. Their photographic exhibitions are one of the highlights for me when visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkangj
50,Serene feeling at the Getty Center,"My friend and I both commented while walking around the Getty Center gives us such a serene feeling. We are blessed with our beautiful SoCal weather of blue skies, slight breeze and gorgeous view to the ocean. The variety of art work should please everyone.Also, the Getty Restaurant is a must! Be prepared to enjoy a lovely glass (or bottle) of wine, a starter, entree AND dessert with coffee. Your palate will thank you for the array of flavors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbySnacks
50,Outstanding exhibitions,"The Getty Center is an impressive place to visit and a real gem for every traveler to Los Angeles. Do not miss the opportunity to see a large variety of different styles, collections and exhibitions on show. It is an impressive place to visit and from the start it feels like a true journey when the tram takes you to the center. The gardens are magnificent and enjoyable with a large variety of trees, shrubs, plants, grasses etc. The coffee shop is a nice place to sit down after a busy day of watching all the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielM158
50,Outstanding!,"It is truly a work of art in its own right, and the views are spectacular. The buildings are beautifully interlaced, a tram takes you from the parking lot up to the Getty, and the ambiance is breathtaking. There is a cafe area on a wide open patio, and inside there is a cafe as well as a restaurant. The traveling exhibition on the economic crisis in Argentina in photos was particularly outstanding. You need to plan a day to do it all. We didn’t have enough time for all the exhibits. A real treasure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryhN2609ZS
50,"What a place, Rome and Greece in california","To enter the center you will have to register and print your pass from the Web. It is free, but don´t forget to do this, you won´t be allowed to enter if you don´t have a printed ticket.The place is just fantastic with a beautifull view of the Pacific. Plan a full day and bring your lunch with you. The villa is just great, it´s like being in greece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyzon12
50,Impressive as always,"We always visit The Getty Center when we visit LA. Their exhibition & permanent collections are consistently impressive and interesting. Everything is organized from the time the car is parked, transport to the Center by tram & the scheduled guided tours that run regularly. Best to visit on a week day but expect school children as it is a popular educational spot. No admission fee but there is a $15 parking charge.Recommend viewing the introduction video for first time visitors & join the guided tours. The volunteer guides are knowledgeable & engaging.If one enjoys their visit here, this can also extends to The Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StrictlyOurOpinion
40,"Free, free, free.","Wow. This place is huge. There is a train that takes you from the car park to the entrance at the top. There are security guards that check your bags before allowing you to enter the premises. There is everything from paintings, sculptures, antiquities and gardens. Tables and chairs to sit and take a break or have a snack in the courtyard.I visited on the back of a 13 hour flight and very little sleep and I would have enjoyed this so much more if I wasn’t sleep deprived.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spunkeemunkee
50,Won't Disappoint - So much to love,"Thoroughly enjoyed visiting for the first time. Gorgeous grounds that are family-friendly and perfect for lounging in the sun. Incredible city views and of course stellar art collection. Multiple dining areas; we chose the more casual which offered a ton of delicious options, to say the least. Definitely allow a half day for a visit if possible! Kids will enjoy the short tram ride. P.S. If I'm remembering correctly wi-fi was spotty, just FYI.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Provo8
50,Best Museum I Have Ever Visited,"From the tram ride to the entrance, to the superb architecture of the center and its garden, to the food in the museum Cafe, the Getty Center was one of the best museums I have ever visited.The art is displayed in incredibly beautiful galleries with impressive views of LA and the many museum shops and temporary exhibits are very well designed.We enjoyed your three hour visit and hope to return again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WellTraveled3
40,Loved the gardens,"It's free to get in but you have to pay for parking - $15. What's incredible is that the car park has so many floors; it was tremendously busy, seemed to be full on each level and we just kept going down and down! Once you've parked up, you walk towards the Getty Centre's very own monorail. The queue for this is a little insane – think Disneyland – I'd say it was about a 40-minute wait. Also, there is partial shade, so if like me you are fair of skin – make sure you're wearing a hat and also sunblock. I'd also say, just bring water with you everywhere when traveling in LA – you don't want to be caught out. The Getty itself is huge so when you're actually walking around, it doesn't seem that busy at all. Architecturally, this building is very beautiful with its mixture of straight and curved lines, poised up high with fabulous views of the city. I loved the grounds water feature through the paths of the Central Garden, the flowering maze and particularly the cactus garden. When inside I enjoyed weaving my way through the various collections and you can see works such as Van Gogh, Irises. Like everywhere in LA, the building had fantastic air condition, but what was also fabulous was the huge, triple glazed (at least) doors that not only maintain the coolness but keep the art protected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
50,Beautiful time spent at the Beautiful Getty Center,"We enjoyed our time at the Getty Center. Easy parking and tram ride close by the parking structure. I advise going on a sunny day. There is a lot of walking outside and would not be easy to walk to various buildings if it was rainy or windy.Their is no admission fee, but parking is $15.00. If you arrive at 3PM it is only $10.00.The individuals working their are knowledgeable and very polite. They have many wonderful artist and collections to view and easy access to them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watergalEncino_CA
50,"There is a reason it is number 1, Free (except parking) and amazing art","I suggest you go on the free tour with the art guide. You can learn a lot about art that you would not regularly understand. The garden is amazing year round and the view is spectacular especially on a clear day. The only draw back is parking cost, but get a car full of people and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earthman88
40,Nice Family Outing,A great time and place to see fabulous art and do so in a family friendly location with a very peaceful location in the hills above LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1027UUmichaelf
40,Beautiful grounds surrounding a small but very nice museum,"Even the outside walls are of interest - you can find fossils in the tiles. On a clear day, the view is spectacular. On busy days, the tram leading up to the museum can be a bit overcrowded. Was bummed to notice they're charging $15 for parking now. Nice half-day event for adults and older children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868
40,The LA/LA exhibit was great.,"This place was amazing, while we were there they had a special display of Latin American (Inca/Mayan) treasures. The artifacts date back several hundred years, in fact, older than I would have thought.In addition to the special exhibit there are sections of the museum that house painted artwork, carvings, historical furniture, think Louis V, French, sculpture and more.While we were not there at the right time of the year to view the gardens at their best I imagine they would be beautiful. We also saw how close the fires got to the museum, it was across the street/highway on the 405. You could see the charred hills and the Getty center with all of its greenery near and around, would have been a disaster if it has crossed the street.The museum is free, the parking is about $20 but you can get a lot of folks into a car or better yet UBER there and then you won't have to worry about the parking. They have a train shuttle that takes you up to the center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599indiram
40,Interesting and inspired!,"Was not sure what to expect but the art collections, the views, the history was simply spectacular. Worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenV98
50,Open your mind...open your eyes!,Recharge your mind and soul...for free...less than 30 minutes from LAX!There are at least ten pieces of art that individually make the Getty rival the more notable museums of the world. Having visited most...The Getty did not disappoint. The Van Gogh alone made this worth the trip....the view and awesome fresh food cafe only enhanced the visit. Sunset was amazing! Open to 9:30pm ..just jump in that next ride share and go!A visit will remind you that our civilization is soooo much better than what is in the news!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayw386

50,Don't miss Getty Museum when you are in LA,"The Getty Center is always my first choice of recommendation when I have friends visiting from out of state. I always enjoy taking my friends there. It's a place for everyone, not only art lovers. In addition to amazing art collections, the Center offers breathtaking views from downtown LA to the Ocean, beautiful gardens, and plenty of seating areas to relax. It is definitely a must see, and you can never be tired of visiting again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel-the-world66

50,Amazing place to visit,"We both loved the Getty Centre, both for its Architecture and its Art. We had limited time so concentrated on the visiting exhibition of Central American gold - wonderful. We then looked at specific galleries - there is plenty to see. There was a small David Hockney exhibition on when we were there.The building is full of light and space and a great place to stroll around. The views are spectacular and there are plenty of seating areas etc. No admission fees but you pay for parking - the ticket is valid for The Getty Villa if used on the same day, which was what we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilld360
50,Beaufitul,"This is such a great museum. I went to all the exhibitions and this is definitely worth the trip. So many scultptures, paintings, and information !

50,Great experience and museum,"Spent an afternoon with my family at the Getty Center, saw the Golden Kingdoms exhibition which was fantastic. The kids enjoyed the hand-decorated masks and playing in the tube sculpture. Great place for a family with young kids (age 6).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afgm2014
40,Worth a visit,I spent a afternoon in the Getty. The collection is nice though not as rich as what you will find in Europe. The garden and the architecture is spectacular! The view of the city and Beverly hills( I reckon?) is amazing. Recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727sherryz
40,Nice Buildings & Grounds,"Mostly old paintings.. Saw a Painting by Vincent Van Gogh.If you’re into old religious paintings this is for you.Personally I found the architecture and grounds more interesting than the art.If you’re visiting on the weekend, Expect it to take a long time to park & the line for the tram to take forever. If you’re impatient like me probably better to just walk up the hill...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamK487
50,Getty is still Number 1!,If you are in LA don’t miss the Getty!Costs nothing to enter other than your parking fee if you come by car.Sets a standard that most fail to meet. Good food as well a a fabulous environment on top of the exhibitions mean I’ll always come back when I’m in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129aDavid
50,Wow!,"Soooo agree with many of the reviews that this MUST be on your bucket list. We got there at 9:30, parked immediately and went right in. The tram’s a great way to get up the hill and deliver you right at the entrance. We walked through the beautiful gardens until the museum opened at 10:00. Then toured each of the floors on our own. The buildings are architecturally wonderful and the artwork breathtaking. The views of the city from each of the outdoor patios is spectacular. Just go. You won’t be sorry! By the time we left at 1:00, it was packed. Not so getting there right as it opens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houstontravelingfool
50,Incredible,"The Getty Center is one of LA's best attractions. When you arrive at the Getty, you are greeted by smiling staff members. The staff really go out of their way to be helpful. They're warm, they're friendly and they're always on hand to answer your questions. The Getty architecture is as stunning as the art. It is entirely made of marble and sits at the top of the hill that divides the city, and it houses some of the most extraordinary pre 20th century European art in existence. From Van Gogh and Monet , to ancient Roman artifacts and tapestries and everything in between. There are also traveling exhibits that feature more modern work. The art is divided into 4 buildings that can be visited in the order of your preference. There are special family rooms as well as activities for kids to stay entertained and learn about art. The buildings are well-designed, with lots of natural light and high ceilings. The grounds include a labyrinth of gardens and manicured lawns that is a tranquil place to sit and read, write in a journal, let the kids blow off some steam or simply meditate and relax. There are fountains and flowers; babbling brooks and tall cactus plants.Another amazing feature of the Getty is the Garden. The beautiful labyrinth-like garden features flowing water and changes with the seasons. If you get hungry you should go to the cafe to sample the amazing daily menu. If you are looking for an exceptional dining experience try the restaurant, since it gets full you are better off making a reservation in advance. If you need want a special treat stop by the first floor of the research library and look at the available literature. On a side note, I was very impressed with the children's gift shop. Instead of the usual array of toys and silly souveniers, the Getty shop is heavy on art supplies, pencils, crayons, clay...all the tools a young artist would need to create his or her own art. Try to be at the Getty Center first thing in the morning – easy to park, no crowds. What can I say except – if you are in LA and love museums you must go. My only regret was we didn't have more time, there is so much to see at this incredible museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_Williams191

50,A must see attraction in LA.,"This museum is worth seeing for its (a) collection; (b) architecture and (c) location! Even if the the first two disappoint you (they won't), the views of LA are stunning, particularly if you are fortunate to arrive on a clear day.A convenient and cheap way to get to the Getty Centre is to take e the public bus, which stops just outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsQ7329RR
50,a day at the getty,"The Getty is a great museum....whatever you like. Art, decorative arts, garden. etc. I really enjoyed both the architectural tour and the garden tour.

40,Excellent French & European furniture,What a gem and collection of French and European Furniture. Truly he had an exquisite eye for fine furniture. Highly recommend seeing these pieces alone. The art is wonderful too. The museum is filled with a lot of Dutch and Flemish art because of the restrictions on years for what the museum can present and acquire. Some of the artists are notable and sought after. Definitely worth comparing the collections from around the USA to the Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trendy_Explorer

40,Wonderful outdoor gardens,"The garden reminded me a bit of the gardens in the Palace of Versailles, except in smaller scale and grandeur. Nonetheless a great garden, and the Photography in Argentina exhibition was very interesting.A must-go at least once but not sure I would return (not a big arts appreciator).The entrance is free with free audio tours, and first hour of parking is also free, although I doubt you would stay for less than an hour to make it. The hour after that is USD 15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summersbea
50,Outstanding,"Visited this museum in June of 2014 and loved it! I could visit this place everyday if I was local. The exhibits, gardens, and art are so beautiful and inspiring. Was pleasantly surprised to be able to experience the James Ensor Exhibit while there. A must when visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodTimeGal78
50,Lovely spot that inspires appreciation for philanthropy,"We can see why the Getty is related #1 of places to see in LA. We went on a weekday, and even then it was busy. The tram deposits you at the steps of the Center, and even with a map it is not possible to visit all of the Center. There are beautiful spots to linger, and the collection of artifacts and artwork is amazing. The Getty is also student-friendly, with a number of local grade and junior high classes sprinkled all around. It's a place you need to return to frequently to get the full sense of beauty. More power to the Getty family for sharing this treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IDFNP

50,Amazing Place Totally Worth the Visit,"The Getty is extraordinary. The art, the architecture, the setting and above all the views are all amazing. The Getty is truly a celebration of beauty on many levels. The best part of all -- admission is free. Parking is $12 however, but too many museums $25 admission fees plus $12-$20 for parking. If you don't like art, go for the sweeping views which, on a day like today included as far east as the Santa Monica mountains and as far west as all of Catalina Island and even San Nicholas beyond. The art collection is massive and beautifully displayed. Even in winter the gardens were fascinating and the building is top design. You can't help but respect The Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheGrove214
50,Must see!,"Stunning location! Worth visiting just for the views, but also wonderful art, including decorative arts. Something for almost everybody. At busy times, allow extra time to get in. We were there on the Saturday afternoon of a long weekend and had to wait just to get into the driveway to where we could be dropped off, then waited in line for the security check, then for the train to go up the hill. But worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AYL038

40,The center's architecture and setting is at least as interesting as the exhibits,"Our journey to the Getty Center was complicated by the common GPS issue - evidenced by the various signs in residential streets directing drivers back towards the 405 junction, which wasted 20+ minutes in our case due to queuing traffic.Having managed to switch lanes on N Sepulveda Blvd just in time to turn left back under the 405 we were finally at the large parking structure. Signage to the Center may be flakey but the onsite parking and transit up to the Center were very well organised. We had a quick lunch in the cafe, a walk around the outside of the Center buildings then time for one permanent exhibit and one temporary exhibit - more time than the 2 hours we had allowed would have been useful as were rather rushed and missed out on the guided tour of the site.Good points:+ Lots to see in the various pavilions and surrounding grounds+ Plenty of onsite parking+ Several options for drinks and lunches+ Architecturally interestingNot so good points:- Check the destination address is correct as misguided GPS regularly takes drivers into the residential neighbourhood of Westgate Heights- The site is on several levels so there are lots of steps, both outside and inside the buildings- For me there were no truly outstanding or must see exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000

The place is huge, the gardens pleasant and time to time they change the exhibitions, so pay attention if is the kind of time you want to dedicate because sometimes you go there and can bump into something you maybe find boring or not attractive.

I also saw the Golden Kingdoms exhibit that included many works discussed during the symposium.The BEST two days I have spent in a very long time. The Getty Center collection and temporary exhibits are priceless! The architecture and gardens are beautiful. It is a wonderful place to spend the day. Many people bring their laptops and write at a patio table, in the garden, in the cafeteria. The parking is $15 for the day, but it is reachable by the bus line that runs up Sepulveda. And if it is a clear day, you can see Catalina! A day at the Getty is a day very well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheriStoll

50,The Getty Center -- a particularly rich experience for viewing art in the hills above Los Angeles.,"The Getty Center is a very special Los Angeles experience of great art in a campus like arrangement of buildings in an exceptional setting. Other cities have Museums in ""downtown "" locations that are very urban but the Getty is situated in the beautiful heights between the San Fernando Valley and the LA Basin. Initially people feared that the need to park and then take a train would discourage people from visiting the Getty but instead the journey and the splendid views became part of the attraction. The collection has some real strengths in Renaissance and Baroque painting as well as a notable collection of master drawings and a particularly fine collection of furniture. There are often very interesting traveling exhibitions on view. I've never visited where I didn't have the opportunity to both visit an old favorite and also see something new. So go for the view! --in all senses of the word.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthW589

50,A must-visit place when in LA... plus it's for free!,The Getty Center didn't disappoint.

50,Fabulous art and architecture.,Great setting for world class art and free to enter. Impressionist art was worth the trip along with the buildings and views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jzamansky
50,"Amazing Architecture, Gardens, & Art!!","There are few places in that you can access in the international art world for free, that allow you to see aspects of paintings, sculpture, architecture, and gardens. This may be the one and only if it’s kind.A couple of things to know - parking is charged, number of people visiting the Center is limited by parking. If you do not get there early, you may not find parking, hence be unable to get access to the Center. If parking is full in the morning, they will ask you to come back around 1:00 for openings in afternoon parking, important to get there around 12:45. This is great as it limits the amount of people to a manageable number, allowing you to move through the exhibits without being rushed or in contact with other people. The tours - self guided and exhibit guided are both excellent and recommended.An amazing way to spend an day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_tornado67
50,Not-to-be-missed destination,"The Getty Center is worth investing a day of a visit to LA - while you can enjoy the architecture and artscaped gardens in less time, once you get all the way to the Getty you can spend hours and hours immersing in the collection. Entry is free but parking is $15. If the adjacent parking is full, look for overflow parking across Sepulveda Boulevard at a temple parking lot - if you see a sign for parking there, turn in immediately instead of turning into the Getty and having to turn around, unless, of course, you just want to drop off your passengers. Don't bother waiting for the tram up the hill - while the sidewalk is a bit steep it is well shaded and not a bad walk. The vistas of Bel Air are delightful from the approach. Once at the Getty, get your bearings with the orientation video and get a map of the complex. Different schools of art are housed in different pavilions. There are several cafes throughout the grounds - my favorite is the Garden Terrace but there are also indoor options. There are special curated or traveling exhibitions as well as a comprehensive permanent collection. There is a free audio tour that features highlights of the collection. The Italian travertine on buildings and courtyards is softened by water features and plants. The gift shop has a good selection of art books but not so many affordable souvenirs except for children. Don't miss the cactus garden at the South Promontory with a fabulous view of downtown LA. If you want to immerse in the history of art, the Getty is one of the best places to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CreateConnects

50,Really worth a big detour,"Staying overnight by the airport and decided to finally go to the Getty. A $20 Uber to get there, but a $50 taxi back. Uber was quoting $75 but it was 5.00 on a Friday and the roads were jammed.The Latin American gold exhibition was the feature and it was very well done. Having visited the Gold Museum in Bogotá only a month or so before we were impressed by the attractive and informative way it had been structured. The Colombians could learn.Terrific paintings, sculptures etc., but it was the setting that makes it unique. Very attractive building with great views, even with the smog of LA which was pretty bad for January.With the special exhibitions I think it could be worth going 2 or 3 Times a year if an LA resident.Entrance was free. No idea how they do that. Must be the rich Foundation. We should have made a bigger effort to visit years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coylum
50,A Day at The Getty is a Must-Do,"We spontaneously chose to visit The Getty Museum before driving back home to San Diego. Wow.

We used the audio tour to learn about the Golden Kingdom and the museum highlights. So much to see. Beautiful views of the city. You must come!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749elsag
50,Best Museum in LA,"This place is one of the best museums in LA. If you like arts and histories, you'll be happy to be here for hours and hours. It's better to visit this place around 10am or probably earlier since it will get crowded and long line entering parking garage. Parking fee is $15 ($10 after 3pm) but no cover to enter the museum. You need to ride a tram from parking garage to the main area (you can walk if you like) and don't forget to ask for a map at information booth inside museum entrance hall. So many interesting things in this place from paintings, sculptures and breathtaking views from outside the building. Bring powerbank or extra charger cos you will take so many pictures. Trust me it's worth it to come here :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdMoch

Toss in the gardens and views makes this a world class experience over the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogiacomo
30,A personal disappointment,"I had heard so much about the place and love modern art and architecture. This place, however, felt totally overdimensioned. I admit the entrance is free and therefore there should be nothing to complain about. It is just I expected a more inspired approach from such a renown architect like Richard Meier. Also, the exhibitions were of moderate interest to me since they do not offer real highlights. My favourite part were the impressionist paintings and the pre-columbian objects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michiberli

50,Visit to the Getty Center,"We live in the San Fernando Valley, not far from the Getty Center but it is a place to return to periodically especially to take out of town visitors. There is great art work there, but if nothing more than to visit the grounds, it is well worth it. Especially on a clear day, the views are spectacular. It is a great destination to just walk around for a couple of hours. Bring your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herb_Silverman

50,Fabulous LA Museum,This was my second visit to this Museum with a view of the La hills and valley. You go for the world class exhibits but you leave remembering the beautiful views in every direction. Plan to spend between 2-4 hours.The only cost is parking is $15 at the base of the mountain then your journey begins by taking the tram up the hill. Amazing views begin your day. Free maps are available so you won get lost. Be sure to visit the beautiful gardens which were an art project itself. You can get eat lunch or just grab a snack at the museum. Go early because there's always a line to park. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johninok
50,Indeed the Best Museum in Los Angeles,"I did not have very high expectation for the Getty Center. I imagined that it is just ""another art museum with mediocre collections established by some wealthy family."" However, their collection is generally extensive. The more impressive is the settings of the center itself.There are several buildings on top of the hill, with great view of Los Angeles (and its congested freeways). There are also several simple but informative temporary exhibitions going on at the time of my visit. The garden and the outdoor artworks are also lovely.The best thing is that all these are free, including the audio guide and the mini-train ride from the parking lot.If you do not have your own transportation, it is a little tricky to get to Getty Center. The easiest way is taking Metro Expo Line to Sepulveda station and change to Bus 734/234. However, I do see many people order Uber to/from the Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saricie_Q
30,Architecture or art ?,I revisited The Getty Center and I encounter the same desilusion as per my last visit. This extraordinary museum is exceeding as an architecture and is lacking in art. The permanent exhibition are poor and the temporary one are unattractive. Although is permanently crowded the curators are probably in a continuous holliday or simply they do not have the means or the will to enrich this wonderful museum with matching art. Check beforehand what's on display or purely go to admire the construction and spend time in the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnlyHighRollers
50,Simply Amazing,"How can one describe how amazing this place is. The architecture, the gardens, the location, the special exhibitions and importantly the collection. I was mesmerized the moment I walked in the first wing. A room of Rembrandt's - wow. Personally I prefer the Cezanne beside van Gogh's Irises which was good considering crowds.

This time, we arrived on a Saturday and the Getty Center closes late on Saturdays. Still, we could barely finish seeing the paintings.We were amazed by the huge collection of paintings. They are all excellent masterpieces from famous painters. They were so beautiful that we found it hard to leave the exhibition rooms. In addition to paintings there are also exhibitions of other arts such as photography, but we did not have time to see them all. Next time when we visit LA again I am sure I will visit the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPofHotels

Sweeping views from several vantage points of Century City and neighboring areas. After a chaotic and crazy day at the Rose Bowl Parade and Football Game, this museum was the calm serenity we needed to enjoy the beautiful sunny CA weather. Parking is at the bottom of the hill and you ride a tram up. Fyi... the Uber/Lyft pickup is in a specific area when you are leaving. Security can direct you to the correct location.

At the Getty Center, the selection of food was great, the layout of the serving area was well thought out AND the food was good!There are four different food lines representing four different food styles. Plus you can go to an already prepared sandwich area and grab and go.Good job, Getty food management!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ports707
50,Wow,"What a fantastic place. Had an awesome day at the Getty. Caught a Lyft from Downtown LA there and back, glad I did as parking was at a premium. Lunch at the cafe was pretty good vale as well.If you are visiting LA it is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rdog67
50,Getty Museum,"Wonderful place of art for all ages and groups of young to old.Having place like this in Los Angelesis priceless.Felt like l was in Europe and enjoying art gallery, but way largerAnd greather than l have experienced.Not as large as LOURVE.I will visit again and again:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mojganm618
50,Beautiful inside and outside,"Spent four hours and could have spent another four hours taking it all in. The gardens are beautiful. Just wish there had been benches along the path so I could sit down and enjoy it more. The artwork is varied and I will have to go back to see what I missed this time. There is no entrance fee for the museum, but they do charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richard9H
50,Nice place to Visit!,"Its a nice place to visit during your stay in LA.Place is beautiful with interesting arts to see. Price is acessible, worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcosVellinho
50,THE PLACE TO GO IN LA!!!!,"Lovely architecture wonderful collection and superb view of LA. The garden is amazing as well. We were there before heading home through LAX and very much regret only spending a day there. Even if you don't want to do anything, it is still the place to go to get away the hassle bustle of LA. There is something for everyone. We will be in LA again and I will schedule at least 2 days another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KTse
50,Lots to Offer!!!,"Amazing sweeping views of the city and a fun little tram ride starts it all off as you climb up to the architecturally stunning estate. The museum has primarily European classical artworks but they also have quite a few spin offs notably the Japanese art exhibit as well as changing contemporary exhibits. Docents lead wonderful informative tours and are excited to share their knowledge and open to discussing ideas. Cafe is state of the art (no pun intended) with lots of options and offerings while the restaurant, while a bit pricey offers an elegant atmosphere and beautiful views. I recommending planning 4+ hours for this museum as there is lots to see! Outdoor gardens are great for walking through, meditating and taking in the sweeping views of Los Angeles - some of the best views of the city from coast to downtown buildings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BennySD
50,Getty is great for a day!,Huge amazing complex. Priceless art sculpture furnishings! Incredible gardens beautiful views.Well worth five hours. Restaurants are great also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigce
50,Magic on the Hilltop,"Wow! The views from the Getty Center are fantastic and that is before you go into any of the exhibits. One parks at the bottom of the hill in the Center's parking structure and upon exiting pays either $10 (3 hours or less) or $15. That is the only cost to you as all the exhibits are free. You can walk, take the tram or a bus to the top, your choice. Plan on spending about three hours viewing before you go into ""museum overload,"" as you have just scratched the surface at least another visit is warranted to lightly cover more of the exhibits. We were impressed with the way the displays were set in rooms that appeared to be taken right from castles and chateaus really bringing the exhibits to life. There is something here for everyone regardless of age. We will return when back in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9dietz
50,One of my favorite museums,"Beautiful, modern set up. Very open and specious. My dad and I used to come here about once a month just to hangout and people watch. The art is pretty unique here I would highly recommend a visit. The views around the building are also a plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Halieee95
10,Wish I could review the center but I spent 45 minutes in the parking garage to be told there was no available parking,"Arrived at the Getty Center at 11;45 am on Tuesday, January 2, 2018. Parking attendant directed us into the parking garage. After we drove down to level P7 and found no available spots, we were again directed by parking attendant to follow the white car in front of us up a hill. We never found the hill because as we exited the garage we were directed by another attendant to turn right. This took us away from the Getty Center! We turned around and were directed by police back into the Center. After arriving at another parking attendant, we were informed that the lot was full and to come back in 1 hour. This already took up 1 hour of our time! I found it hard to believe that the parking attendant directed about 30 cars too many into the parking garage and that there was no communication between them. What a waste of time. Would love to visit the Center in the future but will be some time before I forget the poor treatment we and many others received.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trfRugby_ND
50,Gorgeous gallery and outdoor spaces,"What a view. What a collection of beautiful, fascinating and fun art. I took a bus to get there and it was well worth the effort and getting lost a couple of times. Stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnadU4033SF
50,"Just Go- Even if you don't like museums, you will love this place","The location, the architecture, the art-Oh My.This place has it all.The views are spectacular and the artwork is amazing. The trip is so worth it.Definitely worth the Uber ride.We arrived fairly late in the afternoon and only had 1-2 hours to spend. I would suggest more time to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrpdxs_12
50,World class,"If you love art or architecture, do not miss the Getty Center when visiting LA. Fairly crowded, but worth it. It takes a while to park and either hike the hill or take the tram, so expect to stay a while. The museum cafe is excellent and roomy, but LA pricey for a cafeteria. The art is amazing and from many historical periods and cultures - it's like a mini-met.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/litedee
50,Amazing,"This is a place where you breath culture.The biuldings are amazing , the view , and there is also the collection of arts.Its a must see in LA.There is only one low point , the cafeteria has no Expresso coffee......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuiAmaral
50,Don’t miss it,Don’t miss this treasure BUT plan on spending a leisurely day there. There is just a ton to see and the outdoor gardens are a half of a day alone. There are wonderful restaurants that look out over the valley .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susieqDenver
50,Fantastic and not to be missed,Arrive early. The parking lot opens at 9:30am and the museum opens at 10. Arrive early to take the 5 minute tram ride to the museum. This is what I did recently. At 10am the galleries were not crowded. By 12:15pm it was a mob scene. Parking is $15. Entrance to the galleries is free. There are several fabulous Latin art shows there now that will close next month. There are some fantastic Caravaggio paintings on loan until February 2018. There are lots of volunteers and docents to answer your questions and help you there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Still wonderful,"I’m a regular visitor to LA and we always go the the Getty Centre. Always worth seeing, they have a permanent collection but wonderful touring exhibitions too. Go on a clear day so you can enjoy the views. I take lunch as it is pretty expensive, no one cares that you eat your own food. It always feels a bit regulated and tidy but the gardens are spectacular and its worth going just to see buildings. The tours are excellent too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyLS48
50,Great for the entire family... Great collections and views of the city!,Easy to reach... great parking structure... excellent exhibits and collections and fabulous views! All first class!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlopez333
50,Unbelievable (in a good way!),"November was an excellent time to visit The Getty - the weather was lovely, cool in the morning and comfortably warm in the afternoon. We spent about three hours in various buildings and outside in the garden area. The collections were incredible and the staff and volunteers were very friendly and helpful. Loved the fact that a tram travels up to the site and the process is very well-managed and convenient for visitors. If you appreciate art, you will find works suited to your taste and enjoy the architecture.. The Getty is one of the jewels of Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperSnorkeler
50,Incredible collection in amazingly designed museum property & gardens!,"Two adults + two teens spent all morning and early afternoon at the Getty Center then drove to the Getty Villa for the remainder of the afternoon... a perfect day.Here are some recommendations to help make your day great:-Read up on the website ahead of time to decide on your transportation mode and plan your visit-If driving, note that the parking garage opens at 9:30am. Try to arrive by 9:15 to be line for the parking garage and thus be early in line for the tram!! The tram line gets long very fast.-Take your parking ticket with you, don’t leave it in the car. (Note: if you plan to visit the Villa in the afternoon, pay for your Getty Center parking at the main parking area so you receive a receipt... this acts as a parking pass valid at the Villa so parking is free when you arrive at Malibu).-So arrive at the Getty parking garage by 9:15/9:30 (garage opens at 9:30 but the queue forms earlier); then park and get in the tram queue, then enjoy the ride up the hill!-you are now ready to explore so many wings of the Museum, it’s nearly overwhelming, so if nothing else, just wander and enjoy getting “lost” among the exhibits and views!!-cafes and restaurant don’t open until noon but snack carts are open for coffee and small bites.-The Getty Center Museum is open 10am-6pm.Safety Comment re: The main Getty Center:-For people using wheeled assistance, an extra precaution re the marble.... it can be really slippery. We saw one woman who was using a sit-on seat with wheels and she lost her balance... she fell backward and hit her head hard on the marble. They had to call a medic for assistance. Just be careful re young kids, people using assistance devices, or anyone with slippery-bottom shoes or high heels.-Plan your trip: We were at the Getty Center for four hours and the Villa for two hours and we really needed another two hours at the main Getty museum.... so if you want to hit both locations as we did (we’re from San Diego), then there will be some exhibits that will be missed at the Getty Center. -Oh well!! ‘Time to plan another trip to LA!!-If you do decide to go to the Getty Villa, YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE AND SIGN UP FOR AN ADMISSION TIME-It’s free (as is the main Getty museum), but YOU HAVE TO BRING AN ADMISSION TICKET FOR A SPECIFIC ENTRY TIME by going online and signing up at the GettyVilla.com- So for the Villa, bring your printed admission passes plus your receipt from the paid parking from the Getty parking garage. You’re now ready for the add-on trip to the Vill, if that’s part of your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
50,Allow a whole day,There is so much to see at The Getty! The process of getting from the bottom of the hill and up via the tram is very efficient. Allow several hours- one whole day to be able to visit all the interesting exhibitions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portiaking
50,Love this place!,If you are coming to visit LA (or live in LA) this place is a must see!!! It is free to get in and only costs to park. I recommend bringing a picnic lunch and hanging out on the lawn. Bring a book or a few friends to hang with.There is a LOT of art of all different types and they usually have traveling exhibitions there as well. There is always something to see.I love the architecture. Beautiful buildings and beautiful grounds with a view of the entire city and ocean all the way to Catalina (if it's clear enough). And the tram ride up is very scenic.Is it the Louvre? No. Is it beautiful with an amazing view? Yes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhscripty
50,"Gardens, architecture, art....","Wonderful, definitely worth a visit - but during holidays, my big tip is - get an early start.The car park opens 9:30am and centre opens at 10:00am.We drove past long queues waiting to turn into the car park one afternoon (2pm-ish) - cars were queued down both sides of N Sepulveda Blvd so we went back 10am the next day. A great decision as we drove straight into the car park. At 10:10am there was a 20min queue for the tram to go up the hill to the Getty so we decided to enjoy the walk up, which I would recommend, it took less than 20mins. We stayed around 2 hours which allowed us to enjoy the gardens and half of the galleries on offer (and according to my son there were lots of Pokémon).By the time we left the cars queued to turn into the car park was again way back down Sepulveda Blvd.... my tip is get there early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookatus-havingago
30,Much ado about nothing,"Just like the Getty museum on Pacific Highway, the Getty Center's collections are nothing to write home about. The center is a vast expanse of concrete with subpar everything. Not really worth the trip up that hill, even in a trolley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValayaR

This place sits on top of a hill overlooking LA and may contain some hidden rooms! You can ride the tram or walk to the Getty Center.During the Holiday season this place gets packed! We visited during the golden dragon exhibit. Free admission to all and a magnificent sunset over the ocean. If you google information about the Getty Center you may be surprised about what compels people to go here! From young to old you have to look deeper to know what exactly is going on at this place. Some say there are subliminal things in paintings, lighting, and shadows! Question everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Stunning. Don’t miss this.,"On Boxing Day, we spent five hours at the Getty Center. We could easily have done five more. Exhibits are top notch. The architecture and gardens are inspiring. The setting and views are magnificent.People have already raved about it so I won’t repeat.Here are some suggestions.- if it is at all crowded, Park on the overflow lot just at the bottom of the hill (The “Temple”). You will get in and out much faster.- take the architecture tour. On 45 minutes, you will see things in s completely new way.- plan to view sunset from the balcony just one flour above the main restaurant. Stunner view.- get the free audio guide (iPods). Available in the main lobby.- picnic on the grass by the center gardenAnd don’t miss this place. It was the highlight of our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTSeattle

40,"Outside Five, Inside Three","The buildings and gardens of the Getty are world-class superb. Sadly, most of the great art was already spoken-for when the Getty was built, so the collections are mediocre. There are a couple of nice rooms of near-modern paintings, but that's about it. Occasionally there is an attractive traveling collection that comes by. Go then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162deanm
50,The Getty,"The Getty centre1200 Getty Center Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90049This is an amazing place to visit while in LA. Put it on your To Do list. You will spend at least a couple of hours here and if you're into Art in any way, it is easy to lose yourself for the whole day. The train ride up to the top is great. The architecture, landscaping and sculptures are wonderful and the views are beautiful. And you haven't even started yet.As with most of these establishments, there is a lot of walking around, so you will sleep well that night. I recommend the Getty highly and if I find myself in LA again I will definitely be going back to see what I missed this time.Unfortunately, I don't recommend The Getty if you have young children. Their attention span is not up to it and parents would find themselves rather stressed trying to keep them in line.There are lifts in each building, (the museum consists of 4-5 buildings) and ramps in walking areas so I think people who don't walk too well should be OK. There are places to sit if you need to rest. From what I can remember, wheelchair access is good within the centre but check before you go.I did love the audio guides supplied at the entrance. Make sure one of your group has a form of identification, ie drivers license, passport etc as you will need it to obtain the head sets.There are restrooms, a. restaurant and a cafe. We didn't want a restaurant meal so we opted for the cafe and I was surprised at the range of food on offer there.There is also a well stocked gift shop.And the thing about The Getty that really sets it out from the rest - its free! The parking, the train ride, audio sets and the beautiful museum. All free.You were truely a wonderful man Mr Getty. You left the people an amazing legacy. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatm27

50,Getty visit 12-17-17,"This is one of the most popular places to visit in Los Angeles, and for good reason. The permanent collections are among the best in the country in their various categories (I am particularly fond of the painting collection spanning middle ages to early 20th century). There are also frequent traveling exhibitions that make a visit worthwhile. For example, the current (and sadly soon to close) Golden Kingdoms is spectacular, and the three Caravaggio masterpieces currently on display are worth a trip just by themselves (also closing soon in Feb. 2018). The gardens and view are stunning. For anyone planning even a short trip to Los Angeles, this should be on the agenda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7037ZAjohng

Its changing exhibitions appeal to many tastes. Young families can check out the family room activities. Even if you aren't a big museum fan, the gardens provide year-round beauty. Summer months also feature an outdoor concert series.The best time to visit for spectacular views is on windy days, or just after rain or wind. There are so many stunning vistas. If you don't want to wait for the tram you can walk up the hill.Although you can grab a quick bite while enjoying the views, I enjoy fine dining at The Restaurant at the Getty Center.

Also, the views of Los Angeles from some of the building exits take my breath away/. However, last time I went to the Getty was to see Irises by Vincent Van Gogh again. The Getty did not say how much it paid for the painting, but the previous buyer paid $53.9 million. Usually there's a crowd around the painting, so arrive at opening time (10 am ) for a chance to see it alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/503chelleb

We dined at the more formal restaurant; space was lovely and the cuisine delicious. The highlight of the day.Touring the museum was incredible; amazing collection. The only issue for me is that the collections dwarf the space leaving me a little disappointed. Wayfinding was difficult as well.

50,A MUST visit - a beautiful day that made the visit even more lovely,"I usually don't have much time for the rich and so-called philanthropists (because I think they are usually self-serving at the same time). However, the Getty family has earned my respect.There is no admission fee to the Getty Center. If you drive, the parking fee is $15/vehicle at the base of the hill, where you'd have to take the tram up to the Center.The Center itself is made up of 4 buildings with the gallery/museum in 2 of them. The artefacts and displays are pretty amazing. They housed works of many renowned painters and sculptors and I would recommend taking the tour which highlights some of the exhibits, especially if it is your first time. You would appreciate the displays so much more. It made me want to go back to the exhibits again to mull and absorb the richness of them all as the tour provided just an introduction.Another tour I took was the Architectural tour and again, it made me appreciate what the architects thought and why the design for a certain facet of the building. My biggest take-away was the ""framing"" concept.The grounds were just lovely, so well landscaped and thought through. On a beautiful day, one could spend a whole day walking around, sitting on the lawn and taking in the sights of downtown LA in the distance and the surrounding communities of the well-endowed, like Bel-Air.There are food outlets here so you can have refreshments. There is also a restaurant where people make a point to come dine, I am told (maybe that's why there is free parking after 3pm). We didn't stay till that late and didn't check the restaurant out.A must-see and definitely one that will beckon me for a return visit!Thanks, Getty Foundation for making this available to residents and visitors to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakananginBug
50,"Beautiful, Beautiful!","This is one of the most beautiful museums in the world. The collections, grounds, architecture, everything is beautiful. Three hours were not enough to cover all the galleries so choose wisely if you don’t have much time. We will return on our next visit to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLJSF
50,First Time To The Getty,"Never could I imagine a more pristine , safe and interesting museum staging the world’s finast! This is a must visit in anyone’s lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145chazm
50,Wonderful place - outside & in,The Getty Center is a wonderful museum/art gallery atop a hill overlooking LA. The buildings & courtyards are modern and gorgeous. So much to see that every visit could be different. Took in the Hockney exhibit and Impressionist galleries. Lots of 'must see' paintings and many that are less well-known but nonetheless wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzb2014
50,Beautiful museum and Garden,"A must see. Love coming to the Getty! Beautiful gardens and wonderful art and exhibits. As a photographer I spent most of my time outdoors taking in the architecture and flowers, but the inside is fantastic as well. A place you can come back to again and again and not see everything. Highly recommend this for everyone of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geekette92064
50,the grounds are better than the collection USUALLY,"I've been the The Getty Center many, many times. However, usually I would say the grounds are nicer than the collection...especially when California isn't under drought lockdown and all of their beautiful fountains are full and bubbling.I especially love walking down into the gardens, meandering along the decomposed granite pathways between modern looking steel and succulent plantings in the shade of trees. Large, grassy areas are available for picnicing, which is really nice when you have kiddos with you (and one of my main complaints about the Huntington...but I won't go there here.)However, I have to say that on my last visit I was BLOWN AWAY by the exhibit on Ancient American Gold. It will be on exhibit for a few more months, so definitely visit while it's there because it is amazing.One word of warning: the stone around the central fountain area is slippery in my opinion. I've had members of my party fall before. Be sure to walk carefully or, better yet, wear shoes with good traction.Wishing you love and romance,Aviva Vaughnauthor of slow burn women's fiction inspired by food, travel, and Jane Austen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvivaVaughnAuthor
50,collection improves every year,"When the Getty first opened we went for the architecture and a few collections. Today the collection and traveling shows I would consider first class. They have a regular tour of ""the best of the collection"" which is a good introduction for those who are visiting for the first time in order to get a feel for the collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expectquality1942
50,Fantastic place,The Getty is a first rate museum. The folks running it know what they are doing. It is beautiful and the collection is outstanding. This place is a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3402IRpeterf
50,Worth the trip,The Getty Center is a free art museum and worth visiting. It has a beautiful view of Los Angeles. It is quite a hike from the parking garage to the museum. Good only if capable and want an exercise. There is a tram that will take you up. You have to pay to park. I took a cab. I enjoyed the photographs and drawings that were on exhibit. They also had Van Gogh's Irises and Manet's Spring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyhJ5459UI
50,LOVED IT!,"I could list an endless amount of reasons to come but to put it simply, its just really really beautiful. The exhibits and especially the garden tour are AMAZING and colorful!I would definitely go again, especially in the spring and summer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sswayy
50,"Great grounds, great views and fantastic array of Arts","Easy parking, $10 after 3 pm, free admission on Sunday. The structure of the buildings are art in itself, the views are just fantastic, specially at sunset time. You need the full day to enjoy it, so don’t rush your self or be short on time. Few places to rest in between and have lunch or drinks. The art is just one of a kind. Many famous artist from all over the world including the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684

50,amazing,amazing architecture and park. the museum are very complete and detailed. it was all free or charge and yet very well maintained. beautiful place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stellalarissa
50,It's FREE and FUN,"Even if you don't look at any art, the tram up is an experience all by itself. The archecture is beautiful and views of LA just as beautiful. The garden and the lawns are worth a stroll-through and maybe a picnic. During the summer, there are nights of live music or dj with dancing. Those are my favorite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YazMaTaz
50,What a wonderful place,"This was my first time at the Getty Center and I will come back. What a wonderful place for adults and kids. First I love that in this day and age you don't pay an entrance. Yes you pay for parking but compared to other museums like this in the world, it is fantastic. Kids have fun and get exposed to art and culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigA1999
50,Loved showing the kids an adventure,"The Getty museum is a great place to take young children and open their minds up to a world of architecture, art and adventure the tram is fun, the maze is cool and the activities are great for the kids will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cordica1
50,Incredible - stayed for hours!,"I strongly recommend visiting the Getty Centre, and allowing hours to explore the artwork of the temporary and permanent exhibitions.I loved the contrast of the modern architecture of the building and the artwork and sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NStewart100
50,Amazing. Overwhelming. Sit outside for awhile!,"The Getty Center is huge: exhibits, gardens, architecture. Recommend choosing a single exhibit for each visit; it's just too overwhelming to do more than one, given the size and scope of everything (BIG!). Requires multiple visits to truly appreciate it. Worth going just to sit outside and enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholeb651
50,Better than my high expectations,"AMAZING. Inspiring worth the visit. From the tram ride from the parking to the museum, to the Picasso, Renoir, Degas, and Rembrandt’s, they were all memorable and exciting.In just one room of hundreds at the museum, the impressionist masters on display must be worth half a billion dollars.The Getty complex is huge. It is one a promontory overlooking LA. The buildings are modern works of art themselves.Plus admission is FREE. Parking is $15 but admission and tours are free. If you haven’t gone and have a few free hours in LA, visit the Getty center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/756stevenm
40,Worth a visit (it's FREE); except for parking,"The Getty Center has multiple attractions to view in several different building with beautiful gardens. We visited primarily for the ""Golden Kingdom"" exhibit which is a visiting exhibit but there are numerous other exhibits to see along with the gardens. Admission is free with the exception of parking which was $15. If you chose to eat at the Center, I felt the prices were a little high but might be reasonable for Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LtColD
50,Beautiful views of the city and Beautiful architecture,This place is truly amazing. The best views of the city and the architecture is breathtaking. All I can say is YOU MUST VISIT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glamris
40,location was breathtaking.,disappointed the gardens were not open on that day due to exterminating.choice of art exhibition was poor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293mimi
50,Whoa,"Nominally, the Getty Center is an art museum, but in reality, it is a center of culture, with features ranging from gardens to architecture to a restaurant. For me personally, the highlight was the amazing surroundings. I was awestruck by the stunning architecture, with pools and fountains dotting the floor of the sprawling complex. Even if you, like me, know little about architectonics, you cannot help but snapping out of staring in amazement at the pure white buildings that hold so much world renowned art.And the art! There is much variety, something for everyone, from ancient Mesoamerican artifacts to Argentinean photography to famed paintings, even some contemporary works. You are bound to find something that appeals and speaks to you. Lastly, the views were great on a smog-free day, and a large portion of the Los Angeles area is within view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drrkbrnng
50,"Extensive, Diverse, and Impressive","My sister in L.A suggested this. We spent the entire afternoon there. We barely covered it. Most impressive was the Gold Kingdoms exhibit, a story of ancient American civilizations primarily before the European intrusion. The Argentine photo exhibit was great too. We spent a lot of time in the outdoor gardens, well conceived with much variety and almost impeccable arrangements. We will return to see most of the rest the next time we are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamdT5357XT
30,Sadly only had a very short time,it seems like a fab place - but keep in mind you can not see it properly in less then 2 hrs! you need at least a whole morning or a whole afternoon. If not a whole day! It is massive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syeda409
50,Amazing place!,On of the most beautiful and restful places in LA! I really enjoy my staying there! Very nice people are working there! And it's also nice that entrance is free. But it's a bit hard get there if you are not driving! But anyway! Schedule your visit the Getty! One of my fav artwork of Van Gogh is there!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9030FO_
50,So glad ti visit,"We have been to California many times and have driven past the Getty Center, actually being Naive and not knowing what it is? So we came and was excited that it was an art gallery with Paintings and sculptures that go back centuries. The building design itself is wonderful, there is a train that takes you from the car park, if you arrive after 3pm the parking is only $10 We had a free wheel chair to get us around as I was on crutches, the Gallery was open to very late, we would have stayed longer but we were getting cold and didn't have jackets, live music and actives for children to do. Gorgeous Gardens that we viewed from above, so arrive early and spend the whole day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellejeanette
50,Tram ride up the mountain,"Love everything about this place!!! Art exhibits, floral gardens, cafes, park picnic area. The art experience starts in the tram area. Take the short time to explore the garden exhibits for the tram ride. One of the better Van Gogh and Monet exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olands2016
50,A Museum to visit ahain and again,"The architecture of the MuseumIs fantastic. You must leave your car in the parking lot and then take a shuttle to the museum. Both the parking lot and the shuttle are easy to find.Once you get to the actual museum, in the outside you can admire the buildings, the gardens, the sights of the city, ...The museum is divided in 4 sections, plus the temporary exhibitions. Lots of masterpieces!!!You do not need to visit everything at a time. You can returnon different dates since entrance is free.The restaurant and café are good and not very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeresaPG

50,Great place to spend a few hours or a whole day,We had so much fun here. A great location with wonderful views over LA. We were very fortunate to see the David Hockney exhibit which was amazing. Found it a little confusing to find our way around even with a map! Make sure you stop by the gift store,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbunny

50,"Incredible views and ""Screen Saver"" Picture Opps","Went here right about sunset and the views were amazing, and tons of spots for incredible views ad photo opps. Museum quality is excellent, worthwhile exhibits and helpful staff. Place is keep very clean and trams run back and forth from buildings to parking garage every 5 minutes or so.

50,Views and more,"Review based on outside areas only, we did not Go in the gallery, came here primarily for the gardens and views and we were very impressed. Immaculate public areas, free train to the top, panoramic photo opportunities of LA. Gardens lovely and not too crowded. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparklehorseEngland
50,Amazing and highly recommended,I highly recommend a visit to the Getty Museum. It is an oasis in a busy city. The exhibits were terrific.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonkX9694QI
50,Love this place,"The Getty Center is relaxed, the views are wonderful, and it's a great way to spend time with anyone young or old. Admission is free, parking is affordable, sometimes they have nice temporary exhibits, and they do have a regular collection of European art that is fun to look at. I'd say the garden is probably the highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonbV2957DW
30,Beautiful place but not a great museum,"Its a really relaxing place with beautiful neo architecture . The museum? well , don't expect any Louvre or British Museum in here . Its more a museum to give you an idea of what European art can be . Some Flemish painter if I remember correctly , some french 1700 century furniture ...and that's about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tudorc923
50,A must when in SoCal!,How can such a great have free entrance? We spent two hours and thats far from enough. Will return. Buildings are spectacular! Interior is filled with great and a few crazy objects. Spend at least four hours!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonasr890
50,Not to be missed!,Amazing museum in a spectacular location. Beautiful grounds and so much art to see. The sculpture gardens were gorgeous and the views of downtown LA and the Pacific were amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632deirdreh
50,Meme the art,My boyfriend took me here for my first time. I'd never heard of the getty and didn't know what to expect. He had been here before but told me never inside?? Wasn't sure what he meant by that until we got there. Parking was a little bit of a struggle but the fact that's all you pay for I didn't mind the struggle. I've never been to a museum that charge you at least 50 bucks to get in. When we first got there we found a nice grassy area to sit down that over looked L.A. We ate some food we brought with us. Wish we had brought a bottle of wine. Then we walked around the garden which was kinda small but still beautiful. Finally I wanted to venture in doors and see some art. It was pretty cool. We started taking pics and putting our own captions on some of the art work which turned into a game of who could do the best meme. It was a fun day and a good place to go for a date.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream738259
50,Art showcased at its finest,The Getty never fails to amaze. The ease of access to incredible art is not to be missed. Make sure to plan for a whole day to truly get everything out of the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1L2N3
40,Clear day in LA,"3 generations including 10 and 12-year-olds enjoyed much of a day at the Getty. Highlight was the special exhibit of early Latin American artworks, illustrating how civilized the Americas were prior to its ""discovery"" by Europeans. Too bad much of that was lost.Signage could have been better, it required using their paper maps to plan how to visit the various galleries. While the audio segments were good, the lack of control of the (free) devices for providing information made them difficult to use. I'm an IT pro and figured most things out, but the time should be spent viewing exhibits, not playing around with devices that are by no means intuitive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhxSpeak
50,Beautiful place to visit,The grounds here are amazing and relaxing. I recommend coming and just enjoying your day. The outside gardens are so pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pasa5
50,Beautiful Grounds!,"I visited Getty Center in March and June of 2016. This is one of the top LA attractions and I somehow managed to not get here until I spent 6 months living in SoCal.My parents enjoy art museums, so I had to take them here when they came to visit me in LA in March. On that initial trip, we spent a lot of time in the museum checking out the actual art, but did take a peek at the lovely grounds.My friends from NY were in town a few months later and I was trying to think of unique things to do with them for the full day we were spending together. On this visit we did the free Garden/grounds tour since they were less into art. I really enjoyed learning about the gardens as is find them very gorgeous and so unique compared to what I grew up with in NY.Parking is somewhat limited at the museum, so it's probably best to try to arrive here close to opening time unless you enjoy circling the garage.There is no admission to the museum, but it's $15 to park. Not a bad deal if you have a car load of 4!A lot of the art here consisted of recreations, my husband says it's like the Hollywood version of a museum.I'm not an art fanatic in anyway, but this place does not compare to art meccas like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. It's still worth coming here though, the grounds, architecture and views will impress you.Here are my favorite things about the museum:1. The architecture - It is impressive! The design of the buildings are beautiful. In fact, you can take a free architecture tour of the building, I recommend it if that sounds interesting to you.2. The grounds and gardens - The gardens are stunning and I really enjoyed poking around through them. There are many great photo ops.3. The views - This is contingent on the famous LA smog though. When I came here in March, I believe it had rained the day before. We were here on a windy, but sunny day and we could see down to at least Manhattan Beach. However, when I came here in June, the views weren't as great.I would recommend spending anywhere from 2-5 hours here. The art collections are sizable and the property itself is large.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
50,"The art, the architecture and the views are all amazing.","Lives up to the hype with amazing art from a variety of periods, places and styles. The temporary exhibits were all interesting and complemented the permanent collection. Plus the views from the terraces of the LA area are amazing from the ocean to Downtown. Be prepared to walk a lot but it's worth it. Get there early if visiting at a busy time to avoid parking hassles. Will take more than one visit to really see it all and appreciate everything there is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BocaOpa
50,a must,"a great art collection from all over the world. intersting exebition, lovely gardens, fantastic view over los angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holaguapa3
50,Free! Seriously?! Yes! No excuse to miss the great Getty!,"This is for the Getty Center (not the Villa). Our circumstances meant that we only had a few hours in the afternoon here but could happily have spent more - guides helped us focus on our interests. Go for the art, the architecture or the gardens - all equally impressive. When you need a break, you can easily find a quiet spot here just to take in the views. Still can't get over that this is all FREE (except for very reasonable parking fee)! Thanks, Mr. Getty!Tips:- Check the website first for parking info! We arrived ~1:30 pm and there were not many spots left, though people were starting to leave. Public transit is recommended and likely a very good option. Tram service to Center is well managed and fast.- Docent advised that school field trips generally come through in the a.m. and leave ~ 1 PM, if you are looking for quieter visit- Pay attention to hours of eating facilities; depending on day/season you may have all or nothing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImaginAVL
40,"Free, Classy, Artistic","Accessible through Metro, one can spend a whole day here strolling through the art galleries at a leisurely place. Take the tram to the top but also walkable. Nice ambience, better pack your own lunch as choice for snack/lunch is very limited. Impeccably maintained and galleries are revised frequently. An excellent contribution to citizens and visitors alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller_uk555
50,Treat Yourself to a Sunset at The Getty,This is my favorite museum. It is such a beautiful setting and a great way to spend a day. The exhibits are always interesting and the galleries house an impressive collection. If you can time your visit to be there when the sun is setting as it is a rewarding experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c-shell71

The gallriees are beautiful - not the most oustanding collection but very enjoyable for an art lover",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14judiths
50,This place is a Gift to Humanity!,"The Getty Center is simply extraordinary in every way, I can't get enough of the place and I make a point to visit every time I am in Los Angeles. On my latest visit, I joined two guided tours: Collection Highlights Tour, and Architectural Tour. Both tours were one hour and hosted by very knowledgeable volunteer docents. The physical setting is stunning with gorgeous vistas from the beautiful buildings and grounds, and of course the museum collection is endlessly fascinating. I am just stunned at the beauty of this place and the gift to humanity it represents. The Getty Trust spent almost $1.5 billion on the structures alone. Admission and tours are free. Parking is $15 but The Getty is accessible by public transit (the bus comes right to the entrance, and if you show your TAP transit ticket in the gift shop you get 10% off). The gift shop, by the way, is also excellent. The cafe is big, bright, and serves a wide range of food options, reasonably priced. Plan to spend several hours. Do not miss this extraordinary place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
50,"Beautiful museum, great changing exhibits","The museum itself is absolutely breathtaking, and is the most ""LA"" museum experience one could imagine. I must confess that I became engrossed in the Argentina photo exhibit and didn't see much else during my visit, but that exhibit warrants at least an hour. If you've spent any time in Argentina, you'll appreciate that it shows some of the country outside of just Buenos Aires, and acknowledges the erasure of indigenous culture that's common in most representations of Argentina.I visited with friends who were also quite taken with the impressionist art, though I can't vouch for it myself.One last suggestion: if you have a few minutes, grab a snack or a coffee and sit out on the terrance to get some sun and enjoy the view. Definitely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209ashleyb
50,excellent,"You might find circling around to find a parking spot in early afternoon hours. You just pay $15 parking fee and the museum is free. The art collection is amazing, but the location and the design of the Center in itself is worth the visit. You get the panoramic views of the city from several vintage points. We spent here nearly 4 hrs, so 3 hrs would be a must -including taking the train to the Center from the parking lot .I liked the fact that I could take pics of the art. A real plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubuli32
50,Very Nice,I came here with a group from a hostel that I was staying at. I made a last minute decision to join the group 5 minutes before they were about to depart. That last minute decision turned out to be well worth it. The building itself was very facinating and there are more amazing views of Los Angeles. The central garden is also amazing and defintely an excellent photo opportunity. Don't forget to bring your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
40,Perfect place for art lovers,"You will be finding a rich collection of arts yet don't need to pay a penny seeing them. Parking is not free though. Taking tram doesn't take quite a while, so walking up is also a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirklandTom

50,This is incredible if you like art,"15$ for parking and free entrance to the museum. It takes 5min from the parking up the hill by a tram they provide. There was a nice view of the hills and some friendly deers staring at us when we took the tram.Incredible architectural buildings contained by all sorts of art like sculptures, paintings, all sorts of antiques from different centuries and modern art. There were several buildings containing all this art, there was a lot to see. The view outside is also stunning. Beautiful 360 degrees view of LA, downtown, city and the sea. The garden they have made is exotic and so pretty. The whole place is so clean and quiet, you will find an other type of silence compared to the city. We had lunch at the cafe up there and they had good sandwich and potato soup. There is also a restaurant if you want more fancy food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nir089
50,Great architecture Stunning LA views,This is of course a must see in LA. The buildings are spectacular. The access now is brilliant with a car park a distance away and a complimentary 5 minute tram ride to the door. The views all around are amazing. Inside the permanent art finishes at 1900. Mr Getty didn’t like paintings or sculptures after that period. We did enjoy the great 1850-1900 French impressionist section. The current exhibition of Gold and Luxury from Central and South America is a must see. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
50,Beautiful museum,"Great art collection. Wonderful architecture. And the views are breathtaking. The tram between the parking and the museum is so cool. In the end, you just pay for parking. $15 before 3pm and $10 after. Totally recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanazul

50,Gorgeous site. Great Collections.,My wife and I recently spent a few hours at the Getty and were blown away by both the site and the art. You need to plan on spending several hours to fully explore the Getty. It is amazing. And it's free. Unbelievable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eric22754
50,Continues to amaze,This is my 3rd time and I continue to be amazed. World class art. World class views. Good reasonable cafe food and cool gift shop. It's FREE!This is a must see and rivals all of the world's great museums.A must see for anyone who enjoys art. Go for an hour just to enjoy the building and gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vancouvergirl
50,A Must See Sight by LAX,"If you are in the LAX/UCLA area, make a stop at the Getty! It is free, although parking costs. A tram takes you from the lot to the center and once there, you will be astounded by the openness of the architecture and delighted by the travertine stone, which emits different tones when thumped! The cafeteria offers delightful variety of food and outdoor seating (along with a large indoor area). The day we were there lots of school kids were being taken through, no doubt a standard school field trip - all were nicely behaved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2749LAscottp
50,Excellent Value as it is Free,Exhibits are somewhat focused as they tend to have more of the complementary artists rather than iconic exhibits of just the primary artists in a style. They give a good introduction to some lesser known styles. Reasonable balance of popular and more obscure exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billiamaquaace
50,WOW!,What an amazing experience! Absolutely breathtaking art and just a nice place to walk around. Definitely worth looking into even if only once in your lifetime!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinbN2312WF
50,Extraordinary Experience,"Of all our adventures in Hollywood and Los Angeles, this was our favorite experience. What an incredible opportunity to view the actual masterpieces of classical and contemporary artists. The garden was a lovely walk although it would be a more fulfilling experience if the flora names were indicated. The facility was bright and clean, well marked and easy to tour. Parking is $15 and the tram ride to the facilities is short and organized. There is a lot of walking as the buildings are spread over a wide area. However, the Getty is structured so it is easy to go from one building to the next via bridges between each facility. Take advantage of the audio tour if you wish to learn more about particular artists and their works. We spent a little over three hours at The Center. Highly recommend making a visit to The Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDM137
50,Unforgettable eye opening experience,"I have been going to the Getty Centre for many years partly because my wife is a docent ( and has been for many years ) , but mostly because its a museum with a difference ; there is to my mind , nowhere else in the world quite like itIt combines a fabulous setting , brilliant logistics and organisation , a marvellous selection of paintings , photographs ,sculpture and all surrounded by their mind blowing gardensTo top it all off , they have a first class restaurant with panoramic view of the surrounding area of LAWorth every "" penny """,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELLINGMAN538

50,A great way to spend a beautiful LA day,"The art is amazing but wondering around outside is just as good. It was actually hard to go inside, as the views of LA are magnificent and the buildings, grounds and gardens are work of art themselves!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elebau
50,What a gem of an art museum!,"Before looking on Trip Advisor for things to do in Los Angeles, I had never heard of The Getty Center. After reading the reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to visit the museum. WE WERE BLOWN AWAY by its beauty and what it has to offer! We spent about five hours at The Getty Center and learned a lot about art during an orientation tour! Best of all, it is free!!! And you don't have to be a lover of art to enjoy this beautiful museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayley2016

50,I wish I had more time!,"Went here on Veteran's Day- I was amazed by the sheer size of the center and the stunning views of Los Angeles that it offered. That was *before* we went in to look at the exhibits- WOW!As a consummate defender of the East Coast's attractions, museums being principal among these- I have to say, I was surprised by how beautiful and engaging the collections at the Getty are.For those among us who live life on our phones in the age of social media- if you need a new selfie for Instagram, go to one of the scenic overlooks. You won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500RD
50,Great architecture and art work,I really enjoyed this visit to the Getty Center. The surrounding is so peaceful and lovely. And I love the art work at display. It is really worth spending a day there. There are a few restaurants to choose from and we had a lovely lunch there. I also learn a bit more about the history of the Getty Center and the Getty family. A good history lesson for our family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oppsa
50,Fabulous museum and great location,"While the permanent collection does not rival older museums in Europe and New York, special exhibits can be wonderful. The setting is breathtaking.

50,Better than the Smithsonian,"As a Washingtonian, I border on blasphemy saying this, but the Getty was better than the National Gallery. GASP. The exhibits were phenomenal (including the photography one about Argentina--Americans should take note of history right now!), but the architecture was breathtaking. As were the views; I think you could see all of LA from there. The Getty is a ways from most of the city, but it's well worth the visit. And it's free, so you're really only pay for the Lyft ride to and from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vonettay

50,One word: beautiful.,"J. Paul Getty was certainly an interesting man. On his grandson's kidnapping: ""In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million.When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million—the maximum that would be tax deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest.""The gardens and musical stones are the thing here. We like art and there is certainly plenty here to like for others who do but for us it was all about the beautiful gardens and hilltop views. It's a bit like hanging out at your billionaire uncle's social gathering and I highly recommend making time to spend a couple of hours here at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wulfgang66

Of special interest was the one featuring ancient treasurers of South America, of the Aztecs and of the Mayans. The buildings are of travertine and stunningly beautiful. An unusual garden sunk into a pool is particularly appealing. The restaurant fare is well prepared and delicious and the dining area is ample. There are brochures at the entrance available in Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French, Japanese and Russian, maybe more that I might not have seen.

From the tram ride to the top, the view, the wiliness of the staff to assist. This is not just another place just to hang art. When your in LA, if you visit only one museum, make it the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467harth
50,"Out of LA, while in LA","Situated on a mountaintop, the Getty has amazing views from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean. It is designed for meandering and exploring. Dynamic architecture, inviting gardens and world class art collections are only three reasons to visit. There’s an excellent fine dining restaurant and equally good cafeteria. If it’s a beautiful day, as it usually is, take your food outside. Free admission. And don’t miss the sister property at the Pacific ocean, called the Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAPHIL310
40,Best views of LA on the backdrop of beautifully kept gardens,"This is one of our top free things to do in Los Angeles because of the views of LA's skyscrapers, the art, and the beautifully kept gardens.Visitors get to the top by means of a free modern three-car, cable-pulled hover train funicular that offers incredible views on the way up!Pick up a set of headphones for a free full audio tour of the artwork and the building, the displays are really interesting and creative.If you're vegan, the Getty Center restaurant has a vegan burger and fries in their restaurant. One of the staff members serving the food did make a derogatory comment about veganism, but it's simply a matter of mis-education, it didn't ruin the experience but we did mark down a star as a result.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtwmagazine

Thousands of ORIGINAL works from all the famous artists, including VanGogh, Renoir, Monet, Matisse, and every other person non-art-history-me has ever heard of.If you want to see more multi-million dollar art than you could ever hope to see, go to the Getty. I've been visiting since it opened, every time I'm in town.The architecture! As a rock nerd, and an astronomy nerd, I am enthralled by the vision that led to it's creation.

50,Hard to beat free,"it all starts with a short monorail ride up the hill overlooking a portion of Los Angeles .when you enter the lobby look around and notice the glass walls that separate the lobby from the courtyard and the museums, those floor to ceiling curricular walls slide out of the way and cost $1,000,000 each. Go through the lobby and be sure to look at the garden to your right and below before going into any of the museums .everything is done with good taste and class and as you look at thew architecture you will begin to understand why the buildings cost over $1,000,000,000 (yes that is billion)be sure to look at the baseboards in the room with all the fireplaces and marvel that they are not really original with the fireplace but wood painted to match the fireplace .There are so many secrets of the museum that very few people know such as the wall paper in some rooms cost more then $1,000,000. depending upon what exhibits are being exhibited there is usually something to pique everyone's interest i particularly like the exhibits where the patron is involved in physically performing some of the tasks.All in all it is an outstanding value and well worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183matthewl
50,Awe inspiring and magnificent and humbling,"The Getty is truly one of the greatest Art museums in the world.. not only art but architecture as well.

You are immediately struck by the vista of the surrounding LA basin from the mountains to the sea. The architecture is breathtaking, the gardens are pristine and modern. The collection of Grand Masters art is certainly impressive for a private collection, but it ain't the Louvre. Plan on spending 3 or 4 hours of wandering and exploring. Consider a docent tour. Bring a picnic. It's just a wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBGrandBanks

50,Class All the Way,"The Getty, as the title states, is Class personified. I went, I thought, for the art and was instead treated to the visual delight of being in and outside a space like I've never before experienced. It was a lovely day in the latter part of October, and so the draw to be outside predominated - first with the water features in the courtyard and then extending on into the lower gardens. The Getty is as close to perfection as any architecture/gardens/museum I've ever had the good fortune to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judijon
50,Museum PLUS,"The architecture (both buildings and landscape) are amazing here. You arrive via the infamous 405. Pay $15 to park deep in the bowels of the mountain (there is no fee to visit the Getty, just parking). Then take a tram (or walk, if you're so inclined) to the top of the hill. What a vista! You can see the ocean, complete with shipping activity, the Catalina Islands, etc - and the entire city laid out before you. Take your binoculars. Gardens are immaculate, and the buildings absolutely beautiful inside and out. I'm not really a museum person, but I've been here more than once, which is saying something. For this visit, we saw the special exhibit ""Golden Kingdoms"", and used the audio headset/smartphone devices that are available for free to those willing to surrender their ID temporarily. It was an overwhelming experience! Unless you're a die hard museum goer with iron feet, you won't be able to see everything in even two visits. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345
50,Fantastic!,"Wow! I’ve lived in Orange County 6 months and just visited The Getty. It was breathtaking. The architecture, the views, the exhibits, the grounds, everything picture perfect.

From there, you boarded a tram to go to the top of the mountain. A scenic ride up. At the top was a scenic view of Studio City, and on towards Los Angelos, and of course, the 405 Freeway.Inside was a variety of exhibits and a list of free tours. We took the Garden tour. There we learned about the architect for the gardens and the building. Our guide guides up and around and all over, explaining the history.Excellent tour and the others probably equally as good. You could stay as long as you wanted, or until closing. The restaurant is closed during the week during time school is open.

40,A well-kept secret and the price is right!,"What’s Not to like? Located high atop a hill and accessible by tram, the views are stunning and not to be missed, the architecture and art displays are exquisite and the price is right. The architect of the Getty Center is an award-winning, highly regarded visionary who captured the imagination of the man whose vast art collections are housed here but who, himself, passed away prior to it’s completion .We took in a couple of guided tours and an Introductory 10-min video clip, worth much more than the price of admission, which, in this case, was free! Our guides as well as all of the staff w/ whom we spoke to or interacted with, were friendly and helpful. As an added bonus, the soup and sandwiches we had for lunch in the cafe downstairs were healthy and hearty, if not a bit on the pricy side. All in all, we were very happily surprised, rather than disappointed, w/ the choice we had made to spend our first day in LA.its a good adult alternative to Disneyland and a great way to educate oneself in an entertaining and interactive fashion, while still being able to enjoy the fabulous LAweather and the spectacular, surrounding scenery.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyl585

We were only able to see half of the permanent exhibits while we were there. Must go back our next visit. Free admission. Only $15 parking fee per car.

Actually there are the „Golden Kingdoms of South America“ besides others to explore. Magnificient and well explained. Even our teenie daughter was fascinated. Furthermore the area is worth to visit; you can sitting relaxed in the coffee with a impecable view to the city and the sea or you can stroll around the dozens of outlooks or terraces and look for the best picture point.

Parking is easy--remember to take your ticket with you--and it's a pleasant ride to the top. Good food options, orientation film, phone charging station, complimentary umbrellas to use for hot, sunny days, and a very nice gift shop. We will visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethGT
50,Great way to spend a day,"If you like art or scenery, you should definitely go to the Getty Center. The buildings and views are amazing. The staff is helpful, and it's basically free. Parking costs, and the food's expensive; so fill the car with people and pack a lunch.We went on a Saturday when there were excellent performances of traditional Latin American dance and music. I will be returning as soon as possible to see more art that I did not get to see because we were so busy with the special exhibits and productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/001Slo
50,Excellent! I cannot recommend it highly enough.,"We had 24hours in LA and felt that the Getty Centre was a must. We were not disappointed. We arrived by car and paid 16$ to park so I imagined that this was going to be part of an expensive visit. I couldn't have been more wrong as that was the only fee. Even the cafe was very moderately priced which was impressive given we were a captive audience. We went by dedicated train up to the centre - very easy - and this took us straight to the centre. It is so impressive. Wonderful artworks, fantastically organised, beautiful gardens and the architectural design is truly outstanding. There are views of the whole of LA all the way to the sea on a clear day. It was very hot the day we visited but the centre provides umbrellas for shade if you need it.This is a fabulous place to visit and I cannot recommend it highly enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jps7
50,Exceptional,"The Getty is likely the best designed museum in the world from the traffic flow/parking to the layout of the museum buildings, dining choices and gardens. As county residents we feel particularly blessed to have such a free resource in our area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,Spectacular,A gorgeous facility with breathtaking views -- the room with the Impressionist paintings is not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewW878
50,A beautiful setting for art,"Just a great LA experience. Art, gorgeous gardens, sculpture, architecture and more. Many rooms of paintings from different eras. W at your walking shoes. Train ride is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/103jerryf
50,A modern acropolis atop LA,"The Getty is situated in the most stunning setting for any art-museum complex, high on a hill, overlooking downtown LA, like the Acropolis overlooking Athens. Set off from any other surrounding buildings, the beautiful modern design is an architectural jewel. The size and layout of the complex offers a cool, serene environment. When the sun glares down, the free loaner umbrellas offer a welcome shade when strolling around the gardens. The permanent collection is beautiful, and a variety of changing exhibitions offer the returning visitor plenty of choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeW42
50,Art,We had a few hours to do something In L.A. and we wanted to see this museum. We had a great time in the little bit of time we had. If you visit make sure you try and take the day. we will be back to tour the beautiful place again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacieP301
50,Excellent place !!,There is so much to experience here that we didn’t even get to everything !! The grounds alone are breathtaking !! The exhibits were very lovely and well done. I will be back !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyfeet97
50,World Class Museum in my own Backyard!,"For me, this is the best museum in the entire SoCal region and perhaps one of the best in the world! Richard Meier’s architecture is breathtaking as it feels like a modern American interpretation of the Acropolis in Athens, right down to the stone work and its hilltop location (which can be accessed by a cool tram or walking uphill if you want some exercise)! The gardens are lovely and the plants are works of art in their own right. The art collection is superb of course as many famous artists are present including Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Renoir. There were some great temporary exhibitions when I was there revolving around ancient Mesoamerican art, Argentinian photography, and city planning in Latin America from the 19th and 20th centuries. Best of all, with the exception of parking, it’s free!! So if you want to save some money while also taking in some culture, this museum is absolutely essential for locals and tourists alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Always a great place to visit,"Great views of Los Angeles, rotating art shows. Just a nice way to hang out and spend a day. I enjoyed the children's area and the nice lawn below the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestCoastRestless
50,beautiful inside and out,"Great artwork to see and beautifully displayed, lovely location and architecture. Well organized Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaghoul
50,Must Visit,Absolutely marvellous place to visit whether you are interested in the art or not!Free entry and a reasonable parking charge make it excellent value.Once parked you can either wait for the train or walk up the hill - either is good.Numerous places to get a coffee or lunch or you can just stroll through the gardens to view the architecture and get breathtaking views over Los Angeles and the Sepulveder Pass.Also lots of art!Don’t miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777charnic
50,Simply Breathtaking,"Stopped here a few years ago for just a couple of hours and had to return for a day trip. I was mostly enamored by the stunning architecture, the serene gardens, and the breathtaking views, more so than the art displays, which, of course, are all first rate. The staff, including security guards, all seem to love their jobs and are very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The cafe food is fresh, delicious, and fairly priced. Suggest a full day in order to really see and appreciate everything. You have to pay for parking, but entry to the Center is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/archman8
40,Beautiful,Parking is $15 and included in the entrance fee. Free if you are there for only an hour. Beautiful garden area and the exhibits were ok but not earth shattering for me. Get there early to avoid the crowds. Otherwise you will be fighting not only tourists but also the bus loads of students.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56003Richard
50,"Great museum, great views, great deal","The Getty was truly amazing and is a must see if you have a spare few hours. The sheer size and breadth of the art collection is amazing. We are not big museum people, but this was so worth seeing and experiencing. The walkways between the buildings have tremendous views of the LA area, and the signage helps you identify what you are seeing.As far as the galleries themselves there is a huge variety and depth of art. It is amazing that an individual could have assembled this much and then committed to basically giving it to the public for viewing. Then the gardens outside are also very pleasant to experience. Really beautifully done.It only costs $15 to park and then there is no admittance fee. What a great deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHartMich
50,World class museum & garden,"IF you are into museums and gardens, there is more here than you can see in a day. From the parking on it is well organized and lots of folks there to help you find your way. Tours of certain areas available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
50,Stunningly beautiful museum,"I have wanted to go here for years. It did not disappoint. Taking the tram up to the top was fun. Collections were very nice and well ordered, so you're not wandering around wondering if you hit every gallery. The outdoor space is spectacular. I liked how you left one gallery, went outside, went in again. Beautiful integration of indoor and outdoor. Gardens were spectacular. Loved the special Hockney exhibit. Just wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfitz695
50,Outstanding!,A most memorable experience. Mind boggling architecture. Staff was everywhere ready to assist you. Not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasa392
50,Amazing!,"Been here twice in past five years-beautiful all around. Didn't tour this fall as renovations or changes going on. The building itself is stunning! So many ornate details, beautiful craftsmanship. Of course the pieces they have on display are incredible! Take your camera, too. Enjoy the grounds outside, which are carefully landscaped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreqTrav704
50,AMAZING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS OR ENTIRE DAY,"OOOOH MY GOSH...what an amazing experience. Entrance is free but the parking is $15 per car. (or was when we went several months ago) and what you get is: a breath-taking view from different angles of Los Angeles from the ocean to downtown. You get great, fresh air - gorgeous grounds (go yourself, bring a book and relax in one of the many places that are so very gorgeous to sit and relax.). This is the kind of place that when you go you feel there really still are beautiful and wondrous things in this world. There is a super cafeteria with great food for lunch and is casual and reasonably priced. There is also an AMAZING dining room with the same awesome view that is worth checking out online first because of pricing. It was great when we were there about a year or so ago.This is truly a must see when in the Los Angeles area - or live with a reasonable driving distance. The artwork needs at least 2-21/2 hours to see and the grounds at least an hour. This is if you don't like to linger. If you do like to really take the beauty of it all ""in"", than...well...you could really spend the entire day. Also...the gift shop is wonderful!Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
50,Wonderful,A serene and beautiful place to visit even without going inside!Add the exhibits and you have one of the best museums I have visited. We spent 5 hours there and still didn't get to see most of the beautiful gardens.Good restaurant with many choices and room enough to find a table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK511
40,Trip to the Museum,Free admission but just a $15 fee for parking ( no charge for cabs). Enjoy the tram ride up the mountain and the gardens and museum buildings. Plan on 2 or more hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmojo48
50,My Happy Place,"At varying points in life, different collections speak to me, but the decorative arts and photography exhibits never fail. The terraces and gardens are exceptional places to stop the madness of life, write, photograph, or just be still.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705katherinee
50,Lots to see,"This museum has plenty to see, I was personally surprised to find so much European furniture from Royal estates. It was also excellent to see Van Gogh and Monet paintings in person. The layout of the museum was a bit of a nightmare, no simple route to see everything, felt like we had to keep going back on ourselves to find a different gallery.It's a fantastic place to visit and entry is free (just pay for parking). The views of LA are also excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeepJC
50,Art and more !,"In the foothills of West Los Angeles (LA), you can find the ""Getty Center"" which is a worthwhile site for a day trip. The Getty Center is repository for the art collection of J. Paul Getty. The collection is magnificent and deserves a serious look. The surroundings of the Getty Center are also worthy of your view. If you have the time, I would recommend the outside tour which includes the gardens and the architecture is very much worth while.You will find the views from the deck area as a photo opportunity. My attached photos # 2 , # 3 and # 4 represent some of the views that are available.To understand the gardens you have to know that the building committee decided to select an ""artist"" instead of a landscape architect. As you would expect , the decision had a major impact.In my photo #5, you can see the ""stream"". You have to look at the bottom of the photo as if you standing on the top of a hill looking down. There is about a 100 foot drop from the top of the stream to the bottom. The artist created a stream with large boulders at the top which create noise as the water bounces off of the large stones. As the steam goes down the hill the size of the stones is reduced to create less noise until the stream is quiet at the bottom in the pebbles. In photo # 6, the water of the stream enters the large pool. In photo # 5 you can see the path crosses the steam several times on the way down the hill.In photo # 6, You can see what appear to be large brown vases with red flowers. The large brown vases are actually ""re-bar"" (from building construction) which have been molded into the vase for the red flowers which are bougainvillea. The artist strikes again !!!From the gardens to the art work, it is an excellent day-trip. I recommend doing the outside first. You will be tired when you finish your tour of the great art work. It is a big place !!!A nice restaurant is available for refreshments. A good day !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCIrish1944
50,Stunning,This is one of the best buildings i have ever visited. Every corner you turn there is something pleasing to the eye. The symmetry between straight lines and curves and its environment are brilliant. The gardens are equally inspiring. It is almost like a modern Alhambra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drobo12000
40,cultural surprise,"I think the setting of the Getty, and the fact that you have to take a train up a mountain, adds to the museum. Being hungry, we grabbed a bite from the cafe first, and enjoyed the view. I especially enjoyed the wide, clean spaces and sculptures after driving in a car. Not being from Los Angeles, I was surprised that the museum was a collection of buildings and you have to walk outdoors to get from one to the other. I was impressed by the permanent collection, the circular garden with unique flora, and unique stream/waterfall. Would recommend closed shoes as the gravel pathways can get your feet dusty. A must see for anyone traveling to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecesimms
40,Peaceful and beautiful - a great day trip,"Spent only a few hours on a Sunday afternoon and that was not enough time to soak up the beauty of the architecture, gardens, art and the fantastic views of LA.A great place to bring a blanket and relax on the putting green perfect lawns, while resting in between exhibits.Definitely a fantastic spot for a relaxing leisurely day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendya01
50,"Art, architecture and garden at a super price",First I was impressed it only cost $15 for all of us to get in. You pay for parking and that's it.The garden was so interesting and tactileThe architecture extraordinary. A cross between a roman villa and a ship. White marble and ocean made for a great ambience.The art was impressive and the tour I went on was well done. (Tours are limited to 30 people so get there 15 minutes early). And the earphones worked super well. I heard everything the docent said.Particularly enjoyed discovering Hockney. But it was all great.Glad it was recommended to us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylA13
50,An amazing day!,"I had a most enjoyable day at The Getty centre. Loved the little train up to the centre and found with the aid of maps it was easy to get around. Each building held a treasure trove of interesting exhibits . At mid day I had a pleasant cafe style lunch in the courtyard, a rest and then off I went again. Loved the shop where I bought a lot of gifts. Everything about this centre is easy and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mingblue
50,One of the best art museums in the western United States.,"Thank you, Mr. Getty. Your vision of a top-quality museum for the citizens of southern California and many other locations around the world is a very successful reality. Easy to reach and fun to explore collections display an array of art periods and styles in roomy viewing rooms. Friendly guides and audio-assisted tours are helpful for the novice and expert alike. Take your family and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckG_12
50,"Excellent cultural offer, beautiful garden","I was there on a Saturday and took public transportation to get there. The trip takes a while, but the center is easily accessible by bus. The architecture of the center is awesome, the exhibitions were excellent, and I enjoyed wandering around the garden. The views over Los Angeles are breathtaking. My only squibble with this place is that the cafeterias were not clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439sonjaw
50,Get museum.,Went to the Getty today wish we would have had more time.Beautiful location and great art.There is no charge to go put you have to pay 15 for parking. But if you go to the Getty Villa the same day it's 2 for one parking. Just be sure to get your ticket back.You also don't need reservations for the Getty. They also have several free guided tours. You just get in line at appropriate Time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCRON
50,My New Favorite Place in the Hills!,"I have been wanting to visit The Getty the last few times in LA and it was worth the wait: A unique view of the city, amazing works of art, and stunning architecture. The parking was a challenge (arrived 2 hours before closing on a Sunday), but they are efficient getting us on the trams and clear with direction. The museum is a joy to explore, and our staff highlight includes the Gift Shop team. Can't WAIT to return!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
50,"A ""must do"" if vacationing in L.A.","Fantastic art, photographs and scultures. Beautiful buildings and gardens. Multiple ""gift shop"" opportunities. Very educational. Great views as well.The cafe is open limited hours and there is likely to be a bit of a wait to get on the tram back to the parking lot when you want to leave, but still a wonderful, educational and enlightening experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7905RGpetera
50,Must to see,There are many masterpieces of arts in here than the other US museums. One day is not enough time to walk around these buildings. So enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pldjm
50,Beautiful...and FREE!,"What an amazing museum! We absolutely loved our time here, the exhibits were wonderful and everyone was so helpful and nice. We arrived right around opening time and it was already getting very busy, lots of school groups etc. You do have to take a tram to the top of the hill but it only takes about 2 minutes or so and it's a nice little ride. They have all different types of art which is nice, so there is something for everyone. I would say that this rivals many European museums ( of which many are also free or close to free).We had a fantastic time and would encourage everyone to go this great museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBJ1212
50,The Getty Center,The Getty Center one of the best museums in the country. Be prepared to spend several hours looking at the exhibits the buildings and the outside landscape is also worth some time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wa6flr
50,A must visit attraction when in LA,"I like this place, the museums and the art are great, but the city views are even better, I usually enjoy touring the museums and when I get tired I go to their restaurant and eat with a view. the night view is great as well.One thing to keep in mind, you have to park in a parking lot, then ride a bus and a light metro rail to get to the location, so no direct car parking at the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nemocali
50,BEAUTIFUL & INTERESTING,"I always enjoy the Getty Center, not only for its exceptional exhibits but it’s avant garde Architecture & Beautiful Gardens & INCREDIBLE Views!

Always something new & exciting to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814jeanr

50,Great trip,"Ihave been there several times with my kids. Be sure to ask for the kids ""guide,"" where kids get to search for famous painting or statues on a booklet. Kids like to walk around to the garden. We make the day special with a ""grown-up"" like meal in the museum cafeteria. Kids get to line up and chose their own lunch. Try to make it past 9a and leave before 4p to bypass traffic hour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1234kidsintow

You can observe some of the most incredible views of the the city from a variety of vantage points. On a clear day, you can even see the ocean!The restaurants serve a variety of price points and selections. You can grab a quick snack in the courtyard, eat a casual meal that you can grab ‘n go or be served cafeteria style with hot or cold offerings. If you want to go upscale, there’s a white tablecloth restaurant with delicious choices.After you’ve seen the wonderful art exhibits, you can take a walk through the lovely gardens. A day trip to the Getty is a memorable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaR824
50,Overwhelming Experience,Going to the Getty was an overwhelming artistic experience for me. The works of art and the way they were displayed was fantastic.The only downside was having lunch in the restaurant. The food was only fair and it was very expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarryW982
50,"A ""Don't Miss"" Cultural visit","A ""Gem"" in The Rough. The J.P. Getty Center, compared to Malibu's Getty Villa, is a unique offering of time, space and beauty. Atop the Brentwood hills, this expansive center, designed by architect Richard Meier, is an extraordinary setting of multiple buildings, fountains, gardens, walkways and views. Visitors are treated to a vast collection of Getty's permanent collection, and on-loan pieces, representing fine art from many regions and historic periods. (Multiple genres of art are on view, as well.)This is truly an L.A. GEM, considering most art, galleries and collections in L.A. may be considered primarily ""disposable"", contemporary, often ""annoying"", in a city that seldom embraces FINE ART. Getty's is the rare and welcomed exception. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickster360

Go early for easy parking, take sun hats and allow yourself more time than you think you will need! It is a visit worth doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steviehorton
50,A Must Visit,"A lot of hidden surprises throughout the facility. While the ride up in the tram is cool, time your trips properly as you can end up waiting if there is a big tour. The collection of ancient statues, etc., is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316per
50,Beautiful Museum,In LA for 2 days and we decided to make a last minute change and go to the Getty. We should have planned at least a full day (we only got through 1.5 buildings and a special exhibition before fatigue and the sun setting did us in. This is a fantastic place and I look forward to going back and exploring the rest of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clasicgrl
50,Best Free Art Museum in LA,"Everything from the architecture to the ocean views and the botanical maze garden will keep you visually stimulated in addition to all of the artwork. The place is huge you could easily spend almost a full day here if you take your time. They have food onsite but if you are on a budget there is a nice grass area weather permitting you could have a picnic.It's free to get in, there is a fee for parking I believe $10 but if you bring your LA tap card be sure to show it in the gift shop for a discount.The photographs and manuscripts exhibit was my fave. It's a must see if you enjoy a look into history through photography.It's good for family's, going solo or for a small group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlykiteart

50,Go to see the David Hockney exhibition,"Visited the Getty Centre again this year , this time to see the Happy Birthday Mr Hockney exhibition. Excellent!There is so much to see inside the Getty Centre but make sure to take a walk around the gardens and outside sculptures.Some staff could do with a bit of training as we were given incorrect information several times regarding where to go for a coffee break and also regarding one of the exhibitions.That said, this is an amazing place.It's free entry and you pay around $14 to park.Well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janno58

50,Absolutely Stunning!,"I think my favorite part of the Getty is the architecture. Come here just to hang outside - there's a gorgeous garden and beautiful buildings, surrounded by an aerial view of LA. The exhibitions are great too, there are some modern painters and plenty of temporary shows that are worth the visit.

In addition there are temporary exhibitions. Entrance is free but parking costs $15. There is a monorail which takes you from the parking to the center.There is a choice of elegant or casual dining as well as a gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748paull

50,Amazing place to visit,"We both loved the Getty Centre, both for its Architecture and its Art. We had limited time so concentrated on the visiting exhibition of South American gold - spectacular. We then looked at specific galleries. The building is full of light and space and a great place to stroll around. The views are spectacular and there are plenty of seating areas etc. No admission fees but you pay for parking - the ticket is valid for The Getty Villa if used on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilld360

50,"This is a must on any visitors ""to do"" list in Las Vegas","I have to admit I was a little sceptical in reading all the incredible reviews. Can I say they are all spot-on! Wow, wow, wow!The stunning architecture is only equalled by the gorgeous and very well planned gardens, as an avid gardener I was so impressed I was kinda pathetic taking a million photos. The garden was designed by Robert Erwin, an artist with the help of two very capable landscaper Gardeners. They are a story that unfold as you work your way to the bottom of the garden. Most importantly he takes you on a journey through landscapes and planting season that are exactly what the critics call an artwork in themselves.Of course the architectural work of Richard Meier is the centrepiece of the whol experience. I think they must have used enough travertine to make a quarry. They way he uses this incredibly strong and rich stone with curves and all white exteriors is remarkable. No wonder it took 13 years to create and build.I thank you Mr Getty for your legacy and your most beautiful view of the world and its art. While all your spectacular art works are a time capsule in themselves, the Monet's are my favourites.Please do yourself and your children a huge favour go to the Getty Centre. It's free and it's spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnDavid_1956
50,Stunning diverse collections of art,It's hard to believe this museum is free although there is a hefty charge for parking. There are different cafes to eat in which have tasty food.

30,Choose your guide wisely,This is a must do visit. You need to allow a good half day.Beware I had a volunteer guide who conducted a tour focusing on the architecture of the centre. She was woeful and the tour a waste of time.I then took an audio guide for a highlights tour. Well worth doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrmark1963
50,An oasis away from the bustle of the city,"We were in LA for a few days after a fairly arduous road trip and decided to head off to The Getty Centre after doing some of the ""tourist sites"" on one of our days there. Sunset Boulevard not as bad as people said but overflowing with people and lots of shops, Walt Disney Concert Hall building was spectacular but nowhere to park for any length of time, Griffith Observatory was rammed, drove in (at a snails pace) and out again. We then drove out to the Getty Centre car park (no queues) and caught the monorail up (great views of the six lane highways below). On arrival at the top you are instantly transported into another world that appears clean, fresh, spacious and architecturally outstanding! The restaurant had a great selection of foods and drinks and was reasonably priced with a really nice covered terrace. We took the garden tour and were not disappointed. Norma, our guide was such a lovely lady, friendly funny and very informative. The gardens were wonderful and the backdrop of the clear blue sky against the mainly white buildings was outstanding. We did venture into the Hockney section and also spent a little time looking through a few other exhibitions but time was not on our side. Had we known how lovely this place was we would have planned to have a whole day here and if were ever that way again will definitely be revisiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbjb2012London
30,"Great museum, great view",The collection is impressive with views over Brentwood or western are of Los Angeles. The architecture is interesting. It is difficult to find via GPS as the lyft app dropped us in the middle of a neighborhood with no access behind the museum and beneath a large hill. Get accurate directions before setting out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskV507AO
50,One of the best in the west,"The location is breath taking, the exhibitions it's self has everything . took the 1 hour guided tour to see the highlights , it was worth every minute -not to mention it was free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vardas2013
50,Art museum for those who don't like museums,"To me, the Getty is the model of newer art museums that are visitor friendly. I really don't like the old-style art museums. This is bright and airy, not dark and dank. There is room for individuals and tour groups. There are benches to rest on, and to focus on a few favorite pieces. There are water fountains and restrooms that are kept clean. There are eating places with reasonable, good food, as well as a swankier place for those special moments. Sometimes there is live music in the courtyard. There is a wide variety of permanent exhibits, usually something for everyone. Some of the pieces become like old friends over the years. The visiting exhibits offer something new to look forward to each time one visits. Admission is free. Parking is currently $15 per vehicle. You can also take public transportation or ride-sharing. The tram from the parking garage to the main center is a beautiful ride. The view from the center is amazing, and don't forget to wander through the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
50,Best Museum in the Western Part of the Country,Great experience. A day wasn't long enough to see it all. The museum entrance is free but it cost to park. Clean big parking garage but the wait to park is long. Go during the week when the lines are smaller. The exhibits are interesting. The facility is well done and there is better than average food in the cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61garyn
50,One for the bucket list,"This was a great activity for a whole day. Interesting architecture, great art and a fantastic location overlooking Los Angeles. There are also guided tours to help you understand the background of the architecture and the art. You can take a break from all the art by having a meal and just looking out over the LA cityscape. We had a great day and I would go back next time I'm in LA because there are things that I didn't get to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnS555
40,Spectacular view from the top of hill,"European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, decorative. American, Asian, and European photographs. But the beautiful view that impress me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noohinc
50,Great place to stay a few hours,I'm not the biggest art fan- but this place is great. There is no entrance fee. I think they charge $12 for parking. You can wait for the tram to take you up to the museum or you can walk up. Great views of the city of LA when you get to the top. Nice cafeteria to get a drink at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explorer1421
50,A World Cultural Center,"The Getty is remarkable not only for the art you can see there, but the architecture and gardens are magnificent. It has one of the best views of Los Angeles, and it has a wonderful restaurant that makes for a lovely date of food, art and wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rono776
50,Art with a View,"You have missed out if you do not visit this museum. Frist and foremost, the Getty has one of the most impressive collections in all the world. It is truly like walking through an art history text book. Secondly, the museum and grounds are every bit as impressive as the treasures inside. It is a stunning accomplish set against one of the most impressive backdrops in all of Southern California. Lastly, it is all free. If you are in LA, you simply must go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8513MOtimothyb
50,Getty Center,"It is one of the world's great art museum, well known for its architecture and garden. Getty center is worth a visit simply to see Richard Meier designed building, stop and smell the 🌹 in the garden and don't miss Van Gogh's Irises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinehs2017
50,Always a JOY,"This is a great spot for families and couples alike. It is also fun for individuals looking for a place to sit and do their homework, or write, or sketch. Art lovers will be drawn to the myriad of collections the Getty has and their frequent shows are always a joy to visit.Be aware, there is a parking fee of $5.00 (it may be more, i am not sure, now). There will be a lot of walking once you get off the tram, as well. BRING SUNGLASSES, if you plan to walk around at all on a sunny day. The marble imported from Italy is very light but the sunshine bounces off of it like snow in winter. IT can be blinding.The cafeteria and cafes are the usual overpriced fare, so also be prepared on that front. Food and drink are not allowed inside the museum proper so if you plan to eat, I would do that first if you're bringing your own food.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1266SErebeccas
50,a day of fun at the Getty,"Everything mechanical was very well run at the Getty. I don't know how you could beat the view inside and out. No charge except for parking. That made the higher price of the food easier to swallow. Incidentally, the food was fresh and really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pollyreid
50,Worth A Visit for Locals and Visitors alike,"Beautiful architecture and gardens and a wonderful art museum all in one. You can spend a whole day here and have a nice lunch in one of the cafes. On top of all of this, you get an amazing view of Los Angeles.Admission to the museum is free but you will have to pay for parking. Be sure to check the website regarding parking and note the structure will fill up if you don't get there early and you will have to use alternate parking or transport.If you can, weekdays are less busy than weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Murray6971

50,The Getty from the perspective of a native of Los Angeles.,Fine collections and one of the most beautiful views of Los Angeles. Plan for a few hours and stay until the sun goes down. Lovely terraces. You should book reservations for parking ($15) in the museum parking area because it is in a difficult hillside location and parking anywhere else is virtually impossible. The tram up to the museum from the parking area and the museum are free. It is next to a major freeway which can be very jammed with traffic during the major commuting hours (3:30-6:30). Watching the sunset on the terrace with food and drink is a much better option than braving the freeways at rush hour! The museum and views are well worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjhtmajd
50,"Excellent collection, arhitecture, gardens, view & location",I would recommend spending a whole day at the Getty Center. There is so much to see there and they put on a variety of free tours throughout the day. (There is no need to plan ahead - you can just turn up and pick up the day's timetable from the reception desk). I would recommend the two outdoor tours (garden and architecture) as a large part of the center's appeal is the site itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,GO,This museum is a wonderful experience in every sense. No 1 its FREE to get in you only pay for parking. The building is amazing high quality in every way and the stuff inside well worth looking at. It may not all be to your taste but theirs no arguing its value and uniqueness. An absolute must for every visitor to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelemar
50,Yes. So glad I went,"What can you say about the center that has not already been written. From the ride from the carpark to museum to all the galleries and open space and views, this is a must do in LA. As a keen photographer I spent a lot of time photography area. The exhibits were excellent and very inspiring in a variety of manners. (the shop in that area is comprehensive & dedicated to photography). It was easy spending the whole day there. The open space and gardens are as enjoyable as the art. Large, uncluttered & so much. Overall I found it fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerryk615
50,Best museum in LA,"It's a must visit museum if you are in LA. Just the location itself is beautiful. On top of the hill. The architecture is very unique and so is the experience. There is something for everyone to see, even if you are not a museum fan. There are beautiful gardens whee you can have a picnic outside or if you choose to, you have a cafee where you can buy something to give you energy to keep going around the whole place. This place is huge so come prepared to spend a half day or longer. Depends on your pace and interest. Hope you like this place as much as I did",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albanm955

50,Great Must see for any visitor,Loved The Getty... chock a block full of amazing art and culture..Totally FREE to get in except parking costs but if you take public transport there is a shuttle up the hill to entrance..have lunch at the cafeteria rather than the swanky restaurant.. pricey.. Museum store great too for those unique gifts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonp701
40,Lovely venue,Worth a trip for a lovely lunch. The salads are excellent. As are the various main courses. The service was excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAAtty
50,Beautiful museum,Hands down my favourite museum out of the other ones I have visited during my trip (Vancouver and Virginia). As you take the tram to the museum you see a nice view of the city. The museum is large and it would take a good couple of hours to see everything. I recommend take breaks in between at the gardens. You can even bring a picnic blanket and have a picnic at the gardens. The museum itself was well maintained and design with the natural light was clever. You can also see a beautiful view of the city from the balconies of level 3. Highly recommend this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658gracies
50,Beautiful!,My favorite part was the stunning architecture. The white building against the bright blue sky was outstanding and was great for photos.Everyone had a great day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinebS3302AQ
50,The Getty Center,"This is one of my favorite locations in Los Angeles. Great for many reasons. Choose one of the temporary exhibits or go for the permanent collection, stroll through the magnificent gallery spaces, then take a walk through the spectacular garden in the late afternoon and finish the day with a memorable dining experience in ""the Restaurant at the Getty Center.""Enjoy a glass of wine and share your take away with the person you shared the day with or share on social media. Personally, I enjoy writing my thoughts down on paper and shoot abstract images to recall emotions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305jodis
40,Open display,The walls did not have lots of art on each wall which allowed one to easily view and read about each piece.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triplynnell
50,Art and dining,"On Saturdays throughout the year, dinner is available at the restaurant at the Getty Center. A favorite evening of mine is to make a dinner reservation there and arrive an hour or two early and view a special exhibit and/or the collection.The views from the Getty are stunning and a stroll through the gardens makes one think one is far away from the madding crowds.The dinners are delicious. Well conceived and presented. The servers are gracious and attentive. Just don’t assume you can arrive too much before or after your reserved time. It is fairly small for the size of the facility. A full bar and good wine list. You might try a Moraga wine which is from the winery one views on the tram across the freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B-BETH123
50,Incredible Expetience,"If you are looking for an elegant, memorable and cultural experience, reserve a table at the Getty Center Restaurant after a visit to the museum. Simply stated, the ambience is beautiful with spectacular views. From the moment we entered the front door, we were greeted, seated and treated like royalty. The wine list is most impressive and the food was outstanding. Topped with fabulous desserts and coffee, we left completely satisfied and transported to a very happy place. Congratulations to manager Almog, who made sure we were taken care of throughout our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucreciaJ

40,"Getty, outside, wow, inside, okay.","To go to the getty, if you've never gone before is a really great experience. The outdoor architecture, draped in Jerusalem marble is magnificent. The courtyard and gardens are very nice and the view is great. The exhibits themselves are more pedestrian then the locale, if the subject interest you the exhibits are fine, if the interest is not there rarely will going change your mind. My suggestion is simple, never gone, go! Gone before check up on the exhibits and wait till something intrigues you. great for families and dates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontrealinLosAngeles

50,A great place to visit in LA,"Don't miss out on a easy and free trip to the Beautiful Getty Center Museum overlooking the 405. The artwork is world-class, and even without going into the interiors, you can enjoy the gardens, outdoor sculptures, concerts, fountains and architecture of the buildings themselves. Serious art lovers can spend days at the Getty Center - not to be confused with the Getty Villa, housing antiquities, and still located on the PCH in Malibu. Both great spots for educational field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiaMiaTrav

50,A MUST!!! View the World's Masterpieces right here in LA,"Why did I go to France or Italy to tour museums when some of the most amazing pieces are just a few miles away my home. Ok, it might feel like a few miles away just getting to the actual Getty Center from the Parking lot, but the Admission is...hello...FREE. Parking may be $15 bucks but worth it. My latest visit was in August 2017, really hot day, so it sucked braving the line for the tram to the top. There are umbrella's that you can use to shade yourself. My kids were melting, don't bring kids under 3, they won't be happy. The family room is ALWAYS at capacity.Features: Van Gogh, Manet, and original folios from the 1400's to 1800's, spectacular.In the cafe, get the grilled chicken sandwich (you can add cheese). It's so fresh, juicy and comes with a ton of shoestring fries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/174elyzabethp
30,"Was expecting more given its reputation, little contemporary but is FREE","You get two options when parking, outdoor and take a free coach to the rail connection or use the indoor car park. If you are looking to save a buck or two go for the outdoor parking.We used the indoor car park and paid out fifteen bucks.Short walk to the rail link, thought there might be a view worth looking at but zip.Decided to have lunch, the restaurant prices were outside what we wanted to pay, ie expensive, so the cafe it was. Reminded me of an university canteen, all very what I term mass produced industrial food, a Ramen, Burrito and a bottle of red wine cost fifty bucks.A number of buildings make up the centre, none of which I thought were worth a mention from the point of view of architecture, certainly not influenced by the likes of Gehry, Wright or Niemeyer anonExhibits were equally uninteresting, go check out the what on show in Madrid or Santa Marie de Belem (where you ask, try Portugal) never mind what on offer in London.Sorry guys, very disappointed.Only exhibits that were of interest was that under the heading of ""Golden Kingdoms""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wearyLondon

After parking, you can either wait in line to take the cog train up the hill, or get some exercise by walking. We walked, and it was peaceful. By the time we got to the grounds, we were amazed at the size of the complex and beauty of the architecture. First things first, though: we went to the cafeteria. They had a large selection of food and drinks to enjoy while looking out at the surrounding hills. Then, all we wanted to do was check out the gardens, but were easily distracted by the world-class art in the galleries. In the end, arriving at 12:00 noon, we just did not allocate enough time to take in everything the Getty Center has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smithcu

There are paintings (European, Italian, impressionists, renaissance, water color, sketches), plates, statues, etc.. I have been to many of the worlds best museums and this was one of them.

50,A slice of beauty in the concrete jungles of LA,"The Getty Center is a beautiful facility in the heart of Los Angeles. It's free to attend though you have to pay $15 to park which is quite reasonable in Los Angeles. Upon parking, the free Tram ride to the collections is a beautiful ride up the hill. However, after a long day, it's quite cumbersome to wait in line for a tram back down, though a 15 minute walk up/down the hill is also an option.Once you exit the tram, one will notice the breathtaking views of the city. The white buildings are accented by lovely foliage, fountains and architectural pieces.The collections are beautiful with a mixture of classical and modern pieces. There is also a beautiful garden which is amazing to walk through.The cafe serves decent food for elevated prices but nothing unexpected.Definitely a great way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lordgin1

In fact, we were a bit disappointed with the current exhibitions but never mind, those will change. The permanent collection is grand in its scope. It was extraordinarily busy when we visited due to many school groups but again because of its size and scale, not a big problem.

No separate bar, but wine available where food is served.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikkiLL1
50,Getty Center...Not Really About The Art,"The Getty Center is a spectacular series of structures in a dramatic view location. Best is to go when the weather is not too hot as you will want to spend a good bit of your time outdoors and not in the galleries. The panoramic views, the architecture, the landscaping are the real special qualities of Getty Center. The art is very good but there are other museums in LA such as LACMA or Broad or MOCA where in my opinion the art is more compelling.That said, art lovers or those who just want to experience the spectacular quality of the overall experience will not be disappointed. Getting there can be a pain when traffic on the freeway is terrible. Also parking is a bit of a hassle so if you are meeting people I suggest adding an extra 20 to 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwangers

40,More an art museum,"Read the reviews on The Getty and decided to spend our last day in LA looking at this museum.After visiting a number of DC museums, we had expectationsWhilst the range of art was extensive, including pictures by Van Gogh and Cezanne but the majority of The Getty was artworks and sculptures and a photo presentation.There was also a large range of 15th and 16th century furnitureIf these are in your wheelhouse it is a must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanen617
50,Don't miss this!,"Wow. This establishment is incredible. While exploring the museum and pristinely kept premises, you will wonder how you stepped upon such a gem. Admission is free but I advise you to stop at a cafe or restaurant and give back a small amount to such an amazing organisation. Even if you're not a fan of art or historical artefacts, come for the views of sprawling Los Angeles in all its glory. Still can't get it out of my head.Everything about the Getty Center is worth it, especially the wealth of information contained in its exhibits and shared by the friendly and knowledgable staff combined with its location perched in the hills of Los Angeles providing a once in a lifetime view of California. Well done to the Getty Center for their efforts. Without a doubt will visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlybeee
50,View,"I have visited The Getty Center different times of the year. Spring time is the rime to visit. Gardens, music, restaurants and food stations, various museums to visit. Allot of walking but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ejanier
40,Go for the Views and the Garden,"The exhibits here are never amazing in my experience, but the views and the Garden are just wonderful. I highly recommend getting a fruit and cheese plate at the cafe and then, taking it down to the Garden where you can enjoy the scenery all around. And, I do not mean to belittle the exhibits at the Getty. I saw an Exhibit of Medieval tapestries and a Herb Ritts exhibit about 5 years ago, and they were quite impressive.Still, the stand-out part of the Getty Center is the Garden and the LA views. It's actually a great place for a date in that regard, or even a first time online meet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,Wonderful Art and Design.,"This was a highlight of our time in LA. We drove out to the centre, parking was $15 but entry to the centre was free. There is a train from the parking to the hill top but we chose to walk because the queues were long, it only took us fifteen minutes. The architecture and landscaping created a sense of peace even though the place was heaving when we visited. We thoroughly enjoyed wandering the art galleries for a couple of hours and left reluctantly when we discovered that the cafe and restaurant were closing. I wish we'd got there earlier, My recommendation is to go in the morning so that you can soak up the atmosphere, have ample time to enjoy the grounds and the art and have lunch or tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832carolt
50,Beautiful place and nice view,This place is something really different to be seen in LA area.It’s really beautiful and interesting.Worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837mar_liac
50,Highlight of my LA trip,"I enjoy visiting places but am not an art buff or won't spend hours analyzing art. But this place just left me in awe. You MUST visit.We only had a couple hours so it was short and sweet and with teens this was just the right amount of time. The admission is free as are the self guided tour devices (which we didn't use but would love to go back for). Parking cost $15 but small price to pay.From the parking you take a train to the hill top. Very well executed. From the time you arrive to the time you leave, the architecture, landscaping, thoughtfulness, cleanliness, everything just puts you in an amazing ambience and aura. I can't explain with words but it was an amazing experience.The galleries themselves were world class. I've visited many in Europe and this is right up there, with the added benefit of the ambience.One of the security personnel gave us a quick 'must see' route suggestion and we were able to whizz through and see a lot in a very short time. I will go back and make sure everyone i know visiting LA takes the time to visit. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhoom13
50,Beautiful views surrounded by VERY cool art!,Beautiful views surrounded by VERY cool art! It's an adventure to go to the Getty. I have been there several times with a variety of groups. Kids trips. Romantic brunches for Anniversaries. Birthday lunches with the Ladies.The ambiance is wonderful for lunch. The exhibits change enough so that one might go every 4 months and have new visuals each time!An LA Treasure :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARamblinSoccerMOM
40,Superb location,"We were here in December / January with children and we walked up, rather than taking the train up the hill. The exhibits are rather staid for the most part - classical statuary, renaissance, baroque, impressionists etc that you see in all the major galleries around the world but the location really sets this place apart. The walk up and views once there as well as the architecture really set this place apart as one of the best places to go in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0_Justme_0
40,Massive museum,This museum is huge! The art collections are fantastic and we didn't even get to see everything. The grounds with the flowers and the views of the area are beautiful. My son and his girlfriend took the architecture tour and enjoyed it. The cafe was a little pricey but my youngest son was hangry but there were many choices. You can also buy a bottle of wine. The Getty Center is accessed by a tram that takes you from the parking garage up the hill to the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelg
50,Getty villa,Loved it. 1st floor was closed but worked for us because not all were interested in the museumWill visit again when fully renovated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharlyny2017
50,Fabulous,"I have visited a lot of museums worldwide but never experienced such a delight. The site is large, almost university campus size. The buildings have a great lay out and the works of art are excellent. The setting upon the hill, with beautiful gardens, add to the attraction. But also the organisation, staff and logic details make this a worthwhile visit. Do not miss out on this great opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wub67
50,"Wonderful place to visit, but have enough time.","My boyfriend brought me here a few months ago for my first time, and I will be back. It was an amazing time with him, and I am so happy he brought me here. We came a little later in the day, so I did not have enough time to really see everything, but from what I saw it was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tykane01
40,Recommended,"Spent a Sunday afternoon there. Parking is $15.00. The line for the tram was very long and we were told we could walk to the museum faster than taking the tram. So we walked. A slight uphill walk. The grounds are beautiful as is the architecture. They have a variety of art to satisfy everyone. Stopped for a light lunch and a glass of wine. Prices were moderate. Food was decent, nothing special. However, it was a beautiful day and enjoyed eating outdoors.The gardens are beautiful. Overall, a very nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethS872
50,A gem!!,"This should be on everyone's must do list when in the area. It's FREE with absolutely gorgeous grounds and views everywhere you look. Bring a picnic for the family or buy a lunch with a friend. I would give this a 10!Tip: I took the garden tour. While enjoyable and interesting, no information about the names of the flowers is given if that is what you are interested in. It's only to enjoy the design, sights, and scents.Tip 2: bring your best camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzeemom
40,Pretty good but I have been to better in other cities,The place was interesting as well as the art in there but I didn't get the vow effect for some reason. Traffic was a bit of hell as well. We definitely had fun with friends.I spoke to these other people that recommended using this mobile app they have been using called WhatTuDu. It supposedly gives you suggestions of different things to do in town. I will give it a try to see if it's good for finding things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jim122388
50,Wonderful cultural experience and its free,Love this place! There is something for everyone from paintings to sculptures to beautiful gardens to amazing framed views of mountains and oceans. even the walls are musical and can be played and the train is actually a funicular.I highly recommend The Getty for any visit to LA or even for just afternoon (and make sure to catch the sunset). I haven't been for a while. I took a bus load of clients last time. and its time to go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheromiev
50,"If you love impressionists as much as I do, that's the place","I believe that's one of the most beautiful places in LA. The collection of art with no questions is the strongest. Love Monet and Picasso paintings. And of course Van Gogh. But not speaking only about the art, the environment and location are something to look at separately. I spend the whole day there and now it's one of my favorite museums in the world. Getty Center has free admission but parking is chargeable. $15 flat rate is the parking fee. The same is $10 if you enter after 3pm. Parking for less than one hour is free, but you definitely need more time to enjoy it. There are some cafes outside where you can eat and enjoy the view or have a glass of wine while enjoying this beautiful place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_L3676QL
50,Wonderful place to take the family,"A beautiful location with excellent permanent collection. Beautiful views on a clear day from the many terraces and garden. We like to make reservations for lunch, arrive early to see any temporary exhibits, then have a lunch break and then visit the garden and our favorite pieces in the permanent collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coco091
50,Amazing & it's free entry,"I was so impressed of the size of the Getty Center with the magnificent view of the surrounding areas. We did not go to every single pavilions given limited time there. The central garden, the south pavilion & the restaurant are must visits! If you don't mined waiting, you can take the shuttle bus or the rail up to the Centre. We walked up & then down which took about 15 mins each trip and really nice walk. Must go when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ualyma
50,A wow from all perspectives,"This is where a large portion of J. Paul Getty's wealth was used to create an astonishing museum and garden on a bare LA hilltop. The collection includes van Gogh, Munch, nearly all of the important impressionists, and Rosseau. However, the real ""stars"" are the gardens and the architecture. This is a must see for LA visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocSag
50,Amazing!!!,"We visited The Getty Center recently and it was a fabulous experience. From our arrival, we were treated to a beautiful tram ride with an amazing view of the L.A. area. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly guides helping in any way needed.The architecture of the complex is breathtaking. The collections are housed in various areas, all unique and welcoming. We went early (9:30 a.m.) on Saturday and had no issues with parking or crowds. Even when we left around 4:00 p.m. the crowds did not seem overwhelming. The gardens were lovely, and definitely worth a walk around.There are several restaurant options. We picked the cafeteria style area, which I felt had a variety of options, better than most of these types of venues. There was even a small selection of beer and wine, if that's of interest. The food was fresh and very tasty.Although the Center is free to the public, which is amazing for the quality, parking was $15.00. Overall a real bargain for this memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chatakwa

50,Best museum ever,One of the most wonderful museum I have ever visited... from the gorgeous arts down to the employees,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YNL127
50,You must go,"We have been trying to get here several times during past visits to LA but never had time. This trip we set aside time. We weren't disappointed. The collections are separated by years, each period in a different building. Both sculptures and paintings from the period as well as glass and other items are on display. The gardens are beautiful and should not be missed. There are self guided audio tours available as well as free docent led tours. There is much to see so allow enough time to absorb it all or make sure you can get back at a future date. Entrance to the museum is free but there's a $15 charge to park a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BronxWanderer
50,A Place You NEED to Visit on Your LA Visit,"A total LA experience of Art, Architecture and Sweeping Views! Put the Getty on your list of things to do. I always take out of town guests and they have all loved it. There are 2...the one in Malibu has breathtaking ocean views, plus it's right on the PCH in the heart of the beaches, restaurants and shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billegee123
50,This is one of the best museums for the entire experience of LA,The Getty is just beautifully situated. But you have to do your homework to know when to come for parking and crowds. But it has wonderful galleries and great shows,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksbat3
50,Getty,"Amazing place!! I had never been here before, there's a parking lot that's $15, otherwise the museum is free! Next to the lot is a team station that goes up the hill to the museum. We spent 8 hours here, still didn't see everything! I wouldn't recommend for under age 12 though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freswench
30,There's much more to visit before that...,"It's a nice Villa and it's free.However, the art you'll find is mainly a replica, the place is not too entertaining and it's a little apart from everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbensvMartins
50,great free experience,"the getty is a great place to experience Los Angeles. great museum, good places to eat and fabulous gardens and great views of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander810991
40,A Place to Relax and Contemplate,As you enter the grounds you are met with lush surroundings where the drive way sweeps up the hill to the parking area.Entering the buildings is awe inspiring with the many pieces of art and decadence on show.This is not a place that children would enjoy but is a place for quiet contemplation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djworrall
50,"Great art, garden and views",Always a please taking tourists there. There are so many beautiful things to look at. The garden is always spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebN6450DA

50,The Most Incredible Museum,"I wanted to visit the museum to see specific pieces of Italian art I knew were in their permanent collection. The tram ride from the parking structure to the top of the hill was spectacular. The views were worth just the ride, but you get off and are greeted my the most charming people. Then I discover there is NO entrance fee. The architecture is marvelous, but my favorite experience was the lunch in the restaurant. Every dish was a culinary work of art. I was surprised that our local family had never been to the Getty. It was a perfect visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Italophile173
40,Interesting,I never heard of the Getty Museum before this trip. The grounds and views of Los Angeles are beautiful. The museum has a large variety of artwork and exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loramarj
50,A Must For Every Artist (and Those Who Appreciate Art),"If you consider yourself to be an artist, then you must have been to the Getty Museum. If you have not visited yet, you'd better get up and plan to visit this center.Only a few museums of this magnitude exists in the whole country. This is where you can enrich yourself with the history, the biography and the many stories that surround great artists and their works of art, in the past centuries.You get to see famous artists' paintings and works of art. This is where you get to view the masterpieces of those who came before us and were considered great artists of their time. This is where you get encouraged and inspired to do your next (great) work of art.If your experience at the museum doesn't drive you to great ideas, visions and creations, then you might as well ask yourself whether you are an artist or not.You must visit the center. For all you know, it could be your one-in-a-lifetime exposure to some of the great works of art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexelspixels
50,Beautiful Place,"Just a beautiful place to spend some time and admire the works of art, gardens and the architecture of the buildings. The views of Los Angeles, Hollywood Hills and the Pacific Ocean only add to the special nature of this area.Tip: if you visit both The Getty Center and the Getty Villa (about 30 minutes from each other with light traffic) you can use the same parking pass - just be sure to have it validated before leaving the first museum you visit. 2-for-1 - can't beat it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boeing747-8I
50,Must See: #1 In LA,"The views alone make this the #1 sightseeing stop in all of LA, add in the art, gardens, food, and architecture, and it's simply hands down one of the coolest places to be in the U.S. Don't forget the sister location in Malibu with stunning ocean views. And this photo is from Star Trek when they used the Getty as Starfleet Headquarters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2547QKdaveh
40,I cannot believe so many things to see of total treasure,I waited all my life to see this Museum and it was totally worth it. Would love to go back and see it again there's so much to see that you really can't appreciate it all in one day. The gardens to construction the books just wondered wonderful way to spend the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6319WOlauras
50,Getty Museum,Fantastic! Spend a day here. Art for every taste. Make sure you get the audio player to discover the significance of what you are viewing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DColvin
50,The best thing about LA,"As a lover of architecture as well as art, the Getty Centre was amazing. Set on large grounds overlooking the city, the buildings and grounds are worth a visit alone. Then there is the amazing art ranging from old masters to modern pieces. On top of all that it was free! Don't know how I have missed this place on other trips to LA, but I will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ausmike_1968

40,Beautiful Grounds,"I didn't spend time inside of the museums when I visited the Getty Center, but I did enjoy a nice walk around the beautiful grounds. You pay for parking, but not for entry to the grounds. Would recommend waiting in-line to take the tram up from the parking area to the property. If you plan ahead, they do hold different types of events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinedm23

50,Great Place,Excellent collection of arts nice environment access through Tram is excellent nsp also scenic views are excellent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prabhubabun
50,Beautiful spot in Los Angeles,"This is a full day experience and not to be missed if you are in LA. You park your car ($18 per car sounds steep but there is no per person admission fee to the museum or the grounds) and take a tram up to the top of the mountain. The museum is really impressive but it's the setting and the grounds that continue to stun me over and over again. Take a walk down into the gardens to the large pond with a view of the ocean and the whole city below. Bring a blanket and sit on the well manicured lawn and catch some sun. Have lunch in the gourmet restaurant with a view of the city or grab a bit at one of the snack bars on the premises. There are lovely fountains scattered around the museum grounds and so many lovely spots to just sit and people watch.The museum exhibits change frequently so check their website for the latest ones but for me, it's the grounds and the views that draw me back time and time again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433KM
50,Lives up to the hype,"The Getty was the one place we were sure we wanted to visit in LA. We had high expectations going in, and they were exceeded. The architecture, gardens, and vistas of southern Cal would have made the long Uber ride worthwhile even if there was no art to see, and the art was magnificent. My wife complains that I see museums too fast, but I could spend days in The Getty and enjoy every one. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skipkilmer
50,It's a Must When in LA,"I know, it's a museum... not everybody likes to visit museums, but The Getty is different. If you don't appreciate art, the building, the gardens and the view of the city and the ocean are enough. It is spectacular! It was designed by Richard Meier, so it is very modern, very clean. If you are lucky and visit on a blue sky day, even nicer. Not only the view to the city is breathtaking, the contrast of the color of the walls (travertine stone) with the LA blue sky is outstanding.The location is great, right on top of the 405 freeway. The entrance is free! You only need to pay for parking. From the parking you get into a little train that takes you to the top of the mountain where the museum is located. Sometimes on the way there you can spot wild deers. This ride is beautiful as well.The grass rolling hills are open to the public to explore, to walk on, for the kids to roll down. It's a perfect place for families with young kids. Not only there is a kids room where they have art workshops, they can run free on the gardens.During summer they usually have live music on the grounds.The restaurant is fantastic, with an amazing view. Great for early dinner, watching the sunset. It is very elegant, so I don't suggest going with young kids, rather suggest either bringing your own food, or using their caffe or trolleys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilafajl
50,"Great Day, But bring ID for Audio Tour","Had a wonderful day at the Getty centre, loads to see and some really helpful staff especially Linda. The only disappointing thing is we tried to use the free audio guides and because we didn't have photographic ID they refused to let us use this and were not very helpful. We are from the UK and as standard do not bring our passport and driving licences with us everywhere!!This is definately worth a visit and we did enjoy our day but just remember your ID.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starbar1414
50,The Getty Center (not the Villa),This place is pretty amazing. Some of the exhibits change but when we were there we saw some amazing artwork from J. Paul Getty's personal collection. WOW. Tons of beautiful pieces. The wife went on the guided garden tour and really enjoyed it. I opted for just walking around and taking pics. Some pretty good views of the city from there as well. Definitely recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chiggins
50,UNBELIEVABLE,The Getty Villa is Mediterranean all the way you can see it looks like JP JUST GRABBED A VILLA AND HAD IT TRANSPORTED.. He has a variety of sculptors and paintings. It has BEAUTIFUL GARDENS and amphitheater. You can see the Pacific from his balcony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1DR
50,A whole day of amazing exhibits,"Spend an entire day admiring lovely art. The Getty Center never disappoints. With beautiful and unique architecture, you'll be amused.

50,Architecture of the Getty is FABULOUS!,"I've wanted to visit The Getty Museum for many years, and finally had an opportunity to make it happen. I was not disappointed!

50,Go Getty,"Plan to spend some time here - take the tram up, enjoys the views,walk in the gardens, admire the architecture, visit one or more of the exhibition galleries, grab a snack or dine in the restaurant (pricey). It's free but parking is $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annonymous984
50,Perfect place and affordable,"Whether your solo, with friends or family it's the perfect place to spend the day in Southern California. $15/car to park and no admission beyond that then take the monorail to the Center. Exhibits change so you can find out about the latest by visiting their website. Nice restaurant, snack bars, good coffee bar outside the Center. Beautiful views of LA. Relaxing. We especially loved seeing so many of the great ""masters."" All in one place. By the way, you can take photos-no flash. Do not miss this amazing place if you have the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL

50,Loved this place and wanted to spend more time,Could have spent on day here but didn't have time in our short stay in LA. Art is laid out very well and the gardens are lovely. Short ride up there is fun. And its all free. We didn't sample the catering but it looked good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelab354
50,Outdoors almost as great as inside exhibits,"On a nice clear day this is a great location to visit even if an art museum just isn't your cup of tea to spend a day. The views around LA and the grounds themselves are spectacular. The art exhibits inside cover a vast range so if you find yourself going in just look at each room. Skip the ones that don;t interest you and enjoy the ones that do interest you. You will find something that fits your taste. The museum is set up by art period or artist if the single artist has a large enough of a collection housed in the Getty or it's a traveling exhibit. The individual rooms are spacious enough to enjoy without fighting others to move around.The museum is free. The ""got you"" is the paid parking. It is expensive and limited. The best way to go to the museum is to park somewhere free along a bus-line that goes to the museum and just take public transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDcine

50,Great place to spend your Saturday!,"The Getty museum has a great variety of art work from different styles and periods of art to view, including a large number of original art pieces. Take your time to browse at the different collections, and to walk leisurely through the beautiful gardens. Take a break for a casual lunch at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kypreoi
40,One of a kind,"The Architecture design its quite beautiful, but the best part have to be the art collection.You will see a collection of master pieces centuries old. Literally priceless paintings and other worth millions.If you are an art lover you would have a great time.This is not a place for very young children that have no idea what they are looking at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonybP5411DS

Views of the city are priceless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annebJ4943VN

50,A Day of Relaxing Art and Beauty,"This is the most beautifully crafted museum inside and out. The buildings are modernly situated atop the hill of Sunset just overlooking parts of Beverly Hills, Century City and Brentwood. If you are looking for a zen peaceful way to spend the day. Start in the Garden, walk through the manicured succulents, view the ocean and find a time period of Art you enjoy. Then, spend time imagining what is would have been like to be a fly on the wall when the art work was created. Wether you are an Angelino or a visitor. Everyone should visit the Getty at least once in their life. Even if you think it's not your thing. The place offers many viewpoints of beauty.Have fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliab403
50,Beautiful and free!,"We live in LA but vit the Getty a few times a year. On a clear day, you can see the ocean and a great panoramic LA view. We splurge, and have a nice lunch at their restaurant, although there are other good options.

50,An LA Treasure,"Since moving to Brentwood from Malibu several years ago (the Malibu Getty center now houses an extensive collection of Greco-Roman art objects - well wort a separate visit), the large center on top of a mountain is an LA landmark and a must-see destination. It houses an enormous volume of paintings (all eras), sculptures and other objects of art. Make sure to reserve the visit (as well as parking) in advance. You will be whisked to the museum from the parking structure by a modern monorail. Plan to spend at least 4 hours, although a more comprehensive and worthwhile visit should take a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAW535

50,"Beautiful art, scenery, setting, gardens, etc","We adored this museum. Started with garden tour, which I highly recommend. It gives you a good overview and includes architecture info as well. It's not so much about the plant, per se, but more about why they chose these plants and where to plant them as it relates to the buildings. We then chose to use the iPods instead of formal tour which was excellent. Went to formal restaurant for lunch and food was exquisite. Expensive but worth every penny. Overall an outstanding day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6392CCsandraf

50,Don't Miss the Getty Center,"This beautiful museum is stunning - inside and out. Sometimes I just sit on the lawn and admire the grounds and the architecture. The museum is free. You only have to pay for parking if you chose to drive. Don't miss this if you are visiting Los Angeles and, if you live here, be sure to experience this gem. The temporary exhibits change periodically so there is always something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolkR4945MU
50,Wonderful place to visit!,"The Getty Center is a wonderful highlight of any visit to Los Angeles.

50,Very Beautiful for a day trip,"I recommend this to anyone who enjoys art and a good view. It is relaxing to sit in the garden and just take pictures and enjoy the moment.

50,Worth seeing,"Getty museum is terrific and awesome. Definitely must go! There are a lot of collections, it could spend a full day to take time to review the paintings and furnitures and so on. Also, there is a garden where you can enjoy the California sunshine. Free tour is available! Check the timetable first!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noelt92
50,A quick visit.,"I stopped by the Getty Center immediately after arriving in LA for a series of business meetings. The museum is architecturally beautiful and the collection is strong. Frankly, it's an amazing collection. And museum is very well staffed with both paid employees and volunteers who clearly enjoy their work.I took a guided tour that was supposed to be an overview of the collection. It appears, however, that the Getty's philosophy on tours is to be Socratic in their approach. In other words, the tour was a ""conversation"" rather than a lecture. It was effective, but it does limit how much you can see. We only examined five paintings in an hour. You may be better off with the audio tours, which are readily available.Admission is fee, but you do pay for parking. I arrived early, but the museum is pretty crowded at all times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrmadison1903

50,Wonderful day spent in LA!,"I decided to take my dad to the Getty Center on our first trip to LA. I was slightly hesitant as we had limited time in LA and wasn't sure if it would be worth it as it was also out of the way from our hotel.It was a wonderful day! We were lucky that we had fantastic sunny weather so the views were amazing! The artwork was wonderful and exceeded my expectations, there were many food choices and it wasn't too crowded either! We could have spent days wondering around the gardens and viewing the artwork.If you are in LA it is well worth the visit. Highly recommend it for people of all ages, including families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydney-travelller
50,Stunning art museum,The Getty Center is a stunning architectural achievement - worth visiting even without the art. And it's free! The most beautiful museum I've visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smudlathehound
50,Incredible Views Inside and Out,"I had not been to the Getty Center since opening day years ago. It was stunning then and it is still stunning today. The views from every corner of the property looks over LA and the surrounding cities. Our visit was on a clear day, something rare with no clouds and no smog. We could see downtown LA, Long Beach and the ocean.Inside, Wow! Phenomenal art - Monet, Picasso, you name it, they've got it. Photography, Old Masters, Impressionists, architecture, etc. Take in an art class of drawing or lecture; take a self-guided or private tour. It's all just amazing.The Getty is designed with people in mind. It is a village of galleries surrounding a central gathering area with fountains, chairs, tables and umbrellas. On the outside are more places to gather or explore. Go with people you can share the experience with or meet someone new. I heard so many different languages; a true international experience awaits.Picnic on the lawn or just lay down on the grass and drink in the sun. The gardens are beautiful and well kept. The food is good and plentiful with many choices of location and variety.We could've stayed for days. This is a place you want stay from the beginning of the day to the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xwtmc
50,The highlight of LA,"Accessible, dramatic and unpretentious. I love art but I love this place even more for being so down to earth.

50,A Must!,"The Getty Center is an absolute MUST! We drove up from SD this afternoon and spent 2-1/2 hours there canvassing the highlights: David Hockney (special exhibit), Impressionists, architecture, sculptures, gardens and view of LA. We will return and dedicate a full day and take advantage of several tours.Highly recommend the 10 minute orientation video to start. It runs continuously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db7477
40,Great Place to bring your kids for weekends,My wife and I spent couple hours here after sending our daughter to summer camp.The outdoor area is excellent and the design is definitely family-friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leoliyutang
50,Loved this venue,"We took a break from the theme parks and decided to get some culture. The Center is celebrating its 20th anniversary and the place still looks new!We Ubered from Universal City which cost under $30 and the Center is perfectly organized for a pick up or drop off . You arrive and walk up a set up stairs to reach the security point.Once you arrive via a tram at the top, you can either tour on your own or attend hourly tours led by a docent. We also had a tour of the site and learned about the history of the site and its construction.The artwork was pre-renaissance to 1900's and don't forget to take time to view the tapestry furniture used during this period. Also take time to walk down to the garden which was beautifully sculptured and landscaped.The visit including lunch break should take 4-5 hours if you took time to enjoy the masterpieces. Best of all, the price was right, it is open to the public at no charge (except for parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonfly129
50,Wonderful!,"The Getty Center is located on a hill overlooking the city of Los Angeles. The view on a clear day/night must be unbeatable. We were there on a foggy night and it was still something to enjoy. Enjoying the architecture of the buildings and grounds would be enough but then to have world class artwork located inside makes this place of a kind. Original works of art by van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Monet are displayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiawah1989
50,Impressive,"Well worth the trip to get there. The buildings and grounds are very impressive, let alone the collections that are housed there. There are free guided walking tours on offer which was very informative. The views over LA are very impressive also. Allow a few hours to maximise your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671tonyb
50,Spectacular,"The architecture, the gardens and the art are all absolutely first class. You could easily spend a day here and still want more. The café has plenty of food options and the food is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiS942
50,Art Lovers Paradise,"The Getty Center is truly a treasure. Perched on a hill overlooking LA, it is worth the price of parking to ride the tram to the top and take in the panoramic views.The museum itself houses and amazing collection of art and decorative items, arranged chronologically, which shows the progression and trends. All of the maps were accurate and easy to read for a wonderful self-guided experience. The security guards were very friendly, and some of them had interesting tidbits to tell us as we wandered through the galleries.Be sure to take some time in the outdoors while you are visiting.A stroll through the gardens and across the lawn allows you to look back at the structures and see how they are part of the art as well.This is a great day out for families. All you pay is parking. We noticed that many patrons brought their own picnics on the lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KPTcouple
50,Beautiful Buildings,The artwork in this museum tends to not be the best. The architecture and landscaping is where it's at. Go on a nice day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfA6450AI
50,Great Day for Free,Well with great views from the Pacific Palisades natures beauty is enough to go up to the Getty Center. It is a free day with a Tram ride up from parking down on Sepulveda. It has some of the most interesting exhibits. From vitorian furniture to contemporary art and modern photography. It is a must do on a hot and and the price is always right!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codyv882
50,Beautiful Gardens,We did not explore the inside of the museum but the gardens are just beautiful. They allowed us to bring food for a picnic which I recommend doing on the grassy slope.Don't miss the cactus garden! It's not marked but offers a beautiful view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonC9891
30,Worth a visit for the views,It's a really nice place and worth a visit if you're into this kind of thing but we were here for about an hour and the parking was $15. Make sure you pre book free entry tickets online first before going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eggfriedrice289
50,"A must, when in L. A.","I cannot explain it but the Getty (center and museum) have a strong effect on me. The place is magical for me.For sure, I love the permanent collections especially the impressionists ones.It is obvious that the wonderful architecture of the buildings and the incredible view of Los Angeles are two main reasons of the special quality of the place...You cannot be in LA and miss this place, it would be so sad.Go, visit this place each time you are in the area, and... You will only love it more and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771michaeli

50,Great Air Pieces and a Lot More!,"I unfortunately didn't save a lot of time for this centre, but would highly recommend it for any art lover.

50,"Great art, great architecture and great vistas","The Getty Museum moved from Malibu to this hilltop location several years ago. It has only gotten better since this time. The endowment for the Getty Oil money spared no expense in designing and building this museum. The architecture is exquisite. They have permanent and rotating art exhibits... usually European. They curator could expand on their genres, but for now it's adequate. This is a good spot for families, friends, dates, schools,... just about anyone. This is highly recommended and a good spot for any tourist that visits Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpinlb
50,Just the view was worth the trip!,"Museum was incredible with fantastic architecture to match. Make sure you do the reservation thing! If it's at busy time, you may want to Uber to the museum.

50,Excellent museum perched on a hill,"Extensive collection of art, sculpture and photography. Can look out all over Los Angeles. It is all very well done with beautiful gardens around the place.

50,Escape the crowds and enjoy the beauty!,"My favorite experience of our whole trip! The Getty was better than I could have hoped for. The buildings and grounds were every bit as beautiful and valuable as any of the art they contained. Free too! It was so nice to get away from the traffic, crush of families with kids crowding every square inch of space, and the overall dinginess of LA. Go early in the day and see the Impressionists first in order to linger and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine_titan
50,Just amazing,"Everything about the Getty centre is stylish starting from the electric tram that takes you up the mountain from the lower parking lot.The buildings, gardens and clean architectural lines in the minimalistic use of limestone throughout are in themselves worth the visit, let alone the collections of art, Louise 14 furniture, sculptures etc etc. simply stunning in the quality and extent of the collectionWe only had 3 hours to spend at the museum and it was worthy of at least a day to take in and savour the entire Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceM599
50,Cool Oasis in the Big City,"The Getty Center is the larger of the two Getty institutions in LA and this one is located away from the noise of the nearby freeway as it is accessed by a tram. The elevation of the facility makes for some great views of the LA, weather permitting. Both facilities run free guided tours throughout the day staffed by volunteers. The architecture tour (Richard Meier designed the Getty Center) and garden tour were both excellent.There is plenty of art to see inside the buildings but enjoyed the architecture and gardens most - weather was good though not good enough to get the view of the city.You can easily spend the entire day here - there are cafes/coffee courts and they seemed to be preparing for small evening music performances in the late afternoon.Yes, LA is a large city and public transport isn't quite up to that which exists in cities like NYC and Chicago, but you can get the bus there if you are staying somewhere with reasonable connections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DABSMO
40,Breathtaking architecture and great audio tour,"The vision, aesthetics and upkeep of design elements that went into the making of this museum set it apart from others housing similar artifacts. The location atop the hill, the airy and sunlit promenades, the garden and the timeless function and form make this a jewel for LA. There is a bit of patience required to reach in the traffic but the parking and transport facilities are very convenient to access. The staff are a great part of making the experience smooth. Needs more than one day to cover!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16tnr

50,An art lovers oasis,"A calm, cool oasis amongst the hurly-burly of the city, delightful not only for the wide range art but also the lovely gardens. Easy to park and then to get to the hill top galleries via the 'train'. Entry is free, but the available refreshments are relatively expensive. A place to revisit time and again, but not to miss on your first trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8297UQneilw
40,Really cool!,This is worth seeing even if you're not an astronomer. The museum part is free to walk through and read all about space and planets.

40,As complex as its namesake,"Try to go during the week. The parking fee and the cost of food do not begin to approach the value of what you see. Naturally people go there because it's a good deal, and a world-class Museum, in many respects.The physical plan and architecture are off the charts. A temple to art. The views absolutely breathtaking, the grounds and gardens tasteful and satisfying. I am curious who exactly envisioned where the museum was situated, since JPGetty was long gone. Much of the original Museum was built with travertine. It must be hard to keep up because the years of accumulated grime is beginning to show on the walkways. I don't know how many people from Europe were visiting Los Angeles on the day we went, yet I would venture a good portion of them we're over at the Getty.The art collection itself is mixed. Obviously the Irises piece, and a HANDFUL a French impressionist works are impressive. Apparently many more works could have been had had an absolute bargain, and JPG demurred. Don't go expecting to see the quality of Art that you will find in some of the finer art museums in the world. Given the setting, it's really not that much of a disappointment, yet don't let your imagination run Riot when you hear it's one of the top art museums in the world. It is and it isn't.It is interesting to observe the effect the place has on the people that go, many of whom have to be locals. They seem to be elevated by what they see,, and a little embarrassed if they come in Tattoos flip flops and too casual clothing. Since a museum is supposed to inspire and elevate, it is amazing to have the doors of the Getty thrown open to so many people who are impacted by it. Be sure you have enough time to wonder about, and possibly take in a meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomoBobo
50,"The Getty Center - Winter, Summer or Fall","The Getty is a great day trip for locals or out-of-towers. Beautiful views. Excellent docent tours and exhibits.

However once there this beautiful museum set up in the hills is worth the visit if just for the views..The gardens are small but the museum makes up for it on size alone. Lots of great exhibitions to see and as it's free I would recommend giving this place to go if you've got a few hours to spare in L.A..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cher02
50,Extraordinary views,"My family and I visited this museum while we were in Los Angeles area on vacation.It was a lovely setting which gave the visitor amazing views of the topography of thelandscape. There was beautiful gardens and sculptures all around you.There was many exhibits to see, but the important ones to me were the French Impressionists....also the Turner paintings. I also enjoyed the David Hockney exhibits.Would have liked more time to look around but we were on a tight schedule with this being our first visit to California. This place is a must see attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artistgirl1129
50,Speechless!,"First of all this place could charge $25 per person but it's FREE! All you have to pay is a small amount for parking ($15) for all that you get to see. You can spend hours here as there is so much to see. I can not believe that it took me so long to finally visit this amazing place. There is a cactus garden, statue garden and a beautiful flower garden. There are 4 parts and different levels to the museum itself. My favorite is the south building as it has furniture and other things for the house. There are many places to sit and take in the view and they also have a very nice restaurant with some other eateries also. This time we did not have the time to visit the Getty Villa ( free parking with your paid parking here ) but we will for sure the next time around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshaneel
50,Beautiful complex makes up for a few suprises,"I had been recommended to go to the Getty while on a weekend trip to LA. I didn't research ahead of time and just followed the street signs to get there.First suprise was taking the road under the overpass which placed me in a line for a paid underground parking lot with no option to turn around (cost for parking was $15). After parking I made my way up the elavator and followed the crowds into what turned out to be a lineup for a 30 minute wait to take a tram up the hillside to the complex. The line is outside but they put up large umbrellas to keep people from the sun which was nice.The tram was a quick ride, and lets you out into the truly gorgeous white marble/glass/water featured Getty Centre. Could have spent the entire day wandering in and out of the buildings that featured amazing art as well as the grounds which featured a cactus garden, not to mention the restaurants. Unfortunely I only had about two hours to spend there (including time spent in the line) so decided to limit my time to 3 of the wings and a bit of time in the garden.I would say even if you only have a few hours of time like I did that you visit this wonderful centre that has amazing architecture and worldclass art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlFromSask
50,Beautiful with Lots to See,"I love this museum! Gorgeous inside and out with amazing art and a wonderful garden and lawn for picnicking, You can't beat the free entrance fee (if you park on their property). Great place to bring the kids too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/setbutterfly
50,Its free (except parking is $15),Awesome place! So cool just to walk around and check out the views and architecture. I highly recommend it. They don't' have a ton of art but what they have is great and the buildings are so cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8116HNanne
50,The most spectacular free museum in L.A.,"This magical museum is a must see if you are in the L.A area.I highly recommend it.Had a great time.walking exploring.The outside garden was astonishing.The Tram to get to the garden was a nice ride w a gorgeous view of L.A. and expressways.The art.the sculptors.The panoramic views,the atmosphere was all spectacular.Worth going back to visit this place again.L.A.has wonderfull climate too enjoy too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emberte2015

50,Great Family Visit!,"We met my cousin and her family at the Getty Center and had a great day looking around the museum and touring the garden area.....it's beautiful!! We were also very happy that it was right off of the freeway, so we didn't have to worry about traffic.You do have to pay a parking fee, but it is well worth it. They have a nice tram that brings you from the parking area to the Getty. We also grabbed a bite to eat at the museum. They have a few different restaurants with different price ranges. We ate at the middle price-range cafe. It was a little pricey and the food was okay. They have nice home-made items, but we weren't too impressed with the taste of our food. Next time, we will enjoy the garden & museum and eat else where.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyleigh40
50,Go there! Just do it,"One advise: go! Also if you are not a art lover. This is an amazing place to wander around. Especially on hot days. Great view, great garden, great art collection, What's not to love. Big bonus: no entrance fee, you just pay $15 for the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831hilmarm
50,My first visit,"This was my first visit to the Getty Art Center. It was very well designed in terms of where everything was situated. The tram from the parking lot to the main center was very efficient. The views from different parts of the art center were pretty neat but it was not a clear day (a rarity in L.A to find a clear day).The art collection is quite a range. Parking was $15 but the museum is free which is really nice. When you are ready to leave, it is a good idea to find a pay station off the tram rather than the long lines after you get off on your parking level; at that time, it seems as though everyone is waiting for the the paying station. The restaurant was nice but on the expensive side. Food was very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9325QMsusant
50,It takes hours to see but it's worth it,"I highly recommend the visit to The Getty Center. You could be there all day. The most interesting painting is Irises by Van Gogh, but there is much more to see. The architecture of the building is interesting and the garden is beautiful. Offers great view of the city. We ate at the buffet and the food was good, not expensive. It takes some time to get in the center, so plan at least 30 min extra. You will park in parking garage at the bottom of the hill, the elevator takes you to security center (we waited 20 min in line) where your bags will be checked and then the train takes you to the Getty Center. I highly recommend this museum. The entrance is free, but you pay for the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abeillesgee
50,Great View..Easy Team ride..only $15 per car,This is a must see when in Los Angeles if you want to take on the city from a high point and then see world class art. The art on exhibit is fabulous from renowned painters and sculptors. We could have been there for hours more as it was incredible.Loved it and would return!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridawithKids
50,A must visit when in LA,"So fitting that my first ever TA review is for The Getty Center. I fell in love on my first trip, went back a second time, and have literally dreamed of going back again. Stunning views of LA, fabulous gardens to stroll through, amazing architecture, fascinating art that goes on and on... this place has it all and it's FREE. (Well, free to get in, not free to park.) You can stroll through at your own pace, take a guided tour, or take an audio tour (tours are also free). Plenty of new/temporary exhibits to keep it fresh visit after visit. Next time I'm going to leave more time and just sit in the gardens, soaking up the ambiance. I consider this a ""must visit"" in LA, and a refreshing antidote to everything else visiting LA is about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerishopsandtravels
50,Beautiful,Great spot - not only about the exhibit - the grounds and building all combine with the great view is a great day spend - and take your teenager with you - they will enjoy as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenriB646
40,Lots of Tourists,"We went to the Getty Center on a weekend. This was a mistake. There were so many people there that the time to wait to ride up on the tram was overwhelming. We walked up the hill instead and then were hot and a little tired. All of the headsets had already been given out. We lined up for a tour and did get to do that but they were very crowded. We left the garden tour because the crowd was so big that we could not hear the guide and felt it was a waste of time. I feel it is best to go really early or during the week, so that you can have more of the services.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,The genuine article!,"The genuine article! The place is over-the top grandiose, but it’s worth coming here for the panoramic views of the coast, LA, environs, alone. And the art (superb collection) is beautifully displayed and intelligently arranged. The café and restaurant both have excellent views. Make a reservation for the restaurant ahead of time, there can be long waits. Food and service at the restaurant are topnotch, but it’s not cheap. Admission is free but it costs $15 to park. We Ubered over from Hollywood and at the pool rate it was cheaper than parking (and we didn’t have to wring our hands over which traffic jam would be least vexing!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roy-Tto

50,The most beautiful museum in the country,"It doesn't get any nicer than The Getty Center. You overlook the hills and valleys of Los Angeles and at the same time have the privilege of viewing first class art right next to you! Where else can you be within 2 feet of priceless works by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Manet, Gaughin, and so many others. The luncheon at the restaurant was superb! We could have stayed at the Getty for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GM-FLA

50,Lot of interesting pieces,"Even thought it feels like 40 plus degree out there but for some reason The Getty Centre feels like oasis in the desert. The place is beautiful and the breeze makes you want to stay there forever.The place is clean, very organized, and you do not feel as crowded like any other museum. It is an awesome place to visit if you're into history and arts.If you have tight budget this place is free except the parking for $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8953UNtimc

50,Not the biggest art people but we loved the Getty,"We don't tend to go out of our way to visit art museums when we travel but we had heard enough about the Getty to want to check it out. What a fantastic place! Even if you don't look at a single painting or piece of sculpture you will appreciate the setting on the hill, the architecture of the campus, and the beautiful gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCM99
50,My favorite museum,"A visit to the Getty will not disappoint. Whether you appreciate their art collection or not (lots of impressionist and other traditional visual art and sculpture), the view, architecture and general feeling of escape from the LA heat, cement, and traffic is week worth the trip. There is a parking fee but the museum is free. It's a wonderful asset for the city and a wonderful environment to soak in for a day or a half day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schrodster
50,Free except for the parking,Fantastic place to visit. If in LA you should visit if nothing else the view. The art is fantastic and the self guided audio devices are free so even if you don't have a guided tour the audio aids will let you get the facts on the art you are looking at,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesS488

50,LOVED our visit here!,"We spent a full day and loved every aspect. We took two free tours, which we would recommend, including a garden tour and architecture tour, and loved perusing the galleries. We had a lovely lunch out on the patio overlooking the gardens and couldn't have been more pleased. Great views of LA and the Pacific. Such a great place for art, garden, or architecture enthusiasts, or anyone looking for a nice museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takingtea
50,Amazing view to the Pacific Ocean,A wonderful architectural achievement just from the outside. going inside for free one is amazed at the views over Los Angeles (of course it must be clear day) and also the exhibitions it self. some special exhibition one has to pay. Getting there it is advisable to book in advance. One can get there by car and that to park for a small fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeschilling22
50,Something for everyone,"Let me begin by saying that I am NOT an expert in the arts. If you're anything like me, no worries - they have something for everyone at the Getty. I live about half an hour away, so I like to visit mainly for the peaceful environment and beautiful garden. The Getty Center's buildings are interesting and fun to look at on their own, and you can spend an entire day just roaming around the grounds. They have many activities for children, too. I've visited many times with family and friends and there is always something new to see. The restaurant has a nice view and outdoor seating area; try to make reservations in advance. My friends and I visited the Getty a few weeks ago and all we did was pose for pictures with the view of Westwood and Los Angeles as the backdrop. We were not the only ones! Also, I get my parents tickets to some of their shows (musical performances, readings) and they always have a great time. Sign up for their newsletter to see the calendar of events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyab617
50,Stunning... Very surprising,"I am not easy to please, but this was a major surprise in terms of the arts. The only negative was a picture exposition that should have NOT been there. The paintings were STUNNING, the Louvre/Versailles decors were exquisite. Stunning view over LA. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenbD2045PY
50,Great,Impressionist paintings and sculptures. Beautiful gardens with excellent sculptures. Great museum that's free to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH214
50,Well worth the time and effort to visit!,"The outdoor gardens are my favorite with the amazing architecture and views. I recommend taking a guided tour since they explain the history behind the designs. The Getty is free which is amazing! Parking costs, but it's a fair price. Take an Uber there to save on cost. The PB & J sandwich was less than $3.00, so an inexpensive lunch is possible at The Getty. Lastly, the exhibits are vast and seeing famous works of art up close and personal is life changing. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellebE2271RY

50,Spectacular!,"A way to spend a wonderful afternoon in Los Angeles. From the garden down by the tram station right thru the views to the ocean from the museum itself, the architecture of the Getty is without compare. You can spend your entire time just taking in the surroundings, textures, views, terraces, water features and gardens, but don't miss the galleries. The collections and exhibits are top notch and shouldn't be missed. All of this and the only charge is to park the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omc3

50,A Must See When In Los Angeles,"I live in Los Angeles, and this is one place I have gone to time and time again. It costs (I think) $15.00 to park, but the museum and all it has to offer is free. Paul Getty left Millions upon Millions of dollars to spent for this museum. The buildings themselves are beautiful, sitting atop a hill. On a clear day, if you stand on a balcony of one of the buildings, you can see the coast to downtown Los Angeles. (Ask a guide where this spot is) This museum is filled with all kinds of art..from paintings, to amazing tapestries and intricate very old furniture, to sculptures from ancient times. I love just walking around the outdoor corridors and separate unusual gardens. Plan to spend a full day here. The Getty offers free tours of the buildings and gardens. They have a lovely cafeteria, and also fine dinning (which is not always open..check before you go). There is a tram that takes you from the parking area to the top of the hill where the outside walking areas, and amazing museum buildings are. Be sure to see the movie when you first come it. It will give you a good introduction of what you are about to see. I love this place!! Come alone, come as a couple come with friends and family..There is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5251NMkathyg
50,One of my favorite places in LA.,"Can't say enough good things about the Getty Center - or the 405 Getty as the locals call it. From the beautiful gardens and fountains, the views of the ocean (on a good, clear day), the free lectures and concerts, and of course the art and special exhibits, the Getty is top notch. Sometimes we go just to hang out on the grounds. Truly Camelot in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdunn308

50,Unique experience of European art in Los Angeles,"This place should be on the very first or second location that any travel guide recommends. Offers day out of heat and dirt of Downtown or Hollywood, great panoramic views over the city, and a vast experience of true Old World charm. The latter I found especially calming and healing the homesickness any European alien in California may get. You can take your blanket, as there is lawn area to lounge, cafes and restaurant make it an easy day-long destination. Be sure to check their calendar for concerts, talks, workshops and changing exhibitions not to miss interesting additional learning experience. And all that with full public access, free of charge!

50,Getty Ctr & Villa -- NOT TO BE MISSED,"The Getty Center is a unique ""museum"" in Los Angeles, and one of its best. Admission is free, however, parking is $15. (Note however, that your parking fee is good for admission to the Getty Villa in Malibu on the same day as well). The collection is somewhat eclectic, and there are usually one or two special exhibits. But the place itself is reason enough to visit. Perched on a hilltop it affords a wonderful view of the Pacific from various terraces. Dining options include a really lovely restaurant (a little pricey, but very good quality) as well as two different café venues. This is a place I often bring visitors to the area, and also go myself 2 or 3 times a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rooz

I see large families on weekends, picnicing on the grass. Beautiful garden, with structures made from recycled metal - works of art within a work of art. I love the place. I always make a day of it as there is so much to see, have lunch, see more art, walk the garden and enjoy a coffee.

Once you arrive, you'll have the option to have guided tours, or just mingle around on your own. The guided walking tours, are very informative, and you move around a bit quicker, stopping at various points. There are food and snack carts, along with drink carts, which some contain alcoholic drinks such as beer, out in the middle of the Center. You will also find a lot of covered tables to relax and eat. You are welcome to bring a picnic lunch and enjoy the tables, or go sit under the trees in the grass. If you like to shop, you will find various gift shops throughout.

50,A must for visitors to Los Angeles,"This huge museum complex is situated atop a hill overlooking LA. You can either walk up or take a tram. Several buildings are interconnected with two levels. The upper level has paintings and the lower had art objects, statues, and furniture. However, the layout is what makes this museum spectacular with gardens and terraces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaroncopland

50,"Brilliant architecture and collection, also free","This is a must see in LA, incredible collection of paintings, sculpture, artefacts, furniture, etc. All housed in impressive and sympathetic architecture. The number of items is not overwhelming so you can see it all in one visit, then chill out in the garden. We also did the architecture tour which was interesting. There is a decent but busy cafeteria and other food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grommet22
50,Otherworldly,"I spend a pleasant sunny June afternoon here. Well organized parking ($15 upon exit - museum is free) and easy to make your way to a modern tram that takes you steeply up the hillside. When the doors opened, I felt as if I had been transported to another world. Modern architecture, clean white lines, sculptures and pools. Most of the buildings surround a pleasant central courtyard. Many places to sit and enjoy the view. Friendly and helpful staff. The exhibits were varied and interesting. Watchful staff in each room were kind in their reproach of folks getting too close or using flash or having food or drink. The outdoor spaces were as interesting as the indoor art. Formal and informal gardens mixed with a close cropped lawn where people were encouraged to lounge and children rolled down the hill. As I was reading the utopian book ""The Circle"" at the time, my visit to the Getty Center architecture complemented what I thought the campus in the book would be like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CO911dispatcher

50,What a gem,Viewing extensive framed art and the garden took up the 3 hours we had. Wish we could have seen more. Hard to believe a resource like this costs just $15 to park. To see paintings and sculpture by the masters themselves is thrilling. The garden is incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davenewton
50,Great Building,"The architecture and the gardens were excellent. I'm not a big fan of the 17th and 18th century art but did enjoy quite a few of the pieces. Parking is $15.00, tram and exhibits are free. They have a few gifts shops for cards, souvenirs and some fancy artsy items. The Medusa plate was wonderful and I enjoyed the bronze statues and the intricate inlay pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MettaMoon

50,Beautiful place to visit!,I didn't know this place existed until my sister mentioned it to me. It's a beautiful center for art collections and is founded by the famous J. Paul Getty. The architecture of the place was an amazing setting for the wonderful paintings and statues that surrounded us. It is certainly a hidden gem in Los Angeles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azpinoyinmesa
50,A few good paintings but amazing architecture and views,If you have looked at a lot of art then the stuff here is mildly interesting. However the architecture and views are amazing and the staff were really helpful and polite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanjaap

50,top 5 in LA,"Blow you away, with the sheer design of this mecca, feels like you could be in Greece or Dubai.

50,"If you're not into art, I wouldn't go out of my way for it...","I'm not into art, but we were in the area and had time to kill. The architecture was wonderful. I went on an architecture tour and enjoyed it. Didn't even check out any of the art galleries. We only stayed for a couple hours. I'm giving it 5 stars because it was free. It was a nice way to fill a couple hours, but I wouldn't have wanted to go out of my way for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginap426
50,Amazing,"Went here with a colleague who came to visit for a day in Los Angeles. The place was amazing, the art was just so brilliant. They provide you with iPods that give you information wherever you are in the facilities, (i.e., the history of each panting ect). The indoor and outdoor attractions are both amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephengV9078KB
50,Amazing architecture,We spent a whole day in the wonderful museum and gardens. The museum building is an architectural masterpiece with plenty of space and light and the gardens are amazing. The artwork presented is also beautiful. Although we are from Europe and have seen many museums we enjoyed it very much. I especially liked the impressionist collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520majav
50,Plenty to offer!,"The headache of traffic and parking melted away when we stepped off the tram one Saturday evening summer at the Getty Center. People - presumably locals - had set up picnics, enjoying the cool weather and gorgeous views surrounding the Getty campus, while watching a band perform on a colorfully lit stage, part of a summer series of music. It felt like an added bonus. The museum was open late that night and parking was at a discount since we arrived after 3pm and the galleries had so much to offer. Great temporary exhibitions, which included a tribute to David Hockney when we visited, and an enormous permanent collection that boasts many of the greats. Family activities and sketch rooms. Outside, you can stroll the walkways around the building for some of the best views of the Los Angeles skyline, particularly when the wether is just right. We have been to a lot of museums before, but we're thoroughly impressed with the Getty and hope to return some time soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longstrangejourney
50,So much to see- a place for the senses.,"Free event, just pay parking. $15 before 3 pm, $10 after 3 pm. Bring a picnic lunch as the grass is inviting you to stay awhile. The art is amazing!

50,Excelent museum and gardens to spend a day in LA,"The Getty is a mix of a museum with beautiful gardens, with a nice view of the city of Los Angeles. Although the collections are not very large, you can see a great variety of painting, sculptures, old furnitures, very well chosen and maintained.

50,"Free family activity; great for art, history, and architecture lovers","Free entry; just $15 parking fee per car. Exhibits are spread out, so plan out whether you want to do a guided tour or not. There's a guide book if you need activities to do with elementary school age kids. The garden is beautiful and it's a nice way to spend the day. Get there early (it opens at 10) and leave by 3 to get home in 2 hrs (gotta love SoCal traffic) OR do something else around town and leave after traffic dies down, after 7 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C_Stap
40,"Getty Center in LA - Very reasonable cost, and lots to see","I visited the Getty Center for the first time in July of 2017. It was unexpectedly reasonable in cost. You only pay $15 to park a car, and no other entry fees. So $15 for a carload of people can't be beat. Once you park, you take a Disney/airport style tram to get you to the top of the hill and the Center.There are a number of permanent and also some rotating temporary art exhibits, containing both paintings and sculpture. There is also a very nice botanic garden. The architecture of the buildings is very clean and has lots of angles. You are also situated on top of a hill with nice views of the city (if the smog isn't too bad).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerK1932
50,You have got to go!,When the weather is beautiful outside I generally avoid museums. But the Getty Center is a must see even if the weather is fabulous because this museum has outdoor spaces that are magnificent in between the galleries that are spread out around this large campus.Be sure to a lot at least two hours. You'll want to walk around the Gardens and take in the architecture and the views also several ofspots to stop and either have lunch or have a cup of coffee or sparkling water as you sit in the café taking in the view of the mountains and the vistas that take you all away to the Pacific.And then there is the art. Whatever your taste you'll find something here to inspire.Just don't miss it. Wish I could live here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/560SusanT
50,A very impressive site that is well organised.,"The Getty is more than just an art gallery. The architecture and the garden areas are of interest and most people appeared to spend much of the day there. It is a place to relax as well as to study. The art is very good, if a little bit traditional for my tastes as I prefer more modern work, but I would not miss visiting such an impressive place. Even the journey in the train has wonderful views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueKeo
50,"loved it, and it was free.","I am not a museum buff, but this place is great, best of all its free. Lots to see, amazing art works. There are a couple of cafes, had lunch there and the food was really good. If you are sick of the Hollywood hype etc, this is a nice alternative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philippagoile
50,Stunning views - amazing art!,"Although this trip seemed like a ""touristy"" idea to my 18-year-old daughter, we both ended up loving our visit. The Getty Center is totally engaging - from start to finish. The tram ride up the hill is lots of fun, and gets you excited for your visit. The layout of the center is open and welcoming. We walked through the gardens first, enjoyed the views of the city, then went inside to gaze at the artwork. So enjoyable! And the gift shops are great too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjeanned2017
50,A must see in Los Anglees!!!,Stunning! The architecture and grounds are breathtaking and on a clear day you have great views.The art inside the museum pales in comparison to the art that is the architecture of the building. Brilliant!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290robertt
50,The Getty ...,"The Getty Center is a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust. The $1.3 billion Center was opened to the public in late 1997. It is most known for its architecture, gardens, and views overlooking Los Angeles. The Center sits atop a hill which has been connected to a visitors' parking garage at the bottom of the hill by a three-car, cable-pulled hovertrain.It draws 1.3 million visitors annually. (The other location is the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.) This part of the features pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and many many many 19th- and 20th-century American, Asian, and European photographs.The entrance fee is free but if u take a car, the parking fee is steep. 15$ dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanG786
50,Architectural Marvel,"I remember when the Getty Center was built about 20 years ago and what an enormous undertaking it was. I have visited many times over and take the docent lead architecture tour every time because it never ceases to amaze me how the engineers and designers puzzled together such a masterpiece. From the courtyards, promenades and gardens to the buildings themselves, each is a work of art in its own right rivaling those precious artifacts encapsulated within the museum. Each docent has his or her own way of leading the tour so as to draw your attention to something special or lend historical perspective in some unique way.The restaurants serve decent food, albeit on the pricey side. And very often there are live performances enhancing the overall experience. On a clear day the ocean and city views are unbeatable, particularly if you're visiting in winter when our sunsets are spectacular. Wildlife can usually be spotted at dusk as well as a pin-dotted starry sky from atop this heavenly perch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnalicious
50,Amazing!!!!,"So so glad we came here!!! The architecture and gardens alone make the $15 parking fee worth it! This is a full day adventure, so plan accordingly. Also, grab an umbrella if you plan on being outside a lot, you'll need it for sun/heat protection.Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifercZ1027BT
50,Awesome,My wife had always wanted to visit the Getty Center and I finally was able to get some time to take her. What an awesome display of art. We took a tour with a docent and she was very knowledgable of the time period and was able to tell us the subtle differences in the artists work. We could have spent a few more hours there but we needed to catch our flight. We will definitely be going back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcastillo1
50,So glad we went!,"We hadn't considered going there, but last minute we changed our plans to fit in the Getty Centre, I am so glad we did! Amazing views, great facilities and breathtaking art. David Hockney display was there which was awesome. There are free tours throughout the day, we did the architecture one which was fascinating. The gardens are also amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soph_leigh
50,Go!,The views are stunning. The layout of the museum is natural and well planned. The exhibits are well designed. The tours are informative. The price is right. A perfect way to spend an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290veronicar
50,Fantastic art museum,"I can't really add to what's already been said about this fantastic art museum. I love the exhibition spaces that have clearly been thought through to the smallest detail. The building itself is a work of art, and its location is stunning. An amazing achievement in planning and design. The iPad based audio tours are pretty good.Parking is below, while the main exhibition spaces are reached by a monorail that actually levitates. You'll have to try it to appreciate it.Good eating venues are available that seem to be able to cope with the crowds. Good book and gift shops with a good range to tempt all ages. Prices are not inexpensive, but what do you expect.There are very good tours around the building itself, but be aware of the heat. Some areas are really a sun trap and you'll quickly over-heat! Make sure you borrow one of their sun-umbrellas!An absolutely must-see day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevedT2623MW
50,The walk is definitely worth it.,"A visit to the Getty Center on a hot and sunny day in the summertime can be an exhausting experience, but it is most certainly worth it. There are many galleries where one can sit and contemplate the wonderful works of art or just watch the fascinating crowds. We were there to see the current exhibit, ""Eyewitness Views, Making History in 18th Century Europe."" By all means, take the free guided tour of the exhibition. The lady who led the tour was very engaging and gave us insights into what we were seeing in these paintings. The collection consists of paintings that were commissioned by wealthy nobles who wanted remembrances of their travels on the ""Grand Tour.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570cliffn
50,An absolute must,"This place is so fantastic, beautiful and first class art, wonderful architecture, nice views over LA, an oasis in hectic LA. Even if you don't like art this place is top. We really enjoyed! And the good thing, it's free (besides parking, $10-15)!!If I come back to LA, this museum is on my number one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeBartman
50,Amazing museum,"This museum is very big, very modern and has very intresting peaces of art. We spend there whole day, and still haven't seen everything. Park is awesome. Everywhere is lifts, if you are too tired to take stairs. Guards are everywhere, but they are polite and do not disturb. One time I missed ""no photo"" sign, and I've been warned - but that's it, no bad feelings. I would very recomend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/925mantasg

50,An amazing place,"A stunning hilltop location for this wonderful free museum. The building itself is a work of art and the landscaped gardens filled with sculptures, a delight. Car parking is 15$ which is good value.The little tram service to the centre is very welcome as it is high up and views from the many levels at the Getty have been very designed and are gorgeous.The art exhibitions are varied and have something to interest everyone, there is always a changing exhibition. Different kinds of eateries will suit different visitors and the food is good, freshly made when we visited.Lifts allow easy access for all to the differing levels. Go early, arrive at 10 am if you can, as when we left just after 1pm it was getting very busy.A must see in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891janh

40,"Nice views, go EARLY.","Carpark and the tram to up to the Getty Center opens at 930am, carpark cost $15 and that's all you pay. The center opens at 10am, but your free to wander the gardens before.If you arrive at 12pm you'll be queuing for everything, carpark, bag check, tram, entry etc etc. Much more pleasant experience without the queuing.Other than that, it's beautiful building with great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backpacktheworld1980
50,not big but wonderful,"If you are looking to visit a museum/gallery which gives you the feel good factor throughout, this is it. Not one of those large galleries which takes days and days to file through, this is compact but more than enough to stroll around for the day. We attended the impressionist tour - Becky, the guide was fantastic !! Put this down on your list as a must do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjw1310
50,Do not miss it!,"Fantastic experience in a place where harmony is the leitmotiv. The museum is exceptional, not a wide, dispersive one. Every masterpiece was properly located and you can easily follow the itineraries suggested by the guide. But what is really unique is the location and the building: inside and outside every piece of view was a discovery. From inside, the view on the cloud looking the ceiling was astonishing. The view on LA is the framework of beautiful gardens. Do not miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prindotto
50,L.A.'s Masterpiece: A museum for people who do -- and don't-- love museums,"Yes, the Getty Center is a fine art museum. But it scores high simply as a destination, a beautiful place to walk around, stroll through gardens, enjoy the view. Beautiful architecture, fine art and photography are the cherry on top. You don't have to love every exhibit and every category to enjoy a museum, and some of the best are those whose mix of exhibitions are curated to ensure there is something wonderful for a wide range of tastes. When I took out of town guests there and someone quietly groaned, I said, ""If you don't like this, we don't have to stay more than an hour."" Instead, we closed the place. Also, their fine dining restaurant is a wonderful splurge for special occasions. Beautiful room, wonderful cuisine and servers who love their jobs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760AndreaG

50,Overwhelmed with this place,"I have driven by the Getty Center do many times and said I need to stop one day. Finally got back to Los Angeles and decided I have to go this trip. And I was blown away. The setting is beautiful. The architecture and gardens are worth the visit alone, even if you don't partake in the art exhibits. We were able to see most of the exhibits and it is impressive. If you are an art fan, you will need more than one day to really take in all the Getty has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tucsonm2016
50,Massive,"We had only a few hours to spend at the centre, now that may seem not bad for a visit to any attraction but not this one.You would need to allow a couple of days at least to do this place justice.Not only very interesting but lovely gardens to wander around in as well when you feel you need some fresh air. Take time to visit you won't regret it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/574thomasg
50,Quality Cultural experience,The Getty Center is the best art museum in Los Angeles. The architecture of the building is beautiful and the display of the collections is excellent. There are restaurants that are quite good on site. The view of the LA basin is breathtaking on a clear day. Very well worth your time and effort to visit. Don't forget the Getty Villa also. Very different but well worthwhile of your time also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnolds637

Except for a modest parking fee the exhibits are free and the ones we were able to see were outstanding.would definitely return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/czar13653
50,Get to The Getty,"This is a must do attraction if you're in LA. An amazing building with terrific views across the city, beautiful gardens to walk around and picnic in.

40,"Really beautiful place, a bit more than just a gallery","This place is awesome, but hard enough to get to. It's free after you pay the $15 car parking fee. There is a little train up to it and once up there you will get some of the best view available, of LA.The architecture of the buildings is stunning which nice sleek lines everywhere and straights lines to satisfy the eye. I'm not much for art, but I was a little underwhelmed by the art i saw there to be honest, nothing much that I was struck by, but then, that's just may be my ignorance.Anyway, it's not all about art there. The views are spectacular and it's really worth a visit. Bring sunscreen though or you'll be burn alive as it's really exposed up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyman402016
50,A top LA destination!,"As locals we feel blessed to have The Getty Center in our city. It's one of my favorite museums in the world, and offers something for everyone. The architecture of the buildings and the beautiful gardens are reason enough to visit. Logistics and parking take some advance planning, so visit their web site ahead of time to plan your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollyamas
50,Cant believe this is free* !!!,"It's technically free inly because you have to pay for parking. But even at that, the parking is only $15. The Getty is constantly evolving as different exhibits and pieces pass through. My favorite parts were the exceptionally manicured garden, and the sketching room.The pathway of the garden is designed to force you (in the best possible way) to take in different views of it's beauty. They offer free guided tours through the garden that enhances your knowledge during the visit.The sketching room is also free. They select different art pieces and provide you with everything you kneed to sketch. You pick what you want to sketch from their collection and can take your time to practice your skills (or lack thereof).

40,Loved it!,"It's an amazing place, full of history and beauty and it's free. Allow enough time, as there are a lot to see. It's also very nice place to have a picnic among the beautiful gardens. Can be a bit crowded but fun otherwise. The only thing is the security yelling at ppl at the entrance, it's worse than at the airport but thank god it's not a very long check point. Definitely worth visiting though. Once you're inside, the place will take your breath away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JunglePanther
50,A quick getaway from the city,This art museum is one of my favorite places to go In Los Angeles. The parking is 20$ the entrance is free. It's on top of a hill just above the Santa Monica freeway with a beautiful view of Los Angeles. You ride a tram to the top of the hill and get a wonderful view. The museum has a variety of art pieces and artifacts. Lots of European art. Wonderful places to sketch along with a sketch room area. If you like the outdoors this places has a beautiful garden to visit and you can picnic in the lawn. There are always a variety of traveling exhibits and the architecture is amazing. I am very much in love with this place. It houses very well known artists and creates a calming ambiance. It also has a cafe to eat but I haven't tried it yet!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alemk001
50,Awesome!,"This is a fantastic museum with a huge variety of art types and periods. The best part is that it's free, although you do have to pay $15 for parking.The museum campus is very large. I was able to see all the collections (rushing through some) in about 7 hours straight… but I was really tired at the end.Do not buy any apps for this museum. All the art is well identified, and you can borrow an electronic guide at the museum for free.The European at collection, in particular, from medieval to impressionism, is quite impressive.Well worth the visit. Allow plenty of time, or plan for two or three visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gekkosan
50,Absolutely brilliant - a must see,"This isn't just the home of some great art, it's also a wonderful place to visit for the architecture, the stonework, the gardens and the sculptures.

40,Plan Your Visit,"This is a spectacular stop for the architecture, gardens and cafe alone but if you're coming to see the art, plan your visit because it's a bit confusing to find your way around, and the focus is more on current exhibitions rather than the permanent collection. There are several paintings I know they have in the permanent collection that were not on display and we were disappointed (even shown on the map as the example paintings of their era!). The audio tours are free and very well done, so be sure to request one at the main visitors center. The cafe is also fantastic, with an excellent variety of foods available at themed food stations. On a clear day, the views of downtown LA and the posh suburbs are gorgeous. Overall, the center is a beautiful setting, well-worth an entire day's visit (we slipped out mid-afternoon to see the Getty Villa in Malibu, also beautiful). Same day parking is free at the Villa if you show your parking receipt from the Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCSColumbus
50,Plan for lots of time here,"Not only does the Getty have room after room after room of art, it has immaculately manicured landscaped garden areas that can fill up your day walking through. Then there is the spectacular views of Los Angeles and the surrounding area. You only have to pay for parking, then there is the free people mover up the hill to the Getty. If you get hungry the Getty has an excellent restaurant. This is an all day or at least half day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspZ9286SG

40,"What money can, and can't, do.","J Paul Getty came into a lot of money through his business enterprises. This site, built out as a museum after his death, provides amazing views of the city, sprawled down below. Getty was a fan of European art treasures. Problem is, he came late into the game, after England, France, Germany, etc. had placed most of the best pieces into their national collections, as had American millionaires from the 19 Century. What he (and we, his audience) are left with are accumulations of old attic brick a brac, leftovers from a golden age. The galleries are impressive. Less so the ""art"" they hold. No expense was spared in design and construction; 3 x 3 foot blocks of marble were shipped from thousands of miles, each in their own wooden crates and put in place as walls in a floating structure, for example. The tech facilities for storage and access are impressive, as are certain water features and plazas. Certainly worth a day of exploration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronr648
40,Me. Getty had good taste to go with his money.,The paintings and furniture were fabulous. The statues not much. The guards were not nice. Over reacted to close but no touch looking. Mostly spoiled the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6368YRrobertb
40,Excellent museum if you like the arts,"We visited the Getty Center and enjoyed our visit immensely. The architecture is wonderful, beautiful grounds and lots of wonderful works of art from all over the world. We particularly enjoyed the photos exhibit and the Italian Renaissance special showing. Such beautiful paintings by the masters of their times have us pause tp consider what it was like to live in the 1700's. Highly recommended.

40,Absolutely beautiful,"The physical setting of the Getty alone is worth the visit. The grounds, gardens and views are so beautiful at this museum that I could have stayed there all day. We didn't allot enough time there unfortunately, but now that I know better I'll plan for next time. The exhibits were very interesting, the museum is free, but parking is $15. You park and take a tram to the museum so you are at the mercy of the tram schedule, but it went fairly quickly and wasn't an issue. There are a couple of places to eat on the grounds or you can bring your own food; we didn't eat there but might try it next visit. Very glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAJFA1
30,"Great trip, boring art","Went to the Getty Center and had a really fun experience walking around the building and taking the tram. Only $15 for parking before 3 pm and no other costs except for the overpriced food (to be expected). Awesome view and beautiful garden! However the art in this place is so boring and somewhat depressing. The building and garden make for a nice stroll, but the artwork made us wonder what was all the hype about. This place is a landmark, but you'd have to be on another level to appreciate the art. Worth the trip - don't expect to see anything exciting or inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorR1078

The Gety is one of the top museums in the world. There is also a spectacular gardens one can walk through - completely unique and designed for all ages.

50,Magnificent and Visit-Worthy,"Besides the convenience of a people-mover to take you to the museum's entrance, the grounds and architecture clue you in that this is a world-class museum. Before you even enter you will be captivated by great views of Los Angeles, and bird's-eye views of some incredible gardens on the grounds. There are two main floors of the museum, the Plaza level and the Upper level, and both are handicapped-accessible with ramps and elevators. Each level has four pavilions named after the four cardinal directions, and there is a fascinating gift shop on the Plaza level. When you first arrive you are given assistive listening devices with ear-buds, on which you enter the number of what you are viewing to hear an extensive description about it, and easily followed maps. There are special collections and changing exhibits, and the architecture enhances the whole experience, especially with a number of galleries illuminated by skylights. On the exterior there are framed views and ""oh, wow!"" gardens. The first garden is a sculpture garden on the parking level, followed by another which features a desert landscape, a central garden which zigzags and is lined with beautiful plants, and a flowering maze which is absolutely gorgeous. Surrounding the maze, which is made up of azaleas, are visually stunning specialty gardens which are a delight for the senses. Couple this with world-renowned art and you have a 'can't miss this' experience. There is a $15.00 parking fee, however the museum itself is free. There is also a cafe on the lower level, a restaurant, a garden terrace cafe (which closes in case of rain) and two coffee carts on sunny days. In addition to the museum store there is a children's shop and individual gallery shops.All in all the museum is outstanding and the highlight of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneJourneys
50,Oil Be Back,"I was there when it first opened and I've visited on frequent occasions since then. Lots to see and the building itself is a wonder of laser sculpted concrete. With a family you've got about 90 minutes and then your rascals will be done. No picture can do the Van Gogh justice. You have to see it and the other masterpieces in the flesh. Wear sunscreen as you will be walking outside probably for at least 30 minutes. Take your photos with outside sculptures quickly as the docents will be quick to stop you and have fun.The only thing I didn't like was that in some galleries the pieces are shown too close together so the art can't breathe. It becomes almost like fast food art, and then and then and then when each piece has it's own unique beauty and should be savored for itself. I'd go as early in the day as possible and check to see if any events are on as we saw a kids concert on the grass and my rascals really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,"Whatever the exhibit that week, the architecture is always marvelous","The exhibits are always changing, but the real star here are the buildings - the beautiful, light-colored travertine, that sense of being ancient and modern at the same time, the wonderful sense of light and openness. We live near the Getty Center, and always take out-of-town guests there. Choices for food are not great, and are somewhat pricey, so we recommend having some snacks and drinks hidden in one's bag. Enjoying the views and the gardens is a big portion of the appeal. And sometimes, the exhibits are fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monalovesfood
50,Free! Except for parking.,"I enjoy art museums, but usually cannot last much more than a couple of hours. We were at the Getty for 6 hours! Thoroughly enjoyed it. You pay $12 for parking and that's it. Even the iPhone tour devices are free and I definitely advise getting one. It made the museum much more enjoyable.The Getty is actually 5 museums and the gardens. Each museum is of a specific part of the collection, but none of them was overwhelming. We probably spent 30-45 minutes in each, then had a lovely lunch overlooking the Pacific (decent food, too) and took a walk through the beautiful gardens. There are fountains and pools everywhere which made the white, bright, hot landscape of the buildings seem cooler. The setting is exquisite, the architecture is fabulous and the art is amazing. Be sure to see the exhibit on Getty himself to help understand what a phenomenal thing this museum is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedlite

50,Magnificent Dream!,"My husband and I drove to this scenic location where, upon arriving, took a modern tram up the side of a hill. There was little to no wait time for the trams as they run pretty frequently. As we took in the panorama of the cities below us once we disembarked, we were treated to amazing and breath-taking views. The incredibly beautiful structures that comprise the museum collections offered an array of artistic media from the Renaissance to modern according to each period. There was so much to take in that we actually ran out of time to see it all. This museum offers more than a full day of culture and creativity that we really must visit again soon. My favorite pieces came from the neoclassical period where we were treated to an array of sensory overload in terms of color and texture. I only wish I could touch everything as I am a very tactile learner. Yes, much of the art (paintings, sculptures, and even historical furnishings) are wide open to view up close and personal. Take time to view this museum's massive collections as it merits exemplary marks from everyone from the student of art to the art connoisseur.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciamM8221JF

Start with the highlights tour, which provides a sense of the scope. Getty wasn't keen on modern art, so don't expect to see any. But there's a treasure trove of earlier pieces, and some wonderful Flemish masters, plus the famed impressionist section. There's always a special exhibition, and there's always something for the family. Well done, all of it. Relaxing, and you can set your own pace.

They liked aspects of the children's center, most of it was too young for them to appreciate. We got the complimentary audio tour headsets. We listened to the family tour, but our children were uninterested for the most part. Our 15 year-old's attention was held by some of the exhibits.

I have seen better collections overall in European capital's but the building is very pleasing on the eye and easy to navigate between the wings. They have a tram ride up to the top - you can view the traffic on the freeway you have just fought your way through (like the M25 on steroids but worth the Uber ride ). Views are fab and we had a breeze as it is in the 90's F in LA at the moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuildfordTripper
50,Spectacular Views,"The centre is located at the top of a large hill. Parking is plentiful but you may find yourself going down several levels of the parking garage which is a little annoying. A tram runs up the hill to the center with some good views out the windows on the way up. The wait is not long for the tram even if you just missed it.At the top you will be greeted with amazing views from all sides of the centre, which is larger than it looks in my opinion. There are also several buildings with art and science displays.Unfortunately all we could enjoy were the views this trip since our 1 year old got to the end of her rooe and we needed to head back to the hotel.A few tips: bring sunscreen, know that if you parked in the garage it is difficult to go back to your vehicle so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2628OTmatth
50,"""The Getty""","I visited the museum with my husband and 2 teenagers last May. This place is just beautiful, the views are priceless, they have amazing exhibits, a must do is the garden. There are activities for small children, we had a great time learning at""The getty""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LupitaCalexico
50,Not to be missed!,There are two Getty museums and we visited both. This place is gorgeous and so well laid out. We spent a whole day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14cathyb
50,I still can't believe this was free,"I had such a great day here! From the tram ride up the hill, to the art, architecture, and gardens. It was perfect.The campus is beautiful and the way it is situated on grounds with all of the gardens is worth going to see for itself. Add great art on top of it and it is hard to beat.I love van Gogh and am always super excited to see one of his works in person, and Irises is part of the permanent collection here. Of course, there was a big crowd around it, but if you are patient, you can get up close to have a good look.I really liked that it wasn't just paintings, there were beautiful exhibits of the decorative arts (think furniture, dishes, clocks, etc.), lots of interesting photography, and, my favorite, a collection of illuminated manuscripts that was gorgeous.We took a Lyft from the metro station that dropped us right below the tram to get up to the campus. There are so many gorgeous views once you get to the top.We also ate lunch at the cafe which was nice, and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kfox5
50,The First Wonder of the World,"I have spent so much time in LA< Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood and I cannot believe that I never went to the Getty Center before this trip. The Getty Center is so much more than just a museum. It is free to the general public and so families come with their children, ride the tram up the mountain, and walk through the courtyards and gardens which feature great sculptures - roll down the grassy hill on the side of the structure. Some bring blankets so they can sit on the grass while the kids play in the stream. It reminded me of a walled modern village and all I could think of was how long it must have taken to prepare all of the construction drawings for this incredible environment. The museum displays are so beautifully exhibited. Even though it is said that you can see it in a matter of hours, I would dedicate an entire day for your visit. In any case, make sure that you go. IT IS SPECTACULAR.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895johnw
50,Too much fun for both adults and kids,"If you're visiting Los Angeles, you can't miss this place. The train from the parking terminal alone shows views of LA that you can't see anywhere else. Also the views from the museum can show you a 180 deg from Downtown to the beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAYinLosAngeles
50,Getty Museum,"Since I am a museum buff and love history and art, I really enjoy the going to Getty Museum from time to time. The keep the place very clean and it is a good place to take kids. You can easily spend a day there.In addition, in some exhibits they provide you, for a fee, a head set that explains the various exhibits.The only drawback that I find in going to the Getty is the parking. I feel that they overcharge for the parking; and, finding parking isn't always that easy. However, once you're parked, in my opinion, it is a great experience.And, we have tried the eating places there and, so far, the food has been very good, although a little high for what the provide you; and the facilities are clean.Employees all seem to be nice and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcopQ2910OR
50,Wonderful alternative to overblown attractions,"Forget the popular traps like Hollywood etc - spend a day at the Getty and luxuriate in the fantastic art collection, the great architecture and stunning gardens - and all for free, bar the parking. Can't recommend too highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107kathrynm
50,A quick trip in,"Wow! What a gem! Parking was a slow painful task.However, once in, the place is well planned with elevators and escalators to the tram. You must ride the tram up or walk about 3/4 mile on a slow incline. Lines moved quickly to jettison us to the museum.This museum is FREE. YES. SO COME AND SPEND THE DAY!Great food choices. Lots of lovely landscaping. A succulent garden awaits. The building structure is fluid and stately and floats!I attended the Chalk drawings exhibit. Spectacular when you envision the intricate details these artists can embellish on the paper. Imagine lace details on the sharpest of pencils and to draw and using wet chalk and a pallet knife to carve lines and shadows. Small showing but definitely worth a look. The impressionist salon housed some beautiful Van Gogh and Degas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cookindivarox
50,Getty Legacy Incredible!,"Words cannot express the greatest of J. PAul Getty's philanthropy, this public museum free to all, is a must on any human's bucket list. The parking structure is owned by City of LA and does cost a modest fifteen dollars. Download the Getty 360 app before you go and then plan a full day of exploring...this ever changing exhibits...wonderful day spent gaining some culture, do the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HWH529
50,A Stunning experience. Worth a whole day,"I have visited a lot of museums, in a lot of cities in the world. The Getty is right up there with the very best. Not only the collections (and they are fabulous), but the simple experience of this gorgeous mountain top building, the views, the price (free!), the gardens, and even some free music. We took the time to enjoy the whole experience, and will return each trip to LA. DO NOT MISS THIS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luke2John
50,Stunning!,"The museum is free. You have to pay for parking and then you can either take the tram up, or, you can walk. I suggest the walk it is pretty. They have permanent exhibits as well as rotating ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KGodinez
40,"Great location - oh yeah, there's also some art","I spontaneously went to the Getty Center and really enjoyed the experience. Starting with the quaint people mover that shuttles you from the garage to the Center - benefit: no cars on the hill. The views are amazing and it is a spot to relax, enjoy some nice views and re-energize. The art galleries are quite small - some interesting pieces, but I would generally say you don't go for the art, but rather to experience and enjoy the location and the architecture. Definitely worth a trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rupi3000
50,My Favorite,"I wish I could come here every day. First, the staff is plentiful, organized, and very helpful. Even the tram to the top of the hill to get to the museum was fun. Every where you look are beautiful architecture, art work (inside and out), landscaping, and scenic views. Even the food we got for lunch was good. There is no charge for entry and even the guided tours and lectures are free and plentiful. I loved everything about this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helium571truth
40,Beautiful,We went here not really knowing what to expect. It was very busy but parking was not hard to find ($12 for parking). The tram was a cool way of getting up to the actual museum.The gardens were beautiful and the architecture was amazing. The paintings were cool and so were the sculptures. We are not really museum or art people so it was a bit hard to appreciate all the different works of art but I would highly reccomend for people who love artwork. It is worth it just to see the gardens and scenery though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150jacobm
40,"interesting inside, pretty views/grounds outside","Our visit to The Getty made for an interesting full-day excursion. The grounds are well-maintained and lovely, with nice views of the L.A. area on a clear day. Inside its various buildings, The Getty houses a sizable collection of mostly Renaissance-era paintings and sculptures, with some older pieces (not many) and some slightly newer pieces as well (again, not many). The free audio tour is beneficial and well worth enjoying. Our tour guide for the gardens tour was friendly but ill-informed, telling us virtually nothing that we wouldn't already know ourselves. She was the only ""down side"" to an otherwise nice and interesting visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187hughk
50,Amazing place !! A must visit in LA,We visited the Getty Center and we were Wowed with this awesome sight! The architecture was very modern and the grounds were beautiful. The sculpture garden was a must see! The views of the city were spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norman50
50,Beautiful everywhere,"We are very lucky to only live 15 minutes away, and we have been there many times along the years. I find that every time we visit there is always something new to see. New exhibits, new art, etc. Parking is only $15 per car and that is incredible when you consider prices for other museums around LA. I like to arrive early in the morning, we once went late and there was no more parking so we had to park far away and take a shuttle to the museum. I don't know if they do this anymore, since I make sure to arrive the latest at 11 am. There is a lot to do, and one day is never enough. Little kids love it and they have special activities for them. The last time I was there was during the drought, so all the fountains were turned off, but now everything is back to normal and beautiful as ever. It's nice and cool up there, so during the winter you might want to bundle up. If you go during a very clear day you can also see the ocean. Its a perfect place to pack a lunch or picnic and enjoy it up there. There are sitting areas all over the place, and The views are amazing all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahymapadron
20,Underwhelmed...,"I'm fairly new to Los Angeles and, almost without exception, love going to museums. I've been to quite a few museums throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world. The Getty Center was a disappointment. My low review is based on a few things.First, the artwork is 'good'; It is certainly not exceptional. If you are in the L.A. area, I would instead recommend LACMA, over the Getty, for the quality of the art. Second, it's a trek just to get there. I took Uber. Apparently, that's a good solution because, as many reviewers attest, parking seems to be an issue. Then, once you arrive, you have to take a tram that goes way, way, way up to the whitest, glariest (bring really good sunglasses) plaza and conglomeration of buildings you'll ever see - each of them filled with 'o.k.' art. Finally, the crowds can be overwhelming. I arrived just prior to opening and had to move quickly just to stay ahead of the mobs of people only a few exhibits behind.My conclusion was that this museum was built to impress. It did not impress me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L3290SHkevinm
50,Stunning,"Absolutely beautiful place. Fantastic art and the best view of LA. Even if you are not a big art museum person, the grounds/gardens of the Getty are amazing to see. This is a must do attraction while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Urbarn-Explorer
50,A pleasant surprise!!!,"Was in town with my frat bruhs for a reunion trip and our hotel (Luxe) was near here. We decided to walk. (don't do this..damn near 2 miles of crazy terrain) Once we actually made it to the facility, we avoided the train ride up the mountain and ran. (won't do this again either)But our arrival to the top was worth it. Serene. Peaceful. Artistic. Contemporary. Futuristic. Vintage. All of this and more. The outside decor soothes the soul. The art work in the buildings...masterpieces! It was worth every cardio effort we made! Great view up top too! Everyone is so nice and helpful. White people kept asking were we a basketball team. No! lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deerych
50,Work Conference,Everything about this place was amazing. I had one of favorite museum visit ever. The view going to this place and once you are there is the best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosau326
50,So awesome!,"Start with the view...fantastic! From the Hollywood sign to the entire LA basin...beautiful! I loved the exhibits, looking right at the live sun, seeing the Tesla coil and...the planetarium show was outstanding. We even had a tasty lunch on the patio. Oh, and the Leonard Nimoy Theater was a treat...I felt like he was there. It's a must go especially if you love astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591cathy
50,A must visit!,"The place is huge, so plan on spending more time if you wanna see everything here. I regret that I only had 6 hours while visiting this place in May.The museum has a huge collections. But even if you are not a fan of the exhibitions or arts, the architecture itself, accompanied with beautiful gardens and view from the mountain top is worth for a visit. The stories and history behind the building of this gigantic complex are also quite interesting, and I believe every docent will tell you that on a guided tour.Definitely plan a day to visit here. Getty center is a should-not-miss while you are in Los Angels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cellowu
50,What a great place to visit!,"A wonderful exhibit of artwork in a gorgeous setting. What more could one ask for? I understand they do concerts there too, but not during out visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstauf51
50,A pleasure on many levels,The buildings and collections are superior. Allow as much time as you can and plan to come again to view special collections,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_irjacobs
50,Great,"The place is amazing and Must go in LA .. the views are awsome .. the parking is Us 15 but the entrance is free.. the take you by train from the parking to the museum .. beautiful garden , good restaurant , great place to go and visit .. architecture is awsome , materials used so modern",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ontheroadb
50,You must visit this museum.,The Getty Museum is incredible! I've been there once before and recently visited again. I was blown-away both times. The collection is amazing. There is so much to see. The setting is gorgeous and the place sparkles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGD007
30,A bit forGettyable,The Getty Centre is a wall laid out gallery but the amount and importance of the art isn't as good as a large gallery in Europe.Architecturally the building isn't overly stunning although the tour guides make a big deal of what a great building this is.Overall The Getty isn't a must visit but is probably worth it if you have some time to kill. Also note that entry is free but parking is $15 and fairly unavoidable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
50,Must Visit,"If you love art and everything about it, The Getty is a must visit. Apart from the art museum and Paul Getty's collections, the gardens give you that feeling of peace amidst the crowd and the bustle of the city. A bonus is the breathtaking views of the whole of Los Angeles below. We all enjoyed the place, kids and adults alike. Oh and there's a family room where the kids could draw, explore and make their own masks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843thereseg
50,Great museum and beautiful gardens,"This is a huge place, you can find there a beautiful architecture, excellent collection of arts, amazing gardens with increible sculptures. The view of the city of Los Angeles is like a postcard; usually they have music alive....you can pass a family day unforgettable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioaliaga
50,Beyond expectations,"This was our main destination for a short trip to LA; bucket list item. First time visit to the Getty and we are joining the chorus of people singing the praises of this place. The art, the architecture, the staff, the amenities all were amazing. Simply put, this is an experience not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe85207

40,Great museum with nice gardens.,"The museum was pretty good - I enjoyed spending hours at this place, strolling through the beautiful gardens, open spaces and the breathtaking views of Los Angeles. The center is free unless you are parking at the Centre ($15 per car I recall) and you can choose to walk 10 minutes up to the main area or take the tram up. The museum had some pretty cool exhibits spread across the 4 buildings with the French decorative arts exhibit being the most impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937winnies
40,Never been to the Getty before,"Chose to go to the Getty since admission was free but I think parking is like $12?Beautiful grounds, nice art inside small amount of 'modern' art, more classical. Still, it was a nice outing since it's been years since I've been to an art museum. (And I was an art major in college)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loniy809
50,A great Museum and two tips for visiting,"There's not much I can add re visiting that hasn't been discussed here ad infinitum but I thought I'd share a tip when visiting the Center with you. My family and I have visited the Getty about 6-8 times a year for many, many years. My first tip is to bring your own lunch and either picnic on the lawn (not my fave) eat on the Terrace level where their ""lower"" priced restaurant is located. You can sit at any table in an area which is pretty much protected from the elements and enjoy yourself after/before touring the museum. My 17 year old son and I have been doing this since he was 3 years old. It's a great way to relax and enjoy time with your children. My second tip is for families. Start your visit to the Getty with a stop at heir family center. This is a really fun and art related activity which gives your child a chance to move around and not be bored. We would almost always start here and then proceed to the regular museum for an hour or so and then either go home or enjoy our lunch and people watching. Only one drawback though: This really only applies to the U10 set so be advised. Enjoy your stay at a great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,Exceeded expectations,"The Getty Center set on top of a hill is a stark white contemporary architecturally designed building and I thought that the galleries would be in the same vein. How wrong I was! There are beautiful galleries themed to particular periods of art and genres. We took a one hour guided tour (free with entrance if you wish) to see some of the highlights of the gallery and then wandered around on our own for a few more hours. We could have come back again and again because there was so much to see. Even though there are artworks worth billions of dollars, the galleries and the staff ensure that there is a nice relaxed atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jowX5232YF
50,Wonderful Garden Tour,My wife and I had visited the Getty Center 20 years ago and enjoyed it. This time we decided to take the free hour-long garden tour which included a short introductory segment about the building's architecture. We found the garden tour to be incredibly interesting and beautiful. The gardens were created by an artist with the help of a landscape architect. The participants asked such interesting questions that the tour ended of taking an hour and 20 minutes. This tour ended up being one of the highpoints of our vacation. This tour is offered several times throughout the day. There also is an separate architectural tour that takes an hour which is also offered throughout the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MysticWay15
50,great museum,"very grandious, stunning structure and beautiful place, with gardens, open air sculptures and fine art collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcosh742
50,As good as any European museum,"Multiple buildings filled with pottery, painting, statuary and other treasures from Europe and the USA that were collected by J.P. Getty or donated by others to this fabulous museum. The views of greater LA are spectacular. Museum is free although parking is $15 but this also includes parking at the Getty Vila which is about 10 miles away and well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolW186
50,Lee,"Spectacular views of Los AngelesFrom the city to the ocean and beyond all the way to Catalina. Gardens are fantastic. Buildings gorgeous. The art collection is exceptional. There are also great exhibits that of course vary from time to time. The tram ride up the side of the mountain into which The Getty Center is built is a magnificent way to view Los Angeles. It is quick and immaculate and done in an orderly fashion. I believe there is free parking across the street. Also one should eat at the gorgeoussit down outdoor restaurant with good service and unparalleled views. Food is fresh,creative and delicious. Also have carts and if I remember correctly places to purchase food to sit anywhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLKYB
50,"Lovely place, even if you don't like art","The Getty Center is an amazing building on top of a hill, overlooking the entire Los Angeles area. Entrance is free which is great, but parking is $15. A small train takes you up the hill. The building itself is very beautiful and so is the garden. And the view is amazing! So even if you don't like art, it's worth the visit. Unfortunately some parts were closed during my visit, so I wasn't able to see the expositions I wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64jv
40,Afternoon with 8 kids and a scavenger hunt!,"Through Watson Adventures we scheduled an afternoon scavenger hunt for our boy and seven of his friends. We took an Uber so parking was a non-issue. The line for the tram was long but moved quickly: wait time was about 20 minutes. The museum is of course breath taking: panoramic vista outside almost every building, the buildings are visually stimulating, and the art is very good. I prefer the collection at the Malibu Getty but this is preference only as the collection at the Getty Center is amazing itself. Watson Adventures was organized and the hunt fun. The final scoring was odd but the boys had a great time which is an accomplishment in itself since this was at a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_leland_
50,Getty and Martini's,My girlfriends and I spent the whole day at the Getty Center and did not get to see everything. What a wonderful place with a beautiful view. I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinegridonatelli
50,Fascinating place,"We recently spent a few hours at the Getty Center and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I am not a huge fan of the arts but the docents really brought the paintings to life with their educational tours. If you want to learn more about art, be sure to attend some of the walking lectures. Also, if you have to be back down to the parking lot at a certain time, be sure to leave plenty early enough to wait in a long line to board the tram!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KipDylan

The Getty is a breathtaking physical space with drop dead views of Los Angeles from downtown to the ocean, incredible architecture by Frank Gehry, never before seen unique landscaping , a restaurant with massive glass walls and first classDining, and some of the best tour docents anywhere.The collection of art is personal, diverse , ever changing. You are more likely to see a renaissance painting as opposed to surrealism orImpressionism, but the Getty does not disappoint . Take the white tram up the hill and your art adventure begins. Go at sunset and you'll view Los Angeles with new eyes awash in beauty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaKnowsTravel

50,EVERY time you're in LA,"The Getty Center should not be thought of as a one-off place (see it, be amazed, check it off your bucket list). This is a place to go every time one has a chance, in my opinion. There are constantly-changing exhibits and admission is free except for the parking charge. Their photography collection is one of the best in the world, and there are multiple new photography exhibitions each year. The architecture and grounds are equally interesting, so make sure to take the time to really look around you as you visit. On a clear day, the views of metro Los Angeles are wonderful. The fine-dining restaurant is superb for an institution like this (see separate reviews of it), so I always make the time to have lunch in conjunction with a visit. If it's your first time, GO! If you've already been, don't forget to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR260
50,Stunning,"We didn't spend a lot of time here, but one could easily hang out here for 4 to 6 hours. We had a reservation for brunch after my nephew's college graduation, so we had about 45 minutes before brunch to see part of the museum. Then after brunch, we spent a little time in the gardens, but couldn't stay long due to a flight someone had to catch at LAX. The grounds are immaculate. Everything is bright and clean. The restaurant was delicious, but we saw people with picnic baskets on the lawn. Beautiful trees, plants, and fountains in the gardens. The restaurant has floor to ceiling windows, so it's really light and airy in there. I'm looking forward to visiting the Getty again soon so I can see more of the museum and stay a little longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trottsky

The place and the gardens are enough reasons to visit this place. I visited this museum about 15 years ago, and it has not lost its touch. I visited it now with my daughter who loved the modern arts section.Food and parking is pricey. We got to the cafe pretty late. The main eating area closes at 3:00 pm.

Great place for a date or family Celebration!Then you as you walk around, you are enjoying a Billion dollar view and a Lifetime of Art Education and History?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
50,Cannot Imagine Anyone Not Liking This Place,"Great art exhibits, beautiful building architecture and grounds and gardens, wonderful talent performing, and very warm and accommodating staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelLover23456
50,A MUST SEE !!,Fascinating history and extremely educational. Spent get enough a good 3 hours there and could not get enough of the place. Great for kids as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter7098
50,"Great place for art, but plan carefully if you have limited time","This place has one of the best art collections and it is going to take at least half day to visit all the sections. The center is on top of a hill and you will have to take the Getty Center Tram after you park your car in the parking lot.If you are at LA only for a day or two, be aware that this visit is going to block a lot of your time and not suitable for a hop-on hop-off visit. If you are not in to art, I suggest you skip this unless you want to check the 'I have been there' box. On the other hand if you are an art enthusiast, I would recommend you drop everything else and plan for a full day at Getty center.After reaching there, I realized that it is far bigger than I expected and I should have planned for a full day to appreciate everything, but I enjoyed the experience nevertheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arunnairtp
50,World Class Hotel in Mountain overlooking the best views of Los Angeles,I make sure to visit the Getty at least twice a year - to visit old favorites and attend special exhibits. The place is simply fantastic - modern and the light features the paintings in best light. That stone facade of the building is simply beautiful especially in the sunset setting. It positively glows. The garden is also beautiful. The restaurant features fine dining with varied menu. I have been there several times and I have never been disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireesp
50,On a Clear Day You Can See Forever...,"We lucked out when we chose a clear day to visit The Getty Center. From the roof top, we were able to see many of the sites of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean. The Getty Center is one of LA's real treasures. It is home to Van Gogh's Irises and Renoir's La Promenade along with countless other masterpieces, sculptures, etc. The architecture and gardens are equally spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2TravelersMn
50,All day,Getty is a wonderful place spend the day there. Like the Prado in Madrid. Many exhibits to see. Get there early to avoid crowds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9543LFmichaelf
50,Not to be missed museum!,"My husband and I love visiting museums on any of our trips abroad or in the states. Every time we visit the Getty we say ""this is one of the most beautiful meuseums in the world - especially the grounds."" Don't miss it. A trip to Los Angeles should include a visit to the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetR822
50,Great experience and not entry fee!,Beautiful facility and a wonderful experience. A must see site if you are visiting Los Angeles. Prepare for an all day visit. Look at website ahead of time so you can plan your visit with the offered tours and events that take place daily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221lindag
50,Great view and people watching,"We went up to the Getty Center just as much for the view as for the art. After parking several levels below ground (took a while - be sure to add 30 minutes for parking/tram) going through security and riding the tram to the top of the hill, we were really impressed by the beauty of the gardens, the buildings, and the view of LA. Some people were in shorts and t-shirts, like us, others were really dressed up. It was interesting to see the mix of people at the Getty and to enjoy the beautiful art and environment. It seems like a nice place to sit and have a glass of wine and enjoy the gardens and view as well as to take in the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmw133
40,On my list of can't miss attractions,"I'm writing this for the out of towners. When they were building this, it seemed so precious and name driven that I thought I would never like it. I waited years before finally going. I loved it. It's just the right size and just for the views alone, it's worth the bother and cost to park. An unforgettable and priceless beyond imagination art collection is just icing on the cake. I don't love the garden but I do like the little stream and waterfall that runs through it.I was very confused by the layout on my first few trips. Here's a hint. ALL the paintings are upstairs. Sculpture, furniture, ceramics etc are all down. The galleries nearest the lobby, up or down, contain the oldest works. The salon furthest out, the West Salon has the newest with the small but excellent collection of impressionists upstairs and the ever changing photography exhibits downstairs.Some recommendations: Go on a weekday. Like most things in LA, it's impossibly crowded on the weekends. Get there early or late in the day if you want to avoid noisy school groups. You can breeze through and see most things in about 3-4 hours but if you're detail oriented leave most of a day free. It's always worth it to take the tour especially the small tours that go in depth on one or two major pieces. I've always found them fascinating and your will learn things that would never occur to you if you weren't an art major. I've gone with about 6 groups of kids and with my own. To be honest, my trips with kids under about 15 have not been that successful. The kids get bored and they make the staff very nervous. If you really want to take your kids, look on the schedule for when they have kids activities planned and let them see as little or as much of the art as suits them while being prepared to say, not these kids and not this day and take them out for ice cream and a romp in a park. As an addendum I'll add that both the Science Center and Natural History Museum in Exposition Park near downtown are MUCH better for kids. Most kids would rather see a real space shuttle or dinosaur than a 14th century dutch masterpiece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KZinCC
30,Quick Stop at the Getty Center,The grounds of this museum is beautiful. The tram ride is nice and quick with very beautiful views. The museum is very beautiful. The only complaint he the security stuff is very rude and took away from the experience. Some of us took the tram back early just not to deal with them. Next time in LA I would skip this stop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618tashah
50,Amazing,"A museum with teenage boys?!?!How will they react. Will they ask to go home after 15 minutes?Not at all! Our 15, 13, and 9 year old really loved it. We moved through the different rooms as a family but everyone viewed each piece of art at their leisure gathering only if one of us was especially moved or touched, or if there were any questions.They were excited to go to the next room and after a very easy 2.5 hours, they started to show signs of fatigue and we experienced the first requests to leave. After a break for a light lunch and snacks we returned to viewing art for one more hour before leaving. The children's section is cute but it is really intended for young kids. (Around age 8-10 max)We have returned twice more since then and each time have had similar experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/befkatela
50,One of the most beautiful spots in Los Angeles!,Some of the must exquisite architecture I've ever seen at the Getty Center. The art on display is fantastic. You could spend hours there. Well worth a whole day trip. I also couldn't get over the views of the city from up there! I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in LA. A must see for both locals and tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y415IZmichellen
50,WOW! Can't miss!,"This place is amazing. The art is stunning, the building is fantastic, the events and tours are great, the views are epic, the garden is a masterpiece! The crowds can be annoying, but that's no surprise given it's incredible AND free (well, parking is $15, still a steal). Even the food is good in the cafes. The exhibits change, this time we visited a collection of 17th century European paintings depicting life at that period, it was an excellent collection with some really interesting paintings. There was a flamenco show, and we went on the architecture tour which was great - we learned a lot. The garden is always a treat, but it can be especially crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaszloP381
30,Worth one visit,"The gardens are pretty cool and the history behind them is worth hearing, so go on the short tour. The exhibits change as in any museum, we saw a very cool photography exhibit as well as some of the impressionist art that is always there. I love that Getty set up the museum and it's free to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdellav
50,Fabulous,"On several visits to LA, we had never visited the Getty - stupid. This is a fabulous museum that appeals to every person of any age. We took the garden tour and learned several new facts. But it is the entire experience that really is sticking with us. We were lucky to see two special exhibits, one by Italian artists and one called Concrete poetry. Really enjoyed them as well as the architecture and gardens. Go there if you haven't!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachers55
50,"A MUST for art lovers, and you won't get bored if you aren't one of them","Things to DoThere's a lot of different halls and sectioned by different genre or time or continent. Wide range of art work no limited to painting/ sculptures/ scripts etc. and Van Gough's drawing is there too and attached to a contract that 'forever belongs to Getty's Museum"" so you can only see his hand drawn piece there.There's a lot of different tours available to join for free. I joined the 'introductory' one and its super helpful as an outsider of art industry. Make sure you reserve 15mins ahead to join the tour at the info desk as its first come first served basis. The tour took around an hour or so and learnt a lot about 3-4 art pieces. The guide was very friendly and happy to take questions, introducing everything in very laymen words so everyone understands.Besides of art work, there's a stunning view when you reach the top of the museum. You can see at least 270 degree of the LA and a lot of pictures can be done.There's also a lawn area that for people to chilled with the sun.LocationLocation is not that far. Its in the middle of the road so don't drive too fast so you won't miss the intersection. Parking is quite full on the day i visited but there's alternative outdoor space to park at the same price - just a bit of walking to do but totally managable.PriceNo entry fee but parking was at a flat rate of USD15 for all day.Time SpentFor normal visitor - i think 2-3 hours would be enough. for art lovers, i'd recommend a day as there's a lot to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giligulu2016

Huge amount of amazing art, sculptures, something for everyone, whether you are into art or not.Amazing views of the city, fabulous gardens to wander around and a great cafe where you get a fresh bowl of pho for a tenner.All this and it's free entry! Do not come to LA without visiting here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gibbo1969
50,A wonder of architecture and style.,"A visit to The Getty Center is a step into the future of museums. Access is from the 405 Freeway where you exit to the Getty Carpark and take a monorail to the center. The building is crisp, clean and stunning to the eye. Te exhibits change but the permanent exhibitions are enough to fill up your soul. The restaurant is absolutely top-notch and has wonderful food, luscious oysters and great service. The stonework making up the walls and steps has the occasional fossil within it on the surface. Kids love this place, they adults enjoy it too. A sunny day here is a great day out for singles, families or couples. Easy access for everyone. Great and helpful staff on site too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grantmccahon
50,Great views and exceptional art,This is a don't miss location if in LA. Plan on several hours. Don't miss the gardens. The architecture rivals the art. Plus it is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrannyD2013
50,The Getty,Wonderful place to visit!! We enjoyed the art exhibits by many different artists. We love the beautiful manicured gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trini85Hilo
50,A special museum,"This is a special place. The collection itself cannot be considered top notch, it cannot possibly match the depth and breadth of the world class museums. But the Getty Center provided an outstanding experience with its free admission, wonderful architecture, excellent audio guide, wide range of guided tours and outdoor performances - all designed on bringing the arts to life and connecting with the visitors. Well done, and well worth the time we spent there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
50,Weekend Visit,"We took a guided tour of the grounds. It started out slow but we hung in there and it kept getting better. We were glad we took it. It added more dimension to our visit to the Getty as more than an art museum.There is a room in one of the buildings, I forget which one, that provides a stunning view of Los Angeles and the ocean. I know many think this is not possible, but try it!We ate in the restaurant. It was good but I think, next time, we will get a lunch from one of the vendors and eat al fresco. We arrived about 10 am on a Saturday and lunched about 12:30. The Getty is so huge that it would still have been uncrowded enough to do that. We left after lunch and the crowds were really starting to arrive. The Getty is big and can handle a lot of people, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trouvaille1355
50,Fantastic art museum and gardens,"If you like art, architecture and gardens you don't want to miss this. The views of L. A. from the Getty are great! The Cafe has many choices of cuisine and what we had to eat was delicious. The museum is free and the parking is only $15 for the day. We didn't have enough time but if we had we could have spent all day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685JimM

50,Beautiful Getty Center,This place is top-notch!!! Not one bad word can be said about the Getty Center. How generous of the Getty's to share all of this beauty with the world.A must-see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMonroe101
50,Wow! This place is amazing!,The Getty Center should be on everyone's list of things to do and see while in the LA area. The complex itself is a marvel and the art collection is outstanding with art from all over the world from many artists anyone would recognize (See the photo of Irisses by Picasso). There are free iPod guides to help explain what you are looking at and find your way around this vast museum. There are also fantastic views of the Los Angeles area. We spent four hours and it seemed like only a short time. Did I mention it is entirely free other than the $15 for parking?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommQ8275AR
40,"Stunning buildings, good sculpture but only adequate pictures.","The architect, Richard Meier, has done a beautiful job fitting the buildings into the surroundings with ease and sympathy whilst creating stunning views from viewpoints. The finish of 30 inch square grids is clever and not boring despite feeling a little repetitive. Gardens are lovely and fit in well. The interior is a series of beautiful spaces used with abandon - so much space that it can be left empty in many places just for effect. The art work on display was, with the exception of some personal furniture and the sculpture exhibitions, disappointing. Mainly poor works by lessor artists except for a few of the examples by Impressionists. Well worth the visit but go later in the morning to miss the initial rush which overwhelms the little tram transport system (and it's a long uphill walk if you don't want to wait in line).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrahamCarter
50,Urban adventure locals on tap in Hollywood,"Tom Dennis was our guide.He brought Hollywood alive for us. He is a very passionate local who enjoys sharing his knowledge with others.If any local approached us to buy something he would say, we are visiting from overseas so leave them alone.Tom also drank non alcoholic beer, that's big news for an Australian.This might be in the wrong place it's not about no 1 on the list of things to do in l.a.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etsu2013
40,An LA Museum with that LA Style!,"What’s great about the Getty Museum may not be the art. The art is nice don’t get me wrong; but after visiting the Louvre a couple times, Musée d'Orsay, Musée Picasso, and the New York Met several times, this museum is not as grand in art but looks grand in its presentation and feel. The experience is good, there is great art, some borrowed, and some donated. The art is great to examine and admire like in most museums, but it feels like a hip, California museum experience. The museum is small in content but comes off as a grander experience. The entirety of the package is a 4.5 star experience as long as it’s a beautiful day and you are ready to eat and relax. You can see for miles on top the hill Getty sits. The layout is splendid and the main café is outstanding. There are two cafes and a restaurant. When you attend, go when the sun is out and there is a special exhibit being displayed. I am a Getty photographer contributor so I went for the Thomas Annan exhibit. I like his style of photography. The dark, murky look of city streets interests me. I specifically like shooting Paris, a place with many moody alleyways. I also caught the Eyewitness Views: Making History in 18th Century Europe. The weather did not hold up, but the exhibit was a 4 star presentation. The layout of each exhibit hall is wonderfully done, but short on content. So just understand, you are not getting the Louvre or London’s Natural History Museum; however, the garden, the food, city views and lack of an entrance fee make this a must see on your visit to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haydaddy
50,Needed more time to take it all in,Girlfriend wanted to see this place and so did I. In LA for a couple of nights back in August 2014. Definitely recommend the walking tour outside. The amount of artwork here is amazing. Unfortunately we were pressed for time so we couldn't really spend the proper amount of time to see everything. Take the kids and they'll love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dougenstein

40,European art in the United States 🇺🇸,Probably one of the few places in the whole world where one can view a wide range of European art and paintings outside the European.

50,Los Angeles must,"I just can't say enough about this place. I've always wanted to go here but on Saturday I finally did. Everything about it is beautiful! The art, architecture, and garden. I just wanted to walk around all day and look at the view! I could've sat on the grass and eat a picnic! I really enjoyed the Concrete Poetry exhibit! so captivating and creative. The Chris Killip photographs were eye opening as well. I enjoyed how he captured moments in everyday life. I especially enjoyed the references to early English punk bands! I will definitely come and visit next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlv

I love the Post-Impressionism and Impressionism, so my personal favorite pieces in their collection were Van Gogh's Irises and Claude Monet's The Portal of Rouen Cathedral in Morning Light.

Also I loved the European decorative art galleries as entire rooms were transformed with period pieces so check it out if you have time. If you're not interested in art, the museum has panoramic views of LA/the ocean and nice gardens to lounge around in. Incredibly well done museum and definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apriladventures
50,A place of artistic excellence!,"I recently had a short stay in Los Angeles and had the privilege of being able to visit the Getty Centre. Unfortunately due to time constraints we were unable to explore all that the Getty Centre has to offer and were only able to view some of the art work and view the gardens from the top of the building. The little taste we had was enough to wet our appetites and wish for more time to enjoy all this incredible place has to offer. We parked in the parking garage some distance lower down from the centre and were speedily whisked up to the actual Centre by tram. A comfortable ride! The buildings boast superior architectural design which create a sense of space and peacefulness and allow for perfect viewing of priceless art work. We were allowed to photograph artwork without using a flash. A view of the stunning flowering maze was possible from the top of the building but sadly we had no time to explore the gardens. The Getty Centre caters for every need in terms of general information, accessibility and refreshment. A definite must if one is visiting Los Angeles - but allow for a minimum of a full day - and perhaps return on a second day to fully absorb and appreciate all it has to offer. It was the highlight of my visit to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61RobertaW

40,Impressive art collection - don't rely on GPS to find the Centre !,"Getty Museum contains an impressive art collection, mainly from Renaissance to Impressionist eras. Highlights included some excellent Van Dykes, Rembrandts, a Bernini bust & Van Gogh's ""Irises"".The Center itself is situated on a hill overlooking Hollywood & Beverley Hills, so some good views from the upper levels of the Center.Entrance to the Getty is free, although parking was $15 flat rate regardless of the length of parking. A tramway system connects the car park to to Center itself, travel time a couple of minutes.Guests driving to the Getty Center should not rely on GPS navigation to get there! My GPS device took me into the side streets of Brentwood, until I came across a sign advising me that my GPS directions were wrong & I should not proceed any further. I noticed a couple of other cars also turning around at the same spot so it was not just my GPS giving incorrect directions. To easily find Getty Center simply travel north on Selpulveda Boulevard until you reach the Getty Center turn off sign on your left, the entrance to the Center car park is a further block or so further on to the left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilbyJ2015

At the top you step into a beautiful and amazing museum complex of modern architecture, museum galleries filled with treasures from Renaissance Italy, to modern photography and an open and airy series of courtyards, fountains, cafes and gardens- all just there for you and your family to explore.

I think its easy to feel overwhelmed here as it offers so much. However the admission is free (parking is $15) so I suggest you take what you want from the experience.

50,A Highlight of Any Trip to LA!,"The collection, the architecture, the views, and the experience as a whole are simply amazing. Without a doubt, our visit to the Getty was the most enjoyable, most memorable (in a positive way) experience we had in Los Angeles. I had no idea the Getty was as big as it is. And I thoroughly enjoyed the Greek and Roman sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNixon2014
50,Lovely art museum,"Spent the day at the center and saw fine art, furniture, glass and ceramic pieces. Beautiful views from up there, too. Had lunch at the little food cart -- decent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M824EAcarols
40,Top of the world,We spent three hours on a glorious spring day at The Getty - this time mostly outside exploring the amazing architectural and landscape design. The views of LA and the Brentwood hills were gorgeous and the wonderful main garden made us gape. A fire in Brentwood that spread over acres with smoke billowing above us was an unexpected addition that actually closed the museum gates.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956kathyl
50,The Getty Center is amazing!,"I recently went to the Getty center while I was in LA. This place is a must visit for anyone who enjoy art, or just a day out to get some fresh air away from the city or touristy attractions!There are lots of treasures to be explore, staff was very friendly, and the view is amazing!It is not to be missed when in LA! Highly recommend!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elmainec
50,Mind BLOWN!,The Getty Center is fantastic! You could easily spend 2 days there. We spent most of our time with the modern art and then relaxing moments snacking on the veranda. The landscaping and views are stunning AND it's free! Pay for parking at the bottom of the hill and take the tram up. Everything about this is worth it and I would ABSOLUTELY return next time I'm in California. We saw the media exhibit and it was incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesT5425RT
50,Great museum -- and a vista unlike any other,"The museum has a great collection and it's well arranged, but the star is the museum itself and the visit. On a clear day one can see the mountains and downtown to the east, and the ocean to the west. And the architecture is fantastic.The three exhibits we particularly enjoyed were the ""Eyewitness Views"" (European history told through paintings), the Impressionists, and the garden. I really suggest the audio tour, and I also recommend you get there early on a weekend to avoid long lines at the tram and for tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott95401
50,Well organized,"Well organized art exhibition in Los Angeles. Comprehensive art show. Well worth to visit, see Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Monet, Manet and many more. Museum is free, like tram up ( takes about 5min) but parking was 15$, after 3pm 10$. The museum is popular, so arrive early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
50,Extraordinary,"This is simply an extraordinary place but it is not necessarily the art on display as the place itself - the setting, the buildings, the gardens.Of course the art is amazing and well worth seeing; arranged in five linked pavilions with permanent and changing exhibitions of art and sculpture.The centre begins at the bottom of the hill with a very efficient driverless train which takes you the short ride up the hill and acts as a buffer, separating you from the hectic drama of LA and the notorious 405 freeway you have just driven on! The buildings are reached from the station via a wide and imposing staircase. The buildings are all clad in travertine, a very light coloured limestone creating a dramatic contrast against the green of the gardens and the blue of the LA sky. The gardens are also works of art.The views over LA are extraordinary from the mansions of Bel Air and Rupert Murdoch's vineyard Moraga Estate to the east to the Pacific off Santa Monica to the west.There is a restaurant and a café - we ate outside at the café and the quality and selection of food was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CIHTravels
50,An amazing collection and absolutely must see!,"If you have the time (if you really want to enjoy the entire infrastructure, visit the gardens, wander around and especially discover all the art, you need at least half a day, ideally even 3/4 of a day), go and visit the Getty Center.I was extremely surprised - very positively I mean - by the infrastructure, the architecture, the grandness of the set-up, the gardens and obviously the amazing art collection.There can be a lne when you go at peak hours, but everything is super well organized.A true must see.For me this is amongst the most impressive and interesting private collections I have seen in the world. It's a total experience and so much more than visiting 'a museum'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
50,King Louis XIV Tapestry exhibit,Beautiful museum looking over the city of LA. $15 to park and take tram up to museum. lovely garden and enjoyed spending time in the Woven Gold Tapestry exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sofiared7
50,Awesome Place - A Must See!,"This is free to visit but you have to pay $15 for parking.The first thing that impresses you is how modern and organised everything is. A lot of thought has gone into the parking, the connecting Tram system and overall logistics of this place. A truly professional job!Everything is spotless. The buildings and exhibits are amazing. Add to that the pretty and colourful garden and you will have an amazing visit.What is really good is the way the exhibits are laid out: You go into one area then come out into the fresh air. Take in the spectacular views, then go into the next exhibition area.Getty has collected art from the Old Masters and spent a country's GDP on what you will see. You will not be disappointed.The whole place is a modern architect's dream. It is obvious that no expense has been spared in creating this huge facility, like something out of a James Bond movie.Did I mention that views are spectacular! Go see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeadlyDD
50,Wonderful,Loved everything about this place. The art is incredible and the buildings are amazing too. A very special place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taskette007
50,"Simply amazing....stunning architecture, views....","I visit this museum every time I come out to LA (at least once a year). It has such an amazingly serene atmosphere inside and out. I can spend an entire day here and leave with the feeling I've spent the day on a different planet.Walking through the Impressionists' room is like going to church...you gaze, meditate, breath slowly, picture yourself sitting beside an artist or meandering through a meadow...it's that calming.I can't even begin to write about the magnificent views from the different levels of the buildings or the splendor of taking in the terraced garden/s. I simply don't have the time or the vocabulary!This is a must-see if you're in the LA area. Next time, I hope to make it to the Getty mansion as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KuriousKat2
40,So interesting and diverse,"Attended the first week that they were open Sent a letter describing things which need to be fixed/in/improved. Received a nice letter back about the suggestions. Why did not those highly paid ""experts"" figure this our themselves?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melr314
50,What an amazing place...and all FREE!!,This was a highlight of our holiday. Everything was spotless and the guides were very knowledgeable.We ate in the cafe and the food was delicious and gave good value for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Islanders_831
50,"Vista, Art, Inspiration and a Bite to Eat","Enjoy a few hours on a sunny day here and you will recharge your soul, your creativity and your love of art. Prepare to walk from space to space and experience the various artistic styles and stances.I recommend planning time to picnic as well. The outdoor spaces are wonderful. Beware of crowded days, so plan around hokidays and field trips for more relaxation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katec433
50,Highlight of our trip,"This place is amazing. We were there for almost five hours and maybe saw half of what is on offer. The buildings and campus are so perfectly designed-there is a new view around every corner. The main centerpiece garden is impeccably designed. The rotating exhibit (Concrete Poetry) while we were there was fascinating. We ate in the sit down restaurant and the food was incredible. Both got the cobb salads and we got a charcuterie plate to split. Great views. The whole museum has great views. Gift shops are top notch with tons of interesting books and gifts. The art was well displayed and there are some famous pieces. As some reviewers have said, the art is almost second to the campus itself. It is all free, though, because of the J. Paul Getty trust, which is AMAZING. Truly, I think it is a bucket list kind of place to visit. I will say that, while it is fully accessible, if you are not terribly agile or in good shape, you won't enjoy it as much. There are LOTS of stairs to climb to get the good views and a lot of walking. Bring a bottle of water with you and sunglasses, as the buildings are pure white and there's lots of glare outside. Also the coffee carts/food close at maybe 2:30 so make sure you don't wait to eat if you need to. Highly highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camellia10
50,Amazing views! Beautiful location! Perfect for families or dates!,I took my mom to The Getty Center when she came to visit. It was a first for both of us and we absolutely loved it!! The art they had displayed was fantastic! The structures were so well done and the views were unmatched! The garden was by far our favorite part and I honestly could've sat out there all day.

50,Art collection at its best,"I am not an artiste and I was never interested in art. A friend of mine suggested me to check this place out. And WOW. The museum is an absolute must for art lovers as well as some one like me. The tour guides are awesome and plan your day well. We started with Architecture tour to be followed by Garden tour and then the Renaissance period up to 19th century. Beautiful collection of Ensor, Monet, Van Gogh (Irises)!!. Hats off to Sir Getty who collected the art as well as funded the institution that the world can visit free of charge. Plan at least two days visits and do not miss the fabulous lunch at the restaurant at Plaza level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/513sharadd
50,Great place to visit a must,"This is a magnificent place, not just for the art but the location is beautiful. The white bright stone that covers the floors is something to see. The views of the city of Los Angeles is great. Also, have lunch at the cafe. This place is also free!! I especially love it when they have events, they're always fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorenaK888
40,"Great building, great design; art is so-so, but worth going","The building is absolutely fantastic, the views are super impressive and the ride up the tram is really fun for the kids. I am not a fan of the art, I don't think their regular collection is that great (at least for my taste), but they do have some wonderful special exhibits that make it worth it.We have done a number of dinners in the restaurant. Service can be great, food is pretty good, but not fantastic. Their smaller restaurants and cafeteria used to be better, but they changed chefs/catering companies and it went very far downhill (affected the more formal restaurant as well). I hear, but haven't been there to verify, that they have again changed chefs/catering companies and the new one is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilshireguy
50,An enclave of culture.,"I have been to the Getty Museum many a times, (I live in LA) and always find the exhibits wonderful. A terrific mix of art from different periods, and some superb statues. This is not the sort of place you can rush through, it's a place to savor slowly, from the different galleries with changing exhibits, to a wonderful outdoor garden. It also boasts superb views of the Los Angeles basin as well as the Santa Monica bay. Entrance is always free, but parking is $15.00.There are some food carts as well as restaurants on the premises. Well worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlC8530VB

50,Getty Center Museum,"Getty center museum it's beatifull, $15 flat fee to park, but no entrance fee to the museum. and , if you go to the Getty Villa in Malibu on the same day, you don't pay parking there.I did find the Villa historically rich with artifacts, but the Getty is a different experience. The views of LA and the art exhibits are all masterful. It's a sprawling facility, so allow time. The food restaurant is terrific but a bit expensive,and the whole place is kid friendly.the grounds are so beautifully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urrutiapatty
50,Breathtaking works of art and a spectacular view of Los Angeles on any relatively clear day,"The Getty buildings are a work of art unto themselves. The gardens are elegant, but breezy and offer wonderful places to wander or pause to take in their beauty and perhaps inspire creativity of your own. There are several nice places to eat or snack - not completely budget-friendly, bot won't break the bank too much either.Wander along the travertine walls looking for fossilized elements - there's well over 1 million square feet of travertine throughout the center so there is plenty to see.Inside the buildings the works of art are awe-inspiring. There is a unique and impressive collection of illuminated manuscripts - each page taking days/weeks/months of effort from it's creators to bring it to life in such spectacular detail. Not to be left in the past, the Getty also possesses an amazing collection of photographs and modern sculptures as well. There are outstanding works from painters, sculptors and decorative arts throughout. Traveling exhibitions are generally outstanding as the Getty is known for finding hidden gems to bring to light in addition to their own immense collection.The Getty has some nice things to engage children (their website has some good tips if you are bringing kids as well) and their grounds alone would impress at any age.Parking is $15, but admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171moniquer

50,J Paul Getty museums,"Both Getty museums, the Getty Center on the hillside west of the 405 freeway and the Getty Villa on Pacific Coast Highway, are unique in their exhibitions and the Getty's own art collections. The architectural styles of each museum are also unique, with the Villa adopting a Classical style that complements its mostly Greek & Roman collections & exhibits, and the Center's buildings reflecting a more modern, streamlined style that fits with the art work exhibited from more recent centuries. Beautiful venues & beautiful art exhibits -- definitely highlights when visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/259SandraP
50,The Must-see Museum,"The Getty Center does it right.Incredible collections in a world-class architectural setting. Beautiful gardens and vistas, amazing exhibits for every taste, without ever feeling crowded. And plenty of places to take a break and catch up bite to eat or a cuppa coffee.

50,A GREAT INSTITUTION,"A trip to Los Angeles is not complete (if you are interested in these institutions) unless you visit the Getty. World class Museum but not if you are interested in modern art (except for Photography). The buildings are beautiful, the view outstanding,the gardens lovely and plan to have lunch or dinner at its very good restaurant (reservations suggested) No charge for admission but parking is $10. A secret. Do a two for one, The Getty and Getty Malibu -25 miles away on Pacific Coast Highway (for antiquities-also not to be missed) pay for parking at one and get free parking at the other -must save your ticket-must be same day.

Parking is expensive however and i have heard that public transport link is not great.Once you are up at the top, you cannot but be in awe of the giant stone tiles adorning the buildings inside and out, the impressive galleries and the superb view of L.A.Go for the view if not for the art.

Feel like doing some shopping? I could go on an one about this absolutely fabulous site that will appeal to an eclectic crowd. We visited with several family members, and while at first some were not too excited to tag along we all ended loving this outing. The setting of the Getty Center is also spectacular with extensive views of Los Angeles. A major cultural attraction that is a feast for the eyes, whatever your perspective might be. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stekie
40,Wish I went to Griffith first,"It is an art museum with a nice garden and an informative garden tour. Great for art lovers, but we spent too much time in there and did not have enough time to explore Griffith Observatory, which is more about astronomy and science. Nice views from both properties and both are free. Secure your own food as cafes close early and are, as in all museums, expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MICHAELTAMPABAY

50,Worth the distance,"This museum is amazing. It's hard to get to it so I recommend taking Uber (they are everywhere). The entrance is free, but if you drive be prepared to pay $15 parking. The museum is enormous. There are all types of art work from painting to furniture to sculptures, poetry. You name it. It's plain amazing! The view from several spots is spectacular. You can spend the whole day walking from one build to another and probably not see all the art work. There are two restaurants. One is a cafeteria style and the other is by reservation only. We ate at the one that required reservations. It was very good, but pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanExpatBaku
40,Beautiful grounds and views,The Getty houses an interesting collection including impressionists paintings and sculptures. The grounds are sprawling and have several different gardens where you can picnic. There is an outdoor sculpture park and a few different food options. Unfortunately no proper espresso coffee which is disappointing. It's free and you arrive by an electric train that takes you from the car park to the museum. Take an uber if you want to avoid paying for parking and a wait to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiec962

50,L.A. Journey,"I arrived at The Getty Center with ease, parked in the parking garage ($15) then caught the tram up the hill. My choice to go on a Wednesday morning found me surrounded by field tripping elementary students, but such is life. The architecture of the museum itself is quite nice. The views of the city are amazing. There are tour groups (usually about 1 hour long) you may join, but I chose to wander aimlessly. I truly enjoyed the exhibits I visited. The garden is spectacular. I wound up staying long enough to want some lunch, so found the café. There was a great variety of food offered. All in all, I would definitely go back to this gem, and hope to include The Getty Villa next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatB361

Not much waiting time to ride the tram up to the museum.The collections of paintings and sculptures are truly priceless. Monet, Renoir, Rembrandt and so many more fabulous paintings to see.The view of Los Angeles is breathtaking from the top.The gardens are also so welcoming. We wanted to have a picnic but it became too cold by early evening. (Sunset is around 7:45pm). Tram going back down had no line at all by the time we rode it at 7:30pm.The kids also had so much fun in the family center- making their own masks. Also fun for the kids to play in the gardens. Saw some children rolling down the manicured grasses. A perfect way to spend your day.And the best thing is it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquamermaid
50,An,"I'm glad that I went to both Getty Center and Getty Villa on this trip to LA. This is an amazing place with a large collection of art pieces, wonderful architecture, breathtaking views and a big garden. Easily spend half a day there. If you plan to go to Getty Villa, do it on the same day and you only need to pay $15 parking fee for both places.Highly recommended to all visiting LA even for people who do not visit museum, you will love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WT_Tong
50,Beyond Belief,"Whoever designed this marvel of culture should live to be 1000 years old.The indoor displays are set perfectly. The outdoor gardens are in a class of their own.Accessibility is remarkably easy and convenient.My wife, Naomi, and I shall return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TONY263
50,The Versailles of the West Coast - a MUST do in LA!,"The Getty family opened their immense, private art collection to the public here.It is IMMENSE and unbelievable. Anyone who loves art will be thrilled to go The Getty with you - because you simply cannot see everything in one, two or three days. Native Californians normally don't like going to certain spots (Santa Monica pier, Rodeo, Hollywood drive) because once you've seen it . . .meh. But your friendly natives won't mind taking you to The Getty on your visit, because it always has ""something"" you haven't seen. I recommend you either decide to take it in bite-sized portions, allocating your visit to certain parts of the Getty each time, or acknowledge that you won't see everything in every spot and allow yourself to ramble around as certain items, themes or exhibits attract your attention. If you are with a big group, do NOT try to stay together - you'll get frustrated and won't enjoy your visit. Let everyone soak in whatever they prefer, and use your cell phones to catch up for lunch or whenever you agree to leave.Just like the Getty in Malibu, this one feels like you are walking around someone's spacious home. Which is really amazing because, unlike the Malibu Spanish-Italian architecture Getty, this one is the epitome of modern and from the outside does not look at all like someone's home. But once you are walking around, you expect your host/hostess to come around the corner at any second and ask if you need refreshment yet. It is ""that"" comfortable and ease-inducing. I don't like modern architecture, but love wandering around this Getty (I prefer the Malibu Getty's architecture and location, but they've moved the best pieces to this one).What's really amazing about the Getty is that the architect realized its size could be overwhelming, and built in little gardens, relax spaces, and other ""breaks"" from the art (which are themselves quietly artistic) so that you can SIT and ENJOY a few moments of silence or chat. How many museums acknowledge that you might need a mental break from the art?? My mom loved the eco-friendly and beautiful gardens; I'm not a gardener, there are not many trees and it was a hot day so I was bored, but they were cool-looking. The view of the ocean whilst looking at the gardens was more to my taste. Also, I also love that the Getty has snack stations and areas throughout the museum, so that you do not have to search out 1 cafeteria to eat. Perhaps I'm the only one who gets snacky while walking around looking at art, but ""thank you"" Getty because at least I'm not starving for 80% of the trip.Finally, don't forget to walk into the rooms which look like they are setting up for an art class, or are in the middle of an art class: those classes are usually intended for the public, and the curators would LOVE for you to ask if you can join. I'm not an artist by any means, but I have always enjoyed the experience of looking at a priceless piece of art, having the curator explain some of the best methods to (draw, sculpt, whatever) our own rendition of that art, making the attempt in this amazing museum, and then you walk away with your own (free!) souvenir. When I went with my parents, we were all shocked that my sports-loving dad made the most realistic sketch of the model out of the whole class - it's a bonding, enlightening and simply fun experience.I really think the best part of the Getty is seeing pieces that few people in the world have the opportunity to appreciate. For example, during one of my visits, there was an exhibition of beautifully engraved books that were centuries old. Engraved with gold, encrusted with gems, and absolutely stunning. Interestingly, I had just returned from Ireland where one of their highlights is seeing The Book of Kells in the Trinity Library. I saw the Book of Kells and was appropriately impressed . . . until my Getty visit when I realized that ""these"" books were the ones the world should be ""ooh""-ing and ""aww""-ing over. The Getty had each one displayed in its own cubic case, so that the public could stand all around it and look at its glory - the gorgeous pages, the binding, the gemstone covers. Perhaps this collection (exhibited only for a limited time) and others like it are not highly publicized due to their value? I don't know the reason, but I do know that you should take the opportunity to see these items and others like them whenever possible. It is worth the day, two days, half-day or whatever you can spare. You will love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Persephone11032
50,Art + Science = Getty,"If you remember drive-in movies in their hay day you will get the drill on the Getty.Round up as many art lovers you can pack in your car --9 passenger station wagon er well SUV and you'll all get in for one flat parking fee. Done. You could spend some serious money in the gift shop. You might take a meal in either the cafe or the restaurant. But that's up to you. It is possible to visit and not spent anything extra other than the parking fee. All those drive-in movies had their snack bars.Now the Getty is not one big building. Not at all, more like a bunch of very high end freighter containers each furnished with a part of the Getty's wide range of interests. My visits have been chaotic but fun. Our groups have scattered as each member falls in love with some aspect of the campus. The views or the cutting edge garden or the architecture. It does take a while to get to the art and when you do it's parsed out bit by bit in bite sized portions. If you feel you will only get your money's worth if your eyeballs roll back in your head when you enter the ""grand gallery"" that is wallpapered with masterpieces, then this place will disappoint you. But if a quiet one on one intimate conversation is what you had in mind then this place is for you alone. Well almost. It is a public space, but I kept getting the feeling that J. Paul himself would be delighted in the way each of his ""children"" get their moment in the sun. This can take up a lot of time as I found out for myself one evening as I was gently but firmly placed on to the very last tram doing down the hill. I felt relieved actually I just could not see it all in one visit any more than Disneyland can be ""done"" in a few hours. You can say ""I've been there"" but you can't say ""I saw it all"". If you have decided to wait for a rainy day to go this museum. Please don't. This would be hell.Not as bad as a trip to the beach, but close enough. Every art cube opens on to a chill- out garden. If you like to play games in the rain, bless your heart, go for it. Any indoor mall, coffee shop, or movie would be my pick, It gets chilly up there on the hill on a good night.Many of the buildings are not open to us at all. The back stage at the museum is filled with the science that has become Dr to the Arts. The conservation dept. is world class. Where ever you roam in the world things are either missing cause Dr. Getty is seeing them now or back looking better than ever because of the time spent at the Getty Spa.Make no mistake the art is good, but even better is the way it is scattered over a vast campus. But truth be told many a gold earring seen in the Getty today in what looks like newly minted glory, was in it's just recent past, a thing like a lump of coal.If they have a mission there it is having us asking ourselves ""how did this pretty thing get here ? What did it take? How was it done ? Were mistakes made ? They have made some big ones, but have also owed up to them. Education works on all who are willing to learnThe care and thought behind the smallest detail is impressive.If any costs were cut on anything it is not visible. The Getty staff welcomes you as if you were a client of a five star hotel in Switzerland.And in all I believe you will enjoy your visit to the art Acropolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divagreta2016
50,Best View of LA,"I love art and I love LA. They had an amazing WWI and Picasso's who is one of my favorite artists. The place is huge, there is a ton of things to see and do here.

The Getty Center is not only an amazing structure, it contains some of the great pieces of art of this century as well as previous centuries. Visiting the center takes time. I suggest 4-5 hours of viewing and even taking in lunch at one of their cafes. We spent 5-6 hours at the Center at didn't see it all. Admission to the Center is free, but parking is around $12 per vehicle. Check their webpage for the current exhibits. It is a gem not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bozewoman78

50,A career to build the project,"Getty Center is a wonderful place. It took twelve years to build including the grading and fills to create both the approach and the actual land the buildings are perched upon. From the horizontal elevator to get you from the parking lot to the Center itself, to the dry hung Travertine on the exterior walls, this is one place where quality of the construct was paramount to cost. Two different architectural firms were used to design and build the Center. The buildings and the garden reflect two completely different approaches to Architecture. These two features are equal to the art on display inside the Center itself, which is the main reason for this edifice. Something not to miss! Also do not overlook the opportunity to take advantage of the striking views allowed by the location of the Getty Center. Placed on the same mountain range as the Griffith Observatory the views are similar but from a perspective further West on the same range.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thealeh
50,Building and location alone worth a visit!!,"Beautifully situated the Getty Center is definitely worth a visit. Great panoramic views of the city, beautiful architecture and gardens.

It is located on a prime piece of LA property with vistas of the ocean and downtown LA. The only fee is a $15 parking charge, but admission to the museum and grounds is otherwise free. The exhibits are organized chronologically in each of several buildings which allowed us to choose where we wanted to start. All is the paintings were on the top floors of the buildings and sculptures were were on the second floor, etc. We ventured out on to the grounds which were amazing! There was a babbling brook that had a winding path over it which was lovely to walk on, and a well-manicured garden below.

50,Amazing Getty As Always,"This was my second trip The Getty Center as part of visit to West Hollywood. There is pay parking or one can take thebus--yes you can get there by bus-- or Lyft, Uber or Cab. Aside from parking and the wonderful cafe with views, The Getty charges nothing for the tram which takes visitors from the parking area to the sprawling center perched on a scenic mountaintop or the multiple exhibits. I recommend doing the guided tour of the complex if its your first visit (I've done it before). Always check their web site for what exhibits will be showing around time of your planned (yes, plan it) visit. This time (April 2017) I visited to see ""Breaking News: Turning the Lens on Mass Media,"" an excellent exhibit span 50 years of TV and print media. On my prior visit the Central Garden was under construction--plan on spending an easy hour or more just soaking in the 500 varieties of flowers, the waterfall, the spiral design and awesome views --perfect for families, couples or anyone who adores gardens.

The cafe is modern, efficient and again surounded with views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MharCA
50,Stunning position and some good art,The museum itself is in a stunning position and has marvellous views in all directions. There are many good pieces of art (not just the well known Van Gogh irises) and it is worth allowing several hours to see everything properly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDSK13
30,"Nice garden, lots of work to get to","Maybe its my fault, that art isn't really my thing, but sure was quite the production to get to, and then to have to wait to park, wait for the shuttle, wait, wait wait... finally saw the gardens....not much, but again, I'm not a art museum type. If you are, you might like it more....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonr453
50,One of the best places to spend a day in LA,"Foremost, there's a huge number of attractions and exhibits, meaning every type of art lover will find something to appreciate. And even those who don't care much for art will love the tranquil surroundings and beautiful views.What's more, admission to the museum is free. Even though parking costs $15, a family could attend the museum for less than $5 a person. It's a stellar value for a half-day or day of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettTEvans
30,Something Different to do in LA,"If you have been to a number of large museums, the J Paul Getty Center will pale by comparison. However, this is not to meant to deter you from going if you have seen other attractions in LA and are looking for something different to do. The Center is huge so bring a good pair of waling shoes. There is no charge for admission but parking is cost;y ($20.00). The exhibits are nice but we expected a bit more. The view from the Center is beautiful, especially when there is no smog. There is a large cafe to have lunch and also an expensive restaurant if you prefer. All-in-all I would recommend this attraction if you are looking for something different to do. It will not ""knock your socks off"" but it will keep you busy for a number of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberte35
50,Must see,We spent the day at the Getty with our 12 year old granddaughters. It is free admission with $15.00 fee to park. They have audio sets to use at no charge. I recommend that as the girls loved it. We too a picnic lunch and stored in a free locker. At noon we had a wonderful picnic lunch on the grass under a shade tree. The Getty is amazing. So much yo see that you will need to spend the entire day there to see everything that you want. Go when it opens to beat some of the crowd. There are places to buy lunch or snacks that are reasonable priced. The view from the top of the hill is amazing. We will go back when we visit the kids again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler225
50,The Getty,"An architectural gem built by the generosity of John Paul Getty and family. First class displays inside, but just walking around outside is great for architecture fans, and has long distance views of LA. A ""food court"" type restaurant inside and a more upscale one on the outdoor terrace with relaxing views. Admission is free but parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powerfulmike123
50,Excellent,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Getty Centre. They have a beautiful collection of art, plus we saw a special exhibition. As well as the art there are fabulous views of Los Angeles. We travelled by Uber and took the tram up to the Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencV4785NQ
50,This is what philanthropy can do!,"What an amazing place! After a few hitches getting there on public transport, we were simply spellbound from beginning to end of the visit. The antiquities are wonderful, the cafe is superb and the beautiful surrounds are serene and restful. If you love architecture, you will LOVE this space. Pick up a ticket for the nearby Getty Villa from reception , as this should also not be missed. Not having a car, we found UBER a really good and cheap way to get to and from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LlewelynR
50,What a Legacy,"The Getty Centre is not only a great legacy from one of the world's former richest families but a beautiful, peaceful, alluring location with amazing vistas of LA, monumental architecture and galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinB938
40,Great view on top of LA,"TThe entrance is free but you have to pay 20 bucks for parking. The museum is mostly based on European Art and culture, some interesting pieces. Museum's garden is to see as well. It will take you 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulienRnd
50,Amazing museum with stunning views of L.A.,"The gardens, exhibits and location made this a must-do in L.A. We spent over 3 hours exploring the artwork throughout the numerous buildings at The Getty. The gardens are beautiful even though they were not in full bloom in March.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtravelmom
50,Amazing place. Possible to do Getty Villa same day,"This is an amazing place, big, spacious, well laid out and with a wide range of different art forms on display.It feels luxurious, relaxing and informative throughout and has great choices of eating and drinking on site also.You pay $15 for parking but no entry fee, and I found it easy to come here for 2 hours then go down to the villa for lunch, in which case the parking covers both places on the same day but you do need to get a special ticket from the parking office.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordan1964
50,Wow,Wasn't sure if I was going to like this but when we got to the top after tram ride. Wow. What a view of areas. Gardens are beautiful and galleries are amazing. A must see if your in the area. Must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steveb0029
50,A Los Angeles Must See!,"We love coming to the Getty Center! I have been to the Getty many times and enjoy the views, the gardens and the artwork. The Getty is the first place to instill art appreciation in me. The setting is second to none and offers a tranquil experience to simply sit back and enjoy a piece.One of my favorite things about the Getty are the views of Los Angeles County and the corresponding maps that help you identify landmarks. It is great to be able to put places you see everyday to names.My kids enjoy the Garden the most and like to whip in and out of the pathways among the colorful flowers and shrubs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8028BXthomasb
50,A full day experience,"We visited the Getty in March, my second visit after several years. The location is superb, at the summit of a mountain, serviced by a tram from the parking area. As other viewers highlight, it is FREE! The collection is outstanding. We enjoyed the temporary exhibit by French sculptor Bouchardon. The architecture is stunning and the many esplanades offer breathtaking views over Los Angeles. We had lunch in a well equipped cafeteria offering a wide range of food choices. The Getty is an artistic, educational and cultural experience not to be missed while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougzipo
40,The art collection is a litttle underwhelming,"If you are an experienced art museum visitor, I am afraid you will be disappointed with the Getty Center. I found the collection to be a little small, and while the views of Los Angeles are captivating, and the buildings' architecture is interesting, as an actual art museum, it is only ok. (Not the Met or the Louvre, or the National Gallery).We spent about 2 hours.If you are looking for a full day activity, go to the Huntington Library for its gardens instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KosherAndGlutenFree
50,Wonderful experience!,"Entrance is free, all you need is to pay $15.00 for parking. Magnificently curated with peaceful, beautiful grounds. Good food at the restaurant. Excellent collection of works by Rembrandt.Truly amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlobaker
50,Stunning inside and out,"The Getty was a real highlight of our stay. Free and easily accessible with uber, the grounds, building and art are all stunning. Recommend planning a half day here including lunch at the cafe downstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284
50,So beautiful,"Even if you aren't into the beautiful works of art found at the Getty, the grounds are amazing. The views from every side of The Getty are spectacular!! We ate a light lunch in the cafe, good food, decent prices. A must visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomasviska
50,Free! You must go.,"This place is incredible and did I mention that it is free? Lots of artwork, history and the view is to die for. The gardens are spectacular. The architecture is beautiful and it is huge! You really should go if you're in LA. Plan on spending several hours just looking at the art if that's your thing. If it isn't, you should still go. The view and the gardens and worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmlphoenix
40,great day to go and best of all entry is FREE,i am not that much into art but its certainly well worth the trip when you get there its a good walk around checking out the art and the outdoor area is great has a good view of LA and Bell air,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredL50
50,Another 'must see' place,"A visit to Los Angeles would not be complete without a visit at the Getty. The art collection is extensive, beautifully presented and so are the grounds and the structure. One visit will make you a fan of the place and it's even a fun place for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,Amazing museum and gardens!,"If you aren't able to get to Europe to see the world-famous art museums, this is certainly a wonderful alternative. It includes art by the masters from every different era. It's beautifully laid out, comes with a hand-set you can carry and listen to as you look at art, and it is free! Take a (free) tour. Let someone tell you about the artful layout of the gardens or point out the treasures in the museum. Sit at one of the many patio tables and enjoy a meal. It makes for a very pleasant day! One caution. If you are following your GPS, and you find yourself on small, steep, winding roads through residential neighbourhoods - it's wrong. No matter how right your GPS has been for your entire trip, don't listen to that beguiling voice. You must stay on the freeway and access the parking lot from the North side of the Getty. (parking is the only cost - $15/car)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan586
50,Excellent visit with children,"This must be one of the best value visits in LA since entry is free and it is just $15 to park. One of the most memorable parts of the visit for our young children was the tram ride from the car park to the centre itself, which is situated on top of a hill with spectacular views of LA and its environs. The Gehry-designed buildings, with shaded areas, fountains and viewing points, is almost better than the art collections within. All in all, spent about four hours here and the children were interested and entertained throughout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lirac
50,Beautiful views and gardens,You can see for miles up and down the coast and to downtown LA as you stroll the amazing gardens. Architecture is modern yet beautiful. The collection was nice but the grounds were more impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632KarenT
50,On a clear day you can see the islands!,"I love the Getty! I love that it's free (paid parking is very affordable), I love their tours and their active calendar to engage the visitors in a variety of different experiences, I love the gardens & enjoying a picnic on a sunny day. I prefer to not take in too much artwork during my visit so I don't feel too overwhelmed. The place can be a real sensory overload if you aren't careful!Bring sunglasses, sunblock and a light sweater. This place ROCKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seesumigo
50,Go on a CLEAR day,"While the museum and architecture are impressive on their own, the site offers incredible views spanning from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean. Costing somewhere around $1B to shave off a hilltop and build the Getty Center, I spent years watching it being built while commuting the 405 to work and back.Should DEFINITELY be on your ""must do"" list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HT909
50,Breath-taking Beauty,"Though it sounds time consuming to park, get on a tram up the hill to the museum and climb the stairs to the entrance, the entire experience is calm and lovely. This is such a peaceful place to view gorgeous art. The serene surroundings with water features, pristine landscaping and incredible views are a retreat from the busy city around you.Don't miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP311
50,WOW,One of the best museum I have ever visited. Everything is thought of and the exterior is fantastic. WOW,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133gabic
50,Unbelieveable,"My only regret for our visit was that I did not have more time! The grounds are gorgeous and everything, from the moment you step on the tram up to the center, was delightful!I wish I would have had 6 more hours in the place!Jacob Savery's landscape paintings were a highlight for me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blborgstede
50,Go Getty Good Times,I loved the variety of artwork and display. Plus the landscaping and garden was really cool too. I will be going back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742jaclynd
50,Beautiful experience,Great way to get a view of the LA landscape and experience art and garden design. Worth a trip. Very small crowds on a Friday in April and it's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drake_remoray
50,I thought I'd died and gone to heaven!,"Easy to get to on the 734 bus from Westwood. It is a travertine architectural delight, the garden is beautiful as a re the views over the city especially Bel Air and the Ocean. Will return & most importantly its free as are the architectural and garden tours, amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMANBRAD

50,Don't miss the Getty,"Incredible, wonderful museum and site. I love this place. Nothing like it anywhere in the U.S. This is like visiting an elegant, European museum in a villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrCliff
50,World Class Museum in a magnificent venue,If you enjoy art and you enjoy architecture and appreciate soaring views of LA do not miss this magnificent Museum. It is the best LA has to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W782WApaulh
30,Family Adventure,Buildings are beautiful. Exhibits were not as interesting as I anticipated though. Preferred the Getty Villa and the gardens there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seirshalove727
40,"Incredible grounds, architecture and views","I've been to the Getty a few times now and spend most of my time outside. On a nice day you have full views from the ocean to downtown.It is very convenient to get to, at an exit just off the 405 freeway. Once you pull into the park lot (entry to the museum is free, but parking is $15, or $10 after 3 pm) you go up to the tram and take that up the side of the hill to the museum.The gardens and the grounds are perfectly kept and are a great backdrop for a picnic. It's fun to explore every nook and outlook the museum has to offer. I'm not very familiar with the artwork inside the actual museum but they are housed in multiple buildings.I recommend getting here either early in the day or on a weekday to avoid the heavy crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisong339
40,Lovely afternoon,"We had fantastic weather and clear skies. Loved the tram ride with the views, and loved walking around the grounds. Our family enjoyed the gardens and the location more than the art (there's one room with the famous Impressionists but the rest is missable). We spent a wonderful, tranquil ~2 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MidtownEats
50,BEST views of LA,"Truly a world-class museum, you will be wowed by the beautiful views of L.A., the gorgeous architecture and gardens, and the immense collection or art alongside tourists from all over the world. My first visit to the Getty Center was as great as I expected it to be, and this will not be my last visit!Admission is FREE, except for the parking fee ($15, or $10 after 3pm). If you carpool you can split the parking fee and it won't be an issue. Parking is easy and plentiful. Take a free tram up to the Getty center if you don't feel like walking, or are short of time.There are plenty of free tours going throughout the day about the collection, architecture and gardens. I popped into the tours from time to time, listening to what the guides had to say. You can also pick up a free audioguide (an ipod touch) at the entrance, which gives you insight into most art pieces.I encourage you to explore the museum as thoroughly as possible, because you never know what you may find, and what views you will encounter! The views here are stellar. Next to the Griffith Observatory you can't find a view like this anywhere else. Everywhere I turned I found views that took my breath away.I recommend making the Getty Center a day trip because there's so much to see! Be aware though that the cafe closes at 3pm (and the Center closes at 6pm), so if you're looking to grab a bite make sure to pop into the cafe before it closes!I will be back, even if it means another 3 hour round-trip from the OC!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiakoh
50,Amazing museum,Get there at 930AM to be able to park in the garage. The free tour of the grounds is very helpful to appreciate the museum. Beautiful place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nhtraveler63
20,"Must say, was a little disappointed","As a local resident, sometimes there are attractions that we don't end up going to. However, on a recent weekend I decided to trek on up to the Getty Center. Perhaps it just wasn't a nice day outside and that may have clouded my perception of it, but I just wasn't particularly blown away by this place. Some of the art and artifacts were interesting, but the grounds themselves/overall place is a bit overrated in my opinion. Worth checking out, but don't expect to be there very long. Also, one of the bathrooms was backed up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyD24
50,Great Attraction & Value,"I had heard about this place for years and finally got to visit it on a trip to LA. Couldn't believe that the charge was only $15 for parking, no admission fee. Very impressive architecture by noted architect- Richard Meier. The architecture frames the views, which are fabulous- the mountains, LA & the Pacific. Has multiple buildings- art, Getty Institute, Cafeteria & fine Dining, etc & gardens. We took an architectural tour which was very good, the art museum was very good. Gardens were nice but not that extensive. A great place to spend the afternoon on a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989alanm
30,Not Bad but I liked Getty Villa more,"This is a nice location with a grand vista of the city, sweeping view of the hills and sea and vista of traffic as far as the eye can see. The campus is a wonder, like I wonder what will happen in an earthquake....all the tall supports holding building up in the air on top of a hill with fine art inside. Oh well no doubt everything will be fine.They charge for parking but let you in the museum for free. Odd for a town with such wacky public transit. It does let you ride the little mini tram to the top of the hill; that is a cute ride, almost Disneyland land of the future like. It works!The art is a nice mix but .... I'm going to tell you I enjoyed the Getty Villa the next day more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smokeater55
50,First time visitor to this amazing place.,"Spent all day here and could have easily come back for another day. The Center has exquisite art work, fabulous architecture, amazing gardens, friendly and knowledgeable docents, and a cafe that can meet many food tastes. We took the general tour in the morning and the garden tour in the afternoon. The garden tour was my personal favorite but it is like preferring silver over gold, both are valuable. No fee at the museum but you do have to pay for parking. A tram ride will take you up to the campus. This is a place that should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEtransplant
50,definitely worth a visit,"Wonderful place to visit in LA. Relatively easy to get to, expansive views, expansive art collection, and lovely grounds/gardens. Many famous works of art. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fimfetter
50,Art Gallery with a view,"If coming to Los Angeles the The Getty is a must. My husband is not an art gallery kinda guy and when he asks to go back, who am I to say no. The design and build of The Getty is just beautiful, I could just wander the outside and be very happy. And if you go on a clear day, the view is phenomenal.And yes, it's worth going inside! We saw a wonderful sculpture exhibit, but for me, it's always the Irises. Divine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noosadoer

50,Excellent museum plus beautiful gardens,"The museum has some great classical art - paintings, manuscripts, sculpture. The gardens and view are awesome. Plus it's free.

50,"Fine Art Collection, Wonderful Views, Enjoyable Space","The Getty offers a very clean, well-crafted experience from the shuttle ride up the hill to the lay-out of galleries, to the walk through the gardens or views from many venues including a nice cafe.It definitely is worth a half-day or more's excursion. Perched on a hill overlooking the Westside of Los Angeles, the modern architecture and immaculate grounds are a lovely retreat ""above it all"".Also, check their website; there are always art classes and weekend seminars or speakers. The cultural offerings are well worth partaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthotelpatron

50,Love it here,The Art and the views here are amazing. Always enjoy the ride up to the Getty as you get nice view. Also the tore at the museum has such beautiful stuff to buy.

30,A good starter museum,"If you're a sophisticated art lover and have visited any of the great art museums of the world, you might not be all that impressed with the collection here. However, if this is your maiden visit to an art museum you'll find it to be a good first exposure. The grounds and view are lovely, and the architecture is interesting. One exhibit of note is the photography exhibit dealing with the way the media uses the visual image to shape public opinion. If you happen to be in LA, it's worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938tiarea

Stunning sunset views and a place to really enjoy time appreciating art and decompressing from work or stresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legacyLA
50,Wonderful visit,"The Getty was such a treat. Even if you're not into art, the architecture, the gardens and the view alone are worth the visit - everywhere you turn, you're surrounded by beauty. Add to that the impressive collection of art and it's my personal idea of heaven.The museum is incredibly well-run. You're greeted along the way by staff and volunteers who - to a person - were friendly and helpful. It can be daunting as it's such a big property but there are so many people around to help you find your way.And somehow (I still can't get over this) it's all free. Admission, wi-fi...They offer audio guides and those are free as well.It was an absolute pleasure - thank you Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsk28
50,A different kind of museum,"Went here with friends and totally enjoyed the visit. The gardens are beautiful and excellently maintained.

50,This is the ultimate art spot in LA,"If you like the classical masters, then you MUST come here to see them. I don't think this is a modern art gallery, more classical works here. The garden and lawn are great for a picnic. So bring a basket or a back pack, have some light fare and a glass of wine, enjoy the art and the sunshine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronh118

50,Perched atop a hill overlooking Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is worthy of a full day visit. The buildings, with their skin of terrazzo filled with fossils to find, the courtyards, the galleries and definitely the gardens. The premium restaurant there is delicious but make reservations in advance. There is a simpler less expensive venue, but the restaurant really is a treat. The ART and galleries are alright, not outstanding, though there is a section that has entire rooms brought over from Europe of the 17th and 18th century (I believe) which is lovely to see.The garden design is an interpretation of an Italian Renaissance style garden, though you enter at the top of the hill where it is more wild and take a zig zag path to where it is more ordered ( The Renaissance gardens went the other way) It is pretty, original and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbjnla
50,A wonderful place,"To me this is one of the must sees of Los Angeles. You only need to pay for parking and then all the rest is free, unless you buy some food. Be sure to go into the billion dollar room, where there are more than $1 billion worth of famous paintings, featuring Van Gogh's ""Irises""and other well-known paintings. The views of Los Angeles, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Santa Monica, and Catalina are breathtaking. The architecture is modern, stylish, and attractive. A worthwhile way to spend part of a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer437233

50,A beautiful oasis,"We visited here when we had a few hours to spare one afternoon, not knowing what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise to hop on the tram and travel up the hill to disembark at this beautiful oasis overlooking LA. The buildings are beautiful, the gardens and surrounds are delightful, and the artwork inside will occupy you for hours. Best of all, it is free - parking after 3pm is $10, before then is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissa1100

50,For the artistic personality,"A great place to spend some quality time to see art, architecture, landscapes, sculptures, artefacts and much more. It's contemporary art so go there if you enjoy artistic things. Entrance is free. Audio sets are provided free along with maps. Don't bother to eat or drink from the cafe as it's over priced and the food is not so great.Don't miss going out at the top floors to see some great views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeelikaT

50,Amazing Art in a Fabulous Location,"Plan to spend the day at the Getty with a break halfway to eat and clear your head. You can also tour the gardens (we didn't) to gird yourself for another dive into all the art. We didn't take an audio or guided tour, but both are available for free. Incredible location, striking SoCal architecture and phenomenal views along with a wonderful array of European masters across the centuries (Rubens, Goya, Van Gogh, Renoir, etc.). Free parking and electric train to center. Recommend going earlier in the day on the weekend as the galleries were much busier by the early afternoon making it harder to enjoy the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_working_mom

40,Getty Center,Nice outing especially for those art lovers! Easy parking.Terrific views on the way up.My husband was in his element seeing all the artwork!For us (2 teens and an 8 year old) we loved the gardens - beautiful to walk around and take pictures.The souvenir store had some great items too - the color changing pencils were our fave! We wandered around in there for quite a while!There are also activities for the kids - they had to locate the art work in the different halls which was fun.There's a snack bar and a restaurant. Both a bit pricey but ok for something small.Nice for a couple of hours or a day's visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me8ow
50,Our teens' favourite place in Los Angeles,"We had a whirlwind trip with the teens over 4 days and they rated the Getty Center, along with Joshua Tree National Park, as their fave place to visit. Of course LA is greener than it has been in decades so the bountiful flora contributed to the experience. All was easy - parking was pretty busy for a Friday morning - and we didn't have to wait for the tram in either direction. There's a lot of walking so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCLS
50,Absolutely excellent,"What a gem!! In an attractive hillside location convenient for the motorist, with a large (pay and display) multi-story car park and a driverless train to take visitors to the gardens and galleries, and i'ts free to enter. The buildings, their lay-out and content were first rate as were the attractive gardens. There were also excellent catering facilities and ample clean toilets (rest-rooms)On returning to Los Angeles we would re-visit time and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129DavidA129
50,JUST BEAUTIFUL!,"This is a MUST SEE attraction if you come to LA.I've been to the one in Malibu on PCH, which is also beautiful, but they are completely different.The beauty, elegance, and ambiance are like no other.My kids even loved their visit there.LOVE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196jeffn
50,Good place to visit,"We visited based on the views and were not dissapoited. The tram from the car park was a lovely surprise and had great views of L.A. It was very well organised. The centre itself is made up of several connected buildings. The views of L.A. were amazing. We ate at the cafe, which bad a nice selection. We visited with our 8 year old daughter who also enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JC00000
50,Quite exceptional:,"This is without doubt a must if you are visiting LA. The only charge is for parking. Make sure you visit the Breaking News exhibition and take the architecture tour, its all free of charge. Allow a good full day there is a vast amount to see. The food is excellent and reasonably priced also.Another amazing example of US philanthropy funding the arts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulaustin
50,Wonderful!,My boyfriend and I went to the Getty late one afternoon for an impromptu date night and we can't wait to go back. I didn't bring my DSLR camera and missed some wonderful photo opportunities. The collections are exquisite. My favorite was the French furniture and the antique books. I could have spent all day looking at the book exhibit alone. I could write forever about how much I enjoyed this but I'll keep it short. Go enjoy! Spend the day. Bring a jacket just in case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
50,Stunning,"When you get to the Getty Centre, you park your car for $15 and then you catch a tram to the top of the mountain. The whole complex must be seen to be believed. After hopping off the tram you are confronted by a huge modern multi-storey building. The courtyard and stairs leading up to the entrance are carved from white stone and marble. There are several multi-storey buildings full of art work, sculptures and museum pieces all surrounded by acres of manicured gardens. Entry is free and no reservations are required. You can easily spend from 3 hours to the whole day just wondering around this amazing centre, and the view is spectacular. Take a jacket as it can get quite cold and foggy being so high on top of he mountain. If you love art you will love the Getty Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon
40,"Spectacular Grounds, Lame Impressionism Tour","Yes, the food is overpriced. Pack a picnic! Great tram ride up to the Getty Center, and beautiful architecture and grounds. Skip the sculpture garden and head straight for the cactus garden - sweeping views everywhere. The free tour of Impressionism was a waste of time, but since it was free, who cares! Love that volunteers run the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raventwisp

50,Get Going to the Getty,"This is one of my favorite places to visit! It's free, organized and a place to connect with humanity through art. It's a perfect utopia up on the hill. Come back from here feeling a little more LA, a little more relaxed and little more appreciative of art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laamy24
50,"Amazing views, great architecture","A must visit when in Los Angeles, the Getty center is beautiful, love the gardens as well as the architecture of the building itself. Free other than paying for parking so if you bring a car full of people you really get your money's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676bethanj
40,A very fine centre with exquisite gardens,"Getting to the Getty Centre without a car in LA is easy. Catch the no 2 bus on Hollywood BLVD and get off at USC and then catch the 234 to the Getty. Once you arrive, you will go through security then a tram ride takes you to the centre, all very well organised.Once there, it's free and you are free to roam. It is advisable to hire head phones so you gain a better understanding of the works. Take your time as you make your way through all the spaces, the art work goes to around 1900 so you won't find anything contemporary or modern.If it's a fine day, enjoy a walk around the gardens more spectacular for me than the art works, the views are amazing and there are wonderful sculptures by the likes of Calder.The Getty centre is a must destination, getting there by bus takes you through places in LA you probably wouldn't see in a car so take the bus, it's $. 1.75 one way.Some advise, take you time, it's practically a day event, do not rush up or back or you'll miss the most important experience, the tranquility of the site/view and the beauty of the gardens and art work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondenomad94
50,"Incredible complex, a must see!","This is an astounding place and it is free. One can go just to tour the buildings and the gardens. They have many daily tours of both, but of course, there are also many tours of the art work.They have both a permanent collection and many changing exhibitions. The latter tend to be small, just a few rooms, but I liked that because one could see many periods and styles.We ate in the restaurant twice and thought the food was great plus it has lovely views ( see separate review).There is also a lovely Museum store. Btw, you can walk up to the Center rather than take the tram but the walk is along the road and one hears the thundering noise of the 405 freeway below. We did not find it all that pleasant. On top, at the actual Center, you are in an oasis of calm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyC757
40,Come as much for the grounds and the views as for the exhibits,"Not among the great museums of the world, but worth a visit not only for its permanent collection and rotating exhibitions, but also for the building itself, the grounds, and the magnificent views from its mountaintop perch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikecR9620XM
50,Mr Getty's Treat...,"The Getty is a World class museum. Mr Getty is ""world-class"" in that all of what is contained in this beautiful facility, HE wanted to share with you and I. If you drive by car, that is your only cost. The GETTY FOUNDATION welcomes you.A couple ""cautions""...the collection will require your TIME...you may spend two days, easily. Then as well, there is the building and THE OUTSIDE GROUNDS to admire. Please, ENJOY YOURSELF, we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveN519
50,A beautiful way to spend an afternoon,"The collection is amazing, The gardens are amazing. The special exhibits are always interesting. The views on a clear day are breathtaking. Have lunch at the ""Restaurant"". Pricey but worth every cent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbsarver19
50,Amazing Overall Experience,"Our family recently visited the Getty Center on our trip to the Los Angeles area and I can say it was one of the highlights of our trip! My suggestion is to start with the ""Overview/Highlights"" tour at the beginning. The tour guide is helpful and gives you a sense of the different buildings, its history and what can be found there. You see Van Gogh's ""Irises"" and the museum's other treasures. After the tour, it's much easier to navigate the different buildings.Our family enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing the gardens and architecture as well. In addition, the Restaurant at the Getty is a real hidden gem---and well worth the price. It was great to enjoy a nice, sit-down, coursed meal with a bottle of wine in the middle of the day. The restaurant is surrounded by tall, glass walls, enabling guests to see the beautiful scenery from atop the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TroyB69
50,Wonderful building,"This museum is more about the building, the grounds and the view. As with many newer museums, the art collection is not yet up to par with the world's great museums. Still very much worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caparadis
50,Go on a clear day and get the address right,"Wonderful museum! 2+ hours of art to see and spare some time for gawking at the views (if it's clear)! Make sure you get the address to the base of the Getty Center (and take the tram up), not the Getty Villa. Pretty hard place to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cal337
50,A Great Experience,Loved it. I went with family and we had an amazing time. Perfect mix of historic and modern art. (Also cool to have been at the location that they shot Star Trek),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671jarretp
40,Beautiful visit,"We had visited the Getty Art Museum in Malibu on a previous visit. So we drove to the main Getty Center. The numbers of visitors are limited by the number of available parking spaces. Parking costs $15 but the museum entrance is free. We were pleased to see electric chargers in the garage.we took the lovely tram to the top. There were many school groups but the flow of guests were well organized and we didn't have to wait too long.There are 5 buildings with something in each to see. I was disappointed that the Degas Exhibit was only one painting: The Russian Dancers. The grounds are spectacular, well groomed and, with recent rains, full of flowers and water flows. The views of LA are awesome. The architecture is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frij0lita
40,"Wonderful Place To Visit For Art, Architecture, and views of LA","I had such a pleasant day here on a sunny day.The grounds are gorgeous and as beautiful as the art is on the inside, you can just as easily spend the day in the gardens and cafes on the outside.The art collection is beautiful as are the sculptures. Their photography exhibits change month to month so be sure to check out their site for the latest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Travelin_Bun
50,"Stunning view, great exhibitions, delicious restaurant","We did a Sunday day-date here. Parking was $15 but no entrance fees. Tram up the hill didn't take much waiting (its very organized). Lunch was super yummy (and a tad over-priced) but worth it in the restaurant. Bring a picnic or try the cafe if you're trying to save a little money.The exhibits were great. The view is spectacular- very romantic to wait for sun to set if you can!Impressively clean, well staffed. If you have time read up on the history of Paul Getty.Would like to see what the Malibu location is like next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamazurek

50,Too Much to See In One Day,"While our visit was hampered by nasty LA traffic, we did get to spend 3+ hours on-site, which allowed us to take in the feature exhibit as well as a couple of the permanent galleries. In short, the place is architecturally stunning, the grounds and views are magnificent, the galleries are world class and aside from $15 for parking its FREE!! What an amazing resource for the city and its visitors. We will definitely return, but will look to spread the visit over a couple of days to fully do it justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_D-man27
50,A perfect day to walk in an artful garden.,"Most people go to the Getty Center for the art... and while it's good, the really special place for me is the garden which seems to go on and on. We've had an unusually wet spring here and so the flowers and plants were in full bloom. It was gorgeous! We went on Friday late morning – There were just the perfect amount of people – no real crowd and our train trip up the mountain to the center allowed us to see a good deal of west Los Angeles. I wouldn't recommend a visit on the weekend as crowds are too much to see anything unless what you want to see is a bunch of people and then you'll definitely get that! I suggest A midweek trip to visit the Getty center. Whether it's a fabulous garden or fabulous art, or at the architecture of the buildings, or merely looking out at the cityscape , it will be worth your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607janetb
40,Wonderful Views/Scenery - LOTS to see - Famous Works from the Ages,"I'm an artist and former Art History minor and my son is also an art major - so from OUR point of view -- it was amazing to see real works and artists we'd only seen at study. The galleries include Roman/Greek antiquity sculpture, most all the famous realists, impressionists, priceless furniture displays from a gilded age. We thoroughly enjoyed it. We do wish there were more diversity- maybe some more modern pieces, abstract or later works just to change it up a bit.From my non-artist husband and son's friend's point of view.... Awesome views, famous Van Gogh's, Manet, Monet, Rembrandt, Gaughin and others that they recognized. Thought the Roman/Green sculptures dating back to 100 BC were awesome. They loved the furniture from King Henry and French Royalty on display. They would have appreciated more diversity -- they were ""done"" with the impressionist and portrait artists a lot quicker than we were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_coch
50,Interesting and Beautiful,"The gardens were gorgeous and it was a beautiful place to spend the day. They always have different events going on so you can look up what tours or talks to listen to. There was an interesting part of the museum that looked at the way world events were treated by the media and offered pathways for critical thinking about the way we look at media throughout the ages. Painting and sculptures were beautiful. The architecture of the Getty Center itself was breathtaking, overlooking the city of Los Angeles truly a must see and it is even free except for the reasonable parking fee. From the moment you step onto the tram that takes you to the center this experience is magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiaa526

50,Great Art and Great architecture,"JP Getty may have considered a miser although he was the richest man in the world during his lifetime, but his estate established a fantastic museum overlooking LA.

You will understand how hard that is to believe after you see the incomparable collection. This museum collection includes Van Gogh's ""Irises"" which is worth probably $150 MILLION alone, and has many other world-renowned artists and pieces that will knock you over. Plan to stay several hours. They have a higher end restaurant, a mid-range cafe, and some snack bars.

I have been to the center only twice before and will definitely be back because once again it was an amazing day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusB962
50,"Impressive, free museum","I can't think of what more you would want from an art museum. As a pretty uneducated art enthusiast I especially enjoyed the free headset tour guide which helped explain and contextualise some of what we saw.We were guided through, in chronological order, through renaissance, impressionist and 19th century painting all amongst a spectacular hilltop setting and affordable cafe.Most of all, it was a very welcome surprise to learn that access to this fantastic museum is completely FREE - as a newbie to the US, this is certainly a pleasant surprise. Nothing about this beautiful museum suggests that this is a 'budget' or freebie option, it is only thanks to the generosity of Mr Getty that this is the case.

Wonderful pieces of art work; but the most interesting was the media section, illustrating how media can really bend the truth. Beautiful building, wonderful history behind it. It was raining, so we did not get to see the gardens! Would return to see them, however. Free admission, just a $15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901jenna
40,A must see,We came here on our first day in L.A from Australia. We just loved it. The architecture and exhibitions are very interesting. Views of L.A. and a massive freeway are the best. Admission is free but parking is not. We traveled by Uber so were pleased to see the free train up to the main buildings. There was a huge range of sculptures and paintings to look at as well as many different garden displays. All of the staff are very helpful. Food and drink options were not to our liking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Les6447
50,An Enriching day is one spent at The Getty Center,"The last time I came here was their special preview before the grand opening. I couldn't believe it had been almost 20 years since I last visited. My wife, son and I truly enjoyed our 7 hours here even with the rain. Probably could have spent another 5 being we didn't get a chance to see any of the gardens due to weather and missed a number of exhibits due to time. They have a lot of free tours, take advantage of them. We got in one tour (Renaissance) and the sharing of their knowledge really makes the art come alive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRitt07

50,"beautiful spot, total attention to detail","Amazing, gorgeous architecture and landscape. I can't recall a museum experience with more hospitable and helpful staff, both the employees and the volunteers. We didn't realize how enormous the facility is. Got there too close to closing time (which did give added bonus of the view of city at night) so we returned the next day to see everything. Highly recommend uber/lyft or public transpo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4374HAelizabeths
50,Superb. One of a kind museum,"This museum must be seen to be believed. It's location and architecture is spectacular. The best thing about the museum is the layout. You arrive to easy and well organized parking then ride on a train ( tram) that takes you up a mountainside to an architectural masterpiece that overlooks all of Los Angeles. You can also have lunch in one of the top restaurants in LA and oh --- by the way--- there's some pretty interesting art and sculpture too peruse too!No it's not the louvre but the collection is very good and has a couple of authentic masterpieces.Van Gogh's "" Irises "" alone is worth the price of admission ( which by the way is free).We had a family gathering of 2-70 year age range and everyone had a wonderful time. We visited only the main museum. Saving the roman /Greek building for our next visit.$15 for parking was the only charge.A great deal.Plan to spend at least three hours.It's a gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBB7

40,Wonderful museum,"If you go here, try to avoid rush hours because the highway gets very crowded. A good time to go is after 10 am, when traffic improves. Architectural design of this place is superb. Gardens seem wonderful but it rained the day we went, so we were not able to visit them.They have many art works from different periods and a seasonal show was on.Excellent activity for a rainy day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/536MarcoC
40,Beautifu venue by the beach.,"A beautiful museum filled with statues, furnishings and everyday items to view, surrounded by lush gardens and an amphitheater. We go about twice a year......usually when they have special exhibits. An afternoon is the perfect time to go, then watch the sunset over the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
50,OUTSTANDING DAY VISITING,"My wife and I recently returned from a trip to LA. We spent part of a day visiting The Getty Museum. It was outstanding. Our time there was simply not enough (unfortunately, we had an early wedding to attend). You need an entire day to visit everything.We took the Architectural Tour (45 minutes), the Garden Tour (again 45 minutes) and walked (quickly) the West Building. All were informative and gave us Mr. Getty's history and the history of the museum.There are also a couple of good lunch options....the casual café or the ""better"" restaurant. We quickly ate at the Café and food was fine.This place is FREE (they do charge you $15 to park). It is a wonderful touring option!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159GaryS
50,"If you have a day, go!","Parking is the only required fee, and the exhibits are wonderful. And the views. And the gardens. And the architecture. I even saw a hummingbird flitting in the landscaping -- bonus! Believe it or not, I had lunch for under $6! Granted, it was a can of soda and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the courtyard, but it was all I needed, and sort of a nice change of pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549melissap
50,A world-class museum with outstanding views and exhibits,We only had time for one of the Getty museums and we chose wisely. This museum has eclectic exhibit halls ranging from Renaissance to Impressionist to Modern works. The gardens themselves are true works of art and one could literally spend an entire day without running out of things to see and experience. The guided tours are quite valuable and run throughout the day; definitely worth taking. We have put this museum on our must-return list for our next trip to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawrenceD884

50,Amazing.,"This is the most amazing place I've ever visited on the west coast. A must see. The grounds, gardens, views and architecture alone are enough for a visit, but add the art collection and you can easily spend the day. Amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O554NMjuliew
40,Wonderful gardens,I went to visit the complex to see the architecture. The gardens were a pleasant surprise and you should visit if you have time in LA. It is a bit far out of the town though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
50,A special place!,"I'm lucky to live in DC near many wonderful museums ... but truly enjoyed our recent visit to The Getty. The site is magnificent - with expansive views of LA (when there isn't smog or ""marine layer""). The architecture of the building is amazing - such careful thought clearly went into architect Richard Meier's design. So unique and perfectly situated. The gardens are lovely and worth the stroll. You pay only for parking ($15) so for us, it was a bargain! Wish we could have stayed longer (we had a hockey game to get to in Anaheim) but so glad we made the Sunday afternoon visit. I will definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisab64
50,Incredible! Free! Perfection!,"When in Los Angeles, you MUST go to the Getty Center!!!! The views alone are worth the trip, but the incredible collections will equally blow you away.There is a gourmet restaurant on the property which is incredible, but the cafe is EXCELLENT as well.Warning: it will be tough to see everything in one day so plan multiple visits.This is a ABSOLUTE must see in Los Angeles! You will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729brianc
50,Great morning,This is one of those places where you can spend as much time as you want and still have a great time. The exhibits are thoughtfully located around the property. We especially loved the gardens. we hope to return sometime when we can spend even more time looking through all the rooms. We love that it is free and parking is only $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellc44
50,Beautiful Spot for an Artistic Visit,"The Getty Center hosts a wide range of paintings, decorative arts, and sculpture spread across a number of buildings and outdoor areas. Access through each building is easy, and helpful staff are available if you get lost or are looking for a particular piece. The collection itself has a few notable works, including Van Gogh's IRISES, a handful of Rubens, and some nice Rembrandts, Manets, and Gaughins. But visitors might also be interested in the Research Institute, which specializes in preservation and restoration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyA56003
50,Must see museum in LA,"If you are visiting LA you must see The Getty. It's an amazing series of buildings with incredible views, beautiful gardens and a constantly changing list of exhibits. You definitely need several hours to tour the galleries and outdoor spaces, and there are several places to grab some food on the premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlakeNyc
50,A Short Visit Right Before Closing,"This place is magnificent. The most beatiful place in LA. Even if you are not into art museums, pay the parking fee (only $10 in the afternoon) and ride the tram up the hill to one of the county's most perfectly designed buildings. It fits the space, the top of a hill, like an Italian hill town, but with the precision and aesthetic of one of the truly great American architects. Oh, and by the way, you can see one of Van Gogh's Iris paintings.My family, who are not art museum or architecture fans thought this place was one of the highlights if our trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DTBinFWD
50,Best Place for a Date!,"Nice, well displayed venue. Even if you are not a fan of art, there will be something for everyone here...amazing! Plan at least 4 hours because you'll be surprised how much is here. Best time to visit is right before closing because of all the lights and views near the center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StonewallJackson2015
50,Outstanding,"Probably one of the best features in LA, the Getty Center is a wonderful place with stunning views on LA, quiet areas and garden to linger in the shade, and an incredible art collection! A few pictures of the best painters, from Fra Angelico to Manet and Matisse, including Rembrandt and Turner! Extremely well displayed in beautiful buildings. You will also see French 18th century chateau's living rooms, all genuine, tainted glass, 19th century bronze statues, etc... What a day! I still cannot believe it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guy415
50,Enjoyable Afternoon,"The grounds are very interesting , the collection of art is top rate, overall surroundings are very well thought out, the views are amazing from property , I normally don't go to places like this but this was exceptional",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2613SMjohnm
50,Another 5 star review for a great museum,"If you are looking for a place with great art, great view, great food - then a visit to the Getty is not to be missed. Second visit and well worth it. The museum houses an extensive and well curated collection of art spanning thousands of years. Something for everyone. The day we were there (Wednesday) was school kid day - several of the groups were under 10 years old and they were so engrossed with the docents and the art they were learning about. I love the old masters and there were plenty of them to fill my time. The views from the museum are spectacular (but can be hit or miss). Have lunch in one of the two restaurants (a cafeteria style one with many different choices and a more formal dining room). The museum is free .... but you pay for parking ($15). Be sure to check out their website to learn about the museum and collection as there is so much - everyone should find something interesting in the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twinaisle
50,My favorite place in LA,"The Getty is gorgeous, whether or not you are into art. The grounds are superb and the trip up the mountain in the little train car fun as well. I could hang out here for days. Go during sunset, you won't regret it! Spectacular views of the mountains and parts of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oddessence

50,May cause audible gasp,"Such a well designed facility. Nothing seems crowded even though there were lots of tourists, school field trips, an all manner of people. As much as I hyped this place to my wife she was still blown away by the breadth of art, beauty of the vistas and the gorgeous architecture. The gardens cannot be oversold especially if you are not expecting the grand reveal of the center garden's azaleas labyrinth. It will literally cause an audible gasp if you're not prepared. It took us 4 and a half hours to do the highlights, gardens, and one of the special exhibits. One can easily spend multiple days here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmundp2015
50,"Impressive collection, lovingly arranged, and free admission",Come to see impressive art collection and great view from the hill top. Make sure you see impressionist paintings and great collection of sculptures. Check out their temporary exhibitions too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leonidt158
50,amazing place,Great please to spend the time with friends and girlfriend as well. Had a very special time as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohitbazra
50,A Must See,"The grounds themselves are stunning, and the art collection is substantial. I'd put this on par with all of the other major museums in the world- it's a must. It may be hard to get to without a car though since it's not directly in the city, but the trek will be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233mariak
50,Great views!,I never get tired of this place. Sitting atop a hill on the west side of Los Angeles affords some of the best views on a clear day. And the price is right too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillysWorld
50,It's THE Getty museum!,"To visit Los Angeles and miss the Getty Museum would be an abomination. This is a seminal museum not just for the city but for the art world.The basics: you could just see some of the exhibits, many of which focus on sculpture, paintings and decorative arts from the 1600's to the present. Or you could spend time won their temporary exhibits that feature more contemporary topics.What makes it special, besides the extraordinary collection of art? It's how it's displayed, how its curated. For example, they often juxtapose how one cultural aspect or historical era influenced another, a seemingly different one.What else makes this special? You could even decide to just visit it because of the breathtaking views of the Los Angeles area, the gorgeous architecture, or just to walk around the gardens. (If I could, I'd move in here and bask at the views.) A superb place and a monument to humanity and culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Daphne1734
50,Beautiful place,I've been here with my family. It is gorgeous! It's one of the nicest places in Los Angeles. I took my little niece there she was visiting from Mexico. They all loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifersanchezxyz
50,Simply a Great Attraction. Come Here If You Have Any Soul.,"The Getty is a unique attraction in that it is not only a great art museum, but the setting is an architectural gem and is perfect for its location.I've visited the Getty three times now over the course of several years. Each visit has increased my appreciation of this wonderful site. Let's rattle off some of the strengths.This is an art museum and rather than try to cover everything it does a handful of styles and periods very, very well. Particularly impressive are the European paintings, which include works by Rubens, Breugel, Jan Steen, Rembrandt (there are several), Van Dyke, Poussin, Veronese, Titian, El Greco, LaTour, Delacroix, Turner, (you should get the idea). Many of these paintings are not iconic in the sense that you've seen them countless times, but that's actually part of the charm here - these are works by great masters that are not well known.There is a section on Impressionist art. I believe that at least two of these paintings were actually part of the 1860s Paris salons that began the Impressionist movement. Somewhat oddly, many of these paintings are packed into a single gallery as if to cordon off the paintings most likely to inspire ""selfies"" in a kind of isolation. These paintings are, however, all worth individual consideration, including works by Manet, Pisarro, Monet, Degas, Rodin, Renoir, Sisley, Van Gogh (I think there are about 3 here), Cezanne, Daumier, and Gauguin.If there is anything you take away from this review, please LOOK UP as you enter the hallway just outside gallery E261 (I believe). There you will see the wonderful Honthorst painting: Musicians on the Balcony (1622), which is a depiction of musicians looking down on you from above. It's a delightful scene and probably 98% of visitors never even see it.So the art is great, but the structure is, too. I took an architectural tour, which was great, and helps you ""decode"" much of the building, which vary based on the direction of the rock they are sitting on and their purpose. What I really liked is that this structure is perfect and complements a city I don't even particularly like. It takes advantage of open space. It takes advantage of the sun. There are lots of great views of the city, some of which the structures very deliberately frame. And I can't imagine it working anywhere else - that's the best of what architecture has to offer.There are all kinds of different food offerings, from coffee kiosks, to an excellent cafeteria, to a sit-down restaurant. I saw many people using the site for picnic lunches, and that seemed to be encouraged. As you might expect, there are multiple museum shops, many with unique goods.There is a $15 charge for parking, which I viewed as fair for the area, and admission is free, including to the various exhibits. You really can't do better.One warning (and a tip). This museum is understandably popular with school groups. My sense is that you could avoid them by coming early or later past school hours. I was there mid-day, but found that they are indeed large, but they also move quickly. If you find a group in your way, wait a few minutes and they're likely to move on.I'd say come here on a nice day with family or friends, enjoy the art and the setting, and simply soak it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
50,Beauty in everything,"Although I love art, the one and only time I visited I don't think I paid much attention to it.. instead I was captivated by the beauty of the architecture, stunning views and design of the facilities themselves.Whether you are visiting LA, a native or a transplant - this is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GChi-LA
50,Super location,"Exhibits are wonderful View is spectacular. People watching is fun. Places to hang out and breathe abound. Wine is good. Food service at restaurant is nice. Grass is fresh and gardens are lovely. for a date, a family outing, a time to be alone. The Getty does it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rng17
50,Beautiful Site and Architecture,"Wonderful place. Brought a soon to be six year old. We were only able to make it through 2.5 museum buildings of art. The scavenger hunt they have for the kids helped. We knew we wouldn't see all in one visit. After the hunt, we hit the kids area. Was small but some interactive stuff for younger kids. We spent about 30 mins here. The highlight for my son was the gardens. He loved putting his feet in the small stream and rolling around the grassy lawn. We enjoyed the beauty and thought put into this place. Great gift to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimk336
30,Disappointed,"The art is dead boring (pre C19th), the architecture is a bit dated, but the gardens are still amazing. Free entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casuarina639
50,A Breath Of Fresh Air,"Leave your cares at the bottom of the hill. This family friendly destination (which is free, by the way) will transport you by tram to the travertine modern architectural expanse above the Sepulveda Pass with views from downtown to the ocean. There is a fee for parking and plan to spend a pretty penny in the restaurant. The restaurant is a personal favorite with stunning views, excellent service and menu offerings.There is a cafeteria style spot downstairs as well as food carts and pic-nicking is allowed, too. The gardens are worthy of a stroll and kids will enjoy rolling down the grassy hills. There are interactive (treasure hunts, and hands on exhibits) activities for young visitors a nice gift shop and of course there are many galleries to wander through and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EM-FamilyTravel
50,Refresh your soul!,"Take the entire day to see the Getty. There is so much more here than art. The gardens and outdoor spaces are truly rejuvenating. If you are trying to pack a lot into a trip, then you won't want to spend the entire day here. But if you are a local, this is a wonderful space to spend some time in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2117RFannc
50,Great hang out and picnic,Head up there and enjoy a great view. Bring picnic and relax in the garden. It should be easy to walk and not wait for the tram.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikkelH437
50,Never disappointed,"The Getty never ceases to amaze me. It has opened up so many different facets of Art for everyone in my family. I love it most when we are driving home and the opinions from each one of us that is shared yet again opens up a new view of what we all had just seen. Not matter what each independent view is, it is always one of beauty and one of a new way of understanding life, art and emotion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balabmw
50,Not to be missed,"Our Uber driver yesterday recommended seeing the Getty & so glad we visited. The architecture, gardens, art collection, sculptures & unexpectedly, the incredible views of LA were a good choice of a place to visit while here for only a few days. We also had lunch, which was delicious. We ate outdoors in the beautiful seating. The museum is free. We walked up the hill due to the large number of students arriving about the time we did. We took the tram down, which was a pleasant trip.The gardens & seeing some of my favorite artists made for a perfect day. There is a $10 parking fee, but our Uber driver dropped us off so it was a very economical way to spend a sunny day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/694DawnS
50,Beautiful building and architecture,Last minute descision to come here after it was recommended to us. So glad we did. Stunning views of the city and a beautiful place to walk around. Lovey gardens and wide open spaces. We wanted to look at the impressionist gallery. It's ok and there are some interesting pieces. Definitely worth a visit to see the whole building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6944FYhelenb

It's free admission with a parking fee and a delightful tram ride to the hilltop where the building sits atop. Enjoy one of LA's finest!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/premierlsg
40,Surprisingly good cafeteria lunch,My daughter and I stopped into the Cafe for a late lunch during our visit. We were both impressed with how much we enjoyed our lunches. Really good for cafeteria food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MegR414
50,"Best views, with art!","I love spending the day at the Getty and it's the perfect place to take out of town guests. The Views are incredible, there are a lot of special exhibitions throughout the year, and different choices of where to get lunch depending on what you want to spend.If the weather is nice (and especially during the spring, although it's LA so even in the rain it's been nice) it's wonderful to walk down the zig zag path through Robert Irwin's garden and into the plantings around the water feature. I love bringing people, but I've gone and spent the day on my own with a sketchbook, as well.There's a nice sculpture garden upstairs off of one of the European art buildings. You can get there from an outside stairway, to the left of the ""rock fountain"" as you enter the big area between the main buildings. I've taken a sandwich up there with a journal.Over the years they've had some wonderful new art acquisitions and there is a pretty big variety of art to see in the permanent collection, from the 15th century up to some especially great works in the late 19th, with some lovely impressionist pieces. For the size of the collection there is a big variety of Dutch, Flemish, French and Italian masters (a gorgeous Rembrandt of a military guy in a helmet and my favorite portrait ""Study of a Model"" by the French painter Géricault.)There isn't so much that you are overwhelmed but there is a lot to enjoy with the great architecture and fabulous views. I'd go when it opens, see some art, have lunch and see a bit more art and then leave before traffic if you are going to the east side. Otherwise, stay longer and have dinner in Westwood or Brentwood, and then head home after the traffic.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobaltViolet
50,Must see 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,"One of the most amazing places I have ever visited the views across LA are incredible and it's free to enter (15 dollars to park) you get a tram up from the car park, the buildings are a work of art and the gardens are spectacularA must see if in LA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leet173

Only $15 parking or $10 after 3p on Sat - which is what we did and we had plenty of time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krissicherie
40,Peace and Culture,"Architectural Masterpiece?, the vote is out on that one. Great spot for seeing art, the terrific garden and the best view of L.A. Interesting shows without the crowds at LACMA. And decent food. So, if you're burnt out by the traffic, go here and chill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Logan8811
50,A Beautiful Way To Spend The Day,This museum never ceases to amaze me. The exhibits are always fabulous and diverse. The grounds and view is breathtaking. The ambiance is sublime. It is a relaxing way to stimulate your creativity and soothe your soul.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanciW9
50,Beautiful Place,"I was a bit hesitant to go to the Getty, since I'm not much interested in art, but my visit here was absolutely wonderful. Most people probably go here for the Van Gogh, which is beautiful, but this museum has so much more to offer. The view from the many balconies is amazing, most days you can see out to the ocean. The garden was nearly in full bloom during our visit, and we were able to sit on the grass and just enjoy the scenery for about a half hour. The architecture is astounding and, even with my lack of knowledge on the subject, the art was as well. You could probably spend the whole day here. Don't recommend for people with young children, but this is great for those with teens and for adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/778kj
50,Fun with picasso,"We really enjoyed itRecommend this museum to every bodyTotally worth it ,and the best of all is free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tourhollywood
50,"Good Art Permanent and temporary exhibitionss, And superb Architecture","The Getty Center has a very extensive collection of paintings, statues and an excellent collection of European antiquities, decorative items, furniture, etc. worth to see.With regard to paintings it is not El Prado (Madrid) or Le Louvre or the Vatican museums but it has several interesting paintings of different European schools like: Italian (Tiziano, Carrari, Barbieri, D’Arezzo ); Dutch(Rembrandt, Duck, van Gogh); French (Cézanne, Poussin, Roucher, Monet); Flemish(Rubens), very few from the Spanish school, I remember only one Murillo.In addition to permanent exhibits there are temporary exhibits of great value and the building itself is an outstanding piece of architecture. Do not miss the outside terraces and the gardens.It is not easy to get to the parking area. We always drove to the Getty Center and we usually visit it on the Fridays when I am off work, normally around 10:00. There it might be public transportation (We never use Public Transportation to the Getty) but I guess there it will be buses, no subway, train, etc. So public transportation also will have to fight the traffic.The place is definitely a zoo on weekends, but on week days is easier to get in at around 10:00. Warning; check to museum operating hours and don’t stay too late (15:00 hrs.) otherwise the freeway would be solid. You can also use Sepulveda Blvd instead of the frewway going south toward Beverly Hills or North towards the San Fernando Valley. Going North both, freeway and Sepulveda, will be crowded.During the week, it might be schools visiting which means teenagers doing stupid things but the majority of them don’t pay too much attention and move on quickly. If you are interested in something in an exhibition room full of teenagers, just wait 3 to 5 minutes and the wave will move on.Entrance is free, but you pay for parking. Food is expensive and not that great.The gardens and exterior terraces will be very hot in summer.Worth to visit, we have visited several times but to have an idea of the traffic in Los Angeles; in a low traffic day 12 minutes or less from my house. In a heavy traffic day 45 minutes to 1 hour. Welcome to LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derbunker
50,A day spent at the Getty will bring a lifetime of joy and satisfaction,"There is so much to do and see at the Getty. You need to spend more than a day but if you don;t have the time, you can choose the areas of your particular interests. Personally, the gardens are so well manicured that with weather like today that's where you'll spend most of the time with a terrific cafe and choose the halls you want to peruse. Have a fun and learning experience together with family and friends. Raquel Ramsey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquelr434

The gardens are great and unbelievable and well kept. The views of Santa Monica, Los Angeles and the snow capped mountains are unbelievable.

50,Outstanding cultural centre with amazing views of LA,"The Getty Center is truly superb. I won't reiterate all the good reviews but instead offer some advice:1) Allow a full day2) Try and have your own transport to the centre, the tours are a rip off and are very unreliable with pick up times.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victoriaonholidays
50,Excellent place to spend a few jours,"What a gem! Everything about The Getty is classy and special. Parking was easy, midweek anyway. The views were amazing, the art spectacular (and just the right amount to see).

50,A place to experience,"I go back again and again. Even the parking garage is interesting and that's just the beginning. This museum is a work of art that contains works of art. Like its parent, The Getty Villa, The Getty Center is an experience, not just a museum or a place to visit. I've been to art museums all over the world and have seldom been disappointed. This museum rivals them all when one considers all the factors that a visit entails. Some other world class art museums have better collections but overall, particularly when you add the architecture, the gardens, the setting and the fact that The Getty is free, it is one of the world's outstanding museums.Advice: Reservations are required and should be booked well in advance to avoid disappointment although one might get lucky and get in the same day. Worth a try!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnD1107

50,Omigosh!,"Bring your sturdy walking shoes, a sense of curiosity and wonder and an appreciation for art and architecture and you will think you've died and gone to heaven.

The art is everything.I love this place. Oh, and it is free. Seriously. Free. You pay for parking, but that's it.You start your trip with a ride up a tram to the museum. That is fun in and of itself. The museum has a design that showcases the views from the hilltop location as if they were also pieces of art. The gardens are also designed by, you guessed it, an artist.Heaven in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danid918
50,Please do this! It's worth the time,"The Getty offers a wide variety of permanent and temporary art exhibits.

Entrance is free, but parking £20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianmA476PD
50,Fantastic art and arcitecture for free except the parking.,"You can easily spend a day here. Phenomenal art collection housed in an purpose built development that is worth a visit for the architecture alone.You park all day for USD $15 (from memory) then catch the tram (funicular) up the hill to the precinct of buildings and gardens that make up the Getty.Painting, sculptures, furniture and tapestries number among the art huge collection of fine art.You can do no cost tours of the architecture or watch instructive videos to learn more about the construction of the Getty and about Getty the man.Food in the Bistro was a little pricey but good.

50,Great Day Out,"This place just has to be seen to be believed, ithe design is simply amazing. We took a guided garden tour which was very interesting, unfortunately the tour of the most important works in the collection was booked out. You would want to avoid a very hot day if possible to visit on account of the large expanses of concrete. Food was good and not too pricey but next time we would take a picnic to have on one of the lawns. Lots of children there who seemed to be enjoying themselves! A little train takes you from the parking to the Center, which is fun. No entry charge, $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lavinia4248

50,Spring Road Trip,"We arrived a few minutes after 3 so the parking was $10. That's all we paid for an amazing adventure. Being a Saturday I'm sure it was very busy but it did not seem crowded because the grounds are so big. Plenty to see. We did drive to the 5th basement level to park but the elevator up to tram station was quick. Line to wait wasn't long and the 5 minute trip up the hillside offered breathtaking views of LA and surroundings.

50,Great place to take visitors- Local LA'ers try going in the fall for less crowds,"There's no doubt that this is quite the ""Instagram""-able place. The grounds and views (on a nice day) are beautiful. I love to take advantage of going late in the afternoon for the discounted $10 parking. Local LA'ers: try going in the fall to avoid some of the crowds. I went in October and it was not nearly as busy as when I went in early February.

30,A madhouse on the weekend,"Maybe you'd have better luck on a weekday, but we visited on a Saturday along with half of LA. Upon arrivel, we kept going down and down in the car park, finally finding a spot in the fifth basement. Then up the elevator to find a line of people waiting for a security check. Then another line for the tram to the top of the hill.Crowds thinned a bit in the museum because it's pretty big. But the crowd for the current exhibit's tour was too big, so we skipped it.Since it had rained the day before, the garden tour was partialy cancelled. They would take musem goers to overlook the garden but not walk through it.Did like the free headsets that talk about some of the art work in the musem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour224332
50,Always something great to see and experience,"Been to the Getty's two location numerous times and have enjoyed both but the Getty Center is my favourite. There is always something great to see.

50,"Rainy Day, but who cares","I visited the Getty on a rainy day in LA (historic rains apparently). Much of the great views taking the tram and from them campus were obstructed by clouds/fog, despite that it felt amazing to only have to pay for parking. I enjoyed visiting the exhibits and although I am by no means an art expert I have great admiration and appreciation for the quality that is exhibited here, I especially loved the manuscripts although there were only a few. I plan on returning on a sunny day to enjoy all the outside art and gardens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vsisnero

50,Great views and some truly great art,"A visit to the Getty Center is a must when you are in Los Angeles. The setting is breathtaking, especially if you are able to be there at sunset. The buildings are monumental and have a sense of timelessness about them, something rare in Los Angeles. The grounds invite meandering, especially the wonderful garden. There are some wonderful impressionist paintings and several Rembrandts. The photography collections is first class. And you can eat well in the upscale restaurant, but even the food in the cafe is very pleasant. I am a frequent visitor since I live in the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorlib

50,So Much for So Little!,"The best eclectic collection of art and fine artifacts on the West Coast is accessible to anyone in Southern California. From Van Gogh to bedrooms, Getty certainly knew what he liked. It's a good idea to suspend your expectations of what an art museum SHOULD be. This is a personal collection open to all for free. Parking is a small fee. I enjoyed seeing so many school children enjoying the wonderment of this unique experience. My second visit and hopefully not my last.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LutheranLadySanDiego
50,Art and gardens,"The Getty center is a real treat for art lovers of all types! This is another place in LA you want to visit during the week or on a slower non- art show/opening day. Of course I love the centuries and centuries of artworkand I frequented the Getty Center often when I was in art school studying but now I find it very meditative to escape LA and be in a place such as the Getty center. The gardens there are also superb and absolutely beautiful and tranquil. There is a café with basic beverages and snacks as well. This is a great daytime trip especially when the weather is hot in Los Angeles, museums are the best place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD819
50,Stunning View of LA,Advice is to try and get to The Getty Centre midweek as at the weekends it can get very busy.

On a recent visit, a friend said they wanted to go so my wife and I went along and, wow, am I glad I did. The gardens are stunning. Even the views beyond the Getty are amazing. Go on a sunny day, but okay if a cooler day because there is so much to see outside. There is a nice cafe where you can get a great lunch, and tours you can take as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atthe

Park in the garage ($15.00) and take the tram; incredible views on the climb up to the museum campus.

40,The Architecture Tour Was So Fascinating!,"We very much enjoyed our visit to the Getty Center, the Gardens and some of the exhibits, but the highlight of our visit was the guided Architecture Tour. Our guide was incredible and her explanations of why & how Richard Meier designed the intricate details of the buildings made the trip that much more enjoyable. We had several engineering students in our tour group and they commented about how they had heard excellent things about this tour. I would highly recommend taking this hour tour to gain insight as to the architect's vision and implementation of his ideas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaL437
50,User Friendly Museum,"The beautiful museum and grounds is a great place to spend a few hours. From the views along the monorail ride, and from the museum grounds to all the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanb514
40,Amazing views,Very nice museum and collectionThe views from the top are worth the visit no matter what.OrganizedParking costs 15$,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1755LYkarens
50,Fantastic Way to Spend a Day,"We arrived at the Getty Center for our first visit on a Tuesday morning. Parking and the tram ride were both very easy. We were there on a beautiful day and the views were fantastic. The first thing we did was the architecture tour. I would highly recommend this tour. It is only about 45 minutes and it provides a very good overview of the site, the architect, and the design of the buildings and spaces. We spent a couple hours walking around the plazas and through the galleries. We stopped for a lunch break and we were very impressed with the variety and the quality of the food in the cafe. The collections were quite impressive, although we didn't get to see all of them during our relatively short visit. The Getty is a great way to spend a day in Los Angeles and I would highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeaconTraveler
50,Awesome views,Great views even on a rainy day. We did the 45 minute architecture tour that was very informative. The impressionists gallery was better than I thought it would be. Easy pick up and drop of with Uber and museum is free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgea588
50,One of the Best Experiences in LA,The art is varied and changes from time to time but the architecture and views are always amazing. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesM298
50,Very nice place to visit!,We saw lots of good art works here which impressed us a lot and will surely will spend more time to explore next time when we are there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adabbler
50,"Rain or shine, one of the best places to visit in LA","I have visited the Getty dozens of times, and it is one of my favorite places to recommend in Los Angeles. In addition to the wonderful gardens and magnificent views of the city and Santa Monica coastline, it truly has a ""something-for-everyone"" quality that can open the imagination of every visitor. Each building housing the art collections has its own unique feel. It is wonderful to see the treasures that have been housed there for years (I especially love the crystal chandelier from France in which goldfish were to frolic above the heads of dinner guests). Yet the revolving exhibitions, concerts and lectures keep it alive and fresh. The docents are excellent, yet even if you are looking for a place to get away from the traffic, there is always a quiet corner somewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebekah_jorgensen
50,Amazing building and locale with plenty of space to enjoy the art,"I had been told by a friend that the Getty Centre was worth visiting for the building alone - and that is certainly true. Visited at the end of a fairly long day and so the kids were not going to let me stay for hours. Nevertheless we had time enough to admire the architecture, appreciate the vista over LA and fall in love with one of Cezanne's beautiful still lifes. Free entry means there is no pressure to look at every artwork - I picked one pavilion and savoured that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5414BOannm
50,Don't Miss This,"I love the garden. Parking is easy and inexpensive and then the museum is free!! And you get a little tram ride too! Good for the kid in each of us. Take a tour: architecture, garden, exhibit. Very knowledgable docents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl90
50,A day at the Getty center,I love the Getty center. It's so rich with beautiful art work. They have a stunning garden outside. Probably my favorite part. We had a small picnic on the grass by the river. There is ample parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramnu01
50,This really is one of the best things to do in LA,"I won't try to review it other than to say that it's a must-see for anyone going to LA. The collection is extraordinarily wide although without the depth of the best European galleries. However, as a piece of contemporary architecture it is simply stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavydL
50,An Exciting Learding Adventure,I am always amazed at the exciting exhibits at the Getty and it seems each visit is an exciting learning adventure for me,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibuleo
50,Spend a few hours,"It is large - even the parking lot, so note the parking level you end up at. After entering the museum collect the complimentary audio tour, then check out the special exhibit. The museum buildings are physically ordered by year with the most recent pieces to the right. The museum cafe has a wide variety of food types but closes a couple hours before the museum. Must see the garden - even in February - preferably after taking the complimentary hour long garden tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wen_to_travel
50,A must!,"We had an amazing afternoon. I would budget at least three hours to enjoy both the incredible are and the gardens. Parking was competitive but we'll organized. Staff was very efficient, knowledgeable and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pzpuppy
50,What a wonderful gift to America,All that you will read about the Getty Center is true. This is a remarkable collection in a remarkable setting. Plan on spending a full day there and pace yourself. The scope of this collection is amazing. We ate at the cafe there and the meals were also excellent with a wide variety of options. This is a must see place in LA. We will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begreen
50,Undoubtedly MUST VISIT in LA,"It's a huge complex, I don't think that even the whole day is enough to see everything here. This center is a great combination of museum with unique pictures (e.g. Van Gogh's Irises) and sculptures, architectural masterpiece and panoramic city view with great Californian landscape and nature. The great plus is that it's absolutely free and you don't need any reservation for tickets (like you do for Getty Villa). If you come here in winter, dress up warmly, because the complex is on the hill and it can be really windy outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag394
50,Loved it!,This museum was quite an experience. We stayed about 3 hours. Once you park you will ride the tram to the actual museum. The most famous work is probably the irises by Van Gogh. The impressionist paintings draw quite a crowd. The gardens and views make the outdoor part of the museum just as entertaining. I wouldn't plan on eating at the cafe. Food seemed overpriced for what it is but that is to be expected. This free museum is definitely worth the $15 parking fee. Bring all your friends!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
50,Getty Visit,The Getty is as beautiful as the pictures describe it to be. The buildings themselves are bold and striking. The grounds are kept neat and clean. You can sign out an iPod to give yourself a guided tour by listening in. The tram ride up and entrance are all free to the public and accessible by public transit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393katrinas
50,Overview of LA,"Beautifully set and a great pleasure to visit, walk through the different parts and appreciate the spectacular view and the art on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgazzaz
50,First time visit but not the last.,"On vacation in LA, we were looking for something fun and cheap to do for the afternoon. I have heard of The Getty museum for years. Cost to the museum is free with a $15 parking fee. We took a 45-minute architectural tour and then spent a few hours on a self-guided tour with headsets. With two teenaged boys and an 11-year-old in tow, we all had a great time. Exhibits include artwork, sculptures, tapestries, furniture, and more. The views of Los Angeles to the southeast and the ocean to the southwest are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucerotcb
50,An LA Must!,"Stunning architecture, breathtaking landscape, best views of LA and fantastic art collection. You can spend hours here getting lost in the arts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svanhassel
10,Only for true art connoisseur.,"Pretty boring center unless you really really understand art. Also, the exhibitions shift and so you don't know what you will get into. We saw few Italian exhibits and we didn't enjoy it at all. $15 of parking wasted for an hour spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gauravarora22
50,Incredible museum and grounds,"We always enjoy our visits to the Getty Center. It is wonderful arts center and it is free, you only pay for parking. We always try to visit when the center has a new exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb7091954
50,Beautiful view of the city and fabulous gardens,"A must see museum in Los Angeles and a wonderful place to take visiting guests. Parking can be difficult and fills up, so you may want to take a cab. The view is extraordinary and the art collection is wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MesBeauxVoyages
50,gorgeous,"I absolutely loved this place. Its a really nice place for kids as well. You can take a guided tour if necessary, but I don't actually suggest it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6272PKmatthewd
50,Amazing Location and Views,"The location of the Getty has to be among the most beautiful parcels of land in LA -- the views of the city and the ocean are fantastic...and that is to say nothing about the quality of the art and gardens. Lovely visit, and free too (less the very reasonable $10-15 parking)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231nicholasg
50,Beautiful location,This is a very elegant restaurant at the Getty Center.The menu is interesting and food excellent.We appreciated the fine service and the fact that reservations are honored.At times they cannot accommodate location requests but that is generally not a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCNT3
50,Wonderful for Families,"Tourists or Californians: Spectacular views, luscious gardens, free entry (just a parking fee if you go by auto), good food. The staff always treated us as honored guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dla2rre
30,Worth a Visit,"The collections are neither contemporary, nor exciting, but the Getty is worth a visit for several reasons, including its Richard Meier-designed buildings, its remarkable site and views, and its changing exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18554travel
40,A Little above average food at an extraordinary location,"Oen one evening a week, it is nice to visit the museum late in the day and have dinner in the restaurant. The experience is better than the food whic is upscale, fine dining but someone mises the mark. No matter - go for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voxpopla
50,Don't miss it!,The views of Los Angeles from The Getty Center are awesome. You're up and away from the buzz and busy of the city and surrounded by the most beautiful architecture. We took the architectural tour. It helped us see the design in the building and its surroundings. The museum is filled with beautiful statuary and artworks. The gardens are a favorite. The coffee cart cafe makes a mean espresso and the restaurant - be sure to make a reservation - is too notch. Do yourself a favor and visit The Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daywells
50,Love the Getty!!,We love the Getty. We go back all the time. Every trip opens up something new and different that we hadn't seen before. Sometimes it just my wife and I. Sometimes I've come alone. Other times we've brought the grandkids with us. It just a great day trip with lots of options in one place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479billf
50,Absolutely beautiful,"This Getty Center is truly an experience more so than just a museum. From the incredible artwork, sculptures and artifacts, to the lush gardens and expansive views. There is no other museum like it on earth. The Griffith Observatory comes close from a view perspective but it can't compare from an art and grounds perspective. Hard to believe this is operated of the interest of one very wealthy individual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellO6742OP
50,Self,"Fancinating place. Not too crowded. Lots af display, exhibits and art work. Beautiful grounds. A few areas for children. No charge and plenty of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49dianee
50,Pleasant Day to Spent Your Day with Your Family,"Located on breathtaking view on top of mountain over looking Los Angeles City Getty Museum is beautiful and educational way to spend your day with your family, friends, and date.

South Pavilion (art 1600-1800), West Pavilion (art after 1800), a Research Institute.an Exhibltions pavillion, a Conservation institute and several gardens. With free admission the Getty Centre should prove to be a good place for a day's visit,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephen_Ng2014
50,Above the city,"I have been to the Getty Center on many occasions to see the wide variety of exhibitions and their permanent collection, as well as to attend lectures. The visit is always pleasant due to the surroundings which are well-designed, spacious and tasteful. The Getty Center is well-run and organized to allow the visitor to enjoy the visit without the complication of trying to navigate. It's straightforward. Parking is easy, and the monorail from the parking to the exhibits is fun and interesting, allowing the visitor to look out across LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoobijones

40,Side benifits,There are some interesting side benefits to this museum.1. the air levitated train up the hillside with nice views2. an excellent docent tour - free.3. Tour groups led by UCLA and other institutions who welcomed me to join in and participate in their tour.4. a decent shop with very good art books for sale.5. first rate special exhibits e.g. Turner exhibit.6. Views from several locationsThings I didn't like:1. The cost of the parking $102. much of the art is not well known to me even though I minored in art history and taught drawing at Walt Disney and Stanford University,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joellfritsche

50,Great half day to a day activity,"Nice collection of a variety of artwork. My favorite pieces were from a temporary exhibit... The better part is just the structure and gardens, more so than some of the art. Easy to find and great that you pay one flat rate for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225StevenH225

50,The Building was the Draw for us,"When traveling with an architect, the building is often the draw. We spent our entire visit on the outside of the building, which also included sculptures and wonderful gardens. I'm sure the inside exhibits are very interesting also, but, we didn't have time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50Continental_Drift
50,dreamy place to get cultured and have picnics in the sun,From the moment you step on the tram you know you'll be transported to an amazing place... and so it is. We dont just go there for the art and the family center but simply to walk the beautiful grounds and japanese gardens and see the spectacular views. It's one of my favorite places to spend time with my family- we always have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsoley
50,One of Los Angeles' greatest jewels,"If you're looking for one thing to do in Los Angeles that doesn't remotely feel like a tourist trap, but gives you so much of the LA experience in one place, head to The Getty Center. Perched on top of the Santa Monica mountains, you'll have a beautiful view of the mountains, ocean, and city below. The gardens are magnificent. The architecture is astonishing. The art collection and exhibits are incomparable. The food options, from casual, to fine dining, is always delicious. The grounds are stunning. There are also a number of free tours you can take. You don't need to do them all in one day, but if you're into architecture, the architectural tour is fantastic. I recommend walking back down the hill to the parking lot on your way out. It's a beautiful walk with great views as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatoAkita
50,Always a Treat,"I go to the Getty Center 2-3 times a year, depending on which exhibits they have. It's always a treat--they present unique exhibits that I can't see anywhere else, display them beautifully and in a very organized way. The views from up there are spectacular in every direction. Very much worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693visitor
50,Great way to spend an afternoon in LA,"If you're in Los Angeles, and looking for art, gardens, and views, The Getty Center is a must.There is also a lovely restaurant to have a nice meal if it's a special occasion.The only thing to note is that if you come on a holiday, expect to wait a good 20 -30 minutes in line for the shuttle up the hill, but TOTALLY worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9543TKaudreys
50,Great family day-something for everyone,Love the Getty Center. You can plan to spend a few hours or the entire day. Food and drinks are available.

50,"Visit on a sunny day, fewer visitors, easy access",Weekends at The Getty Center are very busy so a weekday is a better bet to visit and see everything. The cafes and restaurants are only open until 3 on Sundays and the restaurant requires a reservation. Too see the vista of LA go to any of the open terraces. It's magnificent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaC1964
50,At least three birds with one stone,"The Getty is one part gallery, one part architectural gem and one part sculpture garden. And I am sure I am missing something - of yeah, the experience all starts with a ride. My wife and I visit regularly, sometimes with friends and sometimes together. There are also great venues on site that can be rented for events and weddings. I haven't arrived by helicopter but check out the G-shaped landing pad. And the views are great-we can see our house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandCRTravelers

50,One of kind museum.,I toured the Getty last year while visiting LA and it never ceases to amaze me. From the outdoor garden and views to the magnificent artwork inside to the building itself. It seems as if everything about the Center and it's surroundings is a masterpiece. A really amazing place to spend a few hours touring or an entire day. It never gets old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DetourRoatan
40,A Fine Collection in an Extraordinary Setting,"No trip to Southern California would be complete without a foray to the commanding hills of Brentwood to see the Getty Center Collection housed in the impressive Richard Meier designed architecture surrounded by the landscape designs of Robert Irwin. The better part of a day is needed to explore the grounds, the stunning buildings and views, and the fine collection of art, sculpture, furniture and room reconstructions. The programming of the Getty Center is quite extensive and the shows quite instructive, though in many ways the Center feels a bit stifled in its educational and instructional importance. More exhibitions & shows, and programs are working to involved the community and various constituencies. Admission is free, thought advance reservations are needed for car parking. You can also arrived by taxi, or car service such as Uber and not require a reservation. Families will enjoy the incredible numbers of room recreations with art and furniture and wall sections seemlessly fused together to appear as though the viewer is actually in the real locale and transported back to the real era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RushRelax
50,Best Value in LA,"For the price of parking [$15] or if you come on your own by bus, Uber or cab, you get in free.

50,Getty Getaway,A great place to get away from your everyday routine and see some amazing art pieces as well as the views from the Getty. The gardens are ever changing and simply beautiful. There is always something for everyone to enjoy. The tram ride up from parking lot is like being at Disneyland! Plan on spending at least half of the day so you see a bit of everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertagK3179QA
50,Art in LA,Getty has wonderful art exhibits that are matched only be the architecture and wonderfully kept lawns.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpF2648DA

50,It is simply a place not to miss,There is more than enough going on to keep you busy for a whole day. You start with the tram ride which runs parallel to the 405 and gives you a view of the freeway that you have never seen before; the busiest freeway in America with 5 lanes in each direction.The tours are well worth taking and we especially liked the architecture tour giving a great background to the design and materials used. The garden tour is equally fascinating. That is about two hours right there and you haven't even seen a single exhibit yet (there are tours for them too) and the tours are free. Most of the tours are daily but check for special tours going on when you plan to visit.We have been there three or four times and there are so many exhibits going on at the same time it is hard to choose and they change regularly. There are plenty of places to eat and even a fancy restaurant (reservations recommended) with good food (we have enjoyed the Sunday brunch a few times) and great views. In fact the whole place has 360 degree views.There is even a wonderful sculpture garden at the departure station where the tram starts. The Fran and Ray Stark Sculpture Garden is well worth the visit (Movie buffs will recognize the name).All of this for a $15 parking spot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smmower
50,Something for everyone!,"The art exhibits and kids' art rooms are great. The gardens are beautiful and offer a relaxing stroll. The restaurant is truly lovely; the presentation fits an art museum nicely. The views are terrific. Whether you stay for an hour or all day, you'll enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksplanet
50,Great place,"I love taking out of town guests here. They always love it like I do. Great interesting changing exhibits along with their permanent collections. Love the gardens and view also, the resturant is also very good. I like the shows and outdoor entertainment in summer months also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/116amyr
50,Unparelled Views (on a clear day),"Inside and out, this is an amazing museum. While they DO have stuff for kids, it's not the most kid-friendly place (lots of walking and generally quiet in nature).Great for a date (romantic or simply friendly).Carve out at least 3 hours of your day to feel like you've accomplished something. Otherwise you'll feel super rushed and chances are you'll want to return again to catch all the stuff you missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMfromLA
50,A dramatic site overlooking LA,"A good place to bring children (or, in our case, grandchildren). Handouts for ""Art Detective"" and a children's acoustiguide as well as a play room. Lots of space to run outdoors and cafeterias and well as a restaurant for dine dining. And Art, Art, Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmell0r
50,Stunning modern art museum with fantastic views,"The museum is free of charge, you only have to pay for parking. ( 15 per car at this moment ) There are other ways to reach The Getty Center but driving is the easiest. Your experience starts with the little rail car ride up the mountainside, just off the 405 freeway. The buildings are well spaced and allow you a terrific view of both the mountains and the ocean, plus a spectacular view of the city of Los Angeles. They also have delightful gardens too. The exhibitions change often and there are several options for coffee, a light bite to eat or a real meal. This place is a real treat for visitors or residents. Go on a clear day for the best experience but anytime it is well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmianP
50,Best place for the Art loving hearts,"The Getty center museum is the best cultural center which show cause the Art and Architecture of America and Europe with the paintings from the middle ages, which will definitely satisfy the artistic taste in you. It is a free museum you just need to pay the parking($15) , It is well connected by Public transit. You would definitely love the electric tram ride that brings you free to the exhibition site from the Gate. The 360 degree Hill view of LA from this location will be very awesome. Built by Robert Irwin 20 years ago. Good to engage for more than half a day, It has a healthy and tasty restaurant.

50,A 1/2 day at the Getty Museum,"One of my favorite things is to go on the weekend for Brunch. Go when they open the restaurant to (1) avoid the crowds, and (2) get a good table. Go the the Main, formal restaurant. If you ask for a window table, the views are incredible. This is NOT cheap, but worth the treat. Then, after a leisurely brunch (Bloody Marys and Mimosas!), and the blue crab cake eggs benedict is superb), talk a leisurely stroll through the gardens. Finish by (1) visiting the day's featured exhibit, and (2) visiting (or revisiting) those exhibits that appeal to you the most (I, personally, love the French antiques). End your visit at the gift shop, which changes their displays often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sinwood2016
40,Great Lunch in a contemproary atmosphere,"Hosting friends from out of town. Good soup, service and atmosphereGuests wanted to visit the museum and view the grounds. Visited the historical photography section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonViolin
50,"Great views, architecture, and art","Save your trip to the Getty Center for a clear day, and you will be treated to one of the best views in the Los Angeles area. Go on one of the docent led tours and admire the architecture and landscaping. The garden is not a complete success, but at least it is interesting. Inside you will find some impressive art. There are the great old standbys such as the Impressionists, as well as older art collections. I always check out the ever changing exhibitions and usually find something interesting, While you are walking around outside, look for leaves and feathers that landed in the Italian travertine, the same travertine that was used to build the Roman Coliseum. Even the restaurants are worth a visit. The Getty Center is a great place to spend a few hours, and bears repeat visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13wendyv
50,Everything In One Place!,"This is the perfect place to see some of what Los Angeles have to offer. Beautiful views, excellent art, sculptures and landscape. It is free and the parking is very inexpensive.You should not miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyrnaGarcia

50,Getty Fantastic,"The Getty is a hidden gem for Los Angelenos. This is one of the greatest art collections on the planet, rivaling The Louvre. But its not the collection that alone makes it great. The grounds on which it sits is equally as marvelous as to what's inside. The curvilinear design and incredible gardens surrounding the Getty are breathtaking. Please give yourself plenty of time to tour the exterior as to some this is more impressive than what's on the inside of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebMirror
50,Getty Center Re-Visit,We go visit routinely. Different times of year have different displays and events. I love visiting the garden and eating at the indoor restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27ChrisB27

50,Never too tired to go to this museum,"There are two attractions here: the collections, of course; and the structure itself. The enormous buildings are made out of a stone that reflects light in a manner perfect for taking photos of human beings. And in addition, The buildings are situated on a hilltop that looks out across Los Angeles as if it were the Acropolis. This is the place where I can go and hang out for long periods of time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR-LosAngeles
50,Enjoyable Father/Daughter day,"Spent most of the day at the Getty. Took four guided tours: Getty Highlights tour, Architecture tour, Garden Tour and the Bouchardon exhibit tour. Highly recommend taking guided tours. You won't see all of the Getty. But You will learn and enjoy much more of what you do see. Daughter loved the visiting Bourchardon tour the most. The exhibit is visiting from the Lourve.After the Getty day, we had dinner at Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles for the best meal and extravagant desserts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonS690
50,Beautiful architecture,"Since I'm an Architect, and this building was designed by my favorite architect Richard Meier, I had to make this stop. The building is beautiful, as well as the exhibitions, prices for food are high but expected in a place like this. Admission is free, you only have to pay $15 for parking ($10 after 3 pm). Too bad the gardens area was closed, but you can still get a glance from the buildings",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariagovea18
50,"Stunning setting, great shows","This is a 2-3 times a year ""must visit"" location. The view of LA is spectacular. The exhibits are a great mix of modern and Old World. Best to go on days when the weather is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeLA90210
40,"Amazing grounds, good exhibits, all for free","The Getty Centre, is a beautiful free art gallery, museum. Parking is not free $15, but the tram right to the top is free. The grounds and buildings are stunning, and well worth the 4 hours or so it takes to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julez48
40,"Historic, thought provoking & peaceful.","Art aficionado's heaven. I'm not particularly into art, but another member of my party is a true art guru. I enjoyed the manicured gardens the most, as it was the most likely part I could ever hope to replicate myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461nickr

50,Free and Fabulous,"Parking is $15 dollars. You access the Museum Campus from the parking lot via tram. This museum is housed in an architectural masterpiece. There are LOTS of volunteers and paid staff to help you navigate the buildings, floors and exhibits. Tours are available. The museum has a wonderful collection of things representative of the world's artistic high lites...It is NOT overwhelming. The outdoor spaces are welcoming while views of the city are breathtaking.

50,The Architectural Cultural Center of Los Angeles,"This is the best Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Plan to spend the day in the Robert Irwin designed gardens over looking Los Angeles from the magnificent Getty Museum, Research Center built by Richard Meier 20 years ago. You pay for parking that is it, and you are brought from it by funicular to the center. It is worth the trip because it is big, it is grand, it is modern, it is exciting and safe, it is rich and it is magnificently managed and maintained. The food served in their restaurants is even good healthy and reasonable. You can shop as well and bring some art and culture back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VBCJJ
50,"Don't Miss, Great For Anyone","Our group enjoyed both the Getty Center and Villa. We had some art teachers and enthusiasts, but also just some regular travelers. Everyone enjoyed both locations and would go back. Since it is free, except for parking, and an outstanding facility/collection, it is a great travel value for a couple of hours or all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WRHouser
50,Relax and enjoy the views,"I came here on a mission to finally see the Getty Center, after visiting the Getty Villa twice, and I'm glad I went to both. Where the Villa is more secluded and has a ""home and garden"" feel, the Center is more of a traditional museum, but with lots of open spaces between galleries so you can enjoy the typically sunny weather. The outdoor sculptures, rock and water features, gardens, and architecture make the Getty Center well worth a visit. If you want to see a majority of it, give yourself ~2ish hours, but there's always something new to discover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannelle01

The facilities are also first class including the cafeteria which serves a large selection of food, including healthy options unlike most fast food offerings in USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KookaburraSydney
40,If you like museums...,You can't complain if it's free so I won't LOL. I'm not a huge museum fan ....I can look at artwork for about 45 minutes and then my eyes start to glaze over. But if you are into that kind of stuff I'm sure this is the place for you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaLove2015
50,The best,"We got there at 11:00, stayed through an amazing lecture till 5:45pm and barely scratched the surface. $15.00 inside parking lot and all else is free. We didn't make it to the villa.You can use the parking ticket twice in one day. The docents are very knowledgeable and you can pop in and out of different docent groups moving around with guests, or stick with one tour. We got to taste a peppercorn from the pepper tree on the garden tour.We may go back today to catch the villa.**Put the address from their website to find the ONLY entrance to the parking lot. Google maps and Garmin devices may send you off track. They check your bags before they let you onto the team to take the ride up to the parking lot. Don't miss this excursion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRMyers

50,Awesome way to spend a half day,"I have to admit, we never had the getty center on our radar, even though we are in LA almost every year. This was a nice surprise, the entry is free and you only pay for parking. We decided to give it a try and went after 3pm (reduced rate at $10) and were quite surprised at the beautiful view and all the galleries showing different themes. We were really excited with the European artists and found treasures like van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and some other very famous artists hidden in between less known artists. We also took a nice long walk around the park area and it was really lovely. They also have a cafe and restaurant, so you can spend several hours there no problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jesena
50,Something for the whole gang,"The views, aside from the art, are worth going for. I took mother and son and both were really happy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytraveller911
50,Art on a Grand Scale,The Getty is $15 dollars to park and free to visit. The Art museum has near a dozen buildings set in a beautifully landscaped hill top area of Los Angeles. It has a million dollar view and you can see to the Pacific Ocean on a clear day The buildings are divided up by art periods and you could spend several days exploring and seeing all of the collection there. You can buy snacks and coffee there but a picnic lunch is recommended. The buildings made of stone and marble are massive and the architecture is almost art in itself. The grounds are beautiful and there are things to see from the time you get out of the 7 story underground parking lot. There is a small gift shop in most of the buildings from what I could tell. We only made it into three of them. Prices for souvenirs are very reasonable. You could easily spend a full day or more here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629haroldb
50,Highly recommended,The Restaurant at the Getty Center is an excellent place to relax after visiting the Museum. The food and service is spot one and extremely tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5458EUbrianm
50,"World Class Museum Come For the Art, Stay for the Architecture","The grounds, views, many gardens and exterior of The Getty are equally as stunning as the art on the interior. Make sure you leave an adequate amount of time to explore it all! On a clear day you can see all of downtown LA from here! Try to come for a sunset also!The wide variety of art is separated by time period in different buildings. There's sure to be a section here for everyone, from art buffs to even the most novice art fan. I remember the fashion and furniture sections to be among my favorites although The Getty has a few old classics I adore too! There's quite a bit of walking and steps outside so wear comfortable shoes!Admission is FREE but parking is $15, $10 after 3pm. You park at the bottom and take a tram/horizontal elevator to the top where the entrance is located. Kids will love this part! I know I did!They are closed on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmarzy
50,Awesome experience,Finally was able to make it to the Getty and it was the highlight of my trip to Los Angeles. Highly recommend checking it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travisbowel12

50,Te Getty Center,Place not to miss. Needs half a day at least and one could easily spend the whole day there. Uber was great to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mefsummers
40,Better than before,"Went to the Dunhuang exhibit, was flabbergasted. The special exhibition was breathtaking, but even more of a surprise was the Getty Center itself. When it first appeared it seemed like a arrogant excrescence on the LA landscape. Now not so much. Also, the plants have matured and the trees have started to curl and break away from stiff vertical symmetries. Yay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
40,Culture and views at the Getty centre,"A place to visit for everyone interested in architecture, art, parks and magnificent views of LA.Even if a collection is not as large as in some of the European museums, it is still worth a visit. We enjoyed a Highlights if the museum tour.It is also well organized - for a place visited by so many especially at the weekends, there almost are no crowds at all and if you miss a tour, you can join another one because they are conveniently arranged and spaced throughout the day.I suggest bringing your own snacks and drinks and enjoy a picnic on a sunny day.A great way to spend a half or a ful day for just a price of a parking fee (15$ for a whole day, 10$ if you arrive after 3PM).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18milicak
50,Fantastic,"$15 to park, free entry. It was a busy long wait to check bags and get the tram up so we returned to the car, got jackets and I left my bag so we headed straight through to walk up. A 20 min walk up the hill going at a good pace. A great collection and not too busy so you can enjoy it. A free audio guide gave more information. Ate at the cafe - a large varied selection. Waited a couple of minutes and got on a tram back down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliG1620

30,"Who said, free isn't good?","There are few things for free in Los Angeles, CA but the Betty Center is! You can spend the whole day at this museum. The collection is very good and you will certainly enjoy it unless you are European!! LOL especially if you are French. Many of the art pieces are French! And what museum can hold a candle to the Louvre! But, remember the Getty Center is free! Who can best that? Furtheremore, the view from here is simply expectacular, on a clear day, that is! If you are driving, be prepare to pay for parking which is not very cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828annmarieg
40,a gallery and a destination,"we visited for one specific exhibition, and enjoyed the rest of our time exploring the view but it would be easy to spend an entire day there! the view is beautiful and it's a peaceful location to relax and reflect on the treasures you've just viewed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PvrlGirl
50,Lovely place,Beautiful place. You can find great exposition and beautiful architecture. The Getty Center is a must if you are visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneyB278
50,Easier than you think...,"Because it has its freeway exit, and parking and tram, this is an excellent way to enjoy some iconic sights. Not only is the art collection world class, the landscaping is mature and dynamic.Allow a few hours to enjoy this once in your life, more if you must....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8495JLmichaelg
50,Enlightenment at The Getty,"I'm in love with The Getty. If I could live there I would! I have visited there several times with family, friends, and my sons class field trip when he was in grade school.This time I wanted to experience the journey on my own. The monorail takes you up to the top and the anticipation never gets old.The pristine look reminds you of a blank canvas where the promise of possibilities are endless.There are separate sculptural buildings, easily accessible, and frankly it doesn't matter which one you start in.It feels like you've actually stepped into a painting when walking through their gardens. And to be perched on one of the many balcony's looking out over the gorgeous city scape makes you feel like it can easily be a morning ritual...coffee in hand.Of course the main attraction are the exhibits of world renowned artists from eras past to present.To stand and witness the beauty of life caught in a moment of time. To feel the emotions, passion, genius, and sometimes even the pain felt with each stroke of the brush is in itself enlightenment...freedom, exhilaration, sadness, imprisonment, love and timelessness. Connection and disconnect.Ok so even if you don't get all philosophical, like I am being right now before my morning coffee...I can say this for certain...you're going to fall in love with The Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4joannea
50,Mini-Louvre Museum,"Parking is $15, entrance is free. They have guided tours of the highlights of the museum. If you want to do it at your own pace, they have audio guide for free. Their audio guide is very interesting and informative. There were some borrowed art from other museums but it is amazing how much art/paintings J. Paul Getty collected in his lifetime! Stay as long as you want. You can see the views of the city, the water and the mountains on a clear day from the balcony. The garden is pretty. I think it must be prettier in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom! The day we visited was such a beautiful day to explore the outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venust
50,Art is Life,"This is a wonderful place to spend a quiet afternoon or a busy Saturday, whichever you decide. First off, it is free to get in, you only have to pay for parking and it is a reasonable $5.00. You park in the secure parking structure and one of their electric or solar (I forget which) trams takes you up to the museum itself.Once there when you leave the tram you feel like you are somewhere else. The grounds, gardens, exhibits, EVERYTHING is amazing. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the organization of the property. In fact, even the snack area outside (in a center atrium-type area - ok not an atrium, a garden) looks like it was artistically put together. You can get light snacks, espresso, and soft drinks and water there. I don't remember big meals or hearty food. While there enjoying your beverage you can listen to the many fountains and other water art.Don't forget to check out the extensive garden area. The highlight is a concentric circle hedge row garden that they seem to alter slightly with the seasons.This is definitely the type of place that you could visit several times and still feel that you have not yet seen it all.Recommended for out of town guests, relatives, and children 5 and up. You can bring smaller kids but they won't really appreciate anything. It is sort of a bummer pushing a stroller around an art museum...so I'd wait on the little ones.Not sure of the current hours, I want to say it is seasonal and changes so double check their website before you plan to go.Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
50,Amazing place,"The museum itself is a jewel: very customer oriented.From the parking place to the museum, a tram takes you uphill within two minutes.The area is quite big and the view over LA is breathtaking.I spent half a day and I could have spent days exploring the gardens and the exhibitions.You only pay a parking fee of 15$ (10$ after 3pm), no entrance fee for the museum.A MUST SEE during your visit in LA, even if you are not into art. I promise, you'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemmo26
50,Splendid!,"The Getty Museum at the top of a hill. You can park for $15 and catch the tram up the hill from the parking garage. The museum is free. The architecture is white, bright and beautiful. They have gardens, outdoor sculpture, and many buildings of wonderful artwork. Don't miss the panorama views of the valley from the many balconies.The cafeteria had many choices of food, and it was good!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJTravelerNj
50,A pleasant and life affirming escape,"The Getty is a must-do in LA. Besides all the amazing art collections and rotating exhibits, the buildings and the grounds/gardens of the Getty are just beautiful and like art in and of themselves. You really feel like you have arrived in a cloud city above the bustle of LA. Especially since you take a tram up the hill to reach it! It's free, as is admission. You can pay to park on-site, or park elsewhere for free and shuttle-in, I think.I am a big fan of older art, decorative arts and old manuscripts and things like that, which the Getty has. Plus I've seen some great modern exhibits here like ""found photography"" or various photographers being featured. This museum is such a class-act all around!There is a great cafe with a lovely view, it's cafeteria style, last time I was there, at least. They have a little coffee/snack cart as well and events in the evening at times where they have live music! (Check schedule/website for details).Since, again, it's FREE, I have sometimes just taken the tram up the hill and hung out for the afternoon, just as you would at any cafe or open space. It's really that lovely.Wonderful gift shop, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726jamiel

We reached there around 12 hrs and parked our car in the parking lot.After that we went up by Elevator to Tram station, which has taken us to the top of mountain .It has taken about 5 minutes to reach at the top of the hill where Getty Centre is located.View of LA from the Tram was extremely beautiful.After reaching at Getty Centre, we went to the Cafeteria for lunch.It was very beautuful eating place with variety of dishes. Every body from my family had the dishes of their choice. After having coffee,we went inside the centre,where you are welcomed by presenting you a MAP of the area and if you like you can have an AUdio system with ear phones for listening to the description of various artefacts shown in the museum . It has many wings where collections from nearly every corner of the world are displayed. In one of the wing,history of Mr.Getty has also been described.After spending considerable time ,we started around 1600 hrs from there for way back.It was a memorable day for this visit. Its location, surroundings,view allround was very fascinating.

50,A fantastic museum and more.,"The Getty has been on my bucket list, and we chose to go on a rainy LA day. The grounds are so beautiful, and the architecture so interesting that my only regret is that we weren't able to enjoy more time outside. The alchemy exhibit was of particular interest, since that's not something I've seen before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noni2lily
50,"Amazing, great exhibits!!","We visited here in the afternoon, as most of the school children were leaving. The Getty Center is a must see if you like museums, fine art and architecture! I could easily have spent an entire day here, looking at all the paintings and exhibits. The temporary exhibit we saw - Art of Alchemy - was amazing, and went into detail of the purpose of alchemy. In the other exhibits, there were plenty of amazing artwork from Europe and America. The staff were also knowledgeable and able to assist with any queries we had.The Getty Center is set up on a hill, with a small shuttle that takes people from the car park to the top.The views of Los Angeles were amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielS202

50,Beautiful museum in a gorgeous setting,"Don't just go there for the art work, the architecture of the Getty Center is simply gorgeous. We spent time not only looking at art but soaking in the ambience of the center and walking around all the different viewpoints. And entrance is free! If you don't mind a little walk, try walking up to the Getty from the parking lot. When we went the queue for the tram was 25 mins, we walked up easily in 15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vattie
50,A Great American Art Collector,"Early America Art Building: The Getty has many charming and iconic American portraits by limners (a painter of portraits or miniatures). They were self taught artists who painted wealthy families in early America. Washington's portrait is here painted several times. Study these early American painters then walk to the European Painters building and see the lush, painterly portraits of the landed gentry in contrast.FYI Going to the Getty and not seeing Blue Boy or Pinky is like going to the Louvre and not seeing the Mona Lisa.There are interactive displays that help you learn more about the works.This is one of three major museums in LA area that introduce you to the great American collectors and their Collections: Getty, Norton Simon and Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarshaS74
50,Wow!!!,I was visiting with 10 other architects. We arranged for a private guided tour. What an amazing place. It was great to get a sense of the history while we experienced thie Meier masterpiece.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jedg86
50,Raindrops And Renaissance at The Getty In LA,"It’s only fair to evolve into your high-class, formal glove-wearing alter ego when you visit the Getty in LA. You must stand tall, read every placard, and nod thoughtfully as you walk with fingers intertwined behind your back. You must pretend like you know what you’re doing.That’s the mentality I had whilst walking across the meticulously crafted stepping stones on the Saturday before Andrew’s twenty-first birthday, passing women in tall black heels and men with suave fitted jackets. It was absolutely freezing outside (for California, anyways), and rain was starting to drizzle before we’d even entered our first exhibit.As I’m sure anyone can tell from reading our blog, Andrew isn’t an avid partier. He is the type of person, like myself, who finds comfort in the quiet places. His perfect day would probably involve being productive or learning something exciting. I mean really, what more could you expect from someone that throws back podcasts like cocktails from an open bar. Needless to say, I wasn't at all surprised when he declined the typical coming-of-age Vegas bender and chose to spend the evening eating bagels and jumping in puddles with me at an art museum. I think we’re a match made in heaven.I’d never been to the Getty, and Andrew had only been once back when he was a just a bean sprout, so this day trip was practically begging to be checked off our bucket list. We promptly packed our bags, slid on our figurative gloves, and headed out the door.One of the greatest things about the Getty is that it’s free! Set aside fifteen bucks for parking and you’re in. They make it free because they know they can reel you in with their eleven dollar soups! I highly recommend that you bring your own snacks, or at least pine from outside the cafe window then move on.But honestly, this museum should have an entrance fee because it is absolutely gorgeous, and full to the brim with mind-bending artwork. Once inside, you’ll find anything from modern photography to Rembrandts: from goofy metal statues to delicate renaissance sculptures. The entirety of the Getty was actually designed to be an art piece in itself, so walking in between it’s looming walls and under it’s abstract arches can be an awe-inspiring experience in itself. The Getty also features a lovely cactus garden, and an even larger garden that was sadly roped off due to the rain the day we visited.The rain was the cherry on top of our adventure that day. Andrew and I hadn’t planned for anything but sun, so our shoes were soaked and our bodies dripping. Thankfully the Getty left out a slew of complimentary umbrellas, but we didn’t figure that out until it was far too late. That wasn't the museums fault though; we stood up on the roof and appreciated the gloomy view, rain speckling our cheeks, knowing full well how icy we would get later on.Plus, the rain gave us an excuse to take our sweet time as we meandered through the exhibit halls. The History of Alchemy exhibit was temporarily visiting the Getty, so we were lucky enough to see ancient manuscripts, textbooks, and diaries all documenting the human mind and it’s desire to understand the world. The human condition is far more interesting to study than most would assume! We were also taken back in time by the sketch exhibit, only featuring first-drafts that will remain forever unfinished. We saw busts, bronze, and bellies galore while wandering through the many adjacent rooms full of irreplaceable masterpieces. One of my favorite pieces was Jean-Désiré Ringel D'Illzach’s giant bronze and copper vase, adorned with multiple intricately sculpted snails attempting to climb to the top. I was also very fond of Luisa Roldán’s Saint Ginés de la Jara, a life sized sculpture of a man draped in an incredibly intricate robe. His hands and feet were sculpted with meticulous detail, and his robe shimmered magnificently with gold embroidery. I couldn’t even begin to take in all the history, talent, and imagination stored in that mammoth building. You could spend years studying there and never scratch the surface.After walking in circles for hours Andrew and I decided it was time to head home. We managed one last soggy loop to appreciate the architecture, then finally hopped on a rickety tram down to our car. It gently bumbled down the hill as we laughed about whatever we always laugh about together. Everything, I guess.Visiting the Getty is truly an unforgettable experience. Whether you’re moved most by the unfathomably beautiful art, the architecture, the gallant people, the experience, or maybe even the pricey soup, this museum forces you to wonder and dream. Art is infamous for doing so. Though honestly, what stuck with me most was standing in the rain, looking over our city, and laughing with the only person that truly inspires me to dream. Happy birthday, Andrew.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBusyRats_com
50,My #1 spot in LA,"It's more than your usual Museum, you can literally spend the whole day there laying on the green area while enjoying the amazing view.

Paul Getty, a very complicated man, since the artifacts are mostly his.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PermanentNomad
50,Beautiful museum with fantastic views,"We got here a little later than we would've liked to, so we were not able to see the entire museum. But it's well laid out. They offer a phone for free with earphones you can use to learn more about certain pictures by typing in a code. I thoroughly enjoyed that part of the tour. But then you could go outside on balconies and see gorgeous views of the Pacific ocean and downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomboyangel

50,Inside okay; outside spectacular!,"Plan to spend most of your time in the gardens and patios of this marvelous building. The collections are not outstanding, though of course there are beautiful things to see. But the exterior landscape and hard scape designs are worth the trip. A garden and exterior design person's delight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldladyArizona
40,"Impressive, in many ways","The sheer scale of this property is remarkable. It makes many government-sponsored museums seem quaint. The spot alone is worth visiting. Plenty of views in about 320 degrees, provided the air in LA is not opaque, which can happen.Extremely well designed and organized. Parking is plentiful, and the tram up the hill from the parking area is comfortable and appreciated. Leaving all the unattractive infrastructure below and behind adds greatly to the aesthetics once you reach the ""Center.""You could easily spend all day here and not see everything, depending on how much time you take to study each of the exhibits, which all have quality pieces on display. To say the collection is eclectic would be a major understatement. There is something for nearly every taste.This is a beautiful place that is in a place (LA) that no doubt once was, but it is hard to describe it as that these days. At least the climate is good, and the traffic isn't as bad as Beijing. As they say, that's faint praise.Exploring all of this fantastic institution can be very tiring. If you are looking for something more manageable (half a day or less), try the Getty Villa, on the PCH north of Santa Monica. It has a very different feel, much more about being in a place where a very wealthy family lived. 2-3 hours there are enough, and if you are truly ambitious, your parking pass for either the Center of the Villa will get you parked at the other as well. If you decide to do both for lack of time (saving the second $15 parking fee isn't a great reason), plan a very full day and a relaxing evening. I'm an old fart, but I doubt many who are decades younger would be up for a disco (do they still use that word?) later in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbeharry
40,In and Outdoor Museum,"This is a great visit, especially for classes during the week. We went during the week and it was very crowded.

The cafe has a delicious cheese board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolAnn1949
40,Intriguing & Affordable Place!,"My friend and l were surprised to learn it was free to visit! They charged a nominal fee for parking but charged nothing for the actual visit. The short train ride up the hill was scenic & cool, but the views from the top were beautiful! The artwork was amazing and it was awesome to see so many original pieces. It was about 90° or so the day we visited so l was carrying a water bottle. Although it was empty, l was told l couldn't have it with me so l put it in my friend's backpack and that eliminated the issue. They have a great little bookstore, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimSIdaho

Also, the Getty Villa has an impressive collection of ancient pottery inside a recreated roman style home. Also a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X902NWpaulag

50,Amazing place to visit,"The Getty Centre, which holds many of the objects collected by J. Paul Getty in his lifetime, is an amazing museum to visit. Each time I have visited there has been several different exhibitions running simultaneously to interest and excite a diverse audience. The museum itself is free, accessed via a rail system from the bottom of the hill, with the only cost being parking. The spectacular views across Los Angeles just add to a really amazing visit. Exhibitions are also free and encompass ancient and modern works, as well as those borrowed from other institutions. Talks are regularly given on the collection and volunteers are everywhere to assist with any queries. I look forward to visiting the Getty Centre each time I am in Los Angeles, just to see what the latest exhibitions are!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MareeC164

Everything about this museum is very pleasing to the eyes and the soul. The landscaping, sculptures, artwork, architectural design and over all flow are all breathtaking.There are five separate buildings that sit high atop a hill on a hundred and ten acres of pristine property.

50,Beautiful symmetry,It was a bit rainy when we visited the Getty and so the garden was closed but I went on the garden tour anyways and it was worth it to hear about the way the landscape echoes the grid patterns of the architecture. Lots to look at in the galleries and the cafeteria is fantastic. Can't believe this place is free (with exception of parking). a great way to spend a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmykeats
50,Great,Awesome place to visit if you only went for the view. The art work is fantastic and rare. The 16th century furniture was awesome for a woodworker!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonlor20
20,Not For Everyone,"Maybe it was a mistake of mine to come here, but I did not realize what kind of museum I was getting into. I usually enjoy all different kinds of art museums when I get a chance as I have been to the Honolulu Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Orlando Museum of Art, and several others. The garden was very small, I set my expectations too high as I have been to a much larger garden in NYC. The outdoor sculpture museum was very limited as well. The other indoor exhibits were beautiful although my boyfriend and I felt uncomfortable. My boyfriend is Jamaican and I am a Pacific Islander/Asian. With that being said the security of the museum kept a good watch on us and it was very unsettling and hard to enjoy the art as they would follow us and made it obvious they were concerned about us. Mind you neither of us have been arrested before or stolen/damaged anything ever. Also, a lot of Mandarin/Cantonese speaking tourists made it harder on us to enjoy because about 5 or 6 times they would hold the door open for others, but when we tried to grab the door to hold for ourselves they made sure the door slammed on us. I got fed up and didn't even enjoy the museum for an hour and rushed out of there. Also, on the way out we walked towards the Uber exit and were asked TWICE where we were going... OBVIOUSLY to the area where we can get picked up by our Uber driver. First it was a volunteer who questioned us then it was a security guard. I will never return, mind you we do not have any tattoos or piercings or bizarre hairstyle or strange clothing to make us seem suspicious. That being said there was no reason for anyone to treat us this way. The museum itself was beautiful BUT it is hectic with tour groups and you can barely enjoy the art depending which room you decide to step in. Try to come early and during a time that is least busy if possible. I do not recommend for young adults, it's like a confined prison and you must watch your every move. In conclusion, we felt we were being profiled maybe that wasn't the case, but it sure felt like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vavoom808
50,Day at the Museum,"What a way to spend a day. From the moment you arrive and park your car, you enter a different ""zone"" - the zone of culture, beauty and history. There is plenty to see in the galleries but also outside, the architecture and location is breathtaking. The beautiful gardens and relaxing atmosphere makes you want to stay for a whole day. And why not?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
50,A pleasant place to disconnect from the hustle of daily life,"Budget a few hours to tour the galleries, the gardens and sit awhile studying the architecture. At the end, you'll feel calmer.Also; skip the tram ride up & down for a present, brisk walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelThwaite

Great for the whole family. An educational experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acttwo
50,The Getty Center,"If you are going to visit The Getty, plan on being there for several hours. The collections and the gardens are fantastic. As far as food or refreshments go, you are somewhat limited to the following: There is the Getty Restaurant for elegant, but somewhat expensive, dining (reservations recommended) or the Getty Café for casual, cafeteria-style food. There is also a Coffee Cart in the Plaza. Wear good shoes, there's a lot of walking required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873

50,"Beautiful location, building and fine art",We spent a day at the Getty centre and villa. It is located about an hours drive from Hollywood. The villa and main centre are 30 minutes apart by car. No shuttle operates between them. It was difficult to get a taxi for 5 people to the villa which was annoying.You need to book tickets for the villa on line before you go. However they are free as is entry to the Getty centre.The contents of the galleries were absolutely breath taking. Several famous pieces were in the gallery including Van Gogh's Lillies. Well worth the effort to go. The scenery was amazing and the restaurants offered excellent food. All in all a fantastic day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahp576
50,A must see if you're in SoCal!,"You'll need to spend all day here, just to get a glipse of a piece of this magnificient property! And, don't fret, if you don't have a full day, then just walk around, check out the views from the property, and eat at the upscale restaurant - it's a little pricey, but well worth it! The views are stunning, and service top notch!The artwork varies from building to building - so if you're interested in certain styles, you can get a brochure and just nail down the buildings you have time to enter.Handicap parking is the best! But, it doesn't matter where you park, because there's a free shuttle ride up the mountain side up to this once in a lifetime trip up a mountainside. Admission to the Getty is free - but it's best to call ahead for parking reservations, because during certain times of the year, it could be all booked up!Seriously, if you near this place, you've got to go up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conusha
50,A Must See Museum,"This museum is a must see! You park down below and ride a tram up to the museum. It's a gorgeous series of buildings. Can spend a whole day here. There's a formal restaurant, casual restaurant and snack bar. There's several exhibits so it's best to decide what you want to see (three exhibits is usually my limit) and go from there. There's also a lovely outdoor garden area to explore. Beautiful views of L.A. too. You are very high above the city so you get a bird's eye view from the ocean to downtown. Lovely. There's also a Getty Museum (Getty Villa) in Malibu that's worth seeing as well but you need to make reservations for that (it's small and parking is limited).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566KarenP

You feel like you're up in the sky, enjoying the peace and quiet while looking down on the chaos below. The architecture is stunning. Be sure to take the architectural tour as there are many fascinating stories behind the construction of this place. The place feels very clean, modern and - unlike most museums - very open to nature. It is not one big hall...there are various outdoor spaces, the focal point being the wonderful garden! This is just a fantastic retreat where you can leave the craziness of Los Angeles below, rest your eyes and soul, and even enjoy world-class art while you're at it! I must say thank you to all of those who have made this terrific museum available to all of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigPlanDan

40,Pictures Worth a Thousand Words,We went here to do a photo shoot. It was an awesome place. I had no idea there was so much to see. Definitely a must for artistic minds and visionaries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/146KS
50,Must see - but get there early,"We love art museums and there are not many in the US of this quality. My husband prefers pre-1800 and I like the impressionists. There wasn't a lot of impressionist but the rest was perfect for my husband. If you like modern art don't go here. Everything is well displayed. A lot of thought and expertise went into this museum. We got there when it opened and spent about 6 hours there. If you don't read everything like my husband you could go it in half the time. They have specialized tours, or self guided audio tours. There are beautiful gardens as well that overlook the LA area. It is easy to spend the entire day as they also have food.The only caution, you park below and walk up a steep hill or take a shuttle. When we got there, it was easy and fast. When we left the parking lot was full, there was a long wait for a shuttle, and it took awhile to exit. The museum is free but it is $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyR979
50,Do not miss this museum!,"The Getty Center was probably one of the most beautiful art museums I have ever visited. Situated up on a hill, the museum design makes perfect use of its location with the addition of many outside balconies and terraces. We happened to be there on a very clear day for the LA area and had 80 mile views. An unexpected sight were the deer grazing on the hillsides! The art collection is beautifully displayed and nicely organized into separate wings with a large central courtyard area. There is also a formal garden area, but we were unable to walk through that day since it had been closed because of the rain from a couple days before, I guess the walkways get muddy! The tram from the bottom parking lot is a fun ride, but we walked back down for the extra walk, it's not really that far, maybe a quarter mile. And this museum is free, so take the day to see it and have lunch in one of the cafes, it's well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dee490
40,A pleasant family outing,"This is a nice short trip from LA and serves as a weekend activity centre for families. The summer activities and exhibits lined up were quite a few and we could choose as per our preferences. The guided tour to see the van gogh paintings was worth spending time on. The restaurant is a pretty decent one with a good hill-top view. The lawns are quite nice to relax in, esp if there are playful and energetic kids in the group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smS4662GV
50,Spectacular setting,Outstanding impressionist art. The setting is spectacular. Entry free but $15 parking ($10 after 3pm),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slocal
50,Wonderful!,"My husband and I visited The Getty Museum today and it is wonderful! We took 2 tours, one on Renaissance Art & one on Impressionism. Both docents we're truly knowledgeable and friendly.The buildings are something to see and the campus is beautiful, the gardens were lovely even though we didn't have a warm & sunny day.There is no charge to attend the museum and parking is $15.Of course you could go back many times but we were glad to have the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EKZoo
20,"Except some education reasons, no good place to invest time to visit","I visited there early Fall in 2016 per #1 recommendation from Trip Advisor. For reasons/purpose of artistic education (e.g., for young family members) or art viewing, it is still a place worth to visit (despite not being #1 though). For recreation purpose to whom visiting LA from far away (MI for me), it is more like waste of time. There are much more places worth to visit within (e,g., benches and small cities like Santa Monica) and outside of LA (e.g., national parks and peripheral cities).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hogu2016

50,Did not disappoint my kids,"They loved the tram, great outdoors, staircases, funny art, souvenir shops! We purchased a small music box that plays fur Elise designed to have Van Gogh's irises. It is so beautiful and I think its dimensions are 2x2 inches only!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Epiczon
20,"""Disappointed""",Having read the reviews about this place found it to be a huge let down when we got there.We found this to be waste of half a day and there are lots of better places to see in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterfchch
50,Exceptional Museum in a beautiful location,"The Getty Museum sits atop a hill outside Los Angeles and is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. In fact there were several families on the grounds enjoying the sunny weather.The museum was established to hold the Getty collection of art collected for their home. Because of that, it seems to concentrate on pieces someone may have displayed in their home. Each of the buildings house different collections with themes or eras in mind.Access to the museum was easy off the freeway with parking at the bottom of the hill. The tram was out the day I was there, so the choice was to walk up the hill or wait for the shuttle. I waited. I was surprised how many people walked the hill. I walked back and enjoyed the view on the way.I was in town on a business trip and was glad to have stopped in to enjoy the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubba_in_ky
50,Phenomenal Museum!,"A very interesting and enlightening museum surrounded by beautifully landscaped, manicured grounds. If you visit LA and don't go to the Getty Center, you would really miss an experience that will remain with you for life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricka315
50,"""Great place to learn planets and amazing view""","I've been here once, but I love this place! You can see the view all over LA and you get to learn facts and see planets! The cool thing here is that they filmed Rebel Without A Cause in this location! There are always people that set up there telescopes outside of the observatory, they are great people to talk to if you want information about planets and stars! If you want to learn how the Observatory was created you can watch a free documentary narrated by Leonard Nimoy!! The bad thing is that if you want to watch a documentary about planets you have to pay, but overall this place is fun to go with the whole family! I recommend all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930isabellaz
30,"Beautiful space, excellent staff, but not fully handicap accessible","We loved the Getty's stunning collection, and the architecture is a masterwork in and of itself. Every staff member and volunteer was friendly and helpful, and all dining options and bathrooms were clean and spacious. However, taking my walker and wheelchair-using grandparents was a struggle; there are dozens of doors between the wings and apart from entrances into the buildings, none of these doors are handicap accessible--you must always have someone available to hold open a door. We were reliant upon the kindness of strangers all day, for which we were grateful, but how baffling that one of the top museums in the world would not make it a priority to accommodate elderly or disabled patrons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3365KCashleyg
50,Good food and fun dining,"Where else can you eat at a nice restaurant that is not too expensive surrounded by an amazing architecture and works of art- The Getty, of course!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Fascinating place,"Getty was, at one time, the richest man in the world. He put a lot of his money into art. He was a firm believer in the idea that art is to share. So the Getty Center came into being. Entry to the center is free (you only pay for the parking) so for a group of three friends this was a very inexpensive afternoon. The architecture is modern and interesting. The views are superb. And the art collection is world class. The day we visited the gardens were closed because of recent rain - but having seen them in the past I can recommend those too. I very much appreciate the fact that the Getty Center chooses to allow photography of almost all of its collection. That is truly sharing art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveAC1
50,As magnificent as ever...even on a rainy day.,"Visiting our daughter (who was at work most of each day) for 5 days before Christmas, allowed to catch up with locations we had not been to for over 8 years.What can I say about the Getty Center. It is magnificent and always worth going back to rain or shine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJL_2005
50,Gorgeous!,"Visiting the Getty Museum was one of the highlights of our Los Angeles trip. The stunning architecture and the brilliant design of the museum make it a visual delight. If you're lucky enough, like us, to catch your favorite artist's exhibition here then it's a double treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alynat2017
50,Great architecture and superb views,Visited this wonderful place in the last week of December 2016. It is one of the main attractions in Los Angeles located at a great height. There is no entry fee but one has to pay $15 for parking if going there by own car. One can go by bus also. Free guided tours are arranged for different parts of the Center. There is a beautiful garden. Enjoyed scenic views from this Center. One should not miss visiting this place when in Los Angeles..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshwaniC
50,One of the Most Beautiful Museum Complexes in the World,Such an impressive museum in an incredible location with unsurpassed views. Even more incredible is that other than the $15 for the parking (and tram up the mountain) and any food you choose to purchase the museum and the audio headsets were free. Views from either the restaurant or the cafe are fabulous. Do not miss the gardens. All of the collections are great. Love the impressionist gallery and the photography exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBHTravels
50,"An attraction of which we Angelenos are rightly proud. Stately architecture, gorgeous gardens, heart-stopping art.","I have visited the complex many times, but the last was for an exhibition of China's Cave Temples of Dunhuang. It was remarkable when you consider that they actually recreated 4 of the temples in a large hall. The detail was unbelievable. I have been to China twice but never to the area where these caves are located. What a great opportunity for people to see and admire Chinese culture.There is never a charge to visit the museum but one must pay for parking. This exhibit did have a charge, but it was well worth it.I have also been invited to private events and exhibitions at the Center. One would be very fortunate to have that experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oma664
50,Just stunning,"The location, architecture, gardens and artwork are all stunning. I really love this place and visit whenever I have a weekend in LA. Entry is free but parking costs $15. Well worth it. Restaurant is good value and excellent quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/944rp
50,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","I would rate this as one of the most enjoyable days spent at an art museum I have spent. Take the short Uber ride (why drive and complain about the parking queues and cost) to a wonderful location and brilliant architecture with superb gardens and views. Free!! Then enjoy the diverse and beautifully presented artworks. The (also free) auditory guide is fabulous. I especially enjoyed the kids comments on angels and demons. Wish I'd had more time to listen to more of the commentaries on individual works, including expert commentary from curators (sometimes with different point of view). I also took one (free) short tour with an enthusiastic guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KookaburraMike

50,Great visit,"A cousin of mine works there and gave us tour around.I had a great day the gardens there are absolutely breathtaking, and the art is amazing. The tram ride up is pretty cool too.And I'm just gonna say it it's far better than Disneyland.Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Levicorpyutani1
40,Go early to avoid parking traffic,"It is beautiful and huge museum. Although I am not a fan of art, I really enjoyed looking arts and scenery. I went there during my Christmas vacation and parking traffic lasted about an hour. There is a lot to enjoy but be there early in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Never2ver
50,Free Admission; Pay for Parking,"High atop Los Angeles, this center is relatively easy to get to by car if you can get through HWY 405 traffic. While admission is free, you'll have to pay for parking. Once you've parked, there's a nice free short tram ride up to the top where the center and gardens are. So beautiful and serene up here! On a clear day, you can see a good part of L.A. cityscape. Art displays are sparse by museum standards, but there may be special exhibitions throughout the year. Take your time strolling through the zen-like garden. This is not a place you'd want to speed through. Cafe and snacks available but pricey. Closed Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stepsinthesand
50,A Los Angeles Treasure,"J Paul Getty left Los Angeles two great treasures. The Getty Center and the Getty Villa.They have a huge endowment which allows them to do great restoration work for museums all over the world and add to their private collection. They have wonderful relations with other museums which allows them to mount very interesting changing special exhibits all year. Consult their website for current exhibitions. Every day there are tours and lectures to help you understand and enjoy the art. Also, beautiful gardens and views from the location high above Westwood. No charge except for $15 parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francophile1969

50,Find Your Art,"With easy parking, (as the only fee!) the convenience and modern approach to entry, personage allocation, and resource availability is unique and well worth it.

You and/or your group might very well spend all day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MG540
50,Nice art gallery,My husband and I visited here in June. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was free. The grounds are beautiful and they have great artwork and temporary exhibits!Pros1. This place is free of charge. Making it great for people traveling on a budget and still providing a great experience.2. There is a lot to see here all of it beautiful.3. This attraction is good for families and non families alike. There is something for everyone.Cons1. Not really a con but a lot of walking. There are a lot of outdoor things to see and it can get very hot.Not really able to say much bad about this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferkW5524LZ
50,Do Not Miss,"We were all pleasantly surprised by our visit. There was something for everyone- art, architecture, gardens, and amazing views. Their collection includes ""Irises"" by Van Gough.

50,"One of the best ""free"" things to do in Los Angeles","The Getty is truly amazing in that it is one of the few places in Los Angeles that is totally free apart from paying approx. $20 for parking unless you take the bus which has its upsides and downsides.Unlike a lot of the tourist destinations which are silly and bereft of any value, the Getty is well worth your time and effort to visit. There is so much to see that you would hard pressed to see everything they have to offer. Just love this place and the views of the city from the hilltop location are great.Wear sensible walking shoes. Additionally, since the concession stands are often crowded and pricey, I recommend bringing your own snacks and drinks - my late wife and I used to pack a nice picnic style lunch and sit outside of the museum and enjoy life and I would recommend you do too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2131POstevens
50,mesmerizing,"Get there early, before they open and the line to ride the tram isn't as long. Bring your money, because there are several gift shops and they are all Excellent. Great gift shopping for yourself and others! This last trip I spent time in the gardens before going to see the exhibits. Wonderful! Don't miss the tapestries! Incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewD801

50,Not to be missed!,"The Getty is an LA treasure and has something for everyone. The museum has multiple buildings, spacious plazas, and the modern architecture is a work of art. I It boasts fabulous 360 degree views of the city; has an excellent restaurant and cafe, and gardens that astound even when dormant. There are outstanding exhibitions of all types of art. And it's free! An Uber ride from an LAX hotel is less than $20. Worth a trip to LA just to vidit tge Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teacherpam88
40,"Amazing architecture and buildings, timeless art","This is a very highly rated attraction on TripAdvisor, so we felt compelled to visit. Parking is fairly easy, with a multi-story underground garage. You then take the tram up the mountain, viewing the majestic vistas all around the valley and city. J Paul Getty generously bequeathed a great deal of money to the arts, to build the complex, and maintain the complex since there is no admission fee. The architecture required to meet all of the terrain demands and city requirements is amazing. It is clear that no expense was spared when building the complex.One could spend hours on site viewing all of the paintings and other forms of art. While my wife and I appreciated the art, unfortunately our teenagers did not appreciate it as much so our visit was shorter than expected. You can get headsets and download an app to help facilitate the tour, but that likely would not have helped increase the attention of our kids. We completed the visit in about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonR823
50,Enjoyable museum and grounds,"We took our grandkids (ages 9,11, 14) to see the Getty since the older 2 have expressed an interest in art, but even the 9 year old had a great time exploring the beautiful gardens and walkways. The museum is free but there is a fee for parking. The tram ride from the parking lot up to the actual center is enjoyable but there was quite a long wait just to board. Very wheelchair accessible so I never felt like I was holding everyone back. Outdoor vendors were available for snacks but the café has excellent meals if you have time to sit and enjoy them. The views of LA from the Getty are amazing, especially if you happen to be there on a clear, smog free day. Lots to see and do but be sure to check timing on any special exhibits (we missed the one our son was interested in)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel27097265137
50,An American treasure not to be missed,Thank you J Paul Getty Foundation- I loved seeing all the amazing works of art and architecture- only wish I had more time. Your gift of FREE admission is appreciated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331betteb
50,Something for everyone,Wherever you are from and whatever your age there is something mind blowing at the Getty. To see at ground level the clerestory level stain glass windows from an English cathedral blew my mind. That was a previous visit. This time it was the small but superb collection of medieval book miniatures and in particular the artists used good leaf. Go for the guided tour because it makes the collections manageable by concentrating on just a dozen or do items. The docents are highly knowledgeable and each has their own favorites. There is food at different prices too uniformly excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmF8925TB
50,Beautiful,"This is a great attraction for families or travellers flying solo. The scenery is simply beautiful and makes for a very relaxing place to visit if you want to sight see while taking it easy.To get around, I allowed a few hours and did not regret it. The train/tram/monorail was a really fantastic and modern way to see LA from a different perspective away from all of the chaos.While I do love and appreciate art and sculpture myself, I do not necessarily think that you have to be artsy to enjoy this attraction. The architecture is really quite impressive, so 100% bring your camera along and get some photographs of the building, and the gardens with the LA view in the background - you really can't get a bad angle.The gift shop, café and the outdoor garden were some of the highlights for me. Quite tranquil actually.Can't wait to visit again on my next trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganl457
50,Amazing and Impressive,"Firstly, after parking our car, we took the tram up to the Center. The journey itself felt like an appetiser view scenes of beautiful houses.Once you reach the Getty Center, the views on top are beautiful. As a tourist, I'm impressed. There were locals around me and I can tell they were equally impressed.The exhibition halls were great. There are visiting exhibits so it is refreshing to those frequent visitors.The garden was simply beautiful. The views of the sea and the highway (not ugly) were great.I come from a tiny city which is also a financial capital in Asia. What impressed me is the greatness of American people who leave such legacies to share the best with all. USA is impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321yvettet
40,Worth a Visit,"Parking is available on site and then you take a monorail type of shuttle to the actual museum. There are multiple buildings holding different art exhibits. The garden area is very pretty and interesting. The museum and gardens can definitely get crowded as this is a popular tourist spot. I enjoyed the audio guide, which was very informative while you walked through the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kef1545
40,Beautiful design and views,"The setting , design , and views were outstanding.The artwork excellent but all ""old masters""Would have enjoyed seeing some contemporary art in such a contemporary building.Love all the natural light and open spaces.Very enjoyable visit but needed a lot more time than we had for the 5 pavilions .Watched the introduction video and was our only view of the gardens since it was raining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSU64
50,Step into both the past and the future,"The tram takes you up the mountain to a gorgeous postmodern building with marble floors, a futuristic courtyard, and excellent views of the city. Inside, however, you will enter a world of beautiful classical art and rooms right out of a 17th-century French place. Definitely won of the top things in LA to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longislander22
50,From Architecture to Artwork - This is the place to find it,Spend a relaxing day wandering around the outside of the beautifully designed building structures and meandering through the gardens and galleries.

50,Not to be missed!,"The Getty is filled with so much beauty that it is hard to know where to look first. From the moment you step in the tram, you have so many wonderful things to see. The scenery, the architecture... All lovely. And then the art! The fantastic collection filling many buildings. So much to see but so worth the time. We visited on a rather cool and rainy day as we had no choice with our schedule. Even with the gloomy weather we could see that the Getty is a special place. We hope to return on a nicer day when we can enjoy having lunch outside surrounded by the beauty of nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TO-ski-mom
40,Beautiful grounds,Depending on your tastes this museum will have something for pretty well everyone. The mass media exhibit we viewed was an eye opener as well as entertaining. The grounds were very well kept and spotlessly clean. You cannot complain when you entertain a family of five for only the price of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leep6802
50,"Breathtaking Views, Great Art, Attentive Staff","This museum is truly a gem for all to see. While the museum itself is free, you pay $15 to park, but it is well worth it considering that 5 of us toured the museum for that small price. You ride a tram from the parking garage up to the museum. That in itself is fun! The staff noticed that my husband had a knee walker. They rushed up to us and put us at the front of the tram line so he wouldn't have to stand a long time in the regular queue. The art is located in several buildings, all which have a particular emphasis. We were limited in time, so we had to pick and choose what we would see. We were not disappointed -- the impressionism art is fabulous. In addition, there is a beautiful common area complete with fountains and sunken pools where you can look out and see Los Angeles. My only negative is the fact that the food in their café is way overpriced. A must see for anyone visiting Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852kathyk

Its free to get in, but you only have to pay for parking which was $15.00 so I recommend carpooling. Part of the fun is the tram ride up to the Getty. You get a five minute ride to take in the scenery of Santa Monica overlooking the Valley. I have gone here in the summer to walk around the beautiful out door gardens, I have gone to check out specific art exhibits and I have gone here to lay in the grass and study with a friend while enjoying some snacks we brought from home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11rachaelg

50,A Highlight of Your Visit to Los Angeles,"Every time I'm in Los Angeles I make time for a visit to the Getty. The place is always packed, but once you take the tram to the top and look out over the Los Angeles skyline or the ocean you feel like you are the only person there! You don't even have to walk into the museum to understand you are in a truly magnificent place. Take a free tour of the grounds and you will learn how the location was selected and the building of the gift to Los Angeles!

50,Perfect LA escape (while still in the city),Great place to escape LA for the day. I highly recommend a relaxing walk and solo time on the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianmA7810DA
40,Amazing view,Was recommended this place by a friend and got impressed by the amazing LA view this place offers. Personally not an arts fan so can't comment too much on those artworks but I am sure they are fantastic for those who are into them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shengjiet2018
50,Beautiful place to spend at least half a day,"We came on a rainy day but still discovered wonderful views, of the surrounding area as well as of the gardens, landscaping, and architecture. With the exception of the most famous items in the collection (Rembrandt paintings, Impressionist paintings, I didn't find the exhibits themselves to be very compelling, and the temporary exhibits were inconsistently appealing. One of them (on media) seemed forced, although another on the process of drawing was fascinating. (Disclaimer: I'm not an art expert.) Information on Getty's life was useful but understandably limited in what could be said. We ate at the Cafe and were satisfied with the quality of the food there, which wasn't too expensive, either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267marilynt
50,Plan to spend the day,"The architecture, panoramic views and landscape design of the Getty Center are all breathtaking.. There is much to explore, so plan to spend most of the day visiting the numerous exhibitions and enjoying the outdoor spaces. We were accompanied by a 5 year old who was particularly thrilled by the cable car ride up the mountain to the main buildings (hiking up is also an option). Kids have plenty of space to release their energy outside between indoor gallery visits. Lunch was delicious, Guided tours and courtesy umbrellas were available. Admission was free and on site parking very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/468cynthiaf
50,"Architecture, Garden and Of Course Art and Artifacts in harmony","This is great place to visit for almost anyone. In fact I've done many times and each time I found new treasures.Architecture, garden and of course the Art and artifacts are some of the highlight that the museum offers.The free guided tours are very interesting if you don't know what to start. The volunteering are extremely helpful and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cn-in-sjc
50,Interesting place with amazing views,"This is a bit of everything - art collection (the impressionist collection is stunning - the rest not so much); architecture; views; gardens.All of the above makes it a well worth stop in the early part of a LA visit. Get a great view of the city, and get a sense of what it has to offer beyond the usual LA ""stuff"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGlobalGrownUp
50,Great art!,Fantastic art. Good is excellent in the cafe. They handed the holiday crowds well but I took half an hour to find a parking place. Go early in the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DadAndMom
50,Worth the wait,The views especially around sunset was amazing. The art collection and the grounds were beautiful and interesting to see. The lines getting there was long but worth the wait,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Problemchild2
40,Beautiful Building,The Getty Center is a beautiful building and shows off nice pieces of art. A nice view of the city is also included. I definitely recommend visiting the Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomt71
50,What only wealth can do,"The Getty is a futuristic dream on a mountaintop; a bit like walking into a background painting for an episode of the original Star Trek. Travertine limestone/marble retaining walls, plazas, buildings shine brilliantly in the sun... and kids can have fund spotting fossils embedded in the walls. Staircases offer spectacular views of the area and the distant city. Lush gardens and fountains reward the senses with something wonderful everywhere you look.The real treasure is in the collection of art and antiquities, in plaza and galleries. Sumptuous Baroque or stunnning Medieval, ancient Roman or challenging modern -- you will find something of everything here, beautifully presented.Be prepared for walking and climbing, though elevators are available it is a pity to spend any time in a box when you can get such views outdoors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/br_tobias
40,Great but hard to get to.,"We loved the architecture and size of this amazing art center. However, we went on a rainy Saturday and the crowds were overwhelming and detracted from the experience. Also, we were NOT prepared to wait for 45 minutes in the rain for the tram to take us up the mountain to the center....so we walked up. We spent about an hour looking at art amongst the crowds. We did not want to wait 45 minutes to take the tram down the mountain, so again, we walked. I spent plenty of time before visiting on the website, even viewing the video and do not recall anywhere reading that we should plan to add approximately 90 minutes to our visit just to get to the center and back. Even without walking up and back, you would be standing on your feet waiting all that time. I would go back on a weekday and try to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK1704
50,World Class Museum,We were fortunate to have a friend who is a docent there. She made sure that we saw the highlights of both the art and grounds. It is impossible to take in the whole experience in one visit. The place is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelsonB57
40,Wish I had planned more time....,"Visited the Getty Center with my wife who likes art. We arrived around 3:30 (thus, only having two hours) and discovered there wasn't enough time. Certainly a wonderful collection. My foreign wife kept repeating, ""How can all of this be offered for free?"" Due to rain the garden was closed, which was a bit of a bummer. The staff was wonderful-received a print out on how to get back to our hotel using the bus/subway system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButaTokyo
50,Don't miss this masterpiece of architecture and art,I have heard about the Getty Center for many years but this was my first visit and it did not disappoint. We had a great tour guide named Phil who gave us the architecture tour of the Getty and that was really interesting to learn about the time money energy and planning that went into this extraordinary sprawling and beautifully situated gift to the city of Los Angeles.From the paintings and sculptures to the gardens and the physical plant itself I would give this 10 out of 10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bookpublisher
50,Beautiful architecture and views,Not a museum buff at all but just loved the views and setting on a bluff. Fact that it's free helps too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wellesley88
50,Wonderful collection,I came there with my family and I was amazed by all the paintings and sculptures there was. It is an classic collection and the location is wonderful. I would recommend you coming in the morning. Tu go there taking a tram to the center. The restaurant is recommended but on Sunday it is a brunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ulysseh2015
50,Fun and entertaining,"Lots to see so plan to spend at least half a day here. You can spend much more, easily, but spending less would be difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702dougt
50,My visit to the Getty Center,The Getty Center was a well worth the trip. The museum had a vast collection of artwork from the Renaissance era. That was also a special exhibit on alchemy and colors. You can either choose to walk 20 minutes or ride the commuter train to the center. The walk is uphill going towards the center. We chose to take the train because it was raining. Parking is $15 a day but admission is free. Make sure you pay for parking before exiting at one of the machines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mithran1
50,Must see! plan for a full day,"The reasons I tell this a must see are:• Contains original paintings and sculptures by famous painters and artists.• Very open concept architectural building design above hill top• The central garden itself is a nice outdoor place to visit• Stunning sunset view• Last but not the least, no entry fee, only parking feePlease plan a full day visit. Toddlers might not enjoy inside but they would love the outside garden and water features.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdmushfiqula
50,Great experience,We went as part of a tour package so had a ride to the Getty Center! Glad we were not doing the driving as the weather was wet & traffic was busy. Excellent service into museum. Loved the art in the museum. Displays were easy to get around. Didn't do gardens as it was too wet. Ate in cafe. Great variety of food. Excellent food If in LA Getty Center is a must!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/495marshak
50,Mind blowing!,The setting of this Centre has to be experienced in person as description will just not do it justice. The art collection is stunning as is its setting. You can easily spend a couple of days here. Plenty of information is available to explain what you are looking at in terms of interpretation and guided tours. Spotlessly clean .... Magnificent and must not be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sue1904
40,Very good museum with good architecture and great view!,"It is usually closed on Monday but was open on the Monday right after Christmas.A very good art museum with a well rounded collections covering different time period and artistic styles. They have some very good paintings from the impressionist era, which is my favorite type.Beautiful garden and architecture. And it offers gorgeous views of the entire LA from Bel Air to Santa Monica Beach. I would come here just for the views.The museum was slightly confusing to navigate due to its intricate architecture.There is also a very good restaurant in the museum. And several Cafes that offer comfortable outdoor seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickyt373
50,Great museum !,Very well organized. The parking is $15 and then all is frer. You take a trolley to go the museum. Fantastic views of the city. Beautiful architecture. Fantastic european paintings and collections! A must see. Thank you Mr Getty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T8875XUpierrea
40,Something for everyone,"We were there for about 5 hours and enjoyed seeing many of the exhibits and gardens. Many buildings (some difficult to find our way in or out) but basically well organized. The gardens and water feature and lovely. Views of the city and ocean are amazing. I was a bit disappointed with Van Gogh's Irises. There is glass over the painting, and it was difficult to see because of glare (I guess that's why the glass is there) and many people were trying to see it at the same time. We ate lunch outside from the food truck because other locations had long lines. Food was pricey, mediocre quality (tiny pieces of sliced turkey with razor-thin slice of cheese). Parking was easy. There is a tram, but we walked up to the museum and back down. For anyone in reasonable shape, this would not be a difficult walk, but it is either all uphill or all downhill. The gift shop has many nice items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAwalkers
50,What an amazing surprise. A must see.,"If you are anywhere near LA you have to check out this multi-billion dollar architectural masterpiece. The building designs are out of this world as are the formal gardens. We were there as it hosted masterpiece artworks and I am hard pressed to say which I enjoyed more, ""The Irises"" by Van Gogh or the amazing building design and construction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nthnlites
40,Legacy of Paul Getty,"We visited both Getty Center and Getty Villa and left with a similar impression.They won't be our first choices in visiting LA, but great places to take in Paul Getty's legacy and passion in the context of what you'll see of the property, the architecture, and collections.It is better to allocate half-day for the visit to avoid the frustration of queueing for parking and get your bags checked.The views and surrounding are spectacular yet relaxing, and the collections are outstanding considering those are privately owned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88dots
40,Amazinf,"I was with a tour group so I was unable to spend more than roughy three hours there. We started with eating at the Café, which was expensive, but very good. We visited the Van Gogh piece, which was amazing to see in person. We also took time to lay on the lawn and enjoy the outside sculptures. The views were amazing, and it wasn't very crowded. I would go back again to spend more time looking at the pieces, and I recommended giving yourself a lot of time to enjoy it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddy9801
50,Very good museum,A really special museum with a wide range of art. I loved viewing the Monet paintings as well as the Van Gogh and Rembrandt pieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
50,Wow,"Even if you have absolutely no interest in art, go see this unique complex. It's free! The parking ($15) is well organized in a huge garage, and the tram up to the campus was a nice surprise. The architecture, gardens, fountains, and views of the city are spectacular. We took the one-hour overview tour with a docent--very well run. The guide was knowledgeable and personable, and she enhanced our understanding of the art. We had lunch in the clean, spacious cafeteria. Our salads were fresh and reasonably priced. We spent the majority of our time, however, outside. Such a lovely afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LettieS466
20,This is not the best place to visit in LA,"Nice place, regular museum, awful organization, catastrophic parking lot, worst service in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CesarG73
50,A Garden of Delight,"A lovely Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection, as well as some early Northern European masterpieces were among my favorites, but I especially enjoyed the 2-hour tour of the gardens led by a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide who pointed out the numerous ways the modern architecture and planting design complement each other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrisrosie
50,Getty,I was a little hesitant to go but it was an excellent exhibit for all ages. You can spend a few hours here so be prepared if you have kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elij51189
50,Almost overwhelming,"Thank you Mr. Getty for the European Art Collection! Free admission, $15 to park. Parking is in a garage at the bottom of the hill. You take a Tram ride to the Getty Center at the top of the hill. The building architecture is enthralling, the views of the surrounding area (and of course, good old Highway 405) are stupendous. The restaurants have higher quality food (for a museum). I haven't even mentioned the art yet! 5 buildings, 3 levels each full of European art. Free well informed docent tours twice an hour. Plenty of light in the common walkways too minimize Museum fatigue. So much to see, I loved my visit and it is a place I will return to, to see more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetmreynolds
50,Angel's Landing,"To start, a great ride up on the ferry train, then a majestic architecture on top of the hill with a contemporary white blinding stones that makes you feel somewhere between Ancient Greece and space, and finally great art with a finely curated mix programming of medieval art and crafts making, contemporary photography, Antique artifacts or modern art. Diverse, upscale and transcendental. Angel's landing, plan a half day at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/902emmanuellel
40,Nice Place to Visit while in LA,"The line for parking moved quickly. The line for the tram was long. I opted to walk, although they did have a shuttle. The Center was crowded but I was able to see everything. The cafe was easy to navigate with no lines. All in all a very good visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg1502
40,Amazing architecture a gorgeous view,"We went to Getty Center more for the view of L.A. than anything else. We were very surprised by the astonishing architecture of the place, the diversity and variety of art on display and the walk to reach the actual exhibition centre. Corteous staff and parking facility at the bottom of the hill. For lazy people (or those who cannot walk) there is a shuttle train that goes back and froth from the top of the hill. It is lovely on a sunny day, the view is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravellingGabo
50,A must see museum while in the L.A. area!,"Great museum, with classics and modern pieces galore. The architecture is an art piece its self, and the gardens are impressive as well. With ample parking and a shuttle system, it was easy to get to, spend some quality time, and leave at your own pace.We were there on a weekend and the crowds were not an issue at all. Allow a few hours to get a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2113QEjanew
30,Not worth the queue,"Good points:- amazing view of the city,- interesting architecture.- nice gardens.Bad points:- crazy queue to drive in and out. Seriously, this place could do with some serious remodelling of car and people flows in and out.- interesting expos, but average collection. Van Gogh's Irises are fantastic.I would not waste half a day to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnerBalanceMassage
50,"Simply superb, best modern art museum in LA !","From the moment you arrive, the architecture by Richard Meier lifts you up for the art experience to follow ..... the sculptures at the reception tram area are just fab including the Henry Moore ..... and then arrival at the main ticketing area immerses you into the huge selection of art in the various buildings.A huge treat for all art lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrgaryw
50,Fabulous!,"Our family had a great time at this beautiful complex. The buildings and landscape itself is art, not to mention the arts inside the pavilions. The facilities are clean and accessible. If you enjoy art & architecture, there are many things to do while at the Getty. The guided tours were great to help you learn more about the architects and artists who contributed to the design of the Getty. This is a great place to spend a day. Parking is $15 at bottom of hill, then free tram to the complex or 15mins uphill walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Makarios
30,An LA Icon That's Probably Worth It,"We live in LA and had a fun day visiting. It's a beautiful property and there were a couple of nice lavish interior things going on. The views are cool and it's kind of something you have to do. The Getty Center doesn't tug on any heartstrings or bring up any emotion to me, I can't imagine recommending it or needing to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyr164
30,"Beautiful view, but terrible art","The architecture and the view from the Getty is amazing (on a clear day). You can see everything (downtown LA) to the beach after a rainy day (yes it rained in Dec. of 2016). However, their art collection needs some upgrading. Mostly portraits, which I'm not the most fond of. Anyways, always nice getting some fresh air at the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahndoo
50,Wow what a museum,What a beautiful museum. Park is interesting - but you take a cable car to the museum - which is gorgeous - so much to see. The views are amazing! The museum was packed - but it can handle the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmom2238
50,The building makes you forget there is art inside,"After an easy park downhill we took the tram uphill and since then we were so impressed by the building. J. Paul Getty, who earned his money in oil, created this astonishing architectural masterpiece to return something to the community. Every corner of the mostly white building is a new wow experience. The collection is too big to visit in one day, so we focussed on the European master paintings. When you are in to Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Monet you will find nice pieces of art. Dutch painter Rembrandt is the only painter who has his own room. Do not forget to visit the garden and enjoy the beautiful view of Los Angeles. Entry is free and absolute must visit of your LA visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972
40,Art from History to Present,"This place has a tram that takes you to the bldg. There is a cafeteria to eat at, with plenty of seating. There are several areas to find great photo opps. The balconies have views of the ocean and downtown. The views are spectacular. The whole area is wheel chair friendly. There are self guided tours, and guided tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916elled

50,A Feast for the Eyes!,"Located high on a hill overlooking the city of Los Angeles, the Getty Center (which itself is a wonderful example of attractive modern architecture) offers visitors not only some fine examples of art of all kinds (painting, sculpture, drawings, etc.), from all different periods of history, but also some spectacular views of the entire city of Los Angeles and its suburbs, as far south as Rancho Palos Verdes and Long Beach, as well as Santa Monica Bay, and the edge of the Santa Monica Mountains. And except for a $15 parking garage fee ($10 if you arrive after 3 p.m.), which includes a tram ride to the top of the hill, the Getty Center is free! Conveniently located right off the 405 Freeway, this is one L.A. sight you won't want to miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRANDDADGREENGO
50,Best museum I have visted,I am always impressed by the beautiful architecture and gardens as well the art collection here. Have recently visited the Metropolitan and Guggenheim in New York the Getty is the most pleasant museum to vist by far. It is so easy compared to the Met and Guggenheim. It is spacious light and has beautiful views in aĺl directions. The access is easy and rest room facilities are great. This is what a modern museum should be like and why the museums in New York can't compare because of their older buildings. A museum should be beautiful but also functional and thats what Geddes is. Did I mention that it has free admission? But parking is $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnfromwollongong
50,Must see,"Extroadinary art on display and to think this is privately owned, a legacy of J. Paul Getty the oil billionaire. Great selection of Renaissance Art and the old masters plus ancient artefacts and sculptures. Be sure to take a stroll in the beautifully designed gardens. We took the tram up and walked back down to the car park to take in the great views. They also have a great restaurant on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TopcatChris
40,Make sure to join the guided tour,"If you are an art lover, you will love this place. Lots of collections to see from the Getty Trust's Foundation. Make sure to join the architecture guided tour. It's free and tells you a bit about the come about of this museum. The Central Garden is really beautifully laid out. Unfortunately it was closed when we visited. However, we could still look over it from the outside as well as a good panoramic view of LA on a clear day.Tips about parking: if you also visit Getty Villa, make sure you keep your parking receipt and get it validated when you park at the other Getty attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoff451
50,Must See,"For all of you who love art and architecture, this is the place to go to in L.A. The center is situated at the top of the Hills between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. Richard Meier, the architect of this campus did an amazing design integrating buildings and open spaces. He also brought access to most of the spaces within each museum exhibit to the outdoors via terraces and balconies overlooking most of L.A. And Santa Monica. The art collection is vast and covers most of the renaissance to the early industrial ages. Definitely a highly recommended visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricog857
50,A Fun Day Out,"The Getty Center is a must visit attraction for all visitors and residents of Los Angeles. This massive place is an amazing museum filled with historical art paintings, sculptures and special pieces. Taking the tram up from the entrance is a nice five-minute ride where you get to see the surroundings from above.With panoramic views of Los Angeles, this is a great day out, and best of all it's free(If you're driving, it's a flat rate of $15). The outdoor area is huge and the garden is a spectacular setting. My family and I spent around five hours there, and ate at The Restaurant located at the entrance.Usually at tourist attractions the Gift Shops are comprised of rubbish, however the one at the centre had some nice quality products. We bought soaps, chocolate and a calendar. There is limited service at the Getty, however there is free WiFi and you don't even have to provide an email address!I would strongly suggest spending the day there, as this place would appeal to people who enjoy learning about history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessStephanie01
40,A great family visit including kids too,"We had a great family trip for a 1/2 day visit (3 to 4 hours). A short trip is good for kids of all ages to get exposure to great art, gardens, architecture and beautiful views. (Young kids will like the tram ride too from the parking lot up to the museum). There's cafes and restaurants available too to buy food and drinks. We attending multiple guided tours too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestCoastFamiles
50,A Wonderful Day at The Getty,Loved the visit to the Getty Museum and it's beautiful layout of the architecture which holds the enormous amount of art. Each building holds a different venue or period of artwork which was really helpful for what you really wanted to see. Overall the art there was amazing. I definitely would go back. There is so much to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynone
50,One of a must visit in LA,"Great place to visit. Though it is raining, we enjoy visit both indoor and outdoor. Umbrellas are provided. Staffs are very nice and friendly. No admission fee and parking fee is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prattanasandy
50,Wonderful Four Hours,"As the capstone of our LA visit, we made an excursion to the Getty. For LA it was an unusual weather day (rainy, chilly and windy), but the sky was dramatic, making views if the Pacific and the hills quite dramatic. We spent the first two hours going through the special exhibit on Alchemy: super interesting and often beautiful. Then we went to the Cafe for lunch, followed by another two hours or so wandering through the permanent exhibits (hundreds of paintings from the Middle Ages through the 1700-1800's). I especially enjoyed the Rembrandt and Rubens. Everything in the museum, including the taped commentary, is free (except for parking, which can run you $20 for the day). The staff are friendly (one guard had mastered the trick of sleeping while on his feet). There are multiple galleries separated around a large plaza. One hint: try to end your stay at least 15 minutes before closing time. Everyone has to get from the museum to the parking via a free tram that shuttles up and down the hill. It only has three cars with limited capacity, so if you wait until the crowd assembles at closing, you might need to stand in line for 30 minutes or more just to get back to your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaseaton
50,A must-see attraction in Southern California,"In an area that can be expensive, the Getty is a cheap attraction that offers a world-class experience. It is highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FMan81
50,"Great collections, free admission","The Getty Museum has a great collection of art works, sometimes with museum collection exchanges, whcih allows you to see collections from other museums. The guided tours vary in quality, depending on the guides. Free admission, but you gotta pay $15 for parking, and it's a 5-10 min tam ride up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvanL
50,Great place to visit,"We joined the tour of the collection essentials. I'm not massively into art, but found the tour to be very informative and interesting. We also walked around the exhibit 'The Art of Alchemy' and the gardens. There is a free tram that takes you up to the museum from the car park area and both the tour and entry to the museum are free. Great views of LA on a clear day. Highly recommended. We just made a mistake in going to the wrong side of the car park to be picked up by Uber, learn from our mistake and check the signage!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussietravelgirls
50,Fabulous place to visit,"Gorgeous place with magnificent art, gardens, sculptures. The best part is it's all free (except for $15 parking). Cafeteria was great too. Altogether a wonderful way to spend a full morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryo943
50,Amazing art!,"I visited the Getty with my cousins and even spending several hours, we saw only a fraction of the exhibits. There was so much to see and all of it was interesting and informative. I will definitely return in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xena2542
50,Museum with a scenic view.,One of the must do when visiting Los Angeles. The art exhibit is very impressive and the gardens and views are the same. I always enjoy my visit when I go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OneLifetime
50,Wow - what a place,"The architecture of this place really impressed me, from the little monorail up from the car park to the immediate vistas you get over LA there are spectacular views everywhere you turn. Like many galleries like this there is so much to see you can't do it in one visit so see whats on and choose your favourites. Although we are from the UK, we chose to see a show called London Calling which was outstanding, we even ordered a show banner which are offered after the exhibition finishes, we had an email about this 4 months later to say the show had finished and would we still ike the banner - great service. Took many photos of the crisp architecture against the brilliant blue skies and the textures within the buildings come alive in the sunshine - amazing, loved this place. Only negative was the food choices, we traipsed around each of the cafe/restaurants only to find they had all just closed and our only choice was one of the 'street' carts within the grounds which was fine but would have preferred more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingMonk
50,Great museum,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around the numerous galleries. Tons to see. We took a cab, which was about $40, so I'm not sure how much parking was. The only cost was the headphones to listen to the exhibits, but it was worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMM-batraxos
50,"Second visit, worth coming back","This place is just beautiful.Even if you don't appreciate art or museums, it is a great place to eat, view the city (you can see all the way to the ocean) and the gardens.I totally recommend Getty if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaCOliveira
50,An amazing place to spend a day!,"From the moment you exit the parking facility you are exposed to an awesome display of art. From the architecture to the sculpture garden to the outstanding landscaping no detail has been spared. And this is before you even view the exhibits! Additionally, the on-site restaurant is outstanding. What an amazing gift has been given to us all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532JacquelineG
40,Interesting Visit,"The Getty Center is certainly unique. It has a very nice garden and quite an extensive art exhibit. The building architecture is of modern, clean and functional design.There is a tram that takes you up to the center. Getting to the foot of the center is about 30 minutes by car. Uber rates are about $20 (one way) from LA city (TCL threater).There is a very decent cafe and a restaurant at the center. We only tried the cafe - prices were reasonable and there is quite a wide selection of food available.Apart from the cafe food and transport (plus parking if you drive), there is no entrance fee to the exhibits.A pretty good way to spend a relaxing afternoon with the family and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnSG911
50,Beautiful Museum,"We had some time late afternoon so decided to go to the museum two different days. We were able to view the art late in the day which was perfect as there weren't many people and we could get close to the pictures and enjoy the detail. Also got to see the beautiful sunset. What a view! The next day we spent outside in the gardens as there were many people inside. Lots of kids field trips. The parking is $10 after 3:00 and $15 otherwise. The gardens are lovely, even this time of year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allie19
40,Dont miss the Getty! Fascinating exhibits. Great views. Good food.,Getty has continuing and changing exhibits that dont fail to fascinate. Most recent visit was to exhibit based on their continuing archaeological research into the Silk Road Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billa651
50,Great place to visit,"I had heard about this place from friends and it was better than I expected, a mixture of interesting things to see and great views - my highlight Paintings and Running Man",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsV7116SV
50,Getty Greatness,"We could have spent another day exploring the grounds and museum on this fantastic property. I highly recommend starting with the free, ""architecture tour,"" which helped us understand the scope and artistic planning of this Los Angeles wonder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BraGenie
40,Lovely surroundings and some great art works,"I was very glad to visit the Getty, as I am quite interested in Renaissance art. The collection is excellent, but works are limited in number. I would advise potential visitors to carefully look over the website to see if the sort of art works they are interested in can be found in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1685YOelizabethb
50,Awesome views everywhere,"It is fantastic. Every where is so well designed. Wellthought off. Great place to spend a day for whole family. Great art piece, sculptures, furnitures etc. Eye openers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starystarynite
50,A must do,"You should definitely visit the Getty center. Situated on a hill, you are to park in the parking lot, where the first hour is free and then you pay 15$ for the day. I believe that an hour is not enough. Then, you should wait for the tram to get you up the Getty center. The entrance is free and if you have enough time at your disposal to spare, you could also follow programmed tours. Th establishment itself is vast and you should organize your visit in order not to get lost. Apart from the exhibitions, you have to visit the gardens, which are amazing. Try to discover the hidden ""G"" and ""C"" in the gardens representing Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilGrec0
50,"It was five years ago but the place is awesome, unforgettable","This place is extraordinary, will go back on my way home in this trip.

Quite a lesson in good taste, elegance and excellent architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Euggen
50,Interesting!,We enjoyed our trip to the Getty Museum while staying at the Hotel Angeleno! Took the shuttle to and from which made it convenient! This museum is huge and so much to see! We really enjoyed the gardens and artifacts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YancyFamily
50,A Gem,"Absolutely loved this place. Eye catching architecture and gardens. We did the 11am highlights tour (each tour is different depending on the guide) which was worthwhile. I could have easily done another tour but my teens wanted to explore the gardens.This place really is a little gem, not overwhelming like the Met in NYC. Made it a great experience.We arrived at 10am so no problems with parking, but you could see thecar park filling up fast. Train trip up the hill was a novelty and great view of the freeway (I still cannot get over the 5 lanes) so had to take photos.Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Eating areas in 3 different price ranges but we did not stop to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrabO4037VK
50,Gorgeous at Sunset!,"I highly recommend visiting The Getty Center, as it is a free and wonderful attraction! Getting there about and hour or before sunset is well worth it. This way you can see the beautiful skyline with the daylight and as the sun sets. The only think you'll have to pay for is parking, anywhere between $10 to $15 (I believe) based on your length of stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLSoulliere
50,WHHHAAAT a Building,"If you are from Europe and or been to many museum their. you may find the art not that interesting. But the building and the view is wonderful, food bit expensive but can't complain entrance is free.Drawing room is a great place to spend time if you like that, i like it because they use real art that you can walk up to. Thanks to the People that work their really friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonoJ
50,Museum and Gardens and Views!,"You cannot go wrong visiting this attraction!! It has beautiful grounds with water features and amazing views. The exhibits are a nice mix of mediums and are not too large so you don't get bored or burned out. There really is something for everyone. The staff are very friendly and will talk to you and give you a little bit of extra information about the exhibits. You can also get audio/earphone tours if you desire. I went in December and it was somewhat off-season, so parking and travel were a non-issue. However, I could see making sure to plan your attendance at this property appropriately for traffic and parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherhZ6474VL
50,Breathtaking gorgeous!,"The gardens, the exhibits, the trip up there and the whole experience was great! The museum is beautiful! And I recommend anyone visiting LA to make time to go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissinha_canada

50,First time in LA,The museum was a great experience. It reminded me of the D.C. Museums because they have different buildings all with unique exhibits. Their dining area is wonderful as well with a great variety of cuisines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnienick
50,More than just a Museum,"Not only does it have incredible art and exhibits, but the architecture is unique and beautiful, the gardens and waterfalls are awesome, and the view of the Pacific Ocean and city on a clear day is spectacular. Also, riding the monorail up to the top is pretty fun too! If you're in LA, definitely go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaLosAngeles
50,Free (except for parking) exceptional museum experience,"Ride up to the top of the mountain overlooking the city of LA and the 405 freeway on a free tram. If you take public transportation or Uber, there is no entry fee. The $15 parking is for all day and per car-a bargain! The museum has world class art in a setting that allows you to look over the entire city and to the ocean. You can picnic on the grounds with your own food or get food at a cafeteria or upscale restaurant or coffee carts. There is an outstanding children's program with a space created for them that entertained my grandchildren for over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooklyngirl43
50,Excellent Art Museum,"I felt like going to the Getty in the lush hills of Los Angeles was like an escape or retreat from the crassness of the city. I enjoyed how large and spacious the galleries are. I loved just sitting and meditating in the garden. The gift store was well stocked with art history and contemporary art books, calendars and other art items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Infodiva415
50,November Saturday visit,"Arrived around 11. Parking was so easy, tram was no problem. No cost except for parking. Center exhibits were beautiful as were the grounds. No crowds and it's free. No rush environment. Can picnic outside and relax. There were many students working on projects which was neat to see. Highly recommend a visit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMB224
50,A gorgeous day-retreat on a hill,"I love going to the Getty for a quick reset of my energy. It's like a visit to another country where everything beautiful and satisfying is available to me in one place: art, architecture, garden, good food, book store. On a warm day, it's great to wander in the garden or take a quick lunch outdoors in between visits to the always inspiring galleries. This is a place that's good to schedule a whole day for, to allow yourself to enjoy it thoroughly. If you're into photography, there are endless things to photograph because the space is just so wonderfully-designed to interact with light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyfulsteps
50,Amazing view! Gardens! AND Art!,"What's not to love? First, parking is easy. You drive in and pay $15. Then you get to take a cool monorail train up the mountain. Its like a ride at the amusement park. When you get there, the gardens are so beautiful and peaceful, you can spend an hour just doing that. The patio itself, once you get to the main building, is also gorgeous and you can enjoy a great cup of coffee, food and snacks just feeling above it all while still in LA. Go inside, and there are beautiful galleries with so much open space to just BE with the art. There is every type of art from photography to Medieval Illuminations. Dutch masters and French Impressionism. There is an amazing David Hockney display where he uses an iPad to produce landscapes. Its not stuffy at all, and when you get to the South end of each gallery, you can access a balcony that looks over the whole city and the ocean. Try going at Sunset! The gift store is also amazing. I could spend an hour in there. I love the Getty Villa, too, but if you have to choose only one while in LA, I would chose the Center. It's also better for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddlerMom2013
50,Incredible art museum,This place is huge. Great views of the city. A tram runs every five minutes up the hill to the facility. Very large and immaculate garden. World-class art collection. And it is all free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254lewisk

50,More than just for culture-vultures!,"Nestled in the Sepulveda Pass, this is more than just an art museum - although it's pretty good at that too! Enjoy the lovely garden, amazing views to downtown Los Angeles and the Ocean, and a great vibe, in addition to the Monets, Van Goghs, and Titans. If you're peckish, there's a lovely cafeteria, a pricey-but-first-class restaurant, and a coffee/snack cart in the patio. And - like all museums - there's a KILLER gift shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilasU6995RS
50,Great day for families,"The Getty and its sister museum the Getty Villa are both great for all ages. There's a kids activity center and the gardens and grassy area can keep kids occupied for hours with a picnic lunch and exploring. Plus, the train from the parking lot to the museum even feels like an adventure for littles.It's free to enter, with a hefty $12-$15 parking fee (it goes up very year). Still an inexpensive outing for a car full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLWD13
50,A gem,"From the lawns and gardens, to the outdoor sculptures, the architecture and the indoor exhibits, this is a place of beauty and tranquillity. It is peaceful and amazing.The tram/cablecar(?) ride up the hill to the museum was smooth and efficient, with magnificent views.Inside- old masters, new masters, photos, manuscripts, sculptures. Just beautiful, amazing, wonderful.We were fortunate to attend on a day when a drawing class was being held, which we attended (it was great), and like the admission fee, this was also both free and priceless.We were probably there for about 6 hours, and it wasn't long enough.If I visit LA again, this is definitely on my must see list (probably 2-3 visits of 4-6 hours would be best to soak it all up).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katek623
50,"The Getty gets you to Europe, free of charge","Amazing museum, one of the most beautiful properties in California, and I would dare to say in the US. Entrance is free of charge. There are a bunch of free tours available if you want. Remember to book in advance through their website, otherwise you won't get in through the main gate. If you are not into European history don't worry, the Villa and views alone are worth seeing by themselves. It's like travelling for a moment to the Tuscan countryside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581aldoa
50,Best views in Los Angeles,"I have lived in LA for 9 years and visited the Getty for the first time this weekend! I can tell you this will be on the itinerary for every out of town guest I have from now on. The property is spectacular and the views are the best in the entire city. Sunset was great. Entrance is free which was a nice surprise. And we had an incredible meal at the Resturant. Oh, and the art is great too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karendU3998WG
50,A must see,"This is a gem of a museum. Beautiful and majestically sitting high on a mountain, this museum offers a spectacular setting overlooking city and water views.

50,The Getty Center,"From the tram ride up through the buildings & gardens, the Getty Center was a wonderful way to spend the afternoon!

Bring a picnic.Great place for a proposal.The Getty is like a dream.When can I move in?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S-Badventures
40,Beautiful grounds and interesting museum,We took the family here and enjoyed the spectacular architecture of the buildings and amazing views of the LA basin. The grounds and gardens were lovely to walk through and admire. The art is also worthy of a full day at the museum.We had lunch in the cafeteria on the premises and it was good. Our kids / teens are not particularly art lovers so their favorite part of the day was the free tram ride and the cafeteria french fries. However I hope some culture seeped into their pores that day and they will remember it fondly in the future. One can only hope.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campfamily50
50,Alchemy: This is a temporary exhibit but great,"There is an exhibit focused on alchemy, which is how materials and processes are used from nature to create -- artistic creation, but also guilds that were formed to study questions of creation in general. They were trying to solve the mysteries of the universe. Thus, it is really man-made creation in a nutshell. Taking natural substances, and changing them into something else. By taking, earth, water, air and fire, they tried to use these techniques to change the atomic structure (which they modeled) into something else. The exhibit has beautiful art pieces, crystal, drawings and paintings about how philosophers and early chemists worked. Overall, a really super way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lestertheinvestor
40,Must see - Not only for Art But for Architecture and Views,"While Getty Museum has its share of masterpieces, it is not only for the art works that you must visit. Unlike other museums, architecture of Getty although modern and contemporary is eye pleasing and has been done with a lot of thought and planning to offer you the best views of LA and make use of the natural light.The ride up by tram itself is exhilarating and in between free conducted tours , viewing exhibits, there are enough opportunities to rest your eyes and take in some spectacular views of LA from the vantage position of the museum on top of a mountain in Santa MonicaThe museum offers free audio tours. Additionally there are free docent led tours. We took Collection Highlights tour at 1100 and London calling tour at 1330hrs. To do any justice to the Museum aim to spend a full day from the time of opening at around 1000hrs till 1700hrs.Do spend some time in the well designed and maintained gardens. No shortage of food outlets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UNNIMAYA
50,Getty Family Day,"Great day trip from San Diego to see lots of art, nice view of city and a lovely walk through their gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherpaMama
50,Nice Afternoon,"We enjoyed our visit. It took about 4 hours to visit all the galleries in the 4 different buildings, but they are all connected on the second floors.The museum is free, but parking is $15 per car. We arrived about 11AM and no problem finding parking in the garage and the museum was not crowded. It got busy in the afternoon.We visited all the art galleries and exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/910KarenS910
50,Beautiful Museum,"We'd never been to this museum before and were excited to have the chance on this trip. Our GPS had a bit of a problem finding this place but eventually got us there. You park underground which you have to pay for as you leave. You take an elevator to the top floor and board a Monorail that takes you up to the museum complex. On the way you have great views of Beverly Hills and Brentwood and the freeway that OJ Simpson rode on in the back of the white Bronco. The museum buildings themselves are absolutely stunning. Some are connected and some are free standing. This museum features European art and the collection is stunning. They even let you take pictures inside. The grounds surrounding The Getty Center are also spectacular with beautiful gardens, lawns, artwork and a man made stream and pool. You are surrounded by terrific views of the nearby cities. Highly Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevoinMinnesoto
50,superb art in a tranquil setting,"It's a 4 hr tour or more,and the place is beautifully done. The architecture tour is run by a docent who knew a lot about ancient construction--50 minutes of interesting details. Of course, the main event is the art laid out by century. There are enough Rembrandt paintings for virtually an entire room. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garlec
50,Hilltop museum with a spectacular art collection,"An art museum that can compete with the major European art museums.We did visit here one of the major holidays, despite this, it never felt crowded.Everything is so well organized and the staff is a marvel of patience.Certainly there was a queue to the parking and the train to the museum, but everything was so well structured.Painting galleries, Sculpture and Decorative art, Changing exhibitions and lovely gardens.You have to make a choice, so you do not suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. Impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Incredible Architecture - let alone the art!,"What a well oiled Centre, everything from the volunteers greeting you once you step off the tram, to the food, to the collections to the free tours. An absolute pleasure to visit - cannot wait to go back. Allow yourself at least 3 hours to the entire day - there is so much to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passionflower200050
50,A unique treasure of the art world,"The Getty has a remarkable and somewhat unexpected collection: the wing with famous impressionist and modernist paintings is good, but so are the much less crowded rooms with beautiful historic furniture and interior design. The complex itself is an architectural marvel. The restaurant is very much worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickJ_12
50,"A small city, with a great view!","Inside - one ""super-room"" containing the Irises and several others. Outside - fun for kids to roll down the hills, explore the gardens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
50,It's Free!!! (but you pay for parking),"This is an architectural wonder and a real treat. There's no admission fee, but you'll pay $15 to park your car. It's a real bargain. This was a first visit so had little time to view the galleries in depth. There are free tours given by docents who are quite knowledgeable. Spent most of my time looking at the spectacular views and gardens and just walking around. I'll be back again soon and attack the galleries in earnest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Girlgolfer6
50,Amazing way to spend a day in L.A.,"Admission to this amazing art museum and architectural marvel is FREE! If you chose to drive, you pay $15/car parking, but, you could always Uber or have someone drop you off and pick up for a totally free day. I recommend starting with the architectural tour which covers the amazing details of the Getty's creation and orients you to the various buildings. Then, immerse yourself in the Getty's collection of art and when you're starving head to the Restaurant (hopefully you've made a reservation) for an amazing lunch - or, dinner! The Center is open into the evening and dinner is also available until closing. Special events take place from time to time and may or may not have admission fees. Bring your camera as this is the rare art museum where you may photograph most of what you see as long as you don't use your flash and on a good day you can see from the Pacific to the several mountain ranges surrounding the L.A. Basin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilatesProf
50,Stunning,This museum satisfies all of one's desire to see fabulous art but also is stunning architecturally. In fact it is hard to do all in one day. Set on a hill it has fabulous 360 views of the mountains and all the way to LA. It's collection of paintings and special exhibits is top notch and best of all it is free and extraordinarily well organized. We had bunch at the restaurant which was also exceptional and had wonderful views. If you go take the introductory one hour tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Captainspires
50,Amazing,What is not to like. Amazing setting. Amazing collection. Great friendly staff. Make sure you have time. You need time to see everything. Not just look but to view. There is a lot to see...inside and outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneT60
50,Lovely Place!!,Prepare to spend a full day here! This museum has a great art collection and stunning views !! Do not miss the architecture and garden tours!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757adrianaw
40,"Fussy but Worth It, I Think","It's not, to my eye, the greatest thing you could have done with That Hillside, architecturally. And the parking situation is the first of the many fussy little things you're likely to contend with on a trip here.But if you're able to unclench (and, on a busy day, pretend you're alone and it's tranquil amidst the throng), there's much here that's worthwhile to experience. It's a Big Deal Museum, after all, and they've done things properly.Go and see the usual artwork, but you should also check out what additional exhibits are available. They can sometimes be better than the permanent collection, and are frequently as interesting as historical artifacts as they are for their pure artistic value.Just gotta keep a cool head at the many small frustrations that you can encounter when you're going here, and you'll have a great trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandersMusic
50,Amazing,"I'd never heard of the Getty and was so glad we stopped. Breathtaking views from the veranda. Excellent art collection. Large facility we didn't have time to fully explore. Food is very pricey, but good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callesol105
50,Very nice museum,Very nice museum on a hill. Free admission though there is a $15 parking fee or $10 after 3pm. Free iPod audio tour. Lots of collections for oil paintings. Very nice building and garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ubest88

40,A Great Musuem Experience,"I'm originally from NY so its not MOMA or the Met...but for a new museum its spectacular. Both the permanent and traveling, special exhibits are great.Traffic like the rest of LA is problematic so plan to go at not the busiest times such as weekend afternoons or holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timtravelsabout
50,Must see in LA,Visited the Getty Centre on a Saturday afternoon. You can park at the bottom of the hill and get the train to the Centre. Really cool place with interesting exhibitions and amazing views of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/federicozmbn
50,Great Place to Spend the Day,"I was blown away when I learned this fabulous place was free. If you love to look at great architecture, gardens, and views of the surrounding area... The Getty Center is a must see.Make sure you take some of the tours... particularly the garden tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131RichardM131
50,Amazing even if you're not an art enthusiast!,"I'm an art history major and was bound to have an amazing time, but even my husband (who isn't always a huge art enthusiast) found it really inspiring. What really contributes to this is the architecture & gardens. The whole complex is designed to be an amazing indoor/outdoor sensory experience, and we spent probably half our time walking around before even going into the galleries. Of course, the galleries themselves have some really great artwork, and a few of what I call ""money rooms"" (completely full of works by famous-to-the-general-public artists). And it's free! ($15 parking) Highly, highly recommend to absolutely anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quarterlifeadventure
50,Really cool place,"We went and spent much more time outside the art exhibits than in it. Really well thought out architecture and landscaping, leading to an awe-inspiring, magical experience. It's just great to quietly walk around, explore, look at the views. We went in sunset and it was amazing. Truly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julielO2062EW
50,World Class Awesome!!,"$15 per car parking rate was reasonable considering museum admission was free!! Art in the museum was spectacular! I loved viewing Van Gogh's Irises again and the gardens are beautiful. We dined on cafeteria selections, on the patio. The coffee was particularly good. Nice food choices for everyone. The entire experience left me feeling restored. We were happy we arrived early, avoided the crowds and were on our way out before 3 pm traffic jams. Really a world-class experience,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeR34
50,Not To Be Missed.,"Beautiful from top to bottom. The tram ride up the mountain to the spectacular Getty Center is just the start. The Center is placed beautifully on the mountain top and the views are forever. The art, gardens, restaurant and peaceful vibe are fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385elyse
50,Lots of excellent classical art,"The Getty Center offers visitors paintings and sculptures from many of the great masters of Europe, who demostrated real expertise in their works. Contrast these with ""modern art,"" an oxymoron as oxymoronic as they get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alantU471YN
50,Definitely a Must See,"There is nothing else like The Getty Center. The setting is beautiful, sitting high on the hill and, hopefully, you'll be lucky enough to be there on a clear day when you can see from the ocean to downtown LA. Highly recommend the Architectural Tour. We’ve done it four times with various out-of-town guests. Some docents are better than others. The docent we had on our first tour was so exceptional with her knowledge that none of the others ever seemed as good. That being said, it’s still well worth the time because you’ll learn things about the architect, the various buildings and structures, and why the Getty is built the way it is. It's very interesting. There are a lot of little nuances that you won’t notice unless they are pointed out. There is probably too much to see in one day, but what you do see will be well worth it. The Restaurant at The Getty is excellent albeit a little pricey. It a lovely dining room with floor to ceiling windows. They are open for lunch Tuesday thru Sunday and for dinner on Friday & Saturday. It’s too bad the fountains are no longer running because of the water shortage in CA. They really added to the tranquility in the courtyard. If the weather is warm, it’s nice to just sit outside and enjoy the setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandys228
50,World class is not a cliche here.,This is my second visit and will not be my last. Spent 4 hours viewing art and the facility and one could spend days if their legs and feet could hold up. One of the better collections in the United States and I would put it in my top 5 art museums in the country and I have been to many from coast to coast. Excellent range of works and I enjoyed the temporary exhibits also. If you are limited to the number of attractions to visit in the L.A. area I would put this one in your top 3 to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015

50,Day at the Getty,"The Getty Center is a wonderful day to spend the day with family or friends, it has wonderful art pieces like paintings that you will appreciate, they always have beautiful exhibitions; the maze, waterfall and views of LA are well worth the parking fee, parking should not be a problem anymore. If art it's not your thing you will enjoy the immaculate gardens which are meticulously care for, but I think you will enjoy all the art they have from different epochs, makes you realize the great extent of human creativity and talent in our world. After visiting all the wings oh the museum you can drop by Santa Monica to eat and enjoy a view of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgef860

50,Outstanding outside & in - world class in every aspect,"A vision delivered.Seeing so many younger school groups going through this exceptional facility was so pleasing. Soaking up its nod to the past, present & future in such creative ways.Very difficult to post only 10 accompanying images when the outside has as much to offer as the collection stored within this exceptional architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyJetGuru
50,A must do if you come to LA,"The Getty Center is an amazing place to come to, and offers something for everyone. Even if you just come here and look at the views from the gardens down to LA it's worth the $15 parking charge. But the painting collection is great, and the gardens are amazing.Would recommend the short trip out from central LA to come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanteandDougie
50,Wear Comfortable Shoes,"The gardens and exhibits are diverse and widespread, so be sure to consider your feet and schedule time for meals/snacks and just sitting and enjoying the vistas.

From the stunning architecture to the interesting art pieces, to the magnificent grounds and gardens, everything is so pleasing to the eye!The cafeteria provides a wide selection of food, and there is plenty of seating. I would recommend dining al fresco in the sun!Spent about 3 hours wandering around the exhibitions and grounds, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Even the monorail was a good experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItTastesLikeFeet
50,"Wow, The Getty!","Just go! Go for the free admission, go for the art, awesome views or lunch, which you can bring and then have a picnic. So much to offer. This is my second visit, but it was as if it was my first. Parking is abundant and cost $15. The museum has something for everyone to enjoy. So gather the family, pack or purchase a great lunch and enjoy the excellent views. I am looking forward to my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NetteCalifornia
30,Impressive structure/ horrible architecture,It looks like I'm the only one here who thought this place lacks charm and atmosphere. The architecture is horrible - it looks like a first world hospital BUT I must say that the staff was ultra friendly and the collection is impressive!And... it's free :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafael_azzi
50,Best bang for the buck you'll get in LA,"Free admission and amazing gardens. You don't even need to like art to visit this location due to the beautiful grounds and views. Parking can be tight but don't be turned off by parking full sign, they always seem to have a space open. Come late for the sunset views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinElls
50,Vista del Epic,Absolutely tremendous views of LA sprawl. Visit in the winter and the sunset will make your eyes drool. Hardly had time to walk around the indoor exhibits but everything I did see looked very intriguing. Planning to come back on my next visit for much longer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwb92
40,Beautiful Setting and Grounds,"The Getty is well worth visiting whether you are a tourist or a local. The art collection is interesting and they often feature some extraordinary exhibitions. There is not cost to get into the museum, only a parking charge so it can get very busy here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffn146
50,Gorgeous Gardens & Art!,"Had a wonderful afternoon at the Getty, enjoying the beautiful flower gardens (and making a wish throwing coins into the pond!), and exploring some fabulous artwork (Monet, Van Gogh, etc...) And the best is that - once you pay for parking - it's all free. Loved it! And will definitely return for a longer day -- it really does take a long time to see everything (and we didn't manage to).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryAlphan
50,Something for Everyone:,"Monorail-Light-Views -Architecture-Art-open Space-GardensThe monorail is quiet, clean , gentle , fun/ gives a feeling of leaving the city behind and entering a different world. Kids usually love it and it is gentle enough for grandma.The plaza and building architecture is Light in form...inspiring a relaxed breathing and ease that only open spaciousness can do. Our family often goes for the art and never gets further than the pleasure and delight of hanging out in the open spacesThe Garden is deceptively larger than is appears from above. An unrushed meander can take at least 30 minutes. If you relax /reflect on a bench or stop of photos ..plan on more time.(carry water with you and use the bathrooms before hand!). The green hill around the garden may be one of the only local ""parks "" you can be assured has no doggie ""business"" on it..so is a safe place to picnic and let the kids roll downhill and play on.--what a gift! The art: world class, varied exhibits, great with or without the audio self guides. Decent interactive exhibit for young kids too. Drink it in. ABUNDANCE in every way. The restaurant: overpriced and poor /slow service /not worth it the several times I checked it out. The cafeteria: usually good variety (we are vegetarian) and decent prices. Always good seating. Hours are shorter than you might expect so check carefully if you are counting on this for your mealtime. The little cafe : no selection , overpriced, lines. WE OFTEN BRING A PICNIC or snacks. no lines /best price! The gift store; always worth a few minutes or more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannac940
50,Not to be missed if you are in Los Angeles,One of the most impressive art collections in the world. Situated on a cluster of magnificent buildings on a campus perched above the city. Sunset from the balcony of one of the galleries was magnificent to watch as the lights around LA came on in the valley below.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princeton_Man
50,*** Good amazing private collection of art ***,"You really have to admire this place. There is valuable art, a magnificent garden and the amazing architecture to admire. We spent around 3 hours in here and should have allowed for more time. Definitely recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkkchow
50,"Another surprising ""Must Do"" in LA","This road trip has been full of surprises and the afternoon visiting the Getty Center was no different. Ofcourse I knew the famous name and expected it to be lavish but they have taken the museum experience to the next level. Affordability and costs when on holiday is important and I was expecting to pay for some of this experience but apart from the UBER ( we left the car at the hotel ) there and back that was all we paid for, except for a lovely lunch in the grounds. The views, layout and overall experience is second to none as are the variety of art and exhibits on show for your enjoyment. I suppose the only blot on this otherwise perfect review is the waking guided tour we decided to join. It is a very limited group size given the limited number of headsets ( I think it was 20 ). We got there in good time but the tour was not as good as we had hoped and could have been better. If you have a picture ID they will provide free iPod headsets which you can walk around with and learn about specific exhibits in each room simply by putting the number of exhibit in to the iPod.........definetly worth doing .......at your own pace. The food in the restaurant was also well priced with a good selection of sandwiches, salads and drinks and will even sell you some wine if the car is back at the hotel ..........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123steved123
50,"It' a ""must see"" if you're in LA!","An extraordinary collection of masterpieces @GettyMuseum.Here one of #PeterPaulRubens ""The return from war: Mars disarmed by Venus."" #LosAngeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LolsBP
50,The Getty Center,"It is a very impressive place! Very unique!!Its fantastic location overlooking all of Los Angeles, perfectly in tune with it's super modern architecture, the wonderful hi-tech funicular train, not to mention the beautiful local nature as well as the man made gardens... I can't say enough! It is a ""Must See Icon of LA!"" The exhibits held within the museum are also very precious! If you are of European origin like me, and you are accustomed to the nearly infinite displays of famous paintings and statues and various art collections from all eras in the glorious past of European history.... well of course, it is not the Louvre! But there certainly are many beautiful things there that will keep you very interested and very occupied, and don't expect to see it all in one day! Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankL2583
50,Beautiful setting!!,"Beautiful gardens with a view of the Pacific Ocean. On one of my many outings to the Getty, I walked in and was overwhelmed by the artwork. I asked if this came from the Ufitzi Gallery in Italy and it was confirmed that indeed it was. Our day ended with a lunch in the hill top restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyc15
50,Awesome exhibits,"Awesome collection of paintings, statues, artifacts, etc. You don't need to go to Europe to see art collections. Another awesome thing about this place are the buildings and its history behind it. The best thing about Getty Museum is it's Free, you only pay for parking. My favorite place to take friends and relatives from other places when they visit Los Angeles. A must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346williamg
40,A Very Cool Way to Spend an Afternoon,"You know, a lot of art snobs (like me) turn our noses up at the Getty Center because for all its obscene wealth it doesn't have a world-class permanent collection (same holds true for LACMA, btw...)Okay, granted, it doesn't. It's not the Met, the Hermitage, the Louvre. You're not going to see a whole lot of ""greatest hits"" from the rarified world of fine art. What you ARE going to do is spend a really pleasant afternoon surrounded by not only some very worthwhile creations but a whole environment devoted to you having a wonderful, aesthetic experience.Maybe at heart, the Getty Center is really about appreciation, and everything from the restaurants to the gardens to the restrooms is designed to enhance your sense of appreciation. Never mind the stuff hanging on the walls; every time I go there I marvel at the espresso carts, the door handles, the landscaping, how thoughtful and intentional the whole place is.If you want to see Starry Night, go to the MOMA. If you want to see the Mona Lisa, go to the Louvre. But if you just want to experience an intentionally loving and artful environment, the Getty Center should definitely be on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDFreemanstrips
50,"great views , one of a kind building and landscaping","Very interesting and new exhibits all the time, a must see if you come to Los Angeles, There is a little bit of art for everyone to enjoy and the Pastel collection is breathtaking, look closer and you will see the Masterpieces",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1wayfaringstranger
50,Amazing,"It's completely free. Beautiful art and sculpture. I was waiting for robots to come out of the walls, so futuristic in a really cool way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9236AQstevec
50,Great views and great art,"This is a museum consisting of separate buildings around a courtyard designed to hold almost everything in J Paul Getty's collection except for the ancient Greek and Roman which are principally located in a replica Roman villa in Malibu. Entry is free, but parking, at the foot of the hill is not. A free tram connects hilltop to parking. Easily accessible from the 405 freeway in the Sepulveda Pass. Cafeterias/cafes exist but are relatively expensive. Basically an all day experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
50,A must-see stop for anyone visiting Los Angeles,"The remarkable personal collection of Getty is in itself worth a visit for anyone interested in fine art and especially antiquities. But the stunning location and scale of the Getty Center is worth visiting even if one is not an art aficionado.You can see the Getty from far away, but the immensity of its scale really only hits you once you travel up the mountainside in the tram that is the only public entry. What you see when you get off the little train is truly monumental and magnificent.The massive museum complex is constructed of huge blocks of rough white marble and it's quite spectacular. But even more eye-popping are the views its mountainside location offers -- from the Pacific Ocean to the mountains east of Los Angeles, and all the way past the Palos Verdes peninsula to the Port of Los Angeles. Stunning views from various points around the museum make this a real must-see stop on any visit to this city.Another stand-out feature of the Getty Center is the beautiful garden and sloping lawn, where you can walk around gorgeous landscaping or lie on the grass all day with a good book. The garden includes lots of exotic flora and is beautifully manicured and maintained. It's extremely striking.The museum has excellent cafe offerings for food and beverages, and lovely outdoor cafe seating areas that are always lively. It also has an outstanding gift/book shop with superb selections and lots of beautiful items. Sometimes in summer months there is free live music in the open-air areas; it is worth checking to see which evenings might offer that entertainment.Admission to the Getty Center is free, but you must pay for parking. (However there are public transportation options on city bus routes that travel up Sepulveda Boulevard.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6793YDcherylm

50,"Beautiful, Affordable and Incredibly Interesting","There are no downsides to the Getty Center. Majestic architecture, changing exhibits, good food at decent prices, the Getty is a great way to spend a day.

If time permits enjoy a gourmet lunch or a quick snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelfare
50,Amazing Art Gallery - not to be missed,"If you are in LA then the Getty Centre is not to be missed. Allow at least half a day to wander this amazing gallery the variety of the art on display is fantastic. The gardens and the building are also fantastic. An Uber ride from downtown is around $28,00 but it is free to entry the gallery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squashed_boxer

40,"Amazing buildings, exhibits and gardens.",We were there for 5.5 hours and did not see half of what was there. The gardens need to have labels on the plants to know what they are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR817

40,Top of the list,"Even if you don't like art this still a great place to visit. A short monorail trip to the top of the reveals beautiful white stone building. Many gardens to stroll through. Many different art areas with a full restaurant and cafeteria.Only cost is parking, $ 15.00, $ 10.00 after 3 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceM573
50,One of the most attractive place in Los Angeles,"For art lovers, no doubt this is heaven. One can enjoy art in an ideal atmosphere. However, the location of Getty Centre is just wonderful. The moment train/tram takes you to the centre, the 360 degree view of Los Angeles will surly charm you. You can't watch sunrise as the centre opens at about 10 am. But can possibly watch sunset. There are both self-guided tour and guided tour to take you around. The surroundings are very nice to enjoy a relaxing day. And there are no charges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Royadip

50,Beautiful museum and surrounding scenery,"Every aspect of this museum was simply beautiful. In addition to the well-laid out and variety of exhibits, the amazing outdoor scenery really served to calm the senses. I also enjoyed the tram ride up the hill. To top it all off it doesn't cost a single cent. Even if you're not a huge art fan this is one place you should stop by in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HN274
50,a must visit if you come to Los Angeles,"if you come to L.A. for a visit, then you should come here. there are works of art from all over the world here. you can find paintings by Van Gogh, Matisse and many more. and the price is right. it is free. you only pay for parking. we were here with family in August of 2016. my granddaughter loved the beautiful gardens and the vistas of Los Angeles. they have a fine cafe here that has reasonable prices. we had a great time. in addition to their permanent collection of art they have seasonal exhibitions. you may want to check in advance to see what these are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Svaldez
50,Relaxing Day,"Going to The Getty Center is by far, for me, the most relaxing experience. The pieces are amazing (large collection) that I'd recommend blocking out two days for this. The tram ride up to the location is very cool. It was hot when we went so we didn't see as much of the gardens/outdoor areas as I would have liked but it was nice and cool inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsayzdz
50,This is such a worthwhile visit- especially on a clear day,This is a wonderful museum. The exhibits are beautifully laid out with good documentation. It is an amazing location with a world class view of the city and out to the sea. The museum store has many treasures. The fine dining restaurant is very special with excellent food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineK267
50,Great day trip,The Getty building and grounds are incredible on their own but the art is also well worth the trip. Beautiful views from the grounds!!! I will come here again and again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alvysma
50,#1 For a Reason!,"There are actually many reasons The Getty Center is the #1 attraction in LA - but where to start? First, the plethora of wonderful exhibits, of course - from sculpture, to photography, to oils . . . Second, the free admission (but $15 parking per car - still so reasonable). Third, the wonderful tours that are held throughout the day - of the garden, architecture (highly recommended), and special collections - be sure to get the list and plan your day. Or maybe it's the friendly, helpful volunteers who are there to assist you where ever you turn. Could it be the elevated location with spectacular vistas at every turn?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuePete
50,A MUST SEE if visiting LA,The exhibits were good but the view was GREAT! The architecture of the building was incredible to see and you overlook the many LA areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missouritravel5

50,"Outstanding Facility, World Class Art and Venue","Well worth the effort to attend, as the Getty facility is in a beautiful mountainside location and houses many of world renown collections. The $15 admission is just for the parking, otherwise the entrance and exhibits, tours, listening devices, etc. are free. The City is blessed to have such a self supporting facility open to the public. Well worth attending for locals and visitors alike. Outdoor gardens are magnificent. It would take all day to get around, so choose a theme or style and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5026OSjohng
50,"Fantastic, either indoors or outdoors!","I've been coming to Los Angeles in the past twenty years on business, but this time I had a weekend to relax and I was awestruck by the Getty Center. I had no idea what it was about and a friend recommended a visit.So there I went with no big expectations. It was easy to get there and the parking lot is well organized. You can pay with credit card (15 dollars), which is cheap given that the entrance to this wonderful space is free.I began my own personal experience by visiting the outdoor grounds. The views from the city are pretty, but the gardens are phenomenal! I took so many pictures and I'm sharing some here.I was already in love but I still had to check the indoors (in other words, the museums!). I was told the collection was not impressive, but that was entirely wrong. Art is fantastic in all different pavilions in the Center. Of course the West Pavilion with the impressionists was my favorite.I could spend an entire week enjoying the views, gardens and art in this amazing ground. I definitely will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad159533

40,Interesting,Great buildings & gardens visited painting exhibitions but found a lot so got too much in end cafes close early so after walking a lot needed a drink! Staff helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669mj
50,Spectacular architecture and art,"The Getty Genter is more than a series of galleries. It is art, architecture, style and environment rolled into a splendid package. You ride to the top of a hill by tram. The Center is located on the peak of the hill which overlooks parts of west LA and the ocean- an amazing view and a series of amazing buildings. Everywhere you go in the buildings and gardens offers a different perspective - a visual feast. The buildings have permanent collections from every age and when we visited they had a number of temporary exhibitions; a celebration of food and feasts from hundreds of years ago, French tapestries from pre revolution times and so much more. Definitely worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieP712
50,Brilliant way to savour art and LA views ... & its free!,A superb art collection together with stunning architecture & a bird's eye view of LA makes this a wonderful way to spend a few hours away from the hustle & bustle of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julee14
50,"Great art, Fabulous views, Amazing architecture, Nice gardens","Parking was $15 and admission was free. You park at the bottom of the hill and take a train up to the top. The buildings were amazing. I loved the trees and gardens. The art is top notch and the exhibits are very well thought out. You can see a wide range of art in a small amount of time. Exhibits change frequently, so you could go back often. I am so glad I came here. We took a break at the outdoor cafe and I thought the prices were very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertkM5959BT
50,Favourite place in LA,"Stunning grounds & architecture, beautiful artworks preserved and exhibited perfectly. The views towards the coast (you can even see the ocean on a clear day) and over the city are worth the trip let alone all the rest The Getty Center has to offer! Saw 'The Art of Alchemy' exhibit in their Research Institute, was fascinating. You don't want to miss a single description. Great place for picking up souvenirs too, some gems in their gift shops. The cafe has a wide range of food for all tastes and reasonably priced. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancescaLW217
50,Excellent,Super fun to have picnics there and do all that fun stuff and take photos it's an amazing sight but you just have to go to if you are touring California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSW101
50,LA's best sanctuary,"My favorite public place in LA is The Getty. It's architecturally clean, modern museum is perched high on a hill, surrounded by immaculately manicured gardens, and houses a spectacular art collection. It's LA's best sanctuary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/778julianeb
50,Incredible grounds and beautiful buildings.,"The major piece of art in this museum is the building itself, and the gardens adorning it. There are many beautiful paintings and sculptures, but nothing really compares to the facility itself. It is truly magnificent. Highly recommend. Admission is free, but parking is $15 and the system they use is very counterintuitve. You have to get a ticket as you enter, then take it to a kiosk and pay before you leave. The first kiosk we tried would not work, but the second one on another floor did. Just a hassle. Question to the Getty: Why not just have everyone pay the parking fee as you enter and dispense with the tickets and kiosks?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBSpeakeasy
50,Not sure what to do in LA? Try this place.,"It depends on your interests but I believe it's worth coming here even just for a break from it all. There is plenty of art to see and the centre is worth the trip in itself. There are huge gardens to explore, shady trees to sit under and last but not least, various eateries to enjoy. At least during high season. After that you'll find most of them closed.I found this place to be a wonderful sanctuary for those trying to escape the glitz and glamour Hollywood has to offer. Here you find the real deal. None of the fake, pretentious stuff.Entry is free and you pay $15 to park your car. Depending on the temperature you may find it enjoyable to walk up the hill from the carpark but it is about a 20 minutes walk. Otherwise just catch the trains that run up and down the hill every few minutes.Consider joining at least one tour whilst you're there. It may just reveal something new.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefans03
50,gardens of heaven,"this is a great place to take kids and visitors. Grounds are stunning, views amazing and architecture and art fabulous. Park and then you have to take a train to the top, goes quickly.

50,Fantastic art collection with incredible views over LA,"A visit to the Getty Center is a must. The art and the exhibitions are just on of the best in town. Never mind if you do not have much time, the visit is worth it in any case. The architecture of the buildings is superb, the views over LA impeccable, the gardens just so beautifully crafted and all this for free. Definitely plan a visit to this museum whilst you are in LA.As this is a poplar tourist attraction make sure you buy the tickets online in advance so you will get in faster. On quite days one can also enter without advance tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666alexandrat
50,The best hidden restaurant in LA!,We are not modern art lovers and the Getty did not disappoint. It is full of beautiful old paintings and sculptures and exquisite furniture. Getty was a strange man but he had very good taste.I am not sure I like the architecture but the galleries are superb.Even better was the restaurant which has a wonderful menu and sensible portions. The Goldeneye Pinot Noir is fabulous. This has to be one of the best restaurants in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarnPhillips
40,It offers spectacualr view of LA and quiet park to walk around.,"The view and park are romantic. However, the exhibitions in the museum are boring, only European art is offered. There should be choices of arts of other people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aikosha87
50,The beauty of the place caught me by surprise,"I was really just going for the art inside the museum. But when I arrived and walked around and saw the gardens, I was uplifted. Beauty and harmony between the outdoors and the architecture of the buildings! I went in to see the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit and was very impressed by his work which I was new to. After that I mostly stayed in the South Pavillion and enjoyed the European decorative art. There was too much to view and take in for one day - which is good as it gives me an excuse to go back again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaMaria0403
50,Amazing,If you are an art lover visiting Los Angeles the Getty Centre is a must on your list of must do. The size of the Centre is amazing and the collection of art is extraordinary.

50,Fabulous art,Art is amazing and it has different art that visits. It will take all day to see. Try to get a docent to show you around or rent headphone tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tdhalldds
50,Great place to take out of town guests!,"The Getty is stunning - both the property and the vista. It is free to enter, though you pay for parking, which is good for The Getty Center and Getty Villa on a same day visit. Nice giftshop and cafe too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacq-Mike
50,Wow!,"Had a superb day at the Getty Centre- fantastic architecture, beautiful gardens, and then the art! How wonderful to see fantastic art from Monet, Manet, Gaugin, Cezanne, van Gough - the list goes on and on. Fantastic guides and specialist exhibitions too, and all for free- can't recommend this highly enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23berniep
50,Don't miss this one!,"The Getty is quite a wonderful experience. The buildings, landscaping and the extensive art collections are all out-standing draw-cards, but there is also the spectacular views out over LA. And all for free!! We could have stayed all day. The only thing I would fix was the wi-fi in the Uber pick-up area, which was patchy, making the pick-ups a little tricky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyNornor
50,Getti,"It's place like Tretyakovskay gallery , very interesting museum! Salvador Dali, France 16 centure, and other interesting paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isirk2016
50,A must,"If you like art and you are in LA, The Getty is a must. It has a vast collection of art in a very impressive facility. The architecture of the place is mind blowing. Some of the exhibitions are transient, so prior research is recommended. Excellent place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438erickg
50,Unique,"IMO, the Getty shares the title of most beautiful museum I've ever seen with the Guggenheim in Venice. Maybe it's not so rich, but his masterpieces are superb. And the Getty complex is a masterpiece too.Entry is free, park your car for a few bucks and ride the train.You need the whole day to browse everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanDGiusto
50,Amazing Museum and Landscaspe,"If you visit L.A. you must visit the Getty. You don't have to be a museum person to appreciate how cool this spot is. It's also easy to visit using uber and they have a pick up point too. Take the 15 minute walk up to save insane long waits in line, and it's easy to catch the train down (and it's free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L3Nola
40,An eclectic collection of Art,"This museum displays the art acquired by J. Paul Getty, the oil magnate.This was his personal collection and as such it is a humoungous collection.Paintings span from the middle ages to very recent works.There also is furniture, ceramics, manuscripts, jewelry, glassware, etc.The are a number of well-known master works in this collection; and these are things that are must-sees.Unfortunately, there is not enough material in any one subject to allow for an in-depth study of that subject. The Getty is not unique in that respect. The Armand Hammer collection in the LA County Museum suffers from the same problem. Ditto for the Norton-Simon collection in Pasadena. I wish that each of these museums would pick a few time periods or movements or countries and trade/lend to each other in order to get to critical mass.France has dozens of such specialized museums and they allow you to understand an artist's portfolio.Nevertheless the Getty center is a must-see for any visitor to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincent-dirks
40,Great location,Beautiful architecture great views. I great spot to visit a decent collection of art but certainly not spectacular. In the area you should stop in and enjoy..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4940UQstevec
50,the best attraction in L.A. — fantastic views!,"The views of LA from the Getty are absolutely amazing. The building is very remarkable, the collections are also world-class. I also love the gardens. Definitely a must see if you're into arts & culture. Like any large museums, reserve 2-3 hours to visit The Getty Center. They have cafes in the museum, but can be quite costly. You can bring in your own food, but you have to consume it in the gardens/ tables before boarding the tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinky_in_arabia
50,Beautiful setting!,Plan for a full day at this wonderful museum. Impression exhibit is fabulous.The history of the museum video is informative.Grounds are gorgeous. Plan to walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliewft

50,Highlight of LA,"This was my favourite place on my 10 day trip to Los Angeles! The collection is absolutely amazing, with some true masterpieces, and the building itself is stunning. The tram ride up is gorgeous and there are the most spectacular views from all corners of the building of the entire city. Pack a picnic lunch and enjoy the beautiful gardens, I will certainly be back many times.!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyg451
50,beautiful art and amazing view!,"wow, free admission and hour-long tour--amazing! took an uber/lyft from the Long Beach cruise terminal while in port (about $40 each way--but cheaper than the Princess excursion cost)...was blown away by the beauty of the building, then the docent did a great job at explaining five pieces of art in-depth...could have stayed longer and need to go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alaireo
50,A Fantastic Way To Spend An Afternoon,"While visiting LA last month, I had the immense pleasure of visiting The Getty for the first time.The experience was outstanding from beginning to end: from the parking, to the easy and speedy tram ride up to the museum site, to the Central Garden, to the views...To the art!The old masters: Canaletto. Degas. Gauguin. Manet. Monet. Rembrandt. Renoir. Turner. Van Gogh.Some wonderful sculptures (Rodin!). An amazing photo exhibit! There was an exhibit of recent British artists (London Calling) that wasn't really to my taste, though there were a half dozen paintings I enjoyed.I loved my experience at The Getty... and it is a place I will go again and again!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sox1fan
50,"Larger than life buildings, grounds, gardens","The size and scale of the architecture and grounds blew me away. It's a thoughtfully designed space - starting with the tram ride from the parking lot ($15) to the main courtyard areas to the rooftop gardens where you can see plantings on the roof against the backdrop of the LA skyline. Hard to believe there is no entrance fees or tour fees, what a deal.We took one tour of the Impressionists, very nice, but otherwise spent the day outdoors enjoying the sunshine and plants.The restaurants are quite good. We went to the ""cafeteria"" and the food was fresh and high quality. Next time will check out the restaurant require reservation, the menu was quite tempting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fzachary
50,Great day at the Getty.,Unreal collection of ancient Greco-Roman Bronzes. Really mind blowing to see such an accumulation of wealth. Gardens and grounds were beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26MatthewF
50,Not to be missed!,"If you're in the area and can spare a day or part of a day, this is a must-see. Parking is $15 per car but otherwise there are no fees at all, even for the tours. If you get there after 3 pm I believe the parking fee is $10 per car. Trams arrive regularly at the parking structure to take you to the museum.Once you arrive at the museum, go up the stairs and enter the building, there's an introductory film in the room on the right that's not really worth bothering with IMO. Instead stop at the desk just past the entry, leave one photo ID as a deposit and pick up free ipods with headsets for everyone in your party so you can do your own self-guided tour of the art. Staff members will show you how to use the ipod touch if you need.Speaking of tours, the Architectural Tour is very informative even if you aren't really into architecture, as you get a lot of information on the center. It takes about 40 minutes and is really excellent. There's also a garden tour and tours of various exhibits, all are described on the flyer you receive at arrival. I recommend taking at least one tour if possible and seeing the rest on your own with their ipod touch.The buildings that house the art are connected to each other so you can go from one to the other without going outside but step outside once in a while to see the views of the city and the sculpture exhibited outdoors on the different levels. There are also lovely water features outdoors on the main level, and the garden is just lovely for a stroll.If you want to see most of the exhibits in one visit, allocate most of a day so you can also take breaks and see everything at your leisure. Otherwise 3-4 hours would be enough time to see most of the highlights and also take in a tour. It's amazing that you can see so much art in such a beautiful location for such a reasonable cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Weevils
40,the best thing in LA a must for you to see!!,"Went on garden tour, architectual tour and Impressionists tour all three were great three hours then two to walk around.Hey all: Greta Art, Great Architecture, Great View, Great garden and great vibeThe real Zen space of LA a real Winner!!Jimbo Bateso",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bateso
50,Wonderful experience!,What a delight for the senses! The garden tour is very informative and a must if you visit The Getty Center. The architecture alone is worth seeing even if you never enter a building. My eight-year-old loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411BarbaraS411
50,Amazing architecture in a great setting!,"The Getty is one of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited - located on top of a hill in Los Angeles, the views are gorgeous. After parking, visitors take a tram to the top of the hill and experience the 4 main buildings that make up the campus. Each floor and building is well organized with good flow. At the base, well manicured garden / fountains provide a tranquil environment.The art collection is very interesting - portraits, sketches, sculptures, and photographs. The collection isn't as comprehensive as the Met or the Louvre, but still has some beautiful works!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaMariner22

50,Beautiful grounds and architectUre,"1/2 hour outside of downtown LA, this is a really beautiful site. Gardens include serene rock formations, thoughtful use of local plants that can withstand dry conditions. Meier's curving walls look great from the outside and allows visitors to see outside with greatAfter parking the car, a shuttle takes the visitor to the buildings. Because the museum has free entry, there is a high possibility of crowds. Views from the elevated grounds include the greater LA area. We were very fortunate in that we could see all the way to the mountain range on this beautifully clear day.The permanent collection, other the Antiquities, is located here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elaine3Southport
40,Excellent Attraction But Not The Museum,"The Getty Museum site in on top of a mountain which provides fantastic modern architecture, views, a garden, and a funicular you take from the parking lot up to the museum. However, the museum collection will probably disappoint you and will not be an important part of your visit. There is a café. Wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016
50,Museum,What an excellent museum. The art is wonderful however the buildings and location are absolutely marvelous. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scielbi
30,LAX Transit Activity,"Had a few hours of transit in LAX and decided to visit the Getty Museum. Took about half an hour by taxi costing $50-60 one way. There's a train shuttle from the parking lot to the museum up on the hill. Large complex with great scenery of the city and lovely, well-maintained garden - a great place to take a stroll around. The art collection was just fine (Oct. 2 years back).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabyVM
50,A gem,"Even if you are not into art much this is still a must see when in LA. After you park for $ 15 there is a short tram ride that brings you to the hill top. Entrance to the Getty center is FREE, when is the last time you heard that in California? There are multiple buildings and exhibits with some beautiful art ,I especially enjoyed the paintings by famous masters like Rembrandt and van Gogh. But you also have stunning gardens and beautiful views of the ocean and downtown LA. For sure we will visit here more often",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radar60
50,cultural center of the west coast - also great view down on LA,We went to the opening of an exhibition wich was great and I highly recommend it (picture 1).

50,Amazing!!,"What a fantastic place to visit. Easy to get to by bus. Allow all day to see the centre, wear comfy shoes lots of walking involved like all galleries!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylout663
50,Improving,"When the Getty Center first opened we visited and called it a First Rate Facility with a Third Rate Art Collection. Now, many years later it is still a First Rate Facility, extremely well maintained and groomed, with a Second Rate Art Collection. LOL. Given the amount of money the Getty has spent on acquisitions, this should not surprise anyone. Given some more years, the collection may yet attain first-rate quality.Having said that, we feel the Museum is a 'must see' as it is a gorgeous faciltiy with a commanding view and first rate amenities. Also, it qualifies as 'cheap thrills' as admission is free and the $15 charge for parking is quite nominal given the area. So, we highly recommend it.We visited on a Friday and were heartened by the large number of school groups touring. In this day of reduced school budgets for art and culture instruction, it was good to see so many children learning about fine art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash
50,What a view on a clear day!,Half of the experience at the Getty is getting there and the views. Needless to say to art and photography is spectacular. You only pay for parking not to enter the museum. You take a tram from the parking lot to the museum which is slow so you can take in the views and calm you down to enjoy the experience. You arrive and there are different building with different exhibits and special showings. The gardens are worth walking in at all different times of the year and the restaurant is good as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
50,Wonderful center for art - and it's all free!,I go to the Getty Center every time I'm in Los Angeles. It's free and the art exhibits are spectacularly curated. Great gift shops and tours.

Highly recommended trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernbank
50,Must see in L.A.,"The location, architecture and garden are worth a visit even before the art is considered.The operation is a credit to Getty and those working for the organisation.The art speaks for itself.

50,Magical setting in the heart of LA,Being a local I watched The Getty being built from the ground up. Such an amazing feat. Great site with (on a clear day) views across LA and to the Ocean. The permanent colocation is small but truly impressive as are the wonderful gardens and outdoor spaces. The restaurant is really good quality with pricey though worth the setting food. Good on a rare rainy day but go on a clear day and enjoy the art and the amazing view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewM127
40,BUSY BEE!!!,It was a very nice day but with limited time; didn't get to see HALF of what was offered. Definitely want to go back and spend more time there! Loved the tram ride up to the Getty and the view was spectacular!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kckicks
40,Over the city of Angels and SF Valley,"it is a unique experience with different things and pieces of art you see around. it is located high enough to give you a good point of observation over the city and around.just need to head there by car to the parking lot or by bus to the front street, then the train will take you up there through the nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkb975
50,The view alone is worth it,"The getty is simply one of the best museums in the world! It is a must see for any visitor to LA and can be enjoyed over and over. The view alone, particularly on a clear day, makes a visit worthwhile.That is not to undersestimate the beauty of the buildings and the contents. Each is remarkable in its own way. The collection is perhaps quirky, given that it is not dominated by classical masters. It reflects the passions of the originakl owner and the trustees that have followed in his footsteps. Indeed the mixing of ancient artifacts with paintings and furniture/furnishings gives the whole collection a unique feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozefish479
50,Beautiful Grounds,One of the most beautiful museum grounds I have ever seen! Plus it's free! You can spend all day there and even bring your own food and have a picnic. Highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hllywd1982
50,peaceful & great walk at the garden,"My family had always enjoyed our visit to the Getty Center since my kids were young, now days I always bring my visiting friends or family to the center, after the walk thru the museum, on a clear day you can see the ocean from the balcony, the garden is always a retreat for us to relax a bit. Have a cup of coffee & enjoy the view. It's great place to visit that I never get tired of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermO3475KF

50,Nice way to spend a lazy afternoon!,"First visit to the Getty Museum, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It's a beautiful way to spend an afternoon. There is so much to see at this place. First you arrive to the underground parking lot. Parking is $15 per vehicle, but the museum admission is free. A little tram takes you up the hill…I'm not sure if you can walk to the top where the museum entrance is, but it's a long way so I would save my energy for the museum itself. When you get to the main entrance the people at the information desk are very helpful in letting you know what is going on that day. They also have free audio tours, although you do have to leave your ID. Overall they have a tremendous collection of art from different eras and styles. The only thing I did not like that much was the lay-out…The lay-out is all interconnected and before I knew it I was in the new building section and I hadn't finished the last one, so a lot of up and down…(However they do have elevators for accessibility) but a lot of back and forth. But other than the layout, the grounds were well kept very clean. I can imagine a nice romantic date night, looking over the city. The gardens were wonderful, people were relaxing on the ground having a picnic. Walking the paths. I would definitely recommend checking this out. The best part is that it's one of the very few museums open till 9pm. I don't think any others in the greater Los angeles area are open to the general public after 5pm. We spent almost 5 hours there and didn't see all the artwork….that's how much there is to see. I would definitely recommend and return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAExplorer69

50,Possibly my favorite place in Los Angeles.,"I'm relatively new to Los Angeles/California. I lived in NYC for 25 years and sometimes took for granted the amazing museums it had to offer. When I moved to Los Angeles, the Getty Center was a bit of 'therapy' for me. I first went for the Herb Ritts photography exhibition. But, even though I am a photographer, I find I am consistently blown away by painting. Fortunately, the Getty has a European Painting floor which is dazzling. The collection rotates, so I can visit yearly and always find new works.Aside from the magnificent facilities, the grounds are beautiful and the views from the complex and the shuttle tram are quite nice, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RolandKorg
50,"One of the best, anywhere","My wife and I visit the Getty Center a couple of times a year. They have several new exhibits every few months, so there is always something interesting to see. The architecture is spectacular, the views of the LA basin are awesome and, of course, their permanent collection is some of the best in the world. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarryRidge
50,Make this visit at least one full day!,"Come early, stay late. Wow. Wasn't sure how patient my 14 and 11 year old would be and they absolutely loved the place. The views, the cafes, the gardens... It's even more amazing to see incredible artwork from The Masters, one after the other. I understand completely why this is the #1 attraction in LA - deservedly so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveO887

A must see for art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WRashed
50,Something for everyone!,"You don't even have to enter the beautiful buildings to love this place. The scenery and garden alone are enough to justify any number of visits.

50,A must do,"From the fabulous tram ride up to the spectacular buildings and views... the Center itself is well worth the visit ... and then you add the art.... WOW! WOW! WOW! We had a fabulous visit.. but had not allowed enough time to do everything. It was $15 for the parking but there is no entrance fee. We combined our visit with the Getty Villa, so this made the parking fee worthwhile. We tried to get timed tickets for the special exhibition but the only times left were at the end of the day...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5inatent

I recommend taking some of the tours. They are free and very professional.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megandshai
50,So much history/art so little time,Beautiful campus and amazing collection! The Getty keeps exhibits new & interesting. The history of the collections is great - you can have tours or self-guided with audio. The gardens are just as interesting as the art collections. Take at least 4-5 hours. Definitely going back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hjquinlan
50,A must for your out of town guests,"The Getty Center is not only a great museum with striking architecture, its hilltop location makes it also a great destination for about 4 hours, or half a day. Inaugurated in the 1990's it has mostly European decorative arts, some statues, a few impressionists and samples of Asian art.The entrance is free but the parking is a steep $15, worth it if you don't come alone. After parking you take a short train ride to the main entrance which used to be very pleasant with multiple fountains, but unfortunately because of the ongoing Southern California drought, the fountains have been turned off. Nevertheless, this is definitely not a stuffy museum, it is airy, accessible and because it's relatively small you are not overwhelmed by all the art. Definitely leave some time for the beautiful gardens perfect for selfies and pictures with great views in the background. Best time to visit is in the afternoon towards sunset when it's not too bright outdoors and the sunsets are usually spectacular.Finally I strongly recommend the Getty for a meal whether in its cafeteria with a view or the dining room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DariusLA
50,A Must Do When in L.A. Area,"Phenomenal views, wonderful art and outstanding grounds. From the tram ride up to meandering the galleries, a fantastic museum well worth your time to see. If the art doesn't draw you in, the location's vistas will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pukster27

50,What a wonderful Day,"Arrival very smooth, a tram took us up to the Getty Centre...what an attraction. The information briefing is certainly worth listening to before you strike off to visit the various towers. There are four, North, South, East and West. As time was limited we decided that the painting were our top priority. Signs were spot on and we rode the elevator to the 2nd floor. All the towers are connected on this second level so we just walked from one to the other. They supply free of charge an audio system which is really easy to use, you just enter the number of the painting you are viewing and can also get a summary by one of the experts working at the Getty. We also visited the central garden which was a beautiful place to relax after being indoors. Lovely gift shops to buy souvenirs and a variety of different eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loretta22013
50,Fantastic!,"Two of us visited The Getty Center over Labor Day weekend and it greatly exceeded our expectations. There is plenty of parking upon arrival and a complimentary tram takes you on a short ride up to the Center. The design and architecture of the buildings are of equal interest to the art within. The collections are beautifully curated. One should plan to spend a full day here, using the café for lunch. The Center is immaculately clean and easy to navigate.

50,Awesome Garden/Architecture combo!,"Spend a half or whole day here to savor the architecture, exhibits, and gardens - plus the views! All for only the parking fee (so fill your car with family or friends!). I suggest taking the monorail up, entering the main museum entrance and getting a map and info on current exhibits and daily schedule of events. Choose which exhibits you really want to see, rather than walking through all the buildings and getting burned out. Visit those exhibits and be sure to go to the second floor of the building on the Southeast corner, then head out to the balcony walkways to enjoy the views. Continue West (walking to your right if you are facing South, towards the ocean) to the next building. You will see a fantastic cactus/succulent garden on the hill below you. Continue to the last building (farthest West), the go inside to enjoy the permanent exhibit, then downstairs to see the current photography exhibit (unless that is not your thing). From there head out the door, then turn left to go down a descending, switchback walkway through stone walls with periodic views. This will bring you to the seasonally changing gardens. If you have time, go left and meander in the maze, then relax and sit on the lawn for awhile, before heading up the zig zag walkway through a variety of foliage, crossing a stream lined with incrimentally sized boulders. At the top of the path, notice the hollow half of a large urn in the wall. Then go up the stairs to the entry level, walk to the left to see where the stream begins and follow it to the edge, where it flows into the urn. Note that due to the drought, the water may not be flowing. For lunch (or dinner) the cafe and restaurant are both very good. You should make advance reservations if you want to dine at the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tovya

The staff were most kind to point it out to usThe gardens were my favourite with colourful flowers and plants and lovely fountain.I do recommend the free tours led by volunteers. We went on the architecture tour and it was most interesting! Pity we did not have time to do the highlight tour. The tours run through out the day.Umbrellas are a/v on site if you find the sun too glaring, as most of the garden in exposed.Collection wise it is a bit mixed. I suggest if you are not a frequent music tour, to do the highlight tour, or do the audio guide highlight tour, or just browse the collections you are interested in the most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicapui
50,Beautiful museum,Great overlook of the city given its position on the hill - fun tram ride from parking brings you up to museum- which are 5 bldgs with different exhibits - also very nice garden area - the architecture and views provide lots of photo opportunities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewb500
50,Brilliant day out,"I'd read a lot of positive reviews about the Getty Centre on TripAdvisor so I had high hopes - and I wasn't disappointed. It's a lovely place for a day trip. The galleries are home to some world renowned art work from the likes of Van Gough, Manet, Degas etc. which are amazing in themselves, and the setting is beautiful. The gardens are pristine with plenty of photo opportunities plus the cafe serves good food at a reasonable price. Al in all, a brilliant day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KP8886
50,Driven past?...,"We have driven past The Getty Centre many times on our visits to LA. Through the powers of the internet we finally googled it to find out what it was.

50,A great day out in Los Angeles,"The imposing nature of the Getty Centre is something to behold. From the underground parking lot through the tram ride up to the gallery spaces to the exhibits and gardens themselves, this place is not to be missed.15 dollars to park the car and the rest comes for free. Gardens, artwork, cafe and restaurant all leave a truly lasting impression.The generosity and legacy of Getty is truly mind-blowing.If you visit both sites on the same day you pay just $15 ..... yes $15. What's not to like!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlg759
40,Amazing position up in the hills,Our first visit and incredible venue. The views from the garden were breathtaking and the garden incredible. A new exhibition called London Calling was being shown which was of great interest to us as we were visiting from the uk. And all for free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mella642016
40,Relax Your Way thru the Center,"Don't get amped up thinking you have to schedule a tour, be first in the gardens or make it in time for anything. This place is best experienced just sauntering around pointing at things and sitting outside in the breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveljuggernaut
50,"Breathtaking, Inside and Out","I’m from Los Angeles but had never visited The Getty until this past weekend, when I was knocked over by this white marble castle on a high promontory overlooking the west side of town. A whole WALL of Rembrandts! Van Gogh, Monets, Manets, every one a gasp of recognition, and all assembled in a series of buildings under a cloudless blue sky with views that stretch to the sea. Oh what I have been missing all these years! And The Getty is free... all you have to pay is parking. If you’re in L.A. stop reading this and GO, go NOW.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paigeturner2

Love this place, it's a must do when in LA before any other museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3464JTsandrar
50,Fantastic Place,"Amazing architecture by Richard Mier, one of the so called NEW YORK 5. Artwork by the masters and the outdoor garden is a must see. You will do quite a bit of walking as the center is composed of more than 5 buildings with a lot to see in each one. Start at the top floor with the late 1800's art and work your way down the floors through the photo galleries and antiquities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwhames

The architecture is fascinating, the garden is relaxing and charming, the exhibitions are top notch and the food in the cafe varied and tasty.I will never tire of visiting this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagriccia

50,Museum and more,"One of my favorite places to take out of town visitors. Beautiful architecture and a variety of permanent and temporary exhibits generally have something of interest for every age. The outdoors is great for small children because they can run around and thee gardens are lovely. You can eat snacks and they also have a great little restaurant.The museum is free but parking is $15 per automobile. However, if you go to this location as well as the Getty Villa in Malibu, the $15 covers both if done on the same day.The Getty Villa is also magnificent, especially the gardens and view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthC78
50,Relaxing fun day trip,"Being a native LA gal, it's nice to visit this museum whenever I have out of country or state guests looking for a tour of LA. Unless you are an arts fanatic, 3 hours should be more than enough time to spend looking around at all the buildings and taking pictures in the garden. The view here is amazing. Must bring a camera to capture so many different angles and backgrounds of the architecture, gardens and city views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/410christyl

50,A great place to visit,The venue - architecture and grounds are just beautiful. They were as much of a good experience as the exhibits. Spent a long time wandering the buildings and the various landscaped features. The special exhibitions were first rate and were displayed and explained satisfactorily. The cafe at the Getty was a great place to refresh ourselves and provided an economical and varied menu. Probably the only minor irritant was the onsite parking. Some signage explaining the position of vacant spots would help.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryq848
50,Amazing att nucleous,"It's an incredible beauties concentration. The building is itself a artistic piece to be apreciated. The gardens, with a bautiful design of the species and distribution in the flower beds is a spectacle.Inside the building we found a collection of art pieces of the most significant artist of the last centurys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/130andr_b
50,Outstanding Location for a First Class Art Museum,"This was my first visit to the Getty Center and I was amazed at its remarkable size and location in the Santa Monica Mountains, high above Los Angeles. There were more buildings and overlooks and gardens than I had thought. It was also great that admission was free. All I had to pay for was parking, which was $15. Even the tram ride from the parking garage up to the Getty Center was free. I only had time to visit one sight while traveling through Los Angeles, and visiting the Getty Center has been on my bucket list since it opened several years ago. I'm very glad I spent the time to see it. Getting to the museum in Los Angeles is a bit of a problem since the freeways are so full of traffic that it was bumper to bumper for miles on the Ventura Freeway, and then on I-405 going through Sepulveda Pass through the Santa Monica Mountains. I exited onto Sepulveda Blvd. which led to the access road under the freeway to the Getty Center. The parking garage is underground and I had to go down 6 levels before I began to see vacant parking spaces. An elevator took me up to the street level where you board a shuttle tram that winds its way up the mountain to where the museum is. Once you arrive at the top you find that the Getty Center looks like a modern college campus. A map is provided so you can find your way around. I discovered that the Getty Center, is not just a museum, but also supports art around the world, and is active in preserving art from various locations in various countries. There is quite a bit of walking and going up and down stairs to reach the artwork, such as the paintings, sculptures, and the special exhibits. The stunning view of the surrounding mansions on the mountainside, and the view of the Brentwood area of Los Angeles down below is what I remember the most. There is a lot to see here, and 2 hours is not enough time to really cover it all. I was very impressed, and I would say the Getty Center would be one of the top 10 places to visit if you come to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TallTexWally
50,"Great attraction, great architecture with amazing views of LA",The Getty Center was on my tick list and I wasn't disappointed. You pay for parking but other than that the Getty Center is free! From the car park there are free rides to the museum. We spent around two hours there and I would also recommend going around the gardens and check out the views of LA. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrickyTrevLondon
50,Stunning building and view plus amazing art work,This was the first time i had been there. The building itself if stunning. There are also lovely gardens and a cactus garden. It is easy to get to. You pay for parking but the museum itself is free. There are many outdoor places to sit and relax between viewing the collections. It's a true gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaylP_13
50,This location needs 2 days of your time. At least one whole day,I love coming here. It's crazy to me that you can bring a car load of people to experience what is available here for 15 bucks.Everytime I come back I see something new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baldie_Pauldie
50,Beautiful experience,"Special place - the Getty Center is a combination of beautiful architcture, priceless art and ingenious garden design. Tram from parking area is very modern and lifts you out of the mundane into the unexpected.....enter a couple hours of sheer beauty. Best time to visit is Spring for the gardens of course. But year round you will not be disappointed. Take your time with the art, but also with the spectacular Los Angeles views and garden. Be sure to go to the Orientation video before starting your tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenna77

50,Must Visit LA Cultural Landmark,"One of the largest and most popular museums in Los Angeles. Unique architecture. Great exhibitions and sections. Excellent for art lovers. Usually hosts events on Friday, but remember to sneak in the wine ;) Quite a trek to drive and then take a shuttle, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAlen
50,You should go!,Give yourself at least half a day there is so much to see. And go twice!Plenty of underground parking ($15) and a cute shuttle that takes you up the hill.

There are plenty of dining / snacking options too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR-Greenwich

The Getty center outdoor gardens are beautiful and peaceful the views are all captivating from all directions. Dining is a bit limited but thats not why your there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripTip101
50,Beautiful views and gardens!,"Went for an afternoon visit with a friend who has been to the Getty twice before and I was impressed with not only the modern architecture of the buildings themselves but the garden layout was quite interesting and the variety of plantings was very colorful. I also commend the people who run the Getty for their organizational skills,all common areas were clean and tidy. I recommend any of the free tours that are offered,very informative. Complimentary use of umbrellas while visiting the grounds was a nice touch and a welcome one in the hot and sunny Southern California weather! Best of all.... though parking is 15 dollars the museums and gardens are free to enter!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARodriguezP
50,Money well spent!,"We finally got a chance to visit both the Getty buildings. What a treat! No ""water features"" to save on water but everything was gorgeous non the less. Be sure to take your parking ticket so you can go to the Malibu location for the same admission. Someone picked out wonderful marble for the walls! Great displays of all the art. Fun to take the tram up/down the hill next to the infamous 405!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2507YEdavidn
50,The real LA,"The center and garden are great. View from there is fantastic. There is a parking lot: $ 10 and also a tram which will take you all the way up. Even if you are not interested in art, it is worth to see the garden, the city and also the center itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41sladjanaa
40,"Go for the views, landscape, and architecture - the art collection is a bonus","I grew up in L.A. (before the Getty was built) and had never visited until now. I visited expecting a great art experience. To my surprise, the major attraction was the landscape, the architecture, and the view. I commuted for years in the area (as a UCLA student) yet I was still in awe of the visual experience. The site is awesome and very well maintained - worth a visit. Oh, and the art collection. Well it's very nice - but doesn't stand up to comparison of the best art museums we've seen. If you're after a great art experience - there are other options in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gosaka
50,A Must See,"Has been several years since I visited the Getty, but I have never forgotten what a wonderful place it is.The interior holds great displays, worth the trip alone.The view of LA and its surroundings are a treat to see, from that vantage point!

All for free.You just have to pay the parking (if you go by car).The fun begins at the entrance, when you take the train to the top of the mountain.They also have many guide tours and activities for kids and family (also free).Great place to spend the day! And to come back many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielaW661
40,A good weekend visit,"It's a great way to spend a day if you want a break from your regular weekend routine. No entry fee but the parking is $15. There is a tram ride from the parking lot and it went well even though the lines were long the wait wasn't.The exhibits were good but I thought the paintings were just okay. The Pasadena Museum has much better artists and paintings so I was somewhat disappointed. There was a photo exhibit by a gay artist that was not so good. His portraits were okay but kids walking through his gallery looking at his buddy's bare dongs is not okay.We ate in the cafeteria and I had the hamburger (avoiding the hot dogs) and it was priced as expected for a captive customer (around $15). If you want to bring your own lunch know that there are not a lot of places to sit and eat. Bring a blanket and back pack.The grounds were beautiful and there is a story about the conflict between the architect and the garden designer that you'll have to hear during the tour. Oh, and you can get the audio self guided tour and I believe it's free or near free. That's the best. Overall we liked the trip because it got us off the couch. I wouldn't go back for aesthetic reasons. I may return if I have company visiting and it's of interest to them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_Phil_1

50,Dont forget the free getty guide,"Make sure to get the free getty guide device and headset at the plaza entrance. I saw a lot of people without it and i think that it makes the experiece several times better and is not to be missed. If pressed for time, checkout the highlight tour in the device. But plan atleast 3-4 hours to enjoy all the art, the garden and the fantastic views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171rizwani
50,Picnic with a view,"A hidden gem of The Getty Center is that they don't mind if you bring in your own food and drinks (as long as it's not alcoholic) and have yourself a beautiful picnic on the lawn or a table for next to nothing! The artwork here is obvious. You don't need me to tell you that, but pair it with a perfect homemade pasta salad and boom, it's a date!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harlow10
50,Outstanding Experience,"We had a wonderful time at the Getty Center. I would suggest arriving early in the day and getting a schedule of docent led tours. They have several tours throughout the day and the they heightened our understanding of the art and the center. The architecture of the center is lovely and the views surrounding it were breathtaking. If you are visiting LA, I would put the Getty Center at the top of your to do list. A big bonus--there is no admission charge. My only negative--the veggie burgers in the cafe seemed to be made out of beets (bright red and a bit odd).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mhkmhr

Beautiful place to be and thing to do on a hot LA summer's day. A true aesthetic treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6027VHmarias
50,Amazing Gardens and Art exhibits,"Beautiful gardens that literally pull you in to explore further. We walked through all the beautiful flowers and the creek running to the pond below is very relaxing. Benches distributed throughout in shady spots where you can sit and just enjoy the surroundings. The art exhibits were extremely interesting and if you engage any of the ""ushers"" stationed throughout you can learn many of the hidden treasures one might not otherwise find! The staff was extremely well versed on the history and current programs associated with the center. Very enjoyable visit and if you would like some extra exercise skip the Tram and hike up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JungleJym55

50,"A magical escape, a valuable art lesson and cultural experience","Getting to the Getty by public transportation, as I did, is a bitof a challenge: no it is a TOTAL challenge, but it is reallyworth it and you can always use a ride service. The point isto arrive fresh and eager because you will be delighted andperhaps even overwhelmed, by the largesse of the GettyFamily and the intelligence behind the exhibits-as well asthe depth and contrast which each presents. I can also recommend the Cafe: it is very well priced and you canactually have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which isbetter than good at the bargain price of $2.25. But you comefor the surroundings, which take you away from your cares andtribulations and for the Art which is incomparable. Why go to Europe when you can go to the getty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
50,It's like a building in the skies,"I loved the getty centre, their motto is ""gettyinspired"" and it truly is an inspirational place, from the tram station, to the gardens and all the buildings they surround, it's just a very peaceful, thought inducing place. It is a MUST see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelag115

50,Go even if you don't like museums,"You park your car and then take a tram to the top of a hill (mountain? I don't know) where Mr. Getty had this magnificent campus of buildings constructed. The views and gardens are breath taking. There are art museums (that I think are free), cafes, and museum stores on top here. We did not have time to go inside the museums, but looked at the sculpture outside and walked around. It was glorious. Parking was $15.00, but we didn't pay for anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitarachel

40,"Great Art, Awesome View and Great Place!","The Getty Center is one of the most interesting places to visit in L.A.It is located on top of a hill and the views are awesome. The architecture and the facilities are awesome. Make sure you have time to visit the gardens and always plan for at least 3hours to see everything and get you enough time to enjoy. This place is a big Art museum/gallery and it has great pieces there and collections. They offer guided tours but I recommend to go with the self guided tour, just make sure you get there early and ask for an iphone and a pair of headphones for free so you can listen to some recordings from curators and experts talking about the pieces, this way you control the time and the route (Note: you'll be ask to leave and photo ID once you request the audio devices). Entrance is free, you just have to pay for the parking space ($15 for the whole visit).Once there you can take picture of pretty much everything however, in some galleries and sections you're not allow to do it. You can always ask the security personnel in every room, they are always watching since the art is actually in front of you (don't touch anything tough). They have everything: greek, renaissance, realism, asian, religious and modern and some special exhibitions.Take some good photos of Los Angeles's landscape from all the decks and terraces they have... it's awesome!Also, it's always good to check the website looking for special exhibitions and events, working hours, they have different stuff thru the year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChoxU

50,A Great Environment to View Great Art,"The Getty's collection is strong on both European and Modern art, with special treats in Impressionist period. There's a lovely, non traditional garden at the bottom of the hill, with water features, and a walking path through interesting plants and flowers. The restaurant is expensive, and a bit over rated, but the cafe is pretty decent, with nice variety, although a bit expensive as well. There's a really good gift shop in the main building, as well as smaller ones in the other exhibit areas. You pay to park but not admission. I advise you to try 10:00 am on Sunday as you most trouble free smooth visiting time. You can breeze in, see it all and then have lunch before the crowds hit. Another option would be to see it yourself first, and then sign up for a guided tour for the area you're must interested in later in the day. Most of the art is traditional, but the buildings and setting us modern and airy! You'll like it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlelena

50,Great place to visit - beautiful and serene with spectacular views of the LA area.,"The Getty Center sets on a hill above the Los Angeles area with views of cities and ocean. The architecture of the buildings is exquisite - contemporary with a lot of use of various stone which make the buildings become art. There are several pavilions filled with art from various periods, a lovely restaurant for fine dining, a cafe with several selection options and kiosks on the grounds for a quick bite to eat or drink. The gardens are my favorite part of the setting, including sculptured gardens, a waterfall, and a wide variety of plants presented artistically.It is free with $15 parking. You park below in a parking lot and take a tram to The Center. Be sure to browse the gift shops. I especially loved the Children's gift shop as I found several ""must buy"" items for my grandchildren. It includes unique items.We spent 4 hours there and never ran out of things to see and do. We didn't come close to visiting all the art pavilions. It's a place to just ""hang out"" for a few hours and leave the hustle and bustle of life behind and enjoy the beauty and serenity of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArleneB435

20,Highlight tour ruined by attitude,"We visited the Getty centre having been advised by old valued friends of it's beauty and architecture, and both are true. However, as sometimes happens, the visit was ruined by a member of staff, I felt was either ill advised or had a poor attitude. We desired to use spoken guides for the tour, and provided photo ID, we were then asked for a phone number of our hotel. As we had only arrived the previous evening, we did not have it to hand and were told by the young woman (she knows who she is) to go to the info desk, look it up and then return for the device. How ridiculous. When I did speak to the kind lady at the info desk she stated that she had never heard of this requirement and was shocked at our treatment. I volunteer at an English Stately home and would shudder to think I treated a guest in this manner. As the Getty was so beautiful we had intended to return the next day as well. This may seem petty but the visit was ruined by this person and I would never recommend anyone to visit. If the Getty staff wish to answer this can we have a personal reply and not one of your stock answers? Poor show ruining a much anticipated visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weemango

40,A museum with vistas,"This is a museum experience different from many others: the museum is divided into several buildings, and there are gardens and areas to enjoy views of Los Angeles interspersed around the museum's grounds. I enjoyed the exhibits and art collections very much. While many people come here for the views, I found the quality of the collections to be very high – so don't miss out on the museum itself while you are here. Of course, there are excellent views of the city on clear days here as well. The only challenging thing is getting into the museum: on busy days, there may be lines to get into the parking garage. I would suggest going at less busy times if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zinear

50,"The Getty was excellent, the tour with Tours4fun was not a tour, just a transfer","I had booked the J. PAUL GETTY MUSEUM tour for today 09/16/2016. The Getty was perfect but do not ever book a tour with Tours4fun because:1. They picked me up 20 minutes later than what it was writtebn on my ticket (they said it was heavy traffic but this was no excuse, they should have started earlier, they know about the traffic, I was standing in front of Roosevelt Hotel without having anywhere to sit for twenty minutes2. They took me all the way from Hollywood blv to the airport which took more than hour and then back to the Getty Museum which was nearer to Hollywood and not to the airport3. And the most important is that my ticket said I had booked a tour not just a transfer. A tour means you have sb with you to explain various things about the place you are visiting. Instead the driver just drove us to the parking of the Getty without giving the slightest information. I could have gone there on my own and not pay 55 dollars for a transfer.4. The drivers did not speak American, they could not understand everything and therefore gave wrong answers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiaa833
50,"The #1 rated thing to see in all of L.A., Calif.","The Getty is a must see for anyone visiting the Los Angeles area. There is the city center in LA and the villa in Malibu. See both.

Very impressive permanent collection. Also a big art research center.The building and the garden are a great complement to the exhibition pieces.The Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris seems to draw heavily on the Getty Center.If you're in California, go to San Francisco and Yosemite first, and next consider the Getty Center.

I also enjoyed the art. The cafe on site had great food and was reasonably priced.Tips - expect quite a bit of walking and stairs/elevators.

We stared wit h the architecture tour giving a history of the creation of the buildings making up the centre and then the garden tour giving similar for the garden and general plant choices and architecture.We are glad we did these first as they gave us a real insight into the place which helped as we wandered around later.The only other tour was the highlights tour which was simply excellent and gives a potted history to some of the pieces in the centre. It was rally informative and really brought alive the pieces.My wife and I are not familiar with art, architecture or landscaping and so these tours were simply excellent and delivered by enthusiastic and knowledgeable people. They really added to our enjoyment of the whole centre.The views from the centre were drubbing as was a writhing in it. The attention to detail is phenomenal.We we worried that not being familiar with art this attraction would be something that would not interest us or be interesting enough. We could not have been further from he truth and spent most of the day there.The Getty centre have it all absolutely right. Well done on a world class attraction.If I coils give 6 stars then the Getty centre would easily at it.Do yourself a favour and visit as the first thing you plan for LA.

20,The Getty Villa,The villa and gardens are beautiful. We took the architecture tour. Our tour guide was not so good. She didn't seem to know what she was saying and kept changing her story. Maybe it was her first day. It was free so I can't complain too much. It was a little boring and ackward but the tour was less than an hour. We prefered walking around on our own after the tour. The art was cool and the views were nice. All in all it was a nice way to spend an afternoon with family and/or friends.

50,simply outstanding. must see museum and grounds,First visit but must say the museum's approach compared to most other museums is very refreshing. The differences- other than paying for parking $15 per car; there are no other financial obligations unless you choose to eat on site or by something from museum store. Audio equipment is free as is museum admission.Great art in appealing facilities with beautiful views and gardens.Hard to believe everyone in So California has not been to this museum. Would be a great place to impress a date.Any visitor to LA should plan to visit. Probably weekdays would be better as less crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillieMacfan

50,More than a day...,"If you're like me, three hours is about all the museum time I can enjoy at one time. But, these exhibits and grounds deserve more time! We broke it up with lunch (reservations recommended) high up at the restaurant. The view was terrific, the food less than ordinary. Go with the Cobb salad. The mussels and clams recommended was served in a carrot soup, tasted right out of the carton. The prices were high and the standard was low. If you don't mind a bit of wind, they will give you a blanket to throw over your shoulders so you can dine alfresco.I vote museum, yes, yes- restaurant, no.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenhK136XN

50,Must see,"Not only is the artwork within the gallery amazing, but so is the view and the garden. You have to pay for parking, but not for admission, so load your car up with a couple great friends and bring a picnic to enjoy on the lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamburke27
40,"Beautiful gardens and art works, but poor for children.","Really enjoyed the building, gardens and artwork but the information and content available to children could be so much better. The 'art detective card' that was available consisted of trying to find four things in the entire museum. There's real potential for improvement here. We didn't try the audio guide which may have offered something for the younger members of the family but other than this there just wasn't much there to catch their imagination and make the most of the artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airielb
50,Fabulous,Second visit and it always delivers. The current exhibition was excellent and the rest of the halls are a delight to wander through. The best views of LA for a $15 car park or catch public transport and it's all free. This is outstanding for the whole family. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillM232
40,Feels like visiting Europe,"Fantastic and totally free museum, located along 405, open almost the whole week, just need to pay the parking fee $20. Metro Bus service is available.The building architecture and gardens are awesome , the exhibits are great and the views are as scenic like Griffit Observatory. Lots of paintings and artwork from all over the world. Restaurant and gift shop are available.Its a must visit for tourist and locals 😍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dongmelon
40,Worth a visit,"We took a couple of friends from overseas to the Getty's museum to see the new display of the ""Cave Temples of Dunhuang"" . The quality of the exhibit was excellent. We also enjoyed the flower garden very much. There was no entrance fees. The parking ticket was $15 . It is cheaper after ~3PM. We were there on a Saturday and the place was not too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken-from-Kalifornia
50,A great way to play hookie for a day,"This was hookie day for my wife and I. Monthly we try to escape for a day to explore and relax. Amazingly, after living in SoCal for 16 years, this was my first visit to the Getty.The art is very good and well-presented. Without feeling overwhelmed by the art, the collection lets you see and appreciate each artist. And by arranging them by time-period, it lets you see them without comparing them to other times.I think it would be worthwhile to visit at least once every year or two.Must see the gardens. They have a wonderful shaded lawn area where several families were having picnics. What a wonderful idea. Our next trip, lunch will be a picnic in this luxury setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlust1954
50,Something to enjoy for all ages and interests,I wasn't familiar with The Getty Center prior to my visit and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The grounds and exhibit are all beautiful and interesting. We spent several hours here and could have spent the entire day. Absolutely beautiful and well-designed in every way. We all loved it and can't wait to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GigiATL
40,"Dazzling architecture, mediocre art","The Getty Center is a great visit ... the building architecture, grounds, general site up on the hillside and view on a clear day area all truly amazing. But if you are visiting to see great art, you will be disappointed unless they have a special traveling exhibition. The Getty reminds me of the De Young in San Francisco -- both are amazing museums where the building vastly outshines the art collection it houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLaird
50,Exquisite in Every Way,"Getty Center is one of my Top 5 places to visit- including international venues such as the Acropolis Museum in Athens and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. TheCampus is gorgeous, both the permanent and traveling exhibits wonderfully selected and displayed, not to mention the gardens, vistas etc. When you enter the parking garage on crowded days, you'd think the crowds would inhibit enjoying the Center- but not so- crowd control is so well done you hardly notice how many (international) people they accommodate comfortably. We have gone weekdays first thing in the morning and after lunch, and most recently mid afternoon on a Saturday in Aug (peak season) and have enjoyed every experience. For an added bonus, have a meal in the restaurant (RSVPs preferred) for stunning views and a perfect way to cap the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/576maryanns
50,Beautiful place and beautiful paintings,"Really nice complex, I liked to take the tram to go uphill, you can stroll through the buildings, there are flowers everywhere and the paintings were beautiful. We also visited the reconstitution of ancient China's caves. I definitely recommend it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisBodmr
50,Great afternoon escape,"The Getty Center is an amazing place, from the art to the grounds. It is a great way to get out of the city while staying close to the city.Its just off the 405 heading north out of the city, a quick Uber ride or quick drive. They have ample parking,I think its 5 dollars to park. Then its a quick tram ride up to the museums impressive facade.Spend the day walking the grounds, and seeing the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdodgerun
50,The Best Way to See LA,"Not many museums in America are free these days. At the Getty you'll the best views, amazing architecture, beautiful garden walk and endless galleries of art work spanning centuries. Highly recommended. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WildReedNLA
50,Beautiful place to visit and best of all - free!,"Family trip including adults, teens and smaller kids. parking was easy enough think it was about $12 but this was in a car park over the road to the entrance as the official one was full.Tram ride up from the road entrance to the main entrance, amazing views, beautiful gardens, so many exhibits and things to see and do, gift shops, cafes, such a beautiful space; so nice to be somewhere so peaceful even when it's busy.You could spend all day here, highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodegirl77
50,"Beautiful art collections, beautiful architectures and beautiful garden","I was always skeptical about an art gallery in Los Angeles, but boy was I wrong about this one! My wife and I made a trip here only when we didn't have better places to go in the area, and because of the 莫高窟 Mogao cave exhibit. But the trip was more enjoyable than we expected.The tram trip from the parking lot to the actual gallery was very pleasant. You can get a great view of the crowded I-5 highway.The views from the center are nice, though not a whole lot to see.The art collections are abundant and very well curated. I could spend a whole day here.The small garden is well designed and cultivated.The architectures are very distinctive.The facilities are very modern. I didn't realize they provide audio guide. Next time I'll have to try it.All in all, it's well worth the money and time. I'm coming back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexLee-SD
40,"Fabulous spaces, exhibits uneven","Just a gorgeous setting, inside and esp outside. The permanent collection is not great, but improving. The special exhibitions can be wonderful, notably the recent Italian bronzes. The works on paper in the archives building are real treasures and those exhibits should not be overlooked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomeTheSecondTime
40,Free whole day event,This place is stunning and the best part about us that it's free!Definitely do all the tours if possible as I found all the guides highly informative and proffesional.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7975SIjamest
50,amazing place for art and culture,"This was such a great visit. Having been to many museums all over this is unique in that different collections are in different buildings on the ""campus."" this made it fun and you dont get the same kind of museum back ache or headache that you can get in large museums. The 6 Rembrandt paintings were a highlight. The van gogh iris's was special too. I had to rush the visit and will go back. Leave plenty of time to park and get up to the museum. I had to go down 5 levels in the garage and then walk down the hill as there was a 20 minute wait to get the shuttle train down. Beautiful city and ocean views. a magnificent setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
50,plan a full day and take the tours,"I'd been here before for a few hours, but only by staying this time from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. did I feel I really saw the place. There are 5 buildings with permanent collections, one with a temporary exhibit, and then there were Buddhist reproduction caves (leaving soon). I took three tours: Highlights (a bit idiosyncratic, as the docent picks his or her own four favorites), Garden (more interesting than I thought), and Architecture (the absolute best--more about the materials and setting). In between I had time to see most of the galleries. Regarding food, there's a higher-priced restaurant, a cafe overlooking the garden (but with relatively few food choices), and a larger cafe with many food stations and some terrace seating outside. I'm glad I chose the latter. The vermicelli-shrimp-veggie dish at the Asian station was excellent, and I actually enjoyed the mountain view from the back terrace more than the other cafe's view.My main recommendations are to leave enough time, and to do the architecture tour. Also, if you're up to it, walk rather than take the tram (0.75 miles each way). At least walk downhill. Gives a great sense of this area's topography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerseyjazz
50,Stunning!,"I visited The Getty with my husband, nineteen-year old son and his friend. We went only knowing that it was a world famous art gallery that covered several buildings. (Note that we appreciate art but are not well educated in it).The Getty is this on the surface but much, much more. The collection of art (paintings, sculpture, photographs and decorative art) is mind-blowing and, by design, stops at the 19th century.We wanted to take the Renaissance tour but there were too many people for it and there wasn't another later in the day. A word to the wise - when a tour lines up jump in or you might get left out.We were able to get in on the Architecture tour later in the day (one of several). I would highly recommend it as it gives you a greater appreciation of the buildings and their construction and what the architect intended in his design.The gardens are not to be missed. Keep in mind that they are not a horticulture collection but, rather, a painting with plants and you will have a better appreciation.We spent approximately five hours at The Getty including time for lunch and we can't wait to go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary0516
50,Exceeded expectations,Massively impressed by the buildings alone for the views and overall scale. This is how more billionaires should leave a legacy. Outstanding art collections too and easy to park and get around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil4eva
50,"Great place, great views","Even if you're not interested in art, it's a great place to visit just for the architecture, the gardens and the views. It's free to enter, you just have to pay for the parking. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryM461
50,If you only see one Art Museum/Centre - make this the one.,"From the time you enter upon the tram ride up the to the Centre - you feel like you are in a space age film. This centre has so much going for it. You will be ""blown away"" by the architecture for a start. Then the Gardens - even if you are NOT a garden person - the sheer scope of design will impress you. Then entering the exhibits - they are so easy to navigate and so well placed and interesting that you will not notice the hours slipping by. It is both a contemplative and a dynamic space. It is everything you imagine a great art centre to be. The catering - outdoor cafes and food are very reasonably priced and cater for a varied palate (including good gluten free range and vegan). And to top this all off - you only pay for parking (a meagre $15 for all day undercover and secure). Must be the best value in LA. This is an all ages space. I saw everyone from one year old to ninety year old marvel and awaken that sense of wonder - you can see it in people's faces as they walk through this very special place. Thank you Mr. J P Getty for sharing your money with the world in giving us this gift. I for one am forever grateful that I came and saw your gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenJ776
50,Outstanding grounds and art,"The only payment is parking... $15. The entry to grounds and huge rooms filled with art is free. All gorgeous!

They also have a cafe with a massive terrace to grab lunch that was reasonable price wise $15 massive sandwich & drink and you get great views over LA . The only issue is it's a pain to get to without transport.

50,Nice venue overlooking LA,On the hills overlooking LA. We have a short visit ( 90 minutes) as it was closing at 5. Very slick visitor attraction.

50,Put this on the top of your list,"We had only about a full day in LA and surveyed a few locals on how we should spend our time. The Getty was their first suggestion and it didn't disappoint. The Getty is a museum/garden/sanctuary of beauty located just outside of LA (just a $10 uber ride from Santa Monica). It is FREE, just $15 for parking, which you can avoid if you uber. There are several art and history exhibits, but we spent most of our time admiring the contemporary architecture, the gardens, and the best views of LA in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlamFive

50,Adaptable to your needs,"I took my 17 year old daughter for a quick visit over a long weekend trip, and it was great because we didn't have to spend a ton of money or time, neither of which we had! The grounds are amazingly beautiful and the galleries are nicely divided so you can choose your area of interest. We were probably there two hours and it was just right. Sunset is pretty from there, and you should stop at the villa while you're at it. If you go there first make sure to bring your parking receipt with you so you don't pay twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442ginap
50,Grandiose Getty,"This is an extraordinary architectural feat taking advantage of the amazing light and surroundings. The landscaped gardens are stunning and the vision of the architects for the Centre and the Garden so accomplished, artworks in themselves. Great exhibitions and enthusiastic volunteers who love the Centre and exude their pride and passion. I could have spent a whole day there and would go again. This is a 'must see' oasis in a desert full of tackiness and tourist traps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hazeangel64

50,It wasn't my cup of tea,"It wasn't my up of tea but there was some interesting art. I did like more the Getty House, since there was an exhibition at that time, I visited.I am rating it 5 stars because it doesn't meant that just because I did not fall in love with it, it wasn't great. I had a good time at the Getty Center, too. And I loved the plant part of the center. Really interesting :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349anniea
50,Stunning grounds and art,Well worth the effort to spend the day in the Getty. A lot to see but not impossible to take most of it in. Enjoyed the design of the place more than anything. Lots of treats for all to enjoy. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcalkid
50,Best of LA,"This free museum is not only spiritually and emotionally edifying with its many collections of fine art; the place itself is a work of art, and a gift to the people of Los Angeles.Thanks, J. Paul!A must see for every Angeleno and So. Cal. visitor. You only have to pay for parking (which changes all the time; expect to pay close to $20 per car) and food if you buy it. Or you can be smart and bring a picnic basket or ice chest plus a couple blankets and have a picnic on the lawn. There's a coat check station that will hold your basket free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRWagner

50,Will confound your expectations,"You know how the Met in NYC is located right in the middle of everything, with easy walking access and close integration with the city around it? The Getty is nothing like that. It feels like a game reserve, with art instead of rare animals. You park, you ride a train, and you're in a different world for a few hours -- one with a pretty great art collection, fantastic views, really beautiful gardens and a couple of great dining and coffee options. For me (fourth-generation Californian and native Angeleno) it feels like a post-modern reinterpretation of Hearst Castle. If that doesn't pique your interest, nothing will. You should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betteryeti
50,Stunning collection,We spent about 4-5 hours but it was not enough. The art collection is wonderful. The architecture is fabulous. There are so many different galleries and outside spaces to explore. I will definitely return. We had dinner in the elegant Museum restaurant and it was quite tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannaH534
50,"Always a jewel, but especially fascinating now","I love visiting the Getty Museum. It has something to offer just about everyone. A fabulous art collection, great gardens, beautiful views of Los Angeles, interesting architecture, fine dining and great special exhibits and programs. I especially enjoyed my recent visit and seeing the Cave Temples of Dunhuang exhibit. This exhibit recreates exactly 3 caves of thousands located in northwest China along the Silk Road, built between 400 and 1400 and rediscovered in 1900. This is a UNESCO site that is difficult to access by most tourists to China. So being able to explore and visit in Los Angeles is really wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
50,Whole day amazement.,"We had only a few afternoon hours for the Getty Center, and it was evident right at the beginning, that it is just not enough.When you parked the car if you don't use public transport that is also available, (parking fee is $ 15.- and after 3 p.m. is $10.- per car.) use the elevator to get to the entrance level. There is a queue waiting for the train, which goes up to the top of the hill, where the Center is located.My first lovely surprise was waiting for me on the grandiose staircase leading up to the actual Center. Two sculptures were on the stairs, a horrified naked black lady watching a white marble boy holding a frog. He was a welcomed acquaintance. Years ago I saw Charles Ray's sculpture, the “Boy with a frog"" in Venice on the tip of Punta Della Dogana. As I heard in 2013, the Italians removed it for the sake of an old street lamp. What a pity- I thought- and now I was delighted to see it again.Unfortunately, we started our visit, like someone who has all the time of the worlds, and it was too late to realize, that we should have to be selective. For that, we hardly had enough time for the impressionists, and couldn't see the Central Garden at all.Walking from one building to the other one, there are the unruly rocks made by nature or God, and their exciting forms are competing by artists made sculptures. Don't forget to have a look at the stunning view of the valley below and the city in a far distance.If I wouldn't know, that next year we'll be probably back in L.A. and be able to spend a whole day with the treasuries of Getty, I would be sorrowful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkwink

50,A fabulous day out,"We visited on a busy Sunday afternoon in August and took advantage of the slightly reduced parking rate for arriving after 3pm. We did have to queue in the car to go in for 15-20 mins but it was worth the wait.Fun tram ride up the hillside to take you from car park to The Getty included in parking price.Beautiful architecture, amazing views of LA and beautifully tended gardens. We had a very whistle stop tour and would have loved to have stayed longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CornishAdventurers
50,Amazing in outdoor space and indoor art. Really a true treasure.,"Our family was in town for a memorial, and so we had many different ages and budgets. The only fee is a 15$ parking charge. The day was typical for CA,warmer in town but on the grounds of the Getty a perfect breeze.I was concerned with the drought that we wouldn't see flowers-I was wrong!The entire space is really something you could take two days to see all.

Lot's to see thought the maze of buildings (it's easy to get lost), with art suitable for every taste. Bring snacks. There are clean tables and chairs scattered throughout the property when you need a break. Plan on spending most of the day here. Unless you're with kids. Then plan on half a day. It get be a little boring for them. (Although there are lots of Pokemon Go to catch!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WindyCityNomad
50,Yep that's art all right,I'm no artsy fartsy person. We went here because one of our friends really wanted to go and were good sports.

If you're an artist or appreciate art a lot go here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kava-kauboi
50,Company trip,"Everyone that comes to or lives in California, should visit this museum. This place is fascinating. Not only do they have some magnificent pieces of art, but the buildings and gardens themselves are worth the trip alone. Make sure you sign up for guided tours when visiting. Make sure one of those tours concentrates on the construction of the builds and surrounding gardens. Be aware that visiting this museum will last an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davidm497

50,One of Our Top Five Places to Visit Whenever We are in LA,"The Getty Center is free to visit and truly one of the most peaceful and impressive places we have found in LosAngeles. We return every chance we get. You do need to pay for parking but the rest of the day is free as you wander through gorgeous architecture to view art work of the highest caliber. The parking fee is nothing compared to what you receive. This place is a gift. There are impressive outdoor spaces to sit and read, visit or be silent as you enjoy the gardens and views of the city. There are always classic works of art as well as exhibitions that rotate. If you stay for the day, you can bring your own picnic or purchase food. The restaurant we used was sort of cafeteria style but the portions were healthy and clean. There are many options. This is also an interesting place to people watch; all cultures and ages.Though we have normally had no problems parking, this month the parking was full and as the weather was too hot we chose choose to not park off site and walk in. This was a disappointment. If you are going on a weekend you may want to phone the Getty and ask what a safe arrival time would be for parking on site. Enjoy this treasure of a place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wethrivelife
50,One of a kind amazing place,"Several people I know recommended the Getty during my visit to Los Angeles and I am glad I took their advice. It is justly rated the #1 thing to do in LA here on Tripadvisor. I would like to add my voice to the chorus of acclaim. The Getty is an incredible place to spend a morning or an afternoon or indeed the whole day.We arrived a few minutes before opening on a Saturday. We would've preferred a weekday but it couldn't be helped. Anyhow, we were able to park without too much effort ($15 for parking is the only few to get in here, not bad considering). Then there was a bag check and about 10 minutes wait for the tram which took us to the Getty Center.What a place, a mix of architectural elegance and natural beauty blending perfectly side by side. The art collection is very well thought out and contains quality pieces overall even though it is not in the same league as art museums in NYC and Philadelphia. The Getty is more about the whole experience: the art, but also the wondrous architecture, great vistas, and gorgeous gardens. Rarely have I been somewhere which combined both architectural and botanical beauty in one location. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderD
50,Magnificent!,"Wonderful museum with a lot to see. Have a great permanent collection as well as several visiting collections. Among the visiting collections we really liked were London calling, featuring several british artists including Bacon, Frued, and Kassof and Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Buddhist Art . We saw ancient Greek sculpture, art from artists such as Van Gogh,Toulous Lautrec, Monet, and Rousseau. Place is expansive with great garden and views of LA. Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobs448
50,Get Thee to The Getty,"The first time that I visited The Getty Center was years ago - when it had just opened.I visited again last week. It still looks like new, perfectly clean, no signs of aging. Architect Richard Meier's structures still have their allure and simplicity, as before.This time, I spent an entire afternoon, taking my time to visit all of the buildings, and seeing as much of the beautiful collection and special exhibits as I could.Like the Getty Villa, the setting is other worldly. You feel so far removed from the metropolis that is LA, it's a special place. Cool breezes from the Pacific on one side, the hum of LA on the other. Gorgeous gardens, even during a draught!The bougainvillea ""trees"" are phenomenal, a whole other kind of topiary.There are some dining options. I opted for the cafe, which has a nice range of inexpensive food. You can eat indoors or al fresco with views of the surrounding hills, and pesky bees.Getting there can be challenging. I took Uber from Hollywood. They have their own drop off / pick up point by the tram. Getting out would have been very tedious in heavy traffic, so I had my driver take me to Rodeo Drive. It was a lovely ride through Beverly Hills, no traffic. It would have been anti-climactic to sit in traffic after such an awesome experience, it was so much nicer to end it in a lovely place with a glass of champagne.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afazad
50,Amazing,"Art museum yes but even if you aren't into it, come for the views of LA, the architecture and beautiful outdoor seating w greenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katravler
50,A must see if in LA,"The museum at the top of the hill with the view is something everyone should visit. There is art for every interest. I always start in the impressionist wing and work my way back in time. Don't miss the gardens, an ever-changing living piece of art. The tours are worth your time, from the building tour I learned that hitting the walls makes music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wart99
50,Stunning,"You will love the Getty Center. It is part of the museum, which is awe inspiring, but I will just address the outside area.It is so beautiful. There are amazing gardens, flowers, designs, Greco-Roman art, calm places to just sit and relax.The entire Getty Center, including the museum is a must for any visitor to Los Angeles. It is off the 405 Freeway and not centrally located, but not much is in Los Angeles.Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Art at It's Best,"This is an absolutely lovely venue with gardens, art, fountains, and a terriffic view of Los Angeles. I was there in the winter when it had snowed in the local mountains and it was a clear day. The views were stunning. They also revolve their exhibits so you can go from time to time and see new exhibits. The restaurant on site allows you to also have a nice lunch at the venue. This is a great way to spend an afternoon if you have a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83deedeeu

50,Simply Amazing,"This was a surprising stop during my Caravan tour in LA. By suprising, I mean I didn't know how awesome it was. I wish we could've stayed longer than an hour and a half. I recommend 2 1/2 hours or more if you have an appreciation for Greco-Roman art and history. The collection is gargantuan!! The Getty Museum is breathtaking and is a great stop for families, couples or whatever. There will most likely be a crowd, but it's not too bad, because of it size and collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenehalltam
50,Wonderful exhibits,"This place is amazing and free. I could not believe all the exhibits and works of art and there was no entry fee. I only had a few hours and wish I had an entire day. The monk cave exhibits are amazing and it was wonderful to get to go into the caves and truly see the artwork as it was intended to be seen. this is most definitely on my list to go to when I am in LA again, I may plan two days to spend at the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelasiad2016
50,Outstanding,So much to see. Really would be good to plan nearly a whole day here if you want to take you time and see all the exhibits. Such a bargain!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fcpal425
50,Wonderful,"Wonderful! This beautiful and extremely large museum has everything to see. No limits to the taste and feeling of class provided. A great way to spend the day if you have any interest in art. The view and grounds are reason enough to go. Free admission, just pay to park. Its all worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnw273
50,WORTH,I remember going when I was really young so I had to see it again as an adult. Just as aw inspiringly beautiful as I remembered. Coolest attraction in the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesAllen98

50,One of my favorite places in LA,"Hands down, you must visit this place if it's your first or fortieth visit to Los Angeles. Wonderful gardens, an impressive and vast permanent collection, excellent shop and interesting temporary exhibitions. Definitely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boaviagemnyc
50,A modern day architectural and cultural gem,"It is so inspiring that in this day and age a place like the Getty Center could be built! It's scope is so expansive, and it is beautiful in every possible way. The architecture is as stunning as the view of Los Angeles from atop the hill on which it is located. Every detail is, in my mind, perfect, from the ride up the hill on the gleaming white tram, to the gorgeous restaurant with tasty offerings, to the art galleries, to the manicured gardens. One of my favorite ""little known"" facts about the Getty's galleries is that the lighting system was configured so as to mimic the natural light of day in which the paintings of centuries past were painted. Louvered windows in the ceiling open and close with the ambient outdoor light to maintain a continuous level of ""daylight"" in the gallery. A pretty cool system that was invented and first used in the Getty.This is a ""must see"" place, whether you are an art fan or not, the location, the architecture, the gardens, and the overall ambiance make it a worthwhile visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suehI112NO
50,Incredible Beauty,"The Getty had a fascinating exhibit ""London Calling"" along with the DunHuang Cave Drawings. The overall center grounds with its vistas of the city are remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StellaSt_Louis
50,World class art center,"The Getty Center is a complex of buildings on a hill overlooking Los Angeles. Wonderful views and setting for an eclectic collection of paintings, sculpture, furniture, etc. The restaurant offers excellent cuisine and service. A must-see for any trip to CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467bobl
50,A must visit on any LA itinerary!,"From the moment you arrive, it's clear this is not any ordinary art gallery. Yes, the collection is amazing (from the classical to the modern), but the building itself is worth visiting just to experience. Built from the same stone they used in the Colosseum, it is an architectural masterpiece, offering light-filled galleries and special views outside at every turn. Don't forget to walk through the gardens and enjoy the sound sculpture, the bubbling brook with carefully arranged stones to change its sound at every crossing. My family loved it so much, we wanted to return the next day! Oh, and it's FREE!!! (you only pay for carparking)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolync793
40,Nice experience,"You arrive at the 6 floors parking and hardly found a place to park. Then the tram takes over. Getty museum entrance is free (not the parking though). Nice architecture and view. Interesting exhibition including an oustanding sacred arts section, a Van Gogh, a few Monet, Sisley and Manet and much more depending on what you like. Gardens and some sculptures can be seen from the different terraces of the museum. Some special exhibitions are charged. Good experience overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanmouss
50,Understandably Number 1 Attraction,"I would have expected Disneyland to be the first place attraction but when you consider this museum is free (although parking can cost $15) and the artworks are world class, then you can understand why. Getty made a fortune but spent this part of it well. Actually there are two Getty Centers, the older and smaller and original one he opened in 1954 being at his estate in Malibu. Here I am reviewing the much larger Getty Center off the I-405 just north of Santa Monica.We were short on time and only spent about 2.5 hours here which we regret as in that limited time you can only see a fraction of the artworks plus we missed the garden altogether. Plan to spend a whole day here and you might want to come back for at least part of a second day. There are five buildings, each with sculptures and artwork other than paintings on the ground level and paintings on the upper floor. The first South building features European works earlier than 1600, and the second 1600-1700 then the third 1700-1800, the fourth 1800-1860 and the fifth after 1860. If your time is limited its worth planning using the internet to identify which works you want to see, for example Van Gogh's Irises.Apart from the artwork, you ride from the parking station to the museum on a train which gives glimpses of the city of LA below, plus from each of the museum buildings you get magnificent views of the city below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmeem42016
50,a very nice to visit,"driving from L.A. only 30 M.this place is good for whole family.even if you go there for just evening.,a lot of thing to see.Oil printing. antique. But do not forget their sunset view.you will love there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49freddyc
50,Getty Center,"I liked so much the 360 degrees views, the Versailles decorated rooms and the gorgeous classic paintings at the Getty Center!Not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7834TOcristinas
50,Getty Center Visit,Getty center collection is top notch with most renowned artists displayed. The building itself and the grounds are enough to make the trip. Crowds were light on both days I visited but the Dun Huang exhibit was very popular. Entrance to the museum is free but make sure to grab a free ticket for the Dun Huang exhibit as soon as you get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandallF16
50,Beatiful place for both mind and stomach,"Come to see the architecture of the buildings, to mediate around the sculpted water creek, have a picnic on the lawn and yes, see the permanent art collection as well as current exhibitions.The Center also holds free educational lectures and shows movies. On Saturdays, the Center is open late so you can enjoy the sunsets over the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer94
50,A great museum in LA,"Reaching The Getty can be difficult if you don't have a car (but also if you have a car, traffic and parking can be tough, especially during weekends), but it's totally worth it.The Getty is an experience for all your senses: located on the top of a hill, from where you can see from the ocean to Beverly Hills, it has a nice collection of art (don't miss the Upper Level of the West Pavilion, there are masterpieces of Impressionism), with a lot of different temporary exhibitions too. When you finish to visit the Pavilions, go to relax to the Central Garden, take your time and eat/drink something from the Garden Terrace Cafe (but it can be quite expensive!) and go to smell the enormous variety of flowers of the garden. And don't forget to bring, some sunscreen, it can be really sunny up there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filippoc974
50,Wonderful exhibits and beautiful gardens,"A must-see experience while in Los Angeles. Whether you spend a few hours or a full day at The Getty Center, you can see the permanent and special art exhibits, relax in the artful gardens surrounding the museum, and enjoy refreshments from the stands, in the cafe or in the restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriad1
50,I have to go back every year or two.,"It can be a two hour drive each way so we don't visit frequently but it's an outstanding museum and gallery and very well run.The spaces, both interior and exterior, are beautiful in their own right while proving a great setting for the displays.It's a lovely way to spend a day, serene and inspiring. Never fails to remind me of what amazing things people have created and continue to create.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241glennm
50,Amazing,Parking is at a premium at this amazing place. I highly recommend taking Uber or Lyft as they have a designated drop off and pick up location that is very near the train that takes you to the Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spursone
50,"Come for the art, stay for the architecture","We did not plan to visit The Getty during our stay in LA. But after driving past this compelling structure a few times, visible from the highway, we could not resist. We arrived early on a Sunday, and found a 30 minute wait at the shuttle. This was actually a blessing, as we decided to walk up. If you can handle a slow incline for about 10 minutes, skip the shuttle. The walk up is pleasant and easy enough. Once inside, we visited several galleries of the permanent collection as well as the current exhibit of British artists. We enjoyed the eclectic mix of art but were equally enchanted just by being in the space. The Getty is architecturally-inspiring. What a building! The stone, stairways, windows, outdoor spaces, all of it, make you want to linger awhile just to take it all in. We ended up having lunch in the restaurant, which was tasty if a little pricey. But it was absolutely worth it to sit by the window and take in the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabadami
50,Excellent for children and adults,"On a clear Los Angeles day, after a rain, or when there is lots of wind, there is no more beautiful place to see the entire city from sea to mountains.The museum's collection is impressive, but the architecture and views are all part of the experience. Leave one section and walk through the glass hallway to ""cleanse your eye pallet"". The design is brilliant.Find sections designed for education or to interest children. It is a beautiful site and one of LA's top showcases. Eat in the cafeteria or the fine dining, (reserve for the later). You will not be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jashas2014
50,Absolutely Beautiful Museum,The Getty was an absolutely beautiful museum with a picturesque backdrop of Los Angeles. The whole visit was fascinating starting with the tram ride up to the entrance. There are a ton of exhibits in a variety of art forms and it appears to change often. The gardens and grounds of the museum were our favorite part. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262willt
50,A trip Worth taking!!,"The Getty Center Will give its visitor not only the best exhibits views while walking through its galleries but also a great view of LA , while walking through its majestic gardens!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claudiadmcampos
50,"Great Architecture, great day out, Highly Recommended","Was surprised by the amount of European, rather than American, art but was explained by the fact the original Getty didn't like modern art, given the setting and architecture that seemed surprising. Had an amazing day, avoid the middle of the day if at all possible, when coach loads of tourists make it impossible to join the amazing tours that the museum puts on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKRules

50,"A Real ""Must See"" but Don't go on a Tuesday!","I have been to many art museums all over the world, but this one really stands out, so much so that I spent two full days there (and still didn't see everything). The art is accessible, and well-arranged. Unfortunately, my first day there was a Tuesday and traffic and crowds were terrible. The staff explained that Tuesdays are the most crowded day of the week (can't recall why--I think it was school groups or reduced parking or something...) The building itself is a piece of art, and the gardens are really lovely despite the water problems in California that have necessitated the Center turning off the water features. There are surprisingly good food offerings. If you are able, skip the bus that takes you up to the center and walk: it is lovely, and I saw a deer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleBHouston_Texas
50,Perfect place to enjoy by yourself...,"I went there to see the amazing Mapplethorpe exhibit and once again, I was mesmerized by the beauty of the Center itself. Also, every time I go, there's something to admire and rediscover from their permanent collection. They do a fantastic job in keeping and updating the galleries and it is to me, a world class place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558mariaelenav
50,"A wonderful view, and culture too!","We go to the Getty at least once a year. We love the gardens, which change with the seasons, as well as the ever-changing exhibits. On a clear day you can see the ocean and the mountains and all of Los Angeles in between. Furniture, architecture, photography, and paintings can all be found from various time periods and locations There is the Family Room for the kids to explore, so don't leave them out. And admission is free! You can get there by bus, but if you drive your own car, parking is cheaper after 3:00 p.m.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmarchand141
50,Always a pleasure!,"I love the Getty. It is a place to go to for culture and good food. Very relaxing, beautiful exhibits and a bit of a getaway. Parking is easy but you need to call ahead.

50,Splendiferous!,"We visited The Getty Center while visiting LA. It's a top-notch facility where no expense was spared in its architecture, grounds, and, most importantly, its exhibitions.We were able to see ""London Calling"" as the highlight of our visit but were entranced by the views from the outdoor spaces. There are a few lawns that lure you into suddenly wanting to take a nap in the grass...I did just that; it was sublime! I highly recommend it. Admission is free, but there is a $15 fee for parking which drops to $10 after 3pm. I encourage you to arrive early as parking fills up early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuckc2014

50,Fun time at the Getty,My brother and I went here on an overcast day. The crowds weren't too bad and it was very interesting seeing all the art. I'm not a huge art fan but this place has some very interesting pieces. I would recommend it for anyone who is at least 18. I don't think kids would enjoy it much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417donl
50,One of the best West Coast museums.,The vistas overlooking the West Los Angeles basin compliment the galleries of exceptional art within the museum. Plan on taking your time perusing the extensive collections. The Renaissance paintings are truly remarkable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColinPK
50,Dunhuang cave visit,"The caves look authentic and beautifully displayed. The exhibition of related paintings, scrolls and statues are fascinating.

50,Premier attraction in LA,"The gardens alone are worth the visit, along with the tram ride from parking lot to the main campus.

50,GET TO THE GETTY ASAP,"Los Angeles was blessed when the Getty Center was completed and has taken its place in the panoply of five star museums. The collections was wide and varied and change often This is a place you want to visit every 3 months. Good for solo as it's easy to engage in conversation with fellow art lovers. Good for families who want to expose their younger members to art at an early age. Great for couples who can stay for lunch or light dinner/cocktails, watching the sun set over the impeccable gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopem593

50,Free...and fantastic,"Went for a ""field trip"" with one of my children...but was fascinated by the sheer volume of art that a single person (now a trust) has collected. You will need far more than four hours to truly see the entire collection, and for those that are into antiquities, don't miss the Getty Villa in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEvisitorfromCA

It is a treat to have lunch in the restaurant, walk the garden designed by Robert Irwin and the views of Los Angeles are as beautiful as from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allypjc
50,I'm a regular,"Yea, you can go for the art, but you can also go just for the experience of the grounds, amazing city views, the gardens or the food. No need to go in a gallery to have a great day. Very special nights are when bands perform on the outdoor stage on certain weekend summer nights. Sunset views over the Pacific are some of the best anywhere. Watch for those late nite closings. Parking is $15. Museum admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bc511
50,The Caves,"I have visited the Getty on a number of occasions and it is always excellent. The exhibit that I recomment now is The Caves -- an example and explanation of a number of the caves that were developed and utilized along The Silk Road (the ancient route used to travel from Asia to Europe). It includes not only a number of the caves, with explanations of their various enclosures most of which involved Buddha, but there are also additional summaries of concepts appropriate to the time and to those who developed the caves. It was most interesting! I have alread encouraged a number of friends to visit the exhibit and would certainly encourage you to do so. Please remember that the exhibit has a time limitation so you should visit soon. Oh yes, you will always enjoy the regular exhibits and if you have not tried it, I would urge you to have lunch at the Dining Hall--it is quite special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarasG5591ZX
50,The Museum on the Hill,"Great art, two excellent restaurants, on a unique art campus perched on a hill overlooking Los Angeles.

50,Awesome,"A must see. Great views, amazing art, stunning architecture. There is something for everyone here. Get there early and bring a picnic lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLHTraveler22
50,Well worth the visit,"The Getty Center is one of two Getty museums open to the public, this one and the Getty Villa in Malibu. They are very different, and both worth a visit. I've spent a great deal of time at the Villa, which holds the Greek and Roman antiquities housed in a spectacular recreation of a Roman villa, but the Center is the more modern collection, housed in an equally spectacular mountaintop museum with beautiful grounds and view, wonderfully kind and intelligent staff, and an eclectic collection of art and photographs. The Getty, of course, originated as a private collection, and can't rival the long-established museum collections in New York, Chicago or Boston, but they consistently put on very good special exhibits that do rival the best museums in the world. There is no admission charge, which is refreshing, but there is a charge for parking, which you need to reserve, and there is no public transportation to either museum, as is typical with the car-reliant nature of Angelenos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familytraveller31
50,"Getty Center is a ""must"" stop while in LA","This is one of the most amazing collections of architecture and art in Los Angeles. Sprinkled throughout the grounds are peaceful sitting spots, reflecting pools and shady places to view most of the surrounding city. Perched on the top of large hill, I highly recommend using Lyft or Uber to be dropped off at the tram station, the only way to get up and back.There is an excellent cafe with great, varied lunch and dinner menus. Sunday brunch and wine list also available.You can make this an all-day event wandering the museums, gardens, dining and just relaxing with the views of LA.Admission to the Getty Villa is always free but an advance, timed-entry ticket is required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougontheroad
50,BEST Architecture & Views,"OK, so there is much great art in the Getty. It is the architecture of the buildings, the landscape and gardens, and the views from this hilltop property that will blow you away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
50,beautiful place,"The Getty Center is free to get in however you have to pay for parking BUT if you go after 5:00 pm the parking is free. Make sure to take the tours, they are very informative and the docents are very knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marissaf452
50,Spectacular campus,The whole experience was memorable from the tram up to the complex of building and the galleries. But we enjoyed the gardens the most. Lunch was also great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SATXKen
50,J. Paul Getty lives!,"I was always fascinated by J Paul Getty the oil billionaire and read a couple of books about his life. Before you go to the Getty Center read about this man who was such an art lover and took such great care in the way the items that he had collected would be displayed after his death. The architecture of the facility is incredible ...something that Los Angeles is very proud of, and the work you will typically see there is fantastic. This is a must-see on your checklist if you're going to be in Southern California. Also the views from the site are marvelous. Do not miss it because it will add greatly to your cultural experience. The good Lord knows we all need that, I think.Admission is free but parking is expensive --go figure. Who cares!..... it would be worth it at about any price, in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryANulph
40,Great place,Some very well curated European works of art from the Masters.You'll need about 4 hours to see everything properly.Also don't forget to see the garden.The food is expensive so eat before or after but if in LA do go there.The exhibits are free. Only parking and food costs money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalnomadforyou

50,Getty Center,Throughly impressed by the place. The gardens were beautiful and the views were breathtaking. A must see when you're in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasmine_Ee
50,Awesome Museum and Gardens,"We picked a Saturday afternoon to visit the Getty. It was probably the worst day and time given the large crowd. We got lost trying to get there then finally found the parking lot where you park to then get on a tram. We were starting to dread the crowd and think this has been a bad idea, but to our surprise the line moved fast and our visit went very smoothly. Even with a very crowded museum we had a positive experience. We only had a couple of hours so we focused on the European paintings in the West building, and then checked out the garden which is beautiful. We knew going in that we would have to pick a few things to see and leave the rest for another visit(s). Very glad we spent part of our day at the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lebasi10
50,Great Art and Great Views,"It does cost $15 to park, but then you take the tram up to the museum and all exhibits are free. Very good mixture of art. I love the modern art and the photography. Best of all, the views over the garden and out to the coast are spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wannabekauai

50,The Getty Museum,"It is very uplifting experience, perusing thru the most beautiful paintings and furniture in the world! Take a day off to visit! One can have great lunch at the restaurant, and stroll through the Japanese garden in a perfect sunny day! Astounding museum, visit also The Getty Villa in Malibu! Two rewarding experiences! Artsy and delightful paintings from the classics, from Cezane to Rubens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olgalazin
50,Wonderful experience,"When you get there grab an ipod by the entrance to listen to the stories behind the pieces. Loved this museum in every aspect from their friendly staff and service to the ambiance. They have artwork of van gogh, paul gauguin, cezanne(i think!), monet and etc... Absolutely loved this place even the customers here were highly sophisticated. And the interior/exterior of the museum is truly something else! Haven't been to the garden myself but mum says it was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fozb703

50,Wonderful collection. I especially love the Renaissance works.,"This beautiful museum is free, but you must make a reservation. It's setting high above the 405 freeway gives it a beautiful view of the surroundings and there are plenty of open areas where you can sit and relax. The collection is vast and varied and they have many special shows besides. I went with a school group and the students were enchanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillbesharpe

50,Best museum I have ever visited! Definitely worth a few hours,"Perched on top of a hill, The Getty Center is an oasis in the middle of a bustling city. My family is not a museum going family but we read the reviews of The Getty Center and had it recommended to us quite a few times so we decided to give it a shot. When we arrived we were very glad that we heeded the advice we were given , the museum and it's grounds are incredible! This is not your typical museum. With free entry (with the exception of $15 parking) there is no reason not to stop in for a visit.The Getty Center is an amazing place to explore art and architecture. The grounds are incredible, my favorite part of the visit was the immaculate the garden in the center of the museum. The garden itself is a work of art and is worth 30 minutes to an hour of exploring. The exhibit halls are wonderfully curated and educational, featuring a wonderful variety of styles and art movements.I highly recommend a visit to The Getty Center if you are in the LA area for any amount of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaitlynF108
50,"Stunning architecture beautiful gardens, great art , amazing views and free",Just managed to fit this in to a few spare hours in the morning before flying home after visiting LA for a week. Absolutely stunning building and gardens and art and free to visit with amazing views of LA. Only wish we had more time to spend highly recommended and would be top of the list if we return to the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peteyzz
50,The Getty center,Wonderful museum and breathtaking gardens and views out to Pacific Palisades. Also restaurants and coffee shops. The artifacts include bibles written 200 years after Christ. A taxi ride out there in light traffic cost $14. This is a favourite place for us when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaT399
50,Fantastic place,"This place has some awesome views of the city. It was free entry and we were able to see some remarkable pieces of art from some well known artists. This is a place you want to visit while in LA, even for those non art lovers such as myself. I googled one of the picture while i was there and it said it was worth $54 million. I was blown away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjT6325QN
50,"Beautiful museum, great view, super variety of art","From the tram ride to the top of the hill to the beautiful architecture to the excellent collection, this museum is well worth your time. Tip: go all the way down to the 7th level for parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDC72
50,The Space is as great at the Collection,"We loved our visit to the Getty on a hot, sunny LA day. The views of the valley start on the 5 minute tram ride up to the entrance and it's tough to decide which of the creamy white spacious buidlings to start your journey in. Make sure you check out the gardens -- better yet have your cafe lunch out there! Go and go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blevans
50,Amazing Views,"Beautiful gardens, great special exhibits, expansive views, wonderful architecture and that is before entering the art museums. I have even been to some free concerts there. The food didn't work for us - too crowded to serve us at the restaurant and the rest were closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visited49
50,Really nice,"Went there especially for the garden and I was not dissapointed. The whole place is superbly organised, huge and very tranquill at the same time. Although the parking lot was full you could not feel the amount of people that were visiting. The gardens are beautiful, the impressionists section superb. I loved the sculptures. A great start to an LA vist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcekpl
50,World Class,"One of the best museums my wife and I have ever visited.

50,Beautiful exhibits,A top notch center with wonderful art displays and beautiful grounds. Definitely worth a visit when you're in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8244CXericc
50,World- class collection of art,"A must- see for art lovers while visiting LA. This place has it all from paintings to ceramics and sculpture and everything in between. The museum is free- you pay $15 to park, but get there early because space runs out. If you are staying close by, a cab would be reasonable and there is a city bus stop at the entrance as well. Make sure to see the gardens as well. You could easily spend a whole day here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kagatlin
50,So Much to See! A Place to Savor.,"My wife and I went to the Getty Center and Getty Villa on back-to-back days. The Center has an amazing collection of artwork. We spent the full day, and I would still be interested in returning soon. The grounds are beautiful and compliment the collection well. The gardens are worth exploring. They are not huge, but they are well-designed and full of interesting plants. We had lunch at the restaurant, which was a good experience. One additional note, several of the staff members were very friendly and helpful, suggesting things to see and commenting on the art. One closing note: the tram had a 20+ minute wait, so we walked both ways between the parking deck and the Center. It was an easy walk with plenty of shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminH989
40,Brilliant,"A fantastic mix of art and relaxation. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA for a day or morning then make this a must. The views from here are spectacular, and the gardens peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Will0ldham
50,Beautiful Way to Spend an Afternoon,The Getty Center really is special. Once you arrive at the top of the mountain and walk into the museum you feel transported. The architecture is stunning. There are a variety of exhibitions as well as the permanent art collections which are extraordinary. Don't miss the Central Garden. It's always changing with the seasons. The cafe is excellent and the Restaurant is fantastic! you have a spectacular view of the city and the ocean if you have an opportunity to stay for dinner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808kathleeng
50,Highlight of LA,"This is truly an amazing experience - that any visitor to LA should ensure they take the time to visit the Getty Center. Even if you are not into ""art"" - it does not matter, this is one of the most magnificent buildings I have ever been to. It also does house some of the greatest paintings in the world today - where you can see Van Gogh's Irises & a number of amazing Monet's. You cannot see these paintings and not be moved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Jackson_6
40,Very unique overall experience,"From the ride to the center on a tram...to the artistic rendering of patterns in the gardens... to the views of the city...The Getty is a pretty singular experience. That's without even taking the art into account. Actually if the Getty existed as an outdoor park experience without any art museum element at all, I might even like it more.Of all the memorable elements of the Getty, the art is actually least memorable to me. It feels like a marvel in all the other ways I mentioned. I enjoyed the Getty, but If I had the choice to go again to the Getty or not, I probably wouldn't go. If I were a resident of the local area, I would definitely find it worth the time. But as a visitor, I would prefer to spend my time doing something that was more memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ObjectiveWords
50,Superb experience,"A trek out of LA due to the continually congested freeways. Taxi cost $45 each way plus tip from central LA. But well worth it. The Getty Museum is different to the big national museums / galleries in Europe because each piece has been especially selected for its uniqueness and isn't 'crowded' out by larger collections. Despite the full car park and queue for the tram to the museum (from the car park) the galleries at what was peak season did not feel over crowded. The setting is worth a visit as well and then you have the wonderful southern Californian light. Not somewhere for a quick couple of hours. We could have spent the whole day there. One last thing, there's no entry charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexbN2436FA
50,Amazing architecture and so much more,The Getty center was a highlight of our visit to California - excellent museum with spectacular architecture - highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRAHAMMMCFARLANE
50,An amazing must do experience!,I've been to The Getty many times and its always a pleasure. Great place to go if you have out of town visitors on a nice clear day and want to experience great views and a relaxing afternoon. Awesome restaurant - make reservations for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtjLA
50,The highlight of my LA trip,"I'm a museum lover and one of those annoying people who stop to read every single sign, so I barely got to see two buildings before we had to leave.To start, the architecture here is fantastic; an art in itself. The buildings made of limestone are amazing and beautiful against the sunset. The entire complex is set atop a large hill with a jaw-dropping view all around. There's a hovertrain funicular that goes up and down from the entrance to the parking lot at the base. The ride its a great opportunity to see some of the cool views from around the complex.There's a small garden on a lower level where people sit on benches and the lawn. It was an extremely relaxed atmosphere against a beautiful lush background.There was also a small cactus garden out back, where I managed to catch some great silhouette photos.I watched the sun set here and it was probable one of the prettiest I'd ever seen. There were tourists, couples, trees, water, and building all reflecting and silhouetted as the sun slowly crept down behind. It was quite magnificent.I'd love to be able to go back some day and take an entire afternoon to explore the other wings. I'd also live to visit the Getty Villa, which I've heard is equally as beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriah17
50,must see in LA,"This is an attraction, and a place to be, the galleries are intimate, classic baroque, and stunning modern are both at home here. Even without the art, the architecture is magnificent, the Gardens sublime. I envy those lucky enough to work there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normaw806
50,Jewel of Los Angeles,"What more can you say about the Getty... it's free, it has great views and interesting architecture, and that's before you talk about the art -- both permanent exhibits and temporary exhibitions. Heck, even the gift shop is full of entertaining stuff. I really believe there is something here for everyone. I also had an absolutely delicious meal in their main restaurant (not the cafe). I believe the parking charge is reduced after 3 PM as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthPawStyle
40,Van Gogh's Irises now on view,Such a lovely experience. Do not miss visiting the gardens and walk the grounds. A very enjoyable day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oban100
50,Outstanding collection,Varied collections from ancient to contemporary. Worth the trip to spend a day or to see one exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeben818
50,a day at the Getty,My friend I went to the Getty to view the exhibit about the cave paintings in China along the Silk Road. The exhibit was well done and made me feel as though I really was in the caves. We also had lunch in the upscale restaurant which was very noisy and pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/394ever2016
50,Visited the tapestry display,Awesome to see. Very well laid out. The tour was no so good. It was run by a volunteer who didn't really know much. I wish they would offer more training to their volunteer staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tan12jam
50,Unbelievably breathtaking,"Consider the location, the beautiful hilltop setting, the incredible architecture, the wonderful gardens, the spectacular art collections and you just scratch the surface of the power of this place. Oh, by the way, it's free!This is an all day event with no expectations of seeing it all. Take your time and absorb the many sensory offerings and opportunities. You can sit before a painting for an hour if you want or take any number of docented tours. Enjoy the Cafe for lunch.We will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johndstewartsr
40,Great place to visit,"This is a great place to visit, whether its for the art on display, or for the beautiful garden or for the view of LA from the Getty Centre. The Tram ride from the base is also nice. The Museum store also has good stuff to buy.If you are going on a weekend, spare some additional time for the tram ride to and fro as the lines do tend to build up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlokKarande
50,London Calling - superb !,"Temporary exhibition 'London Calling' featuring great painting from the Tate Modern collection, including Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud is a real treat !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/streetMartin
40,Great location,"We visited on a Tuesday afternoon. Traffic was slow getting into the parking garage. From there you take a tram up hill to the museum. The grounds and gardens are beautiful! The collection of paintings was ok. The Cave exhibit was interesting. We had lunch at the Cafe. Prices were high but considering there is no admission fee to the museum, it was understandable. Our teenagers were interested. The adults loved the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8730YMsharonm
50,Fine Art In A Truly Magnificent Venue,The Getty is not to be missed. European Art. Collection is excellent the faculty is architecturally magnificent with fabulous grounds an views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W782WApaulh
50,Awesome View on LA,"Only good things to mention on the Getty Center: The view on the city and the hills, the collection of European paintings, the architecture, the closeness to Beverly Hills and Hollywood and last but not least the free entrance (you pay only $15 for the car). Thx also to our good architecture guide Joanne!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9741ALmikef
50,Spectacular views and gorgeous grounds!,"I would venture to say that the Getty Center is a must-see for anyone visiting LA. Parking is reasonable and the museum is free to the public. You'll take a mono-rail to the top of the mountain and from there you can enjoy spectacular views of the city, especially on a clear day. The picturesque gardens are gorgeous and fragrant. The plantings are fantastic and there is even a rooftop cacti exhibit. Lovely sculptures, beautiful architecture and glimmering water enhancements adorn the property, and there are a good amount of indoor art exhibits, as well. This is a wonderful way to take a break from all of the touristy activities in the city and just unwind. Great for families or visitors of any age. Although there is a fair amount of walking, you can relax and go at your own pace. You can easily spend 3 or more hours enjoying the beauty of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ticcr
40,A nice place presenting art,"Frankly, this place cannot at all compare to the bigger European museums--the latter have had all the time in the world to gather and enhance their collections. Still, if somebody wants to see real art without having to go transatlantic, this is the place. Apart from the exhibitions, the place itself (starting with the train carrying the visitors uphill and later downhill) is awesome. The view of a colibri bird over the flowers was the final and very strong if gentle touch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evgeny69
50,Visit!,"I really enjoyed my visit at the Getty center. The architecture is so cool and you get a really great view over LA. We went on a gudied tour about the architecture, it was quite interesting. We also had some very tasty lunch at the Getty restaurant. I recommend the Getty center even if your not that interested in any specific art/exhibition, because there is so much more to see there (garden, view over LA, architect, great lunch). The entry is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovisawallin
50,Visit the Caves of Dun Huang at the Getty Center before it leaves in early Sept.,"This is an excellent exhibit and it is a great stride toward virtual experiences of far away places. A well designed exhibit. Also take a respite in the gardens at the Center...beautiful, cool running water in a bright environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swauknomad
40,Spectacular views & architecture.,"The Getty is beautifully designed with wonderful views, gleaming white buildings, airy plazas & a lovely garden with interesting water features & dazzling flowers to wander through or sit in to escape the sun. The outdoor cafe was pleasant. The only disappointing part of it was the art itself. It was mostly mediocre representations of major artists. Not terrible, not great. We loved our visit to the Getty, but not because of the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310Andy018
50,I forgot how nice the Getty Center is,"This museum has wonderful exhibits and a beautiful setting on top of a hill. If you are in reasonably good shape I would recommend walking up the hill if the line for the tram is very long. If you are going during the summer tourist season I strongly recommend that you arrive early even before the museum officially opens. We arrived with our car at 9:30am when the parking lot opened and it was definitely worth it. Many people had already parked but many parking spaces were still open. We saw the different exhibits, gardens, and restaurant before the crowds were crazy. When we left at around 1:30pm the crowds and line up of cars were enormous. Also, I have a friend who is a docent and she says visiting the Getty Center late in the day (7pm and after) is wonderful because the crowds are gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Planettraveler
50,Worth spending time,We went just because it in the list of things to do in LA but it was a real pleasant surprise when we got there. The collection of paintings and art floored me. Beautiful all around worth to spend time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victortroyc
50,"Culture, Food and Good Food",We had lunch at the Getty and saw the London Calling visiting exhibit. Both were excellent (although there was a small goof with our lunch with the restaurant was very prompt to address and were very apologetic about). It is a beautiful setting (you feel like you should dress up) and the views of Los Angeles are to die for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJMJanes
50,One of the best,"One of the best museums to visit, and it's free. Parking is not free.Get there early to avoid line ups. Recommend eating lunch on the patio while taking in the vistas.The works of art are worth the long drive up the 405.In all well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzyj905
50,Always something new to discover,"This visit I did the docent-led architecture tour. Our guide was excellent and revealed many interesting facets of the building.While the art works displayed are rather idiosyncratic, as might be expected from a private collection, they are very interesting. Enjoyed the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition immensely.On a previous visit, I found that the main cafe was closed in the early evening. This time it was closed when we were looking for a late lunch! C'mon - that's not quite good enough at one of LA's major attractions! Nevertheless, we did find the healthy salads at the smaller cafe very tasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Simply wow.,One man's ambitious project can provide so much joy to so many. Whether it is the gardens or the paintings. One tip: don't wait for the train but walk. It's less than 15 min for the fit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8335PTalexanderm
40,Great Special exhibits! sun & sky.,"Usually come here for the special exhibits. Love the evening concerts. Recently visited on a hot day to see the ""Caves of Dunhuang"" and the special photography exhibit featuring Robert Mapplethorpe. Needed umbrellas to wait to see the caves. Brilliant sun amplified by the Italian stone. Cave models were dark and refreshing. Liked the actual models best. Close to real feeling of coming into a cave from the desert heat.I have been to Dunhaung in China in 1992 to see the Buddhist art in person. Was very special to see some of the great art without so much travel. Great exhibit! See it!!!After the heat of waiting outside to see the caves, the photograph exhibits were sublime. Saw several including Robert Mapplethorpe: a perfect medium. Great photographs! Love his flowers! Arranged to have a nice lunch at the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,Our visit to the Getty center,"The first declared billionair's museum was very impressive. The visit was free,though they check your bags. The architectural pieces on display were so many we had to rush through. All in all well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rama1004
50,Beautiful & Inspiring,"Excellent. Friendly. Inviting. Inspiring. Entirely recommend even with young children like mine - take time to sketch, it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SIRHC_SENYAH
50,First Visit - Very Impressive!,"Enjoyed midweek visit to The Getty with family. Enjoyed the gardens and exhibits, which change periodically. The transportation system from the parking garage was positive. Admission is free but $15 to park. Or take mass transit if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olinmom
50,Best view of Los Angeles,"If you want to relax in LA, Getty is the perfect stop . The Travertino marble is well used to create a relaxing place with a lot of art inside and good outdoor space . One of the best museum I ever seen .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabioborsoi
50,Absolutely amazing!,"This may be one of the best places we've been to in LA. To enjoy everything that this place offers, one needs to devote a whole day to leisurely appreciate the arts, the gardens and the stunning views of LA. We arrived just before 9:30 am and were directed to a private parking lot across the street to wait for a few minutes. Parking at the garage and taking the tram were easy when you come early. We were so impressed to see how the well-designed buildings (with their various art exhibits and collections) and the open spaces ( with the gardens and sculptures) have come together to give you this feeling of gratitude to the planners, builders and most of all the benefactors of this great center. It's very well-run and the place is clean everywhere. There are several places to eat and open terraces where you can enjoy your meal. Definitely recommending the Getty Center to be in one's list when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVMD
50,Just the most amazing place!,"It is the must do in Los Angeles! One of the most beautiful place i have ever seem. The collections are beautiful, the gardens - breathtaking. The only regret i have is to have spend only 3 hours, i would have like a couple more hours, and trust me i'm not a museum freak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CriCri590
50,Unique view of L.A.,"A visit to the Getty, just off the 405, is truly a wonderful adventure. Arrive early to get a parking spot in the garage then take the elevator to the main level and board the quiet non polluting tram to the main entrance of the museum. The museum consists of several multi storied buildings. Although it's possible to see all of the artwork in a day, your brain will be overwhelmed. My recommendation is to start with the architecture tour, which meets outside the main entrance, then tour the sculpture museum, then the gardens, then pick one remaining type of art that interests you (see brochure for offerings). Maybe pack a lunch because the food offerings are pretty limited and pricey. There are plenty of places to sit and eat. The views of Los Angeles from the Getty are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5749RHjimm
50,Must go when in L.A.,"Breath taking buildings on top of the hill, breath taking view even before you enter and admire the collections - Manet, Monet, Van Gogh. Great collection - one day is not enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
50,Highly recommend it!,Even if you don't enjoy art museums the gardens are worth it. I get tired of museums quickly but the Getty allows you to split up exhibits. Get here early because there is usually a line to get on the tram up the hill. You could also walk up to the museum through the sculpture garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahaK7208CW
40,Good,"A nice clean and interesting place to go. Good art to look at and nice views of LA in the distance too. However, my party contained people not necessarily interested in art and there was nothing there to capture their imagination. Sounds obvious, but sometimes people that are not interested in art can be entertained by unusual exhibits - but not in this case, in my opinion. If you like art, definitely go.Parking was not free when I visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9412VIsteves
50,Lesser known gem of the Los Angeles Art scene,"J Paul Getty was a great advocate of the Arts on all mediums. Though this center uses his namesake, it is a stark contrast in artistic styles from the Getty Villa in Malibu.There are multiple buildings with many different exhibits. The architecture and gardens allow you to not only enjoy the Center itself but the striking Los Angeles skyline as well.There are sculptures, there are fixed permanent exhibits, and traveling exhibits. There is also frequently rotated performance art. Guest services also checks out (free of charge) ipods programmed with information about all the art you find at the facility making for a great self-guided tour.Have a glass of wine or a beer on the patio by the water fountains. Wander through the waist high maze in the garden as it overlooks the cliffs into Beverly Hills. wander the art exhibits. take in a play. there might even be some performance art on the patio. They even pass out free umbrellas to help keep you out of the sun.The gift shop has many items to purchase to make your day memorable.there is a fee for the parking. I have paying for parking but it is a fixed rate and the parking structure is nice, clean, and patrolled by security. Then you take a mono-rail to the top of the mountain to wander the spacious property.Its just a fun time.Note: there is a $1.50 fee online for tickets. The Tickets are free but you have to get them online. You cannot show up and purchase tickets to get in. This helps also keep the crowds down.Just Google: Getty Center to be taken to the proper place to get the free tickets to here or to the Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricStarcher1974
50,LA gem,"We went to the Getty with our tween, teen and my 4 year old nephew; this is a brilliant day for all ages. There is something for everyone, from the art exhibitions, the architecture, the beautiful gardens and views to the children's exhibit and the scenic restaurant(s). We could spend the whole day there. The restaurant would be such a romantic spot to have dinner or a great place for a party. The tram ride up to the museum is so scenic and enjoyable and the view from the hilltop is amazing.This was a day well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogimomma
50,Essential.,"An essential part of any visit to Los Angeles, the Getty Centre is replete with artworks, sculptures and exhibits of real importance. It's also a stunning building which boasts elaborate and colourful gardens, and occupies an elevated position overlooking the city. Don't leave this off your itinerary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilooliM
50,Scrolls of Dunhuang and Illuminated Manuscripts,I went to the Getty Museum and Villa for the first time to see the Caves of Dunhuang exhibit. It included an example and discussion of the thousands of scrolls found at the site that aren't translated yet. Another part of the museum has the permanent collection. It was interesting to see the european illuminated manuscript that had far superior workmanship even though it had been made long ago. The european manuscript had bold colors and a story. The scrolls from Dunhuang were faded by comparison. The scrolls depicted characters from the story of Buddha but no interesting stories of how the people in the Caves lived. The european scrolls reflect the life of the people contemporary to the life of the artist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinhomec
50,Hilltop heaven,"You don't just come to the Getty to see the art and exhibitions, the museum architecture itself is something to be seen. It's perched on top a mountain overlooking LA with views from every side of the structure. The exhibits area always changing so there is constantly something new to be enjoyed. It is good for a few hours or even a full day as you can dine there or grab a snack and coffee. The garden is another work of art in itself and I would recommend bringing a book and lounging in the grass under the SoCal sun...or you can always just buy a book there! A must-see on a visit to LA or for locals as well. You can walk to the top or take the tram, but I recommend the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michishellie
40,"Beautiful space, great contemporary exhibits...","...but I am not a big fan of the Old Masters. Go and enjoy the environment, the views, the gardens. Go for events, the tram ride, walk back down from the the top, lay on the grass, enjoy Mapplethorpe, but skip most of the permanent collection. Remember it's free too. Take the bus (#734 costs $1.75) and skip the parking fee - really free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670charliep

50,This is a must!,"We were kind of flying blind because we did not know what to expect. But we were blown away. We got there at noon on Tuesday and there was a sign ""carpark full"" but the car park across the road was taking the overflow despite their sign ""no parking for Getty Centre"". park there, and it's a short walk across the road to catch the tram which takes you up the hill to the entry.

Parking after 3 PM was $10) Save your receipt and take to the information center and they will exchange for a validated parking stub). The grounds are impressive even if you elect to not go through the exhibits. A five minute tram ride takes you to up to the center. Take in a few moments when you find yourself at the upper edge of the property to take in the views. We were there through closing and decided to walk down instead of taking the tram. It wasn't bad at all, just stick to the sidewalk. A wonderful place and hard to believe that we were still in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penta-Seattle
20,Getty No Go,Why bother!? Shopping mall architecture a long way from anywhere with a less than stock standard selection of European art. Call me old fashioned but who wants to come to LA to see European art? The only redeeming features are the views away from the centre and the surrounding gardens. A totally overrated museum experience and a waste of a precious day in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/182clintonm
50,The best things in life can be free,"From the stunning views of LA as you are seamlessly transported by train to the hilltop site and the airy architect designed galleries containing varied, well laid out master pieces of Western art, this is a worthwhile experience.

Our family of 7 aged from 8 to 72 voted this a very worthwhile outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne87London
50,Ultimate Art Viewing Experience,"I wish this place never closed. My Mom and I spent two full days here last week, and I already want to go back. It is the ultimate art viewing experience, with everything, even the architecture, focused on how to improve this experience, so that by the time I left, I felt energized and inspired instead of exhausted. The views of the city are spectacular. The tours were phenomenal, truly bringing the art to life. By far my favorite spot in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgnieszkaR436

50,Great architectural design and awesome views of LA,"I am not an artist or the artsy type either, but this great art museum is not your typical arts museum either. The architectural style is neo modern with a generous use of limestone rock slabs, even certain doors are made of same stone tiles. All the fountains are turned off due to the ongoing California drought but there is still sufficient beauty in the outdoir gardens to keep your interest. As the day progresses and the smog clears, you can see downtown LA in the distance. Works of Rousseau and some Rembrandts and many other artists under a close watch by security guys, artistically displayed in five different buildings. The courtyards are works of arts themselves. Good free Wi Fi, lots of Pokémons to catch and many restaurants make it a great teenager and young adult hangout too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctorcoolguy
50,Another Lovely Afternoon @ the Getty,I love it when I am able to squeeze in anytime at the Getty. Its amazing & astonishing every time. The garden is in it's glory each season appropriately.

50,An LA must see!,"We only were able to spend a little over an hour at the Getty Center and we barely tapped into it! The gardens are beautiful and the artwork is lovely to look at.

50,World class collection in a world class setting,"You could spend a day in each building or just experiencing the architecture/gardens - this is a wonderfully thought out museum. We were fortunate to see the limited run of the Chinese cave art as well as the additions to the illuminated manuscripts.

50,What a place,"I'm no art expert - quite the reverse, but it did seem to me there was something for everyone here. The buildings themselves resemble a campus and are architecturally really interesting before you look at anything else. The gardens are frankly amazing, from the cactus garden to the main garden - with views over LA to match. The pavilions were well set out and easy to navigate. I liked the way pictures, statues, books etc were brought together for a period. The French rooms with their furnishings were outstanding in my view. I wasn't so impressed with the London Calling exhibition but that's more to do with my lack of appreciation of Freud et al than anything else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonl379
50,"Absolutely amazing, a must visit","It is unbelievable that the art collection that fills the cultural center was once privately owned. I am so glad that it is now on display for all to enjoy.

There are many exhibitions to see & during summer they have evening events - there's nothing better than watching a soul or funk show at sunset at the Getty.

Do not confuse this for the Getty Villa - not the same place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chokocat

You will be surrounded by art - you won't be able to see everything if you're someone who takes time to enjoy art. Also don't miss out on beautiful garden outside and the bird's eye view of LA.

Best of all - free entry!I highly recommend the Architecture tour - this is free and runs throughout the day and really gives an insight into the thinking behind this futuristic looking building.The only word of warning really is to plan your day. There is so much here it's easy to miss something crucial. The car parks were full when we visited, and probably so over the summer so to avoid disappointment it may be worth getting public transport, a cab or Uber (fairly inexpensive).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattj389

There's always a new exhibit rotating throughout the year so you're always going to see something new! Did I mention it's free?! Just pay for parking.

50,Probably overlooked but shouldn't be!,"This turned into one of the highlights of our vacation to California. Not only the famous art but the museum itself is a wonderful place to visit. The views are incredible and we really enjoyed everything about it, even the cafe had good food and the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0beverlym
50,A classy joint for the bargain basement price of free,Well I love museums and this one is the grandaddy of them all. Yes it is on the westside but it is well worth the drive and traffic to experience this place. Although you pay for parking that is the only thing you pay for. They have different exhibits and then they have the usuals. You can easily spend all day here. They have all kinds of art and the building itself is to be appreciated. They also have a garden to just sit and relax. If you have a clear day you can see most of LA on various parts of the property and a nice view of the ocean. I have yet to have someone say they do not like the Getty Lets keep it that way,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chainsawmadman
50,Architecturally Stunning Place to view Art and more!,"Often when you live in LA you overlook the gems in the city but many of us drive past the Getty on the 405 every day-Here are some TIPS-1. GO-in SUMMER try to go EARLY to avoid the Crowds!2, Walk up the hill- skip the Tram and the line-if you are able bodied it is worth walking up the hill- it is quiet-there is a nice breeze and it takes about 15-20minutes.3.take water4.enjoy the building and the views- on a clear day there are some incredible views!Today I visited to just take in the Mapplethorpe Photography exhibit- very much enjoyed it. I did not enjoy watching a lot of visitors taking cell phone pics of his work and no one asking them to stop-.There was a docent at about 1pm near the Electric room who was very very helpful and walked around nicely asking informing visitors not to take photos- he was excellent!!I enjoy visiting the Getty- the parking is $15/car but there are limited number of spaces that a regular size vehicle can fit in- be prepared to have someone parked on your door in the compact spaces.I am lucky in that I live in LA so I can go and visit for a few hours-But if you are visiting from out of town you may want to allow half a day- take a break and have a snack or drink on one of the beautiful terraces.IF they still have it be sure and go downstairs to see the exhibit on the process of building and designing the Getty which to me is most interesting- the site and the design of the structures and gardens is stunning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BackRoadsUSA
50,School Field Trip!,We took our Kindergarteners here on a field trip and they had a blast! If you wonder about bringing young children don't worry they will be engaged.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharondW3582ZR
50,World Class Cultural Centre,"There are no other cultural locations I am aware of quite like the Getty Center. Perched on the top of a hill a short ride away from Bel Air, the architecture and views from its stunning location are worth the trip alone. The exhibitions when we visited were thought provoking and well laid out. Most definitely worth the journey and thank you to the Uber driver who suggested this gem of a place to us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amerdav
50,Quiet Elegance,"The Getty Center is a place for all ages. You can enjoy guided tours, or go off the beaten path to explore your own interests. The gardens in the spring are spectacular!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joy_babydoll
50,Great Museum and Grounds,"We went there for a few hours on our recent visit to LA. It was beautiful. You take a tram from the parking lot(15.00 dollars) up to the Getty Center. It is a great museum with a lot of art from the 1300 to 1800s. Van Gough, Renoir, Manet, Monet, Van Dyck, Goya and many more are represented. The views from the top are gorgeous. This was a highlight of our trip and it is free to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10

50,Stunning Museum and Fantastic View,"I always try to include a visit to The Getty on my trips to LA. The outside views are memorable. The gardens are relaxing as well as educational. I usually plan my visits to have lunch on the patio under the trees with a breeze. Inside my first visit many years ago was to view the French installations. If you are a Francophile and love the history in paintings, sculpture and decorative arts and can't make it to Paris this year, this is the best representation outside the Met in NYC. Check out their special exhibitions before going. I have always found something to buy in the extensive gift shop full of books on the most amazing subjects. Right now I would be looking for Medieval representations which is a current focus. The museum is free, but there is a charge for the parking. The ride from the parking to the museum on the tram is also enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
50,No museum fatigue here,"Be sure to take the architecture tour.The whole place is an architectural marvel, can't see everything in one trip.It is broken up by style and period, with outside breaks to clear your mind.

30,Squeaky floors,Huge place. But not much to actually see in terms of exhibits. Appreciated the serenity and views more. Gardena are lovely. All the floors and surfaces create shoe squeak which is oddly hilarious for a gallery. Found the disconnected and multi floor exhibition space quite strange. Take your own food and arrive early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnotherUnitedKingdom

50,"Stunning architecture, great artworks, amazing views, and a fabulous restaurant to enjoy alone or with loved ones!","I have visited the Getty Museum many times and have enjoyed spending time admiring Van Gogh's irises. There is amazing works of art showcased in beautiful rooms. The garden and terraces are always great places to take some rest or enjoy the great views. On clear summer or spring days one can observe the Pacific Ocean shoreline as well as nearby UCLA...a beautiful campus to visit...it is about 15-20 minutes away. So, after enjoying the museum's amenities, I love having an amazing lunch in the elegant restaurant which has incredible views.

50,Gorgeous building,"My husband and I went to the museum this past week. To get up to the museum you have the option of a tram or a 15 minute walk, the walk wasn't bad even though it was hot.

50,Iconic L.A. experience,"The architecture of this place and the gardens are exquisite. The art exhibits are NOT always up-to-snuff. Most of them we have enjoyed, but a few have been disappointments - choose wisely. I cannot imagine visiting L.A. and not seeing The Getty Center. This and the Walt Disney downtown are the two most iconic structures in L.A. We always take out-of-town visitors to the restaurant here. Request a window table for the impressive view; the food is top notch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxskin

40,Lovely Museum,"I live in the area and receive the Getty's newsletter so I don't miss programs and exhibits I'm interested in.The most recent visit was because they had a exhibition of bronzes from Greece and Rome. The Getty was offering a free tour led by one of the people who designed the exhibition. The tour was amazing. We learned why some bronzes survived, why the exhibition put certain bronzes near each other, how they were made, and who the bronzes depicted. It was a view into what makes a good exhibition that I never had before. Fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abrasrose

50,Great first museum...free parking.,"Go to the Web site to arrange free parking and spend at least 2 to three hours seeing a variety of famous art. Good kids area inside too. This is a place for all, but I would discuss with your family how to act in a museum ahead of time if they have never been to one. No flash photography, and take time to enjoy the art, don't race through.we love the statues, furniture and of course the variety of patntings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryrL6667BC
40,Viewing the History of Art,Enjoyng the day with my daughter and her friend viewing all the historic art and history in the Getty Museum. My favorite part of the Getty is viewing the garden in the view of this city is spectacular. I love going to the museum so I go to the Getty Center in the valley and I also go to the Getty Villa in Malibu each one of them have Exquisite historical information that would be educational to anyone that loves and enjoy the Arts. The reason why I gave it four star vs. Five star tattoos because I hate the parking situation it becomes crazy and having a lot of times at both centers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PleasantsD
50,Worth it just to see the Rembrandts.,"Stunning location, great exhibits, greatest of artists. I've been waiting years to see the Getty and finally had an afternoon free in LA. Yes, I would go again now I know what to expect, perhaps early morning next time, I think that carpark may fill up quickly when it's busy.

50,Abby sees art and architectural!,"My wife and I took my nephew and his wife, Abby, to The Getty. It was Abby's idea. She loves art and visiting museums. It had been a few years since we had visited The Getty, and I had forgotten the incredible architecture and exquisite collections of art. Yet, for me, that day, it was the gardens that captured my interest. From perfectly symmetrical plant and aggregate spacing to beautiful random landscapes, I was caught up in the sunlight scenes. In the moment it was easy to forget that the fast paced Los Angeles lifestyle zoomed by at freeway speed. The Getty is a treasure, go behold it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2922WZdavidb
50,Too big for one day,"The Getty provides abounding pleasure to the person seeking beauty in architecture, fine art and scenery. The hilltop location is breathtaking with a view that extends to the ocean. Not to be missed is the docent led tour of the architecture. The choice of art arranged in specific galleries will direct you to those artists or periods that you favor. The photograph collection is unique. Exhibitions change so check the museum's website to learn the current offerings. You can spend an entire day at the Getty (food is available) but it's unlikely that you will see it all. It's a bargain to boot-as many as you can squeeze in a car for one price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocliver

We would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simrlty
50,Often Something New,"I have been to the Getty Center several times. Typically I find something new each time. Some of the displays do not fit what you would think the Getty is about, but deep down it is all art. My favorite place is the Garden, you can not go unless you plan to visit the garden. It is wise to check and see what will be on display. One word of caution, DO NOT use flash photography. You will be swarmed on by security. There are vintage period furnishings, various art styles. One time when I went they had a Latino Heritage event with Low rider cars on display. Impressive. Even of it isn't your cup of tea, there are several halls of a variety of art forms. Photographs, Oils, water colors, sculpture, statuary, musical instruments. Never dull. The kids aren't wild about it but they need the culture anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PastorC_12

Unlike the LACMA exhibit, Getty was free. I got the recorded tour and learned a lot.I preferred to The Getty's photos to LACMAs, but was surprised it only had one photograph of Patti Smith, and said little about their relationship. I preferred the organization and display at the Getty Center.As I exited, I opted to go to electricity exhibit, also in the photo photography wing. I got such a kick out of that.

50,"Art, architecture, gardens, and vistas","There is something for everyone here at the Getty. We arrived around 9:45 a.m. in time to park in their parking lot and take the tram up to the main entrance area. The tram is a very nice amenity.Another amenity visitors should take advantage of upon arrival--the free umbrella for sun protection. It was definitely a needed extra. When you for inside galleries you leave it in an outside bucket and pick up another one on your exit to the next area.Wear comfortable walking shoes as there is a lot to see. We enjoyed everything we could, but tired out well before closing time of 9 p.m. that night. Be careful.to drink lots of water. Hard to accomplish in the galleries, but much needed.We took lots of photos. Actually wish we had brought our camera bag and stored it coat check. You are allowed to go back and forth to change things up at coat check.We enjoyed a mid-day break at the restaurant on site. YUM! They made some fabulous dishes. Great romantic location if you need a date idea--lunch or dinner. Fabulous with handling food allergies.Definitely a must see location in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mama2potter
50,Move over Loevre,"I know some purists will hate me, but I have been blessed to visit many art museums in the world, but this one nearly defies description. I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this wonderful museum! The cafe had the best fresh salad too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enigmaman95
40,"Good art, hot and crowded. Sit on the lawn below the museum to chill out.","We finally visited the Getty Center. It's worth a visit once. The art is good - several interesting impressionists, a range of other eras - kind of an odd mix, I suppose matching Getty's interests. The galleries felt awkward to get around; the overall architecture seemed like it was designed more to be seen than to walk through. The main court is very, very hot during the summer. We found the lawn below the museum to be a great place to chill out.I enjoyed the architecture of the Getty Museum in Malibu much more, and found it a much nicer place to sit in between setting the art.Shuttle cars from parking lot to museum were misbehaving when we went; the walk up to the museum is reasonably short and partially shaded. If your group doesn't need the assistance, just walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert2765
50,Beautiful Museum!,"Really happy we got to visit the Getty Museum. Entrance fee is free after you pay a 15.00 parking fee. The grounds are beautiful. The children's pavilion is cute and my kids had a great time making masks and viewing the illuminated art. The food was pricey, however since the entrance fee is free, you can't really complain and it was really nice. Loved visiting here and would recommend it to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristine72

50,So Much to See Here,"You can spend a whole day here. Lovely gardens, incredible art, great food also. It is worth it just for the view of the city and valley. Admission is free but parking is $15 - still a bargain. The Impressionist Collection is quite extensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisC6649
50,World Class Museum!,I loved it! I can't believe the entrance was free! All we paid was 15 for parking and then they take you up the hill to the stunning museum. We had a little problem when the monorail broke down and we had to walk up about half way. But even that was kind of exciting. They have a food court and gift shops. There is live entertainment. The exhibits are amazing! Only issue: It was a nightmare getting home on the 405 and the 210! There was traffic on the way up that added 45 to 55 minutes to our commute .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767lesliep
40,Amazing place,"Wow this place is stunning, the architecture, the gardens, the views... I'm not one for staring at art, but you can certainly enjoy this museum without even going to see any of the exhibitions. Really is worth a visit if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GHedley

50,A world class museum,The Getty is an amazing place to visit. It is free to go in here although you must pay for the parking which is not cheap. The artwork is nothing less than amazing. The grounds are beautiful and so is the landscaping. If you're in the area I highly recommend to go to the Getty museum!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4564IKrichardl
40,If you like art,"It was a questionable decision to go as I'm not big into art in any way. But plenty of stuff to look at, with great views of the city. Not for most kids, though, as they'll get bored pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themikeKsmith
50,A full day activity,"This was our first visit, and we came specifically for the Mapplethorpe exhibit. We only planned enough time in our day for this show, but we could have easily spent the whole day or days there. The shuttle line moved quickly. The buildings were beautiful. A truly impressive space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly_V_McCoy
50,Beautiful Museum and Setting,"We went to the Getty and although we had a bit of difficulty with parking initially the day ended up ok. We arrived about 11:30-12:00 and the garage was full. We decided to get some lunch and then try again. Not many restaurants in the area but we did find a pizza place. Returned about 1:30 and the parking lot was open again. We loved the museum, for its architecture, the Zen of the buildings, and of coarse the artwork. Definitely don't miss when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NyCindy
50,Fabulous,"My previous visit was in 1983 so I wanted to see the renovations completed in the 90's. It is a magnificent place and the renovations are spectacular. This place is a gem of the Pacific coast. If you just want to wander in the gardens, or see the antiquities, or enjoy lunch on the terrace then this place is for you. Be sure to take a guided tour. It really enhanced the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacX3035BJ
50,Beautiful museum with great view of Los Angeles,"We parked the car in the parking lot and took the 5 minutes train to the top of the hill.At the museum entry you get the free audio iPad .The place contains many different exhibition, some are permanent and some changing exhibitions.From the exhibition rooms , go out to the porch to see the view of LA.It is also recommended to take a hike in the Getty center gardens.The parking fees is 10$ but all the exhibitions in the center are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redtom1
40,Amazing Museum but Very Crowded,"The Getty Museum set of buildings themselves are amazing enough to justify the visit. This is a great example of a historical set of art assembled in a modern era. This museum is incredibly well funded but it's art on display lacked some of the traditional big name artists one would find in Chicago, New York, London, Paris, Madrid, Rome and Florence. This is primarily because the works have mostly been acquired in the past 40 years. However, the lack of tons of ""big name"" artist works should not discourage you from making the drive, fighting to find a parking spot in the garage and boarding the people mover up the hill...rather the art that is displayed, especially some of the exhibits are some of the best pieces of some less appreciated artists that exist. Certainly in one collection. Like most museums there is more to do there in 3-4 hours then can be done. When you want a break from the traditional Amusement Park and Beach Southern California vacation I would highly recommend planning a half day at the Getty. The only issue is the crowds. The museum is free. The parking currently costs $15 per car however. My recommendation is to plan to be there when the museum opens to avoid the crowds in the afternoon. Nothing is more frustrating then feeling pushed inside a museum or feeling like you have to read placards on the wall by darting in and out of others. Plan your trip so you get the most out of the adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyl157
50,Great place!,"Wonderful art, interesting historic perspectives, beautiful, relaxing atmosphere. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing or artistic escape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranE4684EI
40,"Come by bus, and it's free","I really don't understand why people drive here. We stayed in Hollywood, so getting to the Getty required a bus transfer (bus 2 to UCLA, then bus 234 north on Sepulveda). It was very easy, though, and by arriving by bus we saved the $15 parking fee. Everything else at the Getty is absolutely free.We arrived first thing in the morning, actually a few minutes before opening time. I was glad we did, because it made the visit easier--particularly on a weekend. We went through security in no time and got timed tickets for the first entrance of the day in the special exhibition on Buddhist caves. When we left there was a line at security that filled up an enormous tape maze.The setting of the museum is beautiful, and the buildings and surrounding sculpture are worth a visit all by themselves. The paintings are also interesting, though it's far from the best art museum I've been to. (I'd recommend the Chicago Art Institute or the Museum of Modern Art in New York ahead of this.) It surprised me how little American art there is in the collection, and aside from the caves there was pretty much nothing non-Western. There is a good representation of almost every European artist, though--often not their most famous work, but interesting paintings nonetheless.The staff are very friendly and helpful, and they had one of the better museum shops I've seen. There's also a variety of food options at fairly affordable prices.From most tourists' point of view the Getty is out of the way, but it's worth a trip. In addition to the bus on Sunset, you can easily take the Expo rail line from either downtown or Santa Monica to the Sepulveda stop and transfer to a northbound bus there. The buses are frequent, and they announce the stops so you know exactly when to hit the ""stop"" button to get off. Do come, and enjoy one of the best free museums around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmbia
20,Very cold!,"A little bit disappointing as one floor was closed because they were installing the Beatles exhibition. Also it was bitterly cold in there, I could only stand it for 30 minutes. You definitely need to take a jacket or sweater with you when you go, otherwise it was OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ainybell
50,Beautiful location and great art,"The location is incredibly beautiful with almost 360 degree views over LA and the ocean. The building itself and the gardens are also very beautiful. The art collection is great too, and I particularly enjoyed the romantic/impressionism paintings. There's definitely a lot to see here and it's great value being free and all! But be aware, parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellef608
50,An exhibition full of surprises for all,"For anyone interested in art, history both ancient and middle ages, then this is a place not to be missed. You will need at least 3 hours to fully appreciate this wonderful exhibition. Ancient statues, vases and hundreds of artifacts will amaze you. You wont have to go to Greece or Rome. French furniture is also a highlight . Dont forget your camera. Another bonus is the wonderful landscaped gardens, complete with running water creeks and fountains cared for by dozens of gardeners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbD9553EE

The Getty is very educational and entertaining for young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynn_FL
50,"Incredible collection of artwork, displayed in a spectacular fashion","The Getty Center is one of the best ""hidden secrets in plain sight"" in Los Angeles. Located just off the 405 Freeway, north of West LA, you can't miss the beautiful buildings as you drive past. Admission is free, but parking is $15 -- whether you're there for 1 hour or all day. Still, a great deal for the experience of seeing some of the most amazing artwork available anywhere in the world. The museum offers many traveling exhibitions as well, and there's enough variety to satisfy anyone's taste in art.For example, on this visit there was section dedicated to the photography of Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as the Cave Temples of Dunhuang China. In fact, this exhibition included a replica of the actual caves to walk through, which gave a fully immersive experience into the history of the artwork.You can literally spend all day roaming through the various exhibit halls, and they even offer free guided tours throughout the day. Not only are the grounds absolutely beautiful, but the views of LA are just spectacular.I recommend that you arrive early (before 11am) as the parking structure fills up quickly. If you really want a special treat, make reservation at the full service restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555donw

40,"Beautiful Gardens, Superb Tour Guides","Had a short visit early morning. We could not stop for the galleries due to our time limitations. Rather, we went for their free architecture and garden tours. Both of our tour guides were experienced, intellectual individuals and their presentations did not feel and sound like a generic, ""memorized"" speech.The architecture tour guide was a lady who knew the architect personally, and I could say she was doing her job with love. You could get a great vibe from her during the tour.The garden tour guide was my favorite, as he was very well-informed and more structured in his presentation in my opinion.visiting the main garden is a must here.

I also had read Mr. Getty's book when I was in my 20's. Quite a good read. I still remember things he said in the book. How to be Rich! He should know. But, back to the Getty Center review.

People coming from that direction had a very large advantage over those of us taking a left across traffic. The Getty Villa is also very special and interesting. Don't miss either of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKHEBoston
50,WORLD CLASS!,"The architecture, the gardens , the art. This is the place to view great collections of world class art. Exhibits change throughout the year so that every visit is like the first. Crowds can be present, so earlier in the day is best to avoid the lines. Parking is below the center with a tram to take you to the top. Young kids....maybe not if you want to enjoy your stay. This is a half day+ destination. Don't rush. Take your time and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave
50,Laid back & sensational exhibits,I've attended The Getty both for work research and for leisure. The gardens are gorgeous and there are many wonderful outside areas for walking and exploring. Most exhibits that I've been to have been fascinating and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
50,Fantastic,"I can't believe this place was free (only pay for parking). The place is gorgeous, wonderful exhibits, lovely gardens and friendly staff. Amazing views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyGB
50,Equally beautiful inside and out,The Getty Center is a gorgeous stop while visiting LA. It is a striking collection of buildings surrounded by unique gardens that you can stroll through for hours. The exhibits inside the center include permanent and visiting works. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adot914
50,WOW!,"I have visited The Getty Center twice and The Getty Villas once. Both are incredibly beautiful! Whether or not you are an art museum fanatic you will be amazed at the collections. Outside areas are wonderfully landscaped. Restaurant at the Center is ""high-end"", but the cafeteria style food court has offerings for all. No charge for admission, but $15 to park ($10 after 3:00 PM) at both venues. NOTE: The Villas require timed tickets which can be booked online. It is a smaller venue and the timed entry controls the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angievaughn
50,Worth every penny,"Amazing museum, staff is very knowledgeable. The layout is intriguing, the collection is fantastic. Even the tram ride up to the museum is amazing. I can't say enough good things. Go see for yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157kaitlynf
50,Great art in a spectacular setting,"A tram takes you up a winding trail to the Getty. It is a fantastic venue and it is free.Before you start your tour, make sure you see the film about the building of the Richard Meier structure and the design of the garden.The permanent collection is first rate and the exhibitions are always interesting.If you take the kids, there is a delightful area for them.There is also an area near the tram stop for Uber pickup.Great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283carolec
40,Somewhere different,"I have been wanting to take my daughters to The Getty Center since we moved back to LA after a 10 year absence. This was their first ever visit. As for me, it has been nearly twenty years since my last visit there.What a beautiful place. The weather was nice and sunny and there wasn't much smog which made the view from everywhere awesome.The exhibitions we saw were mainly of early Eastern European artist. I wanted to take my girls to see something different. They really enjoyed our day there and we plant to go again soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koreyh362
50,What a gem,"The Getty Center is a must stop in Los Angeles. The place is beautiful, the gardens are perfection, and the ambience is just great. Every exhibition is different and it has its own vibration. Last but not least, the views of the city are stunning. Great place to go on a Saturday and do something different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maye16
40,Getty Center Highlights,"The Getty Center's architecture was stunning and the gardens beautiful with panoramic view of LA. The art museum was a nice way to take in some culture outside of the beach and boardwalk scene. The tram to the top only takes a few minutes, and the earlier in the day you, the fewer the crowds will be. FYI: The line for exhibits was lengthy... although the walk-through at the exhibit itself was brief.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820MikeS
50,Favorite place in Los Angeles,"From the moment you take the tram up the hill, you are transported to a different world. The gorgeous gardens, with favorite Van Gough and Monet paintings, along with the children's art center when my daughter was young, have made the Getty a Center a frequent destination for over 15 years. Although the water fountains have been turned off, it is such a beautiful museum in such a beautiful setting and on a clear day there are the most beautiful views. Highly recommend but wear good walking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonnlm
50,Amazing place,"The Getty is an amazing place to spend a day enjoying the gardens and the art.Plan to spend many hours both indoors and outdoors both equally as beautiful.The art collection is spectacular, with sections dedicated to sculpture, furniture, fine arts and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marxiana
40,Review of the Getty,"A fun outing for the day! Went with a few girlfriends to look at a specific exhibit, and made a great day out of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerN633
50,I consider the Getty Center a LA 'MUST SEE'!,"A visit to the Getty is so much more than a museum visit...the architecture is breathtaking, the views are the best you will find in the whole city and the circular garden walk is an experience for the senses. They offer wonderful summer concerts and special events and the special exhibits are always beautifully executed ~ plus the tram ride is offers a nice vista of Bel Air vineyards on the way up. I recommend you make a lunch (or dinner on weekends) reservation at the Restaurant at the Getty Center for a wonderful fine dining experience with spectacular views. Need I mention the art collection? Personal favs are the Femme Statue in the main entry by Giacometti, the impressionist room with Van Gogh's Irises (one of the most expensive paintings ever acquired), photography exhibits and the decorated period rooms with French decorative arts. Whenever we need a 'stay-cation' we head to the Getty for little getaway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carobritravels
50,One of the best,"Everything was good. If you come to L.A, You must visit this lovely and luxury place. The place is not that really big but many collections are there and good for with young kid too. It is high end museum and people working there are very helpful and friendly. Especially garden is lovely!! I definitely will go again! Love here!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serendipityall
50,Great Architecture with interesting collections and programs,The Getty is a must see when you come to LA. It is a minimum half day and they have several good restaurants. Be sure to see the gardens and try to see all of the buildings which are truly great. In the summer they have evening programs with entertainment so be sure to check the website to see what is going on. The galleries are plentiful so plan your visit to be sure you see your favorites. This is a clean safe and very attractive venue that you will like very much. There is no admission fee but parking is $15 and that includes a monorail ride to the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,Don't miss this Cultural Gem!,"An truly amazing place to spend the day, exploring the Getty Campus, sprawling over a Hilltop overlooking greater Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean, with various buildings, galleries, and ART seeminglyfrom almost every continent and period to appreciate. I was there for 5 hours and didn't have time to see everything, but I throughly enjoyed my visit, I wish that I could stay overnight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltect
50,"I wrote a master thesis about the most wealthy people in the US - Rockefeller, Waltons, .....","About 35 years ago, i wrote a master thesis at my university about the most powerful and most wealthy multi- billionaire people in the US, like the Rockefellers, the Waltons, the Vanderbilts, etc.In the 1980ies I travelled all over the US and Canada to search for information for my master thesis about the most powerful and most wealthy people in North America.I visited Los Angeles/ CA several times, and visited the Getty Center, because the Getty family is one of the most powerful family in North America.I recommend you to search for information about this very interesting American family and then to visit the Getty Center - you won't regret the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HamburgAlsterFan
50,Beautiful museum for arts and architecture,"I could spend all day here. The Getty Center is home to a global collection of art, history, and architecture. The garden is serene and is a perfect place to read or relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4933HXchristopherl
50,Moving,"It lived up to my expectations and then some. I recommend the free tour. It help us stop and really look at the paintings and then brush up on our mythology and religion, since many early paintings were religious or mythologically inspired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asharprd
50,Spectacular museum and grounds-all free!!,"The Getty Center should not be missed! We spent 4 hours there but you can easily spend an entire day!!The grounds are beautiful-bring a picnic or eat at their cafe outside.The train ride up offers beautiful views of the mountains. The marble and stone structure is a sight to behold and the artwork inside is phenomenal. There is always a special exhibit going on.There are umbrellas for the sun---or rain-and the place is immaculate-so clean! Perfect for all singles, couples, groups, families-it is so impressive-don't miss it. The cactus garden and stones with gold were lovely. So much to see-you will need a minimum of 3 hours. Parking is hard, but you will eventually find a space in the garage for $10.00. Even with huge crowds you never feel crowded or disturbed while looking at the artwork. It was a wonderful experience and I returned for a another visit before I left LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370camilleq
50,Breathtaking!,"ARRIVE EARLY!! This is a very popular LA attraction and we found that arriving by 9:30 ensured us a great parking space and time to peruse the gorgeous gardens. Then by 10:00 when the museum opens, we were able to see most everything without any crowds or distractions and we were finished by noon. The paintings and exhibits are all 5 star! As we were leaving the line for the tram up the hill to the museum was over an hour long! So again--arrive early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrins364

50,Delightful Grounds,"It is a beautiful museum. One I love seeing from the freeway as much as from the Center itself. There are numerous exhibits, so go back often. Perfect for a day date for those that live in LA but want to feel more like tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniqueqt22
40,"Beautiful grounds, great to walk around. Exhibits, fine if they are to your taste.","The Getty Center has very nice gardens, and spectacular views of Los Angeles. This is what I recommend most. As for the exhibits, that is so purely a matter of taste that it is hard to review. On our visit, we walked through a couple of the exhibits, but they weren't really my cup of tea so I didn't really care for them. But it is definitely worth the ride to take in the gardens and views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue
50,Must Visit,A day like no other! We were looking for something to do for a day trip before a night flight to Sydney - we hired a driver and did good thing - visited Getty in Malibu many years ago before this sight was completed - that was a treasure - this was divine!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephg838
40,Pleasant way to spend an afternoon,"Interesting temporary exhibits and well-displayed art in permanent exhibits. Limited variety of art, no American paintings or sculpture, some photography. Café is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990cherylc
50,Lots of paintings with special feature presentation.,"Very easy to find. Parking space is tight for large vehicle. This is a free attraction except you have to pay for parking. You have a great view of Los Angeles mountain scape in the garden. Price of food is expensive. Comparable to Universal Studio. The cafe is nice, big and roomy. You need to take a short tram ride from the parking to the main building. A cool ride on a driverless tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skier101
50,Best attraction on a rainy day,"I loved it.. the exhibitions are of high quality and the location, building and overall experience are not to be missed! A must-do in L.A",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJCairns
50,Beautiful,"Amazing grounds and buildings. Great views of Los Angeles. We also has a quick snack. Enjoyed our visit and exhibits. Short walk uphill to museum from parking, faster than waiting for crowded tram",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schspa
50,Gorgeous and worthwhile,"My first visit with my sister who loves to visit every time she is in town. Was very interesting to see the many exhibits. Viewed the replica of the Mogao Caves from Dunhuang, China. Breathtaking and amazing to see how well preserved history can be. Beautiful views from every stairwell and balcony. Gardens are well layed out. Property is relaxing to stroll and tram ride up from parking lot provides a nice snapshot of the homes on the hillside. Another must see when in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basays
40,Lovely Place,"Its a nice place, on top of hill, with a wonderful view. The gallery is awesome, I am not much of art critic, but the collection is breathtaking. The Garden is also excellent for kids to play around and spend some quality time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abutaiyab
50,Beautiful Oasis in LA,The Getty is a beautiful place to escape to in busy LA. The gardens are relaxing the exhibitions are top-notch. It was a great way to start our stay in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smultronpod
50,"If you have time to go to one museum, make it this one!","To be truthful, I had not heard of the Getty Museum, not knowing what it was or where it was. However, a friend said that we should see it. So we went. I was so glad I did. The museum has so much to offer - the architecture itself is stunning, the garden is spectacular and one of my very favorites, the exhibits are world class. While it is not as large as some others, I think one would have a hard time seeing all the exhibits in one setting and not get information overload. And the Getty Center sits on a hill overlooking the 405, Century City and downtown LA (more distance). However, the view is still spectacular. I was so glad that I went and I will always make it a destination when I have time in the LA for business or pleasure. You will NOT be disappointed. I marked below that it is ""not"" a rainy day activity only because I loved the garden so much, and if one spends only in the inside, he/she would miss half of the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLlovetravel
50,I like going to special exhibits or events at the Getty Center,"Last month I have visited the Getty Center for 2 special exhibits. One was about the work of Mapplethorpe. It was done in the best of taste, covering all areas of his photography. I liked the flower still lives the best, but was really impressed with all of his work. The other was about cave temples of Dunhuang, Buddhist Art on China's Silk Road. The docent was absolutely inspiring, interesting and in top of that fun. Even if you din't like the exhibits, the location and the view from the Getty are amazingly beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ingebored
50,Stunning Building and Exhibits,This is one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever been in. Made mostly from huge blocks of marble brought over from Italy that were cut so precise they are grout-less.Inside these stunning buildings are rotating art exhibits brought in from all over the world. Check online to find what's currently showing.The gardens are expertly designed and tended too. Take a walk thru the gardens and explore its beauty.The have an excellent restaurant and cafeteria here. I usually eat at the cafeteria as it is much higher end still than your typical cafeteria food.Stunning views of LA and the ocean.The topper.. it's all free except parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38kevinl
50,Stunning,"Awed by the contemporary architecture and how it is married to the land. Exquisite landscaping, neat garden and architectural tours, impressive exhibits, including the Mapplethorpe exhibit which we were lucky enough to get into. Best of all, it's all free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320kennethm
50,The Getty Center,The Getty Center is a must see when in Los Angeles. They have a great collection of paintings and the grounds are great to walk around in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IAMTHETRAVELGOD
50,Plan of spending several hours here!,An enjoyable day here. Highly recommended. Beautiful place. Take some of the guided tours. Rare works of art on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamMc88
50,Nice Collection. Great Garden,"Very nice museum in L.A. Unfortunately Paul Getty didn't like modern art, so the collection is mostly classic. Fabulous architecture by Richard Meier (although the Italian white pavement stones are too shiny and dazzling). Free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ezpass
50,Beautiful!,"The Getty Center was a great place to visit. Admission was free, but not parking. The grounds were beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllisonB2208
50,One of the best museums,"We visited quite a few museums throughout of life and Getty is one not to miss. The structures and landscapes themselves are worth the trip. ARTS are plentiful. If you have time, not to skip the Getty's house, which is another 30 min drive. The house sits on the hill and overlook the ocean. The artifacts collected in the house is impressive. Hard to beat anywhere else. A must visit to the Getty and his house. My kids rarely like visiting museums, but they want to come back to see this again. This to prove that it has a variety of things for us to do as a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timt642
50,Art Made Fun,We love this free art museum and have been there many times over the years. We parked the car and took the tram to the top. The kids like the hands-on interactive displays and we love browsing the art of the masters--our favorite is Van Gogh's Iris. My wife likes to walk in the garden while the kids follow the stream/waterfall. We bought food at the concession stands. We usually bring our out-of-town visitors here; our sisters like the exhibit on antique furniture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
50,A true gem of LA.,"The architecture, the art collection, and the grounds make for a full day of enjoyment. We took a picnic and enjoyed on the grounds. Did the free architecture tour which was informative. The views of the city are excellent. The art collection is amazing, the best in CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCandCM
50,The Getty Architecture is as much of the attractions as the exhibits!,"To tell the truth there is better art in Paris and Firenze but I doubt there is a more interesting designed museum space in the world than the Getty off of the 405 in Los Angeles.The old Getty in Malibu is frankly a pain to get to. It takes reservations, limited parking, and special days etc. but the new Getty (which also needs reservations) has greater parking and a more user friendly nature.After an engaging tram ride up to the entrance (the kids will love it), go for lunch and sit out and delight at the thrilling 360 degree of L.A. from this mountaintop. The exhibits are always well done and varied but seeing the garden and walking its trail is even better. The gift shop is great and the docent free tours are worth taking. Its a wonderful afternoon for the whole family …and…only in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eggcreamer
40,Expansive Hilltop Campus Too Separated From Its City,"Vast funds from the Getty oil fortune were used to build this luxurious campus on a hill overlooking the west side of Los Angeles city. Further funds were utilized to provide an exceptional endowment that allows art executives to run the facility and also to purchase art on the international market.To access, one can take a bus or drive one's car to the facility parking area ($5 parking fee), then board a shuttle train up the hill to the campus. Once there, docents can guide one to any of the many buildings that house a permanent collection and also temporary exhibits. The campus is so large that there are several restaurants ranging from fast food to fine cuisine. A spacious theater can hold conferences or presentations.In addition to a great deal of space of art galleries, there is also an art conservation center that works to innovate art conservation and to teach visiting conservators in these novel techniques.So far as I know, the Getty holds a particularly good collection of photographs, many from the collection of Samuel Wagstaff. It also owns an okay collection of Western European art. To see its allied collection of Greek and Roman sculpture, one must drive 20 minutes west to Malibu to visit the Getty Villa (separate entrance and reservation). That campus is a replication of a Roman villa.Design of Getty Center campus was provided by Richard Meier's company in the blonde block style of his High Museum in Atlanta, but at a much larger scale. Garden was designed by artist Robert Irwin and takes good advantage of the sloping hillside. As with a cathedral town in Europe, these buildings can be seen from much of the city below.But that said, this approach to an art center by necessity removes art from the cauldron in which it is created. Getty Foundation contributions to local art events does not overcome my serious concerns with this approach. Sometimes, when visiting, one feels that this is more of a party locale for wealthy westsiders or a tourist stop than it is a vital art museum, no matter what shows are curated. Also, challenge and time involved in getting to this facility, by necessity, creates a barrier to visiting. By contrast, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), at street level in a more active part of town, not only provides better access, but also, I would maintain, offers more interesting exhibits. Certainly, one sees crowds at LACMA that one doesn't see at the Getty. Locals who attend musical events, special presentations, and so forth.With so many museums now dotting the Los Angeles basin (LACMA, Broad, Hammer, MOCA, Huntington, Norton Simon) and others coming on board soon, one has to ask whether one would recommend that a visitor with limited time should spend the half day effort to go to the Getty when he can instead, say, hit the Broad (reservations a good idea) and MOCA's two downtown branches for the same time investment, or head out to Pasadena to visit the Norton Simon and the Huntington Gallery and Gardens.Finally, there is something truly misproportioned about the Getty's dedication of so much of its space to what I would call ""palatial-ism"" instead of art display. They spent way more time on the frame than on the painting. Courtyards, restaurants, stairs, etc. should allow one to reach the art, not supersede the art. Even at places such as the Kunsthistoriche in Vienna, one walks from the street a hundred feet and into a building that houses art which in its totality is far superior to art at the Getty. Same thing for the Hermitage, despite the fact that it is cobbled together from a number of disparate buildings. Or best of all, the Prado, with its curatorial excellence gathered in one building of masterworks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GEDLosAngeles_CA
50,Getty museum,The Getty Center is definitely a great place to see if your visiting Los Angeles. The museum has so much history and the landscaping is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Genaro100181
50,WOW exhibition!,"For art lovers, this is a must! I visited already quit some private collections but this museum beats them all. All great painters are represented, the only one I haven't seen is Picasso. Loved ""The Senses"" of Rambrandt. The building is so impresive and the views are unbelievable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magdak13
50,Beautiful way to spend an afternoon,"Not only do they have great pieces of art but the view and the grounds are spectacular. After spending a couple of hours viewing the paintings we went out side to sit on the grass and appreciate the view, The architecture is part of the art it is stunning. Parking was easy. Unfortunately the line for the tram up the hill was quite long. On out way out we opted to walk down the hill. It was a lovely but I think would be very strenuous to wald up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriR96
50,A setting to appreciate art,I love art but felt the ghetty had stuck way too traditional.Now the ghetty has opened up creative exhibitions and multimedia displays done in exciting ways.

50,"Art, Great Views & Wine Al Aperto","If you can't afford to visit the European museums, come to the Getty Center and feel at ecstasy when you set a foot at the first step of the staircase that take you to the main entrance. The lobby has a high ceiling that give you the impression of floating as you walk in the museum.Entering at any of the pavilions make you feel relaxed and feel at ease to enjoy the invaluable art collection that Mr. Paul Getty kindly inherited to us.The Garden beautiful flora display is a delight to our sight and smell senses! The city view are not less charming with great opportunities for the most amateur photographer.Last but not least, visit the terrace bistro and enjoy a cheese platter with some chardonnay.If you are from Southern California you must visit it!

50,Summertime tour,"I took my 2 daughters and brother up to the Getty Ctr. from Long Beach. It is very easy to access, plenty of parking, and affordable ($15) considering there's no entrance fee for museum. There was something for everyone. Rousseau's landscapes, Rodin sculptures, Mapplethorpe photo exhibit - NOTE: some parts are not for the kids! My youngest really enjoyed the Silk Road exhibits and learned quite a bit about the trade routes, items transported to/from, etc..The scrolls were the main highlight for me, personally. Such detail and so well preserved. I wish we'd had a second day to return and do the 3D featured event, but no time that day. The grounds are meticulous. Scenery and views very impressive. The snacks, fruit, and gourmet coffee drinks/teas available at most places are at reasonable prices. All four of us had a memorable experience. We just might make that second trip up there while in SoCal this year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Montanagilmore

50,Wonderful Exhibits and Views of Los Angeles,"We always visit the Getty Center when in southern California. While admission is free, parking when we visited in 2015 was about $15. Still a bargain for such an interesting place to visit. The exhibits are wonderful and the grounds are very attractive with numerous flowering plants and trees. In addition, the views of the Los Angeles basin from the museum buildings are the most spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Retirees
40,It's the building that grabbed me,"I have to admit that it was not the collection inside the galleries that grabbed my attention, but the buildings and grounds in which they are housed. I agree with one of the earlier reviewers who said the museum is built for people - it is accessible, easy to navigate and provides plenty of opportunity to take a break in an outdoor space. I feel a little guilty admitting that the collections, apart from the Mapplethorpe, did not move me that much. Nonethless, it was well worth the visit. If you are a fan of late 20th century architecture then add this to the list of places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyPaul
50,Favorite LA Museum,We have been here three times and always enjoy our visit.One of the best views of the area. It pays to buy tickets ahead of time online especially if you are planning to visity the Getty house down the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMJ024
50,AMAZING Must See for all,"This is the Art Museum that has you in mind. Easy to get to right off the 405. It is FREE. Convenient parking. Tram-train takes you to the mountain-top campus. Easy walking to see the exhibits. Frequent tours to give a quick orientation to the property and some art appreciation while you're at it.

50,A Must See FREE Art Museum (and Gardens) with Incredible Views!,"This is a free world class art museum, located in the mountains just north of West Los Angeles heading to the Valley. Not that easy to get to if you don't have a car, although there is a public bus (must have exact change) that goes there. There is no street parking and you have to pay to park. A free train takes you from the parking structure up to the top of the mountain (and down when you leave) where the museum is located (you can walk up if you want, but I would save my energy for walking around the museum...walk down if you want at the end of your day). There are several buildings housing the art and furniture on display, Make sure to walk around the gardens. The view over LA is wonderful. They also have night programs (films and concerts) and great art classes (I've taken several). Check out their calendar to see what's on. Plan on spending most of the day here because you probably won't want to leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladeela

40,Art and beautiful gardens,"The Getty is a great place to spend the day. I've been several times, both with my family as well as student groups.

50,"Beautiful Museum grounds, a must see while visiting LA","This is a really beautiful museum complex with very unique gardens. The collection of paintings and sculpture was truly awesome. It is free admission, although there were one or two pay exhibits. There was a charge for parking, $15, but I believe if you go after 3pm it's cheaper. We loved the views of the surrounding LA hillside from the various vista points in and around the museum grounds. Highly recommended for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL251

50,Truly one of the must see destinations in Los Angeles,"Beautiful views, architecture and art. The Getty Center is a wonderful experience for all ages. The grounds are impeccable and the architecture is inspiring. There are always a number of excellent exhibitions and their collection is fantastic. This would be in the top 3 of recommendations for people visiting LA. I live here and try to go at least once every year or two. The tram ride up to the top of the hill is a fun part of the experience itself. They also have wonderful concerts and other events at the site. It can be experienced in a few hours but I would give yourself the day and plan to have lunch at the cafe and not feel rushed. There are plenty of areas to sit as well as grassy areas to lay out and enjoy the California sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robkolar
50,"Fabulous buildings, art collections and views","With only a two night stopover, we chose to visit the Getty Center rather than Hollywood or other LA attractions. It was a great choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hilaryjbarber
40,Beautiful gardens & Exhibits!,"I came to The Getty with my mom and best friend for leisure one day. The facilities were clean, staff very friendly and helpful. Although they are easily found I didn't feel hovered. The gardens are my favorite, but the maze which is what made me go, is not for visitors to walk through. It was a bit disappointing. The views are stunning though and the center makes for a wonderful place to relax, learn, and maybe read a book!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanelBrown
50,"Wonderful place, don't miss it if you come to LA","This is a great place to visit, great exhibitions, permanent and temporary and a beautiful place to walk around and enjoy the views of los angeles.Check for special events, parking is $15 but the museum is free, it is fun to take the railway up while enjoying the views of LA.If it's a sunny day make sure you bring sunglasses.

50,What a gem!,"I really can't say enough about how stupendous the Getty Center is. Parking was clearly marked and cost $15. A tram takes you to the actual center which is so large and architecturally beautiful in its curving alabaster splendor. We saw special exhibits and permanent collections, all fabulous. There were restaurants on site, but we chose to just enjoy coffee and snacks from a kiosk in the courtyard. The gardens were the highlight for us.....just so beautiful and creatively arranged. We arrived at opening which was a great idea, as it got more and more crowded as the day progressed. A trip to Los Angeles would not be complete without a visit to The Getty. What a generous gift to not only the people of LA, but to anyone who visits. By the way, admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GR8TravLs
50,Beautiful gardens on a hot day,We visited the Getty Centre on a hot LA day which was perfect as there was a nice breeze up there and the gardens were nice to relax in.

50,"A quick, but ""worth it"" visit to the Getty Center.","We had a few hours left in the day after we landed at the Burbank airport...before we were to meet with family for dinner. We decided to drive to the Getty Center, for lunch and to see it. It was our first time. We had a delicious lunch out on the patio by the cafeteria, and then took an architectural tour. I would highly recommend this tour. We then visited the traveling Chinese exhibit. We walked all through the gorgeous gardens, and then it was time to leave to meet up with family. Did not get into any of the other exhibits, but felt it was well worth out trip there. Would love to go again. We got there about 11:00. I would try to go as early as possible. It opens at 10:00 $15 parking, but free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeo947
50,Great art collections / great views of the city!,"The Getty Center is a huge art museum, with a lot of interesting exhibits that rotate. The views from the Getty are amazing as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,Inspiring architecture even before you go inside,"Wow!! What a wonderful example of art presentation that allows full access and viewing to the masses. I love the way the really big famous pieces are given exactly the same accessibility as the lesser pieces. The different areas of the museum all have a slightly different feel, which must be directly related to the physical nature of each of the buildings. They are all stunning and seriously impressive, as are the gardens.No charge to enter is an obvious bonus - and how all museums should be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F64FPlouisew
50,World Class Museum and Grounds,"With an ocean view, permanent art collection and changing exhibits, it should be a major destination for all.

50,World-Class Art Museum here in L.A.,"I watched the years that it took to build the Getty atop the Santa Monica mountains. It does NOT disappoint. While their magnificent Greco-Roman collection remains at the Getty's original facility, a replica of a sprawling Roman villa, built just off Pacific Coast Highway, the new museum has the highest caliber of art that exists in the world today. Best part is that it's free! You just have to arrange ahead of time so they can control the number of folks visiting on any given day. If you're an art lover, GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelarnold

50,Severely underrated!!,"We had a fabulous day at the Getty Centre. We got there for just before lunch with the intention of spending a couple of hours and then heading off to Beverly Hills. Instead we landed up staying the entire afternoon till the early hours of the evening. I love everything related to art and architecture and this place brings the two together. Designed by Richard Meirs this is one of his classic modular designs using principles of Da Vinci's golden proportions. You can see the mathematical modules repeated from tiling to glass pane and geometric forms combining with each other.And if you are not interested in this, go there for the spectacular and breath taking views of the city. The building forms a picture frame to view the city. Great for a picnic as well. It is definitely one of my favourite spots in LA. Also don't forget to look into the free tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881amritad

My kids look at Greek statues and go ""Meh"" and ""Dad, why did you bring us here? (After the Tram ride, it's all downhill from there for kids) For those of us over the age of 25?, the Getty is very interesting. I'm not a lover of antiquities, so I enjoy the architecture, the landscaping and the restaurant.AND, it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kboy00

50,Field day with kids!,"What a great thing to do with kids if you are walking up the road, watching the tram, seeing the freeway, riding the elevator, exploring the family room and the grounds of the Getty! The galeries, not so much.Enjoy your time, but pick the activities based on your kids. Playing on the sculptures is frowned upon, as is playing in the water features, running/rolling in the grass is fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198ullis

40,Very romantic architecture and view,"It is in a very romantic location with the city lights showing beautifully at sundown and a view all the way to the ocean. My first time there I was really impressed. I liked the antique furniture better than all the paintings. Some of the fantastic inlays that are in the furniture really make you go ""Wow"".You don't get to park right on the top but there are busses that take you from places where it is easy to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54aliced
50,It's all about the garden.,"I've been watching Robert Irwin's garden develop over the years since it was first opened.It's truly a work of art, at one with its setting, ever changing with the seasons.I hope they put the water back on in the stream. Drought or not, it is being constantly recycled in the system.And the museum's collection ain't bad either. Highly recommended for the first time visitor or resident of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LosAngelesLens
50,City Oasis,"Always look forward to my visits about every 3 months or so. It is an oasis above the hustle & bustle of LA traffic. With views of the ocean & city centers on the horizon, this place is a gem any time of year on any occasion. Pack up the car with as many friends as possible or go it solo, you only pay for parking & the entire day can be spent roaming the gardens & galleries at leisure. Have a pick nick on the lawn or visit the trendy outdoor caffe, you choose the flavor & extension of your stay. Watch the sunset off a balcony, play hide & seek with your kids or take selfies next to every sculpture, there is fun for every age group. Listen to Summer music or lecture about the artists & art or take a class. It's a wonderful place for a date ..... 1st or 100th !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalya24
50,Finally a museum that is tuned to its audience. Do not Miss!,"First, do not let the ""out of town"" location deter you. You can even get there by bus if you wish. You are welcomed by an automated tram and did I mention that entry is totally free. The exhibitions are well-organized to allow you to have enough space to see the exhibits. The various buildings are connected and as the weather is always nice in LA, go visit the beautiful gardens.Last but not the least, they bring amazing exhibitions.Bravo to the Getty Foundation!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/good-living-montreal
50,Fantastic facility!,"The grounds themselves are so beautiful, the architecture so stunning, I sometimes forget to even go into the galleries.

Bring a camera; photography is welcome but unfortunately tripods and monopods are not.Watch the shadows change during the day and with the seasons. The Getty Center is enjoyable all year long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASkooter
50,Great Family Outing,"The Getty is one of LA's iconic places for both tourists and locals. It's not the easiest to get to if you're not living in the LA vicinity because you have to take the dreaded 405 fwy to get there but once there, you park, take the cool shuttle up to the top of the mountain and get a breathtaking view of LA without really leaving it. The garden is beautiful, the exhibits are fun, there is a kid's space where kids can let loose and create interactive art, it's AC'd indoors, and you can either bring your own picnic or buy food from their cafe and eat in the dining area. The food is not that great in value or taste so if you're so inclined, you should bring your own food. There are many spaces, nooks, and crannies to situate yourself and take in a day at the Getty. Great place for pictures, to spend the whole day out, and to catch up with friends and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saikoxpooh

50,Amazing view!,"Take lots of pictures and take a good portion of your day to enjoy the architecture. We had an enjoyable time getting lost and finding some interesting exhibits.

50,My new favorite museum,"The Getty is what sets LA apart from every other museum in the world. First it's perched up on the hills overlooking Hollywood, one has to take a nice tram up the hills. The view alone is worth a trip to Getty. Second, the buildings and garden compliment each other so well. Third, the art collection is to die for. Special exhibit include Mogao Buddhist cave paintings from China, Mapplethrope. Getty is a leader in art research and restoration in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newtonmum

40,Very informative and engaging,"The first striking thing is the magnificent architecture, and landscape. Truly sets this museum apart. Add to that, is the fact that this is a private museum, with an impressive collection that grows over the years. Quite surprising is the free access to most parts of the museum and the conducted tours thru the day. Overall, a day well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0mestic_traveller
50,Passing by,"It's a beautiful modern building. The best thing is riding the railroad tram up to the museum.You can bring snacks and go picnic there, or eat at their cafeteria.It's very relaxing and great view.I enjoy the surroundings more than anything else.If you visit there, you might want to stop by UCLA campus as well.If you drive, would also recommend you drive through Bel Air where all the stars live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc

Located on top of a hill in Los Angeles, it affords the visitor a view of the city below, as well as a spot to idle away and enjoy the many works of art that are on display here. Tours are offered throughout the day based on a schedule, and they come highly recommended.

Admission is free, thanks to the philanthropic vision of Mr. Getty, and the Getty Trust. This place is an absolute gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ezinneu
50,Amazing,"This is such a beautiful complex of buildings and gardens. The architecture is stunning, as are the views from all of the various spots around the complex. I wouldn't recommend the architecture or garden tours. They were pretty terrible. Currently they have 3 replicas of Chinese caves from the 2nd, 6th and 7th centuries. This was a very nice exhibit. The other buildings house J. Paul Getty's art collection...which is pretty spectacular. The museum is free but the parking is $15. This is an absolute must see in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramadama
50,I didn't think it would be this good,"It is that good. Anyone interested in art should visit this museum. The collection is too vast to see in a single visit, but I urge you to get started.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncleScooge01

40,Relaxing on a hot day,This is a really great place to walk around and enjoy the art and statues. There wasn't any water in the fountain pool because it's so dry and they are trying to conserve water. We went here before going to the beach. The parking was $15. You can make an online reservation and enjoy all the art for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirbyfive
50,Nice museum with art pieces from all over the world,"This place is definitely worth seeing. The admission is free, but you have to pay for the parking ($15). After you left your car at the parking you are riding a train that gets you to the top of the mountain where the museum is located. In rainy days you can use umbrellas that the museum provides you. Thats a nice thing.The architecture of the building is very interesting and modern, there are several buildings with galleries with different arts. So you need a map to plan which galleries and art pieces you want to see there. Though this museum can't compare in amount and variety of famous art pieces as you can see in New York or in Philly, but still there are some well known Van Gogh and rembrandt's paintings.We also visited the cafe,its pricy (like in all museums), but the food was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronikak694

The short team rides then ascends to the center, a spectacular architectural composite of several buildings housing European paintings, decorative arts, and special exhibits.

Currently there an extensive collection of Rousseau's landscapes, with many pieces moaned from museums around the world. Currently there are two collections of photographs, including a special of works by Mapplethorpe. A mother current exhibit are re-created three Chinese caves from the 5th -8th century.

50,Getty tour,Excellent tour especially for people interested in museums. Would surely recommend for visitors to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajinikausalya
40,Great Art and Gardens,A trip out to the Getty Center is a must when visiting LA.

Admission is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abieb2015
50,"Go There For The ""Experience,"" Not The ""Greatest Hits""","If you're an art snob like me, you may initially turn your nose up at a museum drenched in money but with a permanent collection that anything but world class. This ain't the Metropolitan or the Louvre or the Hermitage, not even close; trust me. But if you relax your standards a bit, you'll realize, like I did, that the Getty is more about an overall art-filled experience than it is about showing off their important collection of Painter X or Sculptor Y. It's a wonderful place to spend the afternoon exploring the endlessly interesting architecture, perusing a modest collection of worthwhile, if not world-famous art, eating a fabulous meal (if you can spring for the pricey restaurant) or an utterly decent one (at the slightly less exorbitant café) and catching a bit of sun on the amazingly manicured lawn. The special exhibitions are always well-intentioned and well-executed, the panoramic views are worth the price of admission and the obvious, heartfelt commitment to the artistic life of a city that is pretty naive about such things is genuinely inspiring. Yes, go to Paris for the Mona Lisa, go to New York for Starry Night, but go to the Getty for an afternoon that will just leave you feeling good. Unlike some, this museum seems to really care about the well-being of its visitors. It shows in everything down to the smallest detail, and it's hard not to appreciate their efforts and love what they've accomplished in return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProPhotoLA
50,Wonderful museum,"What a great place and worth a visit. There are buildings with differentkinds of art, tours, and usually they have a special exhibit. Good for children since there is a children's areas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dassya722
50,Nice relaxing day when you are in Los Angeles.,This Los Angeles Iconic venue is fantastic to enjoy great Art and relax. Take a break from a hectic Los Angeles visit and enjoy the tremendous grounds and Art!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/551palles
50,Will not disappoint.,"We actually extended our trip to Southern California by one day to see the Getty Center. We went specifically for my artistic teenage daughter's birthday. She loved the rest of our trip--all the usual SoCal attractions--but this topped them all. All three of our daughters spent most of their souvenir money at the gift shop.While the Getty Center itself is free, the parking is not. We only had two or three hours to spend, so we rushed through the things we most cared about; we could easily have spent a full day here. There are gardens on the outside (not to mention those views!) and art of all kinds on the inside, so there's plenty to do inside and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44sabrinac
50,Great art. Spectacular grounds and views of West LA.,"I am a casual museum-goer and not an expert. This site is set up as multiple buildings with permanent and temporary exhibits located around a spacious outdoor plaza. On a 'good weather day' this place is spectacular. The open-air vibe, compelling architecture, outstanding gardens, and fantastic views of West L.A. (including the beaches) make this more than just a museum. I could spend hours here just taking photos! The art is top notch, but not as comprehensive as with larger museums such as the Met in NYC.Museum is free to enter, but costs $15 to park. Since this is on a hilltop adjacent to Sepulveda and the 405, there is no convenient free off site parking. There are the usual gift shops and places to eat on site.Be aware of the traffic, however. Your travel time here will greatly depend on how bad the 405 and Sepulveda are backed up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinGator
50,Sublime architecture and stunning gardens,Loved the exhibitions but it was the architecture and grounds that blew me away the most. Take a picnic and breathe in the surroundings - SUPERB!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewt423
40,"Art Works A+, Food a D.","We toured the Getty Villa in the morning, then the Center in the afternoon in order to pay for parking only once. The Getty Center art is really, really good. There are 4 buildings of art, plus a special exhibit. We were disappointed with the gardens - they are not as pretty as those at the Villa. The food at the Cafe at the Center is really overpriced and not very good. I would recommend the Villa for gardens, the Center for art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckBrooks
50,Beautiful experience,"We just happened on this tour because the actual house was closed on Monday's. We loved this tour, I felt like we were in Europe not LA! It was free and peaceful. Full of ancient history and helps us realize how small we are compared to the longevity of ancient artifacts . This is great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vgillhooper

50,A great day out,"This was top of my list of things to do in my first trip to LA - and it didn't disappoint. Spent a whole Saturday here, leaving about 5 pm when crowds were still coming in. So much to do and see and all the exhibitions I went through were well laid out in bite size galleries. This meant nothing seemed intimidating and I felt I saw all that I wanted to, unlike say in the huge museums such as the Louvre or the British Museum when you always feel you've missed something.I did wonder how families might have dealt with the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition which those not fully aware of part of his oeuvre might have unwittingly stumbled into some photos they'd rather not their kids see. To be fair there were signs but I wouldn't be surprised if some missed them and stumbled into what would be rather shocking images even for most adults.That aside, they were many families and the center does obviously put a lot of effort into keeping kids entertained.Location is of course stunning with wonderful views of LA and all the way to Santa Monica - selfie heaven.Getting there I chose to leave the rental car in the hotel and use Uber - a sensible decision especially if you're new to driving in the US. And as I was leaving (took about 20 mins for an Uber pick up) the queue to get in the parking was huge - and that was for the evening.Has to be on your must-do list in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevehR6324RG
50,AMAZING Japanese Garden!,We have been here before a few times. My really FAVORITE is the Japanese Garden!Besides you can admire art collections from different cultures and different parts of the world!If you have the choice try to avoid a very hot day so you can make the most out of your Garden experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837manuelv

50,"""Incredible displays and views""","What's not to like?

Incredible view of LA from this vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9652GMkathyk
50,Great View,"If you like to be around beautiful things, you will love the Getty Center. Great art collection as well as other exibithions throughout the year. The garden and the architecture are gorgeous, as well as the view...specially durind sunset! It´s one of my favorite spots in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATranqui

50,first time visit,I went with my family for the first time. I'm impressed with the disney style order in handling crowds. The tram was excellent. Very efficient. The museum was great. Laid out very well. We spend 5 hour there looking through everything. I would highly recommend going. Free to go. Parking 15 dollars/underground ( nice on a hot day) Def go to,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertthedentist
40,The garden is the real gem,"The Getty center is definitely one of the top things to see in LA. The buildings and the park alone are worth the visit. The collection is interesting and even if not extraordinary it contains few hidden gems, like the Angel of the Citadel from Marino Marini. But the real gem is the garden. And if you have the chance, get a guided tour through it. You will discover many flowers and plants, beside understanding the architect's idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StefaniaT496
50,Take the time and visit the Getty,"You can read enough about the Getty to know that it is worth a visit, and I will only add that as a very seasoned museum goer, it is one of the finest in the world. To the art-phobic I say this: go anyway. This is one of the most beautiful buildings in the US, on a spectacular setting that invites you to linger and enjoy the experience. It is on of the most person-friendly museums I have ever visited: warm, welcoming, unpretentious, with ample room to move around, in and out of the exhibition spaces. Despite huge crowds, there is no cattle-herd vibe like you find in many (ex: The Louvre). Take your time and take it in. Just don't do Universal Studios on the same day. Shrek 4-D and Robert Mapplethorpe's sublime flowers just don't mix in anyone's brain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott_R_Seattle
50,"A collection of Roman, Byzantine, Greek art/sculpture and more to rival any museum.","Don't miss this beautiful palace by the sea. The collection of ancient art work is museum level in an amazing setting. This mansion/palace is overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. It's stunning. A real feast for the eyes. Entry is free, but you need a timed entry ticket. Parking is $15 or $10 after 3pm. That price is small when compared to what some museums charge and the collection is unreal that one man acquired all these antiquities. They have different special exhibits and events monthly, so check out their website to plan your visit.This is a must while in the area and you have about 4 hours to spare to enrich your life.I would add that it's not necessarily a place for kids. No touching exhibits and considering the content - more for young adults or adults. There is a serenity here people come to experience on the grounds. The outdoor fountain pool area is stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valogreeneyez
50,Wonderful and relaxing!,"Getty Center is beautiful and a great place to visit. Although there is a $15 parking fee, admission is free. Still a great bargain and wonderful get away from the craziness of LA. No doubt one of our favorite places to visit in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackpotmom
50,One of my favorite museums in LA,This museum houses the Getty collection which specializes in photography. They have bought or licensed so many iconic images as well as many others that you won't have seen. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
50,Wow!,"I expected a pretty building in downtown LA. But this place is mid-blowing, set up on a hill. I've been to a number of major museums around the world, so I wan't sure what to expect. I love the Impressionists, and I was not disappointed in the collection here, given the relative newness of the museum.The highlight here is the architecture of the buildings, the display rooms, the flow of the museum, the gardens and the view. This is rated the #1 attraction in LA, as it should be. Take the time to see it. take the architecture tour too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335howards
40,Breathing room!,"Great exhibits and peaceful exterior spaces make visiting the Getty a pleasant experience. See some art, have some breathing room in the courtyard, visit another gallery, have some breathing room in the garden...It's free to enter, with paid parking at the bottom of the hill; opt to walk the .75 miles uphill to the center, or take the free tram. Dining is overpriced ($3 can of Diet Coke, for example) and prices for the same items varied depending on where purchased.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kris_K_D
50,One of the great galleries,Definitely worth a visit. The permanent collection is exceptional and the latest special exhibition about the cave temples of Dunhuang was a revelation. Beautiful setting and very special architecture and gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH29
50,Meticulously arranged exhibits,"The themed displays every once in a while are quite well put-together and contain more than can be discovered in a single perusal, so it's nice to be able to see them a couple of times. It's great for a one time visit too, though. A beautiful place to just relax in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moupim
50,"Free to visit, Great for the whole family",Park your car and walk to the tram ( parking costs $15). It will take you up the mountain to a beautiful building and grounds.

40,Beautiful views,"The Getty Center, for starters its free admission and only 10 for parking. Many beautiful paintings to look at. They have an ancient Asian exhibit and floral garden. The best part of this place in my opinion is the beautiful views of LA you will see up there. Great place to go on a lunch date. You can bring your lunch, there are many places (including tables) to eat and enjoy the scenery",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mortiz8387
50,Amazing,"We saw parts of this museum as we drove up the freeway from LA. Great car park and a cute little train to take you up a couple of hundred feet to the museum area. What an expanse! The various galleries and buildings are well spaced. The views are brilliant. Statues and sculptures everywhere. What a range of exhibits and not enough time to see everything. The photographs, rooms, furniture and gift shops. Great restrooms and cafes. What a great experience, then again the great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikethenailer
50,The Getty Center,"The Getty center is the most important building/site to see in Los Angeles.The buildings themselves are beautiful; the garden is an experience; the views, from all over the center are views that you cannot see anywhere else in the city. The museum is interesting and educational; the main restaurant is one of the best fine dining restaurants in the city. If you have guests coming to Los Angeles, this is a number one place to take them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marians958
50,"Spectacular architecture, lush landscaping, amazing views of LA & great art exhibits--for FREE!","The Getty Center is a must-see in Los Angeles--not only for tourists, but also for local residents. First, it is a beautiful place, immaculately maintained. Second, it's FREE! In these times where tourist attractions & art offerings (of any kind) are getting financially out of reach for people of average means, the Getty Center is a wonderfully welcome way for everyone to enjoy world-class art in a gorgeous setting.Although there is a reasonable parking fee, a free shuttle takes visitors from the parking structure up the hill to the Getty Center, which is a lovely campus composed of different buildings housing different kinds of art--both permanent collections & rotating special exhibits. On our most recent visit, we saw a cutting-edge show of late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's work & also a series of recreated ""caves"" with ancient artwork recently discovered in China--so there's always something for everyone here!On weekend nights in the summer, there are outdoor concerts & other special events scheduled that would be appropriate for families & people of any age.I highly recommend this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb
50,Beautiful center,This is a very good place to go for dates as well as family outings. I highly recommend going to Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730chandnis
50,One of the best places in LA to step away from the madness,"My wife used to work here, so I have visited numerous times. That was over a decade ago, and the Getty forever remains one of my favorite places to take out of town visitors (and now that I don't live in LA, I still like to visit for myself when in town.) I don't have a lot to say about the art collection. There is definitely some really interesting art here, worth seeing... but I can only spend an hour or so in any museum before I start to feel visually full. However, the Getty is more than an art museum. The architecture, the views, the grounds are the main attraction for me. It's a great place to have a picnic. DEFINITELY take the free, docent-led architecture tour... I've done that several times (some tour guides are better than oterhs.) It's fascinating to understand the history, the inspiration, and the aesthetics that brought this place into being: an energetic hub of Los Angeles situated on a mountaintop, overlooking the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43carlb
50,Getty on a West Los Angeles hill.,"The Getty not only has beautiful pieces of art but a beautiful location as well as great architecture. The museum is free but parking is about $15 per car. The view of the city is great from the hillside location. Try to visit when the museum is open late. It is fun to watch the sun set over Los Angeles and Santa Minica.The Malibu Getty is another great location. Free, but like the WLA location, there is a parking fee.Always a good idea to have a reservation. But a must at Malibu. This is because both museums have limited parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneHolmerSmith
50,Love the Getty!,"The Getty offers some of the best views of LA. The art collection isn't the most iconic, but they do have a great variety of art and furniture from the Baroque up to contemporary art. The photography exhibit changes often, and they do get some great special exhibits.I take all of my visitors to LA to the Getty--I will never get sick of the architecture, the cafes, the galleries, and the gardens! A great way to spend a day in LA.Admission is free but parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyp167

50,WOW!,I had heard of the Getty but didn't know much about it. We were visiting our son who suggested we visit the Getty. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the buildings. We spent some of our time viewing exhibits but to be honest I spent quite a bit of time admiring the architecture and reading about how the building was designed and constructed. We ate at the cafe which was pleasant. I'm looking forward to returning at some point when we come back to S Cal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637guyr
50,An amazing place to visit even if the artwork is not your focus,"This is really a must do for anyone visiting Los Angeles. Apart from its extensive collection of artwork, this is such an amazing facility architecturally, from the fine detail to the imposing but human friendly scale. There are so many places just to sit and admire the view or soak up the atmosphere. And all for just the cost of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsaym731
50,An amazing place to take a breath in L.A.,"I went visiting L.A. during the memorial long weekend. This is the first time I went to L.A., and to be honest, this city is too crowed and the traffic is too scary......So the Getty center is a good place to slow down and take a breath. This museum is so good and you can see so many things here.....Painting...Antiques....varieties of collection here that you could ever imagined. So if you have a chance to visit L.A., don't forget to come to here and enjoy the art and beautiful gardens here. Recommend to everybody.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yangor
50,The Getty presentation is something to see and experience.,"I was introduced to the Getty by a good friend and residence of Hollywood, who though that i should see the Getty, because of my interest in architecture, music, and art. I was impressively awed by the high level of attenuation to detail form the moment I arrived. Access to the Getty was easy and well defined. The parking garage set the stage for a cool, relaxing and comfortable walk into the impressive world that the Getty shares with the pubic. The staff at every location throughout the facility was polite, knowledgeable and most courteous, Each exhibit hall was designed with ample wall space for a non-cluttered presentation. This enables one to view and absorb the beauty of each piece. The collections are expressive and impressive and give one the opportunity to view the works of our worlds greatest innovators in the art world. artist.There is always a need for one to take a break from and relief of the intense upload of visual information. The relief is with the cool open space between the ever-flowing beautiful buildings and their placement upon the hill. The view of Los Angeles is spectacular and breathtaking, and comforted by the meticulously detailed and beautifully maintained landscape within which the Getty is set. The Getty offers more than one can imagine. I highly suggest you to visit The Getty as a ""must see and experience"" this beautifully assembled and powerful cultural experience.Sincerely,Jennings",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525jenningsm
50,Great,"The Getty center is wonderful for all the art lovers out there it is an eclectic display which is pleasing to all.

Great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357chantelleh
40,Beautiful museum and great family attraction,"My husband and I took our girls (10 and 13) to visit the Getty last week. We all truly enjoyed the museum. It was much larger than I expected with five buildings to tour. It had primarily paintings (all classical, nothing ""modern"" at the time), but they also had some religious art, antiques (books and furniture), and a handful of sculptures (most of their sculptures are at the Villa location). They also had a beautiful garden exhibit. Our only disappointment was their cafe which was pricier than Disneyland's restaurants (and we ate at their cheaper eatery...there's a fancier restaurant as well). The food was decent, though the portions on the pizzas were pretty tiny. I'd skip it and eat before/after your visit. We spent about four hours at the museum and saw pretty much everything at a decent, leisurely pace. Entrance to the museum is free, but you have to pay for parking. There's a tram from the parking garage to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FAMVACLasVegas
50,A really great experience,"We spent a grey drizzly day, yes they do have them in California in June, in the Getty Center. It was wonderful, the Art is of course amazing but the building itself is worth visiting, with wonderful shapes and views. The staff both the volunteers and actual curators were friendly and would go out their way , literally, in one case to help.The special Exhibition on the Duanhuang Caves was fascinating and well presented.Don't believe them if they say you can get round in three hours, we spent five hours there and skipped an awful lot of the permanent exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyL458
50,Beautiful architecture + art,"It´s worth the trip just for it´s architecture. Even people that aren´t that much into the topic will like to wak around the terrace, garden and galleries. They are very prepared for foreign visitors and have audio tours in many languages.From up there you can see L.A skyline and the San Francisco Highway. A must-see for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510anav
50,"First class museum, but be sure not to miss the free garden tour","I went there for the first time with a friend. We visited the Dunhuang caves replicas, as well as the exhibit, but for me the real highlight was the free garden tour. My friend, who was there at least 4-5 times before, found so many things pointed out to him that he never noticed during the tour. It was so informative and interesting, it was really fun. They have the tour a few times a day, be sure no to miss it! I'll sure go back for another visit the next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NameisAlreadyTaken02
50,"Plan to spend the day, there is art, gardens and lunch to enjoy.","I was so pleased to find a place to spend the day while in L.A. on business. We had just about 6 hours and that wasn't even enough time - in my opinion. We had reservations at the restaurant and enjoyed an expensive, but special lunch, toured the many art exhibits and took the complementary garden and architectural tours. I recommend the guided tours. We enjoyed the architectural tour the most. Be sure to have your camera ready for the garden. It is very large and the history behind the design in certainly interesting. I can't believe this is tucked in alongside a major freeway. Easy off and on. I recommend arriving first thing in the mornings. The lines were already forming for the up travel up the hill to the center. Parking is underground and easy, but that too fills up quickly. If I lived in L.A. I would certainly hold a membership here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolDeland
50,"FANTASTIC MUSEUM, VIEWS, FUN DAY & IT'S FREE!!!","Situated up in the hills of LA near Brentwood, this museum houses numerous works of arts initially amassed by J. Paul Getty. In 1982, it became the world's wealthiest museum from an $1.2B inheritance. It's one of the most expensive museum built in the world (if not the most expensive:$1.3B) Over the years, it has acquired more and more artwork. Entrance is free (parking is not) and there's a tram or funicular that takes you up the museum. View is amazing (LA Skyline, San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains as well as the Pacific Ocean). The gardens are spectacular. You can bring your own food and have a picnic. Or dine in and enjoy its terrific restaurant. I regularly come to bring visiting family and friends and the museum never cease to impress me with its views, architecture, art works, exhibits new and old, and gardens. One of our visit was on a Sat afternoon and there was a open concert. Music added fun and entertainment to our touristy, educational trip. Apparently, they have scheduled musicians on Sat afternoon (not sure whether it's every Sat). Not to be missed when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosario308
50,Must see in LA!,"The Getty Center has so much to offer in terms of a rich cultural experience. The architecture itself was beyond impressive, the landscaping was breathtaking, and the exhibits exquisite. I could have spent a week there taking it all in! After I spent a few hours looking at only a couple exhibits, I retreated outside to the cafe patio, which was a great on the go lunch. Then I just spent some time reading in the garden- one of the most relaxing parts of my vacation! As far as parking/ tram- not bad at all. The transportation system is very efficient and the experience is worth any minor inconveniences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacjohnson869
40,Good place If you are into all sort of ART,"We got to the car park early and still had to go down, down down to the 4th level of the car park. Came up the lift to hundreds of people queued up to get on the little 2 carriage train that takes you up to the top, ushers were telling people to walk the 15 minutes to the top as they would be waiting longer than 15 minutes to get a ride up to the top.So we walked. The views were amazing, the gardens lovely, coffee shops and restaurant at the top, very pricey. The buildings are amazing and the contents while not our cup of tea was overwhelming. Great if you are into that sort of thing you could spend a lot of time going from room to room, building to building. Lots of people around for the Memorial Day weekend.You only pay $15 they say It is for parking, keep your ticket with you, that you get when entering the car park, so that you can pay at different ticket booths that are located in many places, prior to you exiting the car park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697tinas

Give yourself about 3-4 hours for the visit.

50,Exibition,"I returned to the Getty for the Maplethorpe Exibition. In addition there was an Exibition of 19 C photography from the Wagstaff collection. Both are worth the trip. WARNING. The Maplethorpe Exibition is not for children nor folks offended by nudity.The Getty understood the value of Photography as art early on and has acquired an amazing collection. To their credit, after Christopher Knight's expose' in the LA times they are on track and have really beefed up the permanent collection. The restaurant turns out superior food in a beautiful setting. This is a great venue for locals and out of town folks. We try to see all the exhibit the Getty has to offer. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5547ZTrichardw

I hadn't visited it since major renovations years ago and I can't remember the time that I visited as a kid. needless to say the place is breathtaking. I wasn't prepared though for all that it takes to get there. I was meeting my family friends for lunch and didn't factor in the time for parking and taking the tram/train up there so I was embarrassingly late. expect that process to take anywhere from 30-45 min before setting foot in museum grounds. but even that experience is enjoyable; watching the people and enjoying the views of the neighborhood homes on the hills was fun. we finally arrived and enjoyed lunch at the restaurant. afterward we strolled around the museum grounds and relaxed on the grass while the kids ran around. you can have a great time here and not even see any exhibits. we explored only a part of the grounds so i can't wait to return and have a proper visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dexter619
40,Really nice location,"It's worth a visit only to see the great architecture, let alone the huge exhibition! We went there around 5 pm, it was really quiet since most of the big groups went home already. We almost had the place to ourselves! We really enjoyed the stunning views and the different exhibitions. Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaswG3085EU
50,Enjoyed this museum inside and out!!,"Today was overcast and cool but we were able to enjoy it by being both inside and out at the Getty Center Museum in Brentwood. The museum is free and the only thing you have to pay for is the parking. A tram takes you to the top of the mountain where the museum steps are located. We got timed tickets for the special exhibit on our way in. Using the free head set, we set off indoors with a guided tour of the museum's artworks on display. Amazing collection in a beautiful setting. They also offer an online ""search and find"" tour if you come with kids who may not enjoy looking at all the museum has to offer. Because of the many buildings, you get to wander inside and out, enjoying the many scenic views of LA in every direction. Outside, the offerings are just as wonderful. Beautiful gardens to walk through on a path that takes you zig zag down so you do not miss a single bloom. You end up overlooking a picturesque fountain surrounded with flowers of every color. People were picnicking on the grounds. We ate at the cafe and found it very reasonable and good food! We were there for 3+hours and did not see it all! Bring sunglasses and comfy shoes! They have rain/sun umbrellas at each building too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maggie215
50,Take the Architecture Tour,I enjoyed my day at The Getty. I especially enjoyed the 45-minute Architecture Tour. It was fascinating to hear about and see how the campus was designed---and to hear stories about how architect Richard Meier had to keep the property owners at the bottom of the hill happy during planning and construction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingGuy
50,Fantastic - The greatest experience of L.A.,"The Getty Center is an amazing museum of art. Everything is organized in an excellent way and the impressive museum buildings (an art exhibition itself) are situated on hills above L.A.Skip Hollywood, Beverly Hills etc and go for the Getty Center instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526max
40,Gorgeous views!,"The Getty Center is a gorgeous museum. The grounds are spectacular and offer wonderful views and the art is amazing. I went on a bright summer day and it got very warm there, much too warm for a picnic outdoors. Choose a more temperate day and you can eat outside when you need a break from the museum. Sign up for tours early and arrive early. They get full fast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sindbat
50,Must see in LA,"This place is so good. Even if you don't appreciate museums\exhibitions, the view is still nice. They have a wonderful garden and getting there from the parking lot by the tram or by walking is also a nice experience.We visited on our way from Hollywood to Santa Monica and enjoyed it very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danihalf
50,Spectacular,"This is easily one of the best private museums in the world. Keep aside a full day to see the gems and stroll through the building and gardens. Look online for free tours that you can join.Tip: get in early - parking fills up quick. Lots of school trips and kids around, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shivs
50,Bring your sun glasses,"Great place to go. But everything is outside is white marble, so bring your sun glasses. Even better, go visit the Getty Villa museum in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899
50,A Special Place to See Time and Time Again,"If you enjoy beautiful paintings, by greats like Rembrandt, Manet, Degas, Renoir, and Van Gogh, exquisite sculptures set in creative gardens, amazing architecture, and incredible antique French furniture, then you will adore this museum.I recommend the following:(1) Get there about 9:30 AM for good parking, which is located at the intersection of Sepulveda and Getty Center Drive. If you are going north on Sepulveda, you will make a left turn into the parking garage. Take a ticket and then you can pay in numerous places at the center. Do not leave your ticket in the car--take it with you. We paid at a machine right where you wait for the tram when you leave--it was quick and easy and took my debit card ($15 to park). The tram and garden are open at 9:30 with the center opening at 10 AM. We were so glad we got there early.(2) Immediately proceed to get the special exhibition ticket for the Cave Temples of Dunhuang (you get a specific time and we got our tickets for 10:15--no wait and still nice and cool for viewing. If you are going after September 4th, then see what is the special exhibition at that time and get those tickets first.(3) After viewing the caves (or other specialty exhibition), I recommend taking the Collection Highlights Tour, which is a one hour overview of major works. You tell the information desk (lobby left as you enter the center) that you'd like to take the tour and they will tell you to be there about 10 minutes before the tour starts. You can check out the gift shop and then it's time to sit on the waiting seats for the 11:00 AM tour. The docent will ask you all to line up and give you hearing devices--quite nice. They tell funny anecdotes and interesting details.(4) After the highlights tour, it's time for lunch. I recommend the downstairs café for the best prices and good selections. The Mexican food and sweet potato fries were loved by our group. Expect to spend about $10 - $15 per person.(5) Now, it's time for a garden tour. The front information desk will most likely direct you to a shady spot just to the right under some trees. You can grab an umbrella to keep the sun off of you but don't take on if you are also trying to hold a camera and take photos. We took the 12:30 garden tour and the volunteer guide, a landscape architect from Budapest whose name escapes me, was marvelous.We ended our day after the garden tour just due to fatigue. This is a museum you can go to time and time again. The ancient Roman art collection is at the Getty Villa in Malibu. The parking for the day covers both facilities but we were too tired to do both museums in one day. Please note that this is not an interactive museum (like the science & technology museums) for children; however, they have special art classes & talks for children you can find out about ahead of time. Most of the tourists' children within the facility seemed bored and only smiled when running around on the grass in the garden or splashing their feet in the fountain stream. I'd plan ahead for one of the art classes if you're bringing young children.I hope this review is helpful. ~Lori",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorisJ1821NM
50,Getty Centre an amasing place and a must visit when in Los Angeles,"The Getty Centre houses an amazing selection of painting, Sculpture, Decorative Arts, Manuscripts and exhibitions. The Getty Centre is free and an be reached by public bus from either Los Angeles City or the coastal areas of Santa Monica or Venice Beach.There are several reasonable places to choose to eat within the centre. There is a restaurant, café, garden terrace cafe as well as coffee carts. We lunched at the Garden Terrace Café and found it had a reasonable range of options and was cheap and enjoyable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432SandyM
50,#1 choice to take my out of town visitors,"The center is not only gorgeous, beautiful but informative, spacious and no admission. The only thing you have to pay is parking, $15 but if you go to both Getty villa and center on the same day, the fee covers both. Right now they have the display of caves of Dunhuang till September 1. First go to the information desk to get your timed ticket for cave visit, then go and line up for the 3D display, may takes 20 minutes wait and then see the exhibition next door. The cave entrance may takes up to 5 hours wait, so go and visit all other galleries first. The garden is a must visit even you have a short visit or you are too tired. You own't regret. When the flowers are in bloom, it is just beautiful and what a wonderful stroll to see different kinds of species of flowers and vegetation.Of course the galleries are super wonderful. Make sure you give yourself a whole day to visit and enjoy jewel in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
40,"Beautiful Architecture, Gardens, and Art Collection","The Getty Center is a close get away from the bustle of downtown Los Angeles. After paying $15 for parking, you take the free tram up to The Getty Center. Enjoy the views overlooking LA and its freeway as you go up and prepared to be stunned by the beautiful buildings, gardens and artwork. You can easily spend hours here just wandering around. Also, the garden area may be closed if it just rained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewW6413
50,For everyone,"This place is for everyone. Parking costs about $15.00 but there is no entrance fee or fee for the tram. It does get very busy, we had a half hour wait for the tram. Then it was up the hill for amazing views of the city and the typical Richard Meier architecture curves, lots of them. The complex is well integrated into the landscape and takes advantage of the views of the coast and urban landscape with some pretty amazing homes on the Bel Air hills. There are huge public spaces including gardens and water features. The museum covers centuries and various forms of art including photography and sculpture. The permanent collection is a wide range of painters ranging many centuries including impressionism and pre-impressionist works check out 'irises' by Van Gogh. Count on a full day to enjoy the site and the exhibits when we were there the Dunghan caves exhibit was on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppynic
50,Beautiful landscaping and art,I highly recommend the Getty Center both for the art work along with the beautiful landscaped gardens and views. The Getty Center is well worth a days outing and also caters very well for elderly or any persons in a wheel chair. There is plenty of seating and 'rest' areas around both in the building and out in the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678pattib
40,Beautiful Views and Art,"We skipped the tram and walked the path to the Center. Easy walk and you get to take in the views. Once up top views even more impressive. The art and sculpture collections are impressive. The Central Garden is a must see. One can relax all day on the benches reading, writing or people watching. Will be back again. Parking is easy $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveR364
50,"By architect Richard Meier, iconic","Quite typical of RM architecture ie. White cladding and curves, lots of them. The complex is well integrated into the landscape and takes advantage of the views of the coast and urban landscape.The public spaces are alive all day and the gardens a respite from the cultural events. The museum covers centuries and various forms of art including photography. Mapplethorpe was covered in May, quite daring but well worth while. The permanent collection is a wide range of painters ranging many centuries. Count on a full day to enjoy the site and the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ross086
50,Must See!,"Price is right (free – other than parking) and the view is spectacular. Even if art is not really your thing, the buildings, grounds, views and gardens are worth the trip.We took one of the Highlight tours. It focused on a few pieces and provided some in depth information that made the experience more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianew166
50,The Dunghan Caves exhibit is not to be missed!,"This is a spectacular exhibit. Two caves have been completely reconstructed on site and one was moved as is from China. Absolutely stunning! I had never heard of these caves before but they are a UNESCO world heritage site. The visit begins with a 6-minute 3D video presentation and then original artifacts in a separate area, one of which is the Diamond Sutra, the oldest printed book in human history. There are hundreds of caves in this area in China which was on the Silk Road. Makes me dream of taking a trip to see it all. If you have more energy after this exhibit, there is a lot more to see, of course. We're particularly fans of impressionism and pre-impressionist works and one of my favorite paintings of all time, IRISES by Van Gogh is at the Getty. Take the bus instead of driving and you won't have to pay the $10-$15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maringfro
50,A must see!,A diverse selection of unique art exhibits. The buildings and gardens are absolutely breathtaking. You must visit if you are in the area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaylaK493

50,world class and wonderful,"The Getty Center is architecturally-impressive and unique. Its collections are extensive and varied. The gift shop is good and the café on the terrace is convenient and pleasant. For the 13 dollar parking fee, you get admission to the entire center. Take the tram to the center from the parking area, or walk up the driveway if you'd prefer a little exercise. The staff was helpful and friendly. I'd advise getting there early: My wife and I arrived at 9:58 AM for a 10 AM opening and there was already traffic and a line-up! This is a world-class treasure trove. Take your time. Set aside a day--or break your visit into a few days--in order to savor a little bit of everything there is to see. Our focus was the 19th century European paintings and the Mapplethorpe photos, but there was much more to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yodelman
40,Good but Not as Good as LACMA,"The Getty Center is a good museum. It's divided into several wings, and each has something interesting to offer. The collection of European art is not bad (a lot of Monets), and there is something interesting to be seen in each wing. Even so, I found it to be inferior to LACMA purely as a museum.In addition, the Getty is very difficult to reach: you need to come by private car (and parking in the only parking lot costs money, so effectively the museum isn't free), and then you are taken by some kind of funicular to the actual museum. Speaking of non-free, since the site is so isolated, you can't just come out and grab a bite to eat, so if you spend enough time here you'll want to eat, and the only choice is the overpriced museum cafeteria. I recommend bringing food in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
50,World class,"Commanding view of LA, Bel Air and Westwood. Beautiful architecture, sculptures and gardens. Admission is free but you pay to park and then tram from the parkade to the galleries. The time commitment is a minimum of 2 hours, but 4 to 6 is better. The galleries hold a priceless collection of the last 500 years of western art; as good as I've seen outside the Louvre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelh409
40,Nice place for a half day visit,"Great view of the city, fantastic architecture and lay-out, decent exhibits. I find the rotating collections to have been quite good - the permanent collections leave a lot to be desired. But its worth taking the tram up, seeing the view, getting a bit of art in, and then continuing on with your day. Try The Restaurant up there - quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngusRodrigo

50,Absolutely amazing!,"Loved everything about the Getty. The price is right ;-). The grounds are immaculate. The views are spectacular. It's absolutely a place to go if you want to see LA from the top of everything. Plus, ate in the Cafe with the family for lunch. Pretty tasty food :-). And a very solidly curated gift shop for those who have to take something home from everywhere they go. Absolutely something to put on your agenda list for a few days in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriseV8121GS
50,Fantastic Place,"A gift from The Getty Foundation is this wonderful museum/venue which is perched high on a hill overlooking Los Angeles.

((smog/fog) may limit views so if possible take these conditions into account While the museum is free parking is mandatory unless using mass transit or taxi/uber. No convenient parking outside, and sidewalks are not available most of the way on Sepulveda, a very busy street.The exhibits are in multiple buildings and include most of the collection except for the Roman greek and other ancient pieces which are in the villa in malibu miles away from the center.The free tours are very worth the time.One can picnic on the grounds and there is food for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fem2015
40,Eclectic art collection in an architecturally unique building,"The Getty collection is a great museum to visit in LA. First off the architecture provides so much natural light, giving the place an ephemeral feel. The medieval European art (pre-Renaissance) collection is good as well as the Dutch masters. I would spend most of my time here. The historical manuscript collection is interesting as well. The 19th century European collection is spotty; clearly Getty started collecting these pieces late because he does not have marquee pieces but earlier, insignificant works of these artists. The photography and more modern art collections are not to my taste, so we skipped these. The Getty also had an interesting Chinese art visiting exhibition; I'm sure they have great collections touring there often.The best part of the Getty collection is actually the Getty Villa in Malibu. That is a separate museum which I rate as 5 out of 5. If limited on time, go to the Villa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej

But this Museum is such an expansion, and what a beautiful setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmccross
50,Always a joy,Art + view + food + location = bliss! I always love going even though I am a native Angeleno and have been numerous times. I also take out of town guests. Their permanent collection is magnificent and they always have something interesting going on. Now that you don't need reservations for parking it is even sweeter. Try it at night under the stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanelizabethhp
40,Good Art; Spectacular Architecture and Gardens,"Being an angelino, I've been to The Getty Center perhaps half a dozen times. The last time was approximately 6 weeks ago. There was an excellent Mapplethorpe photography exhibit and a fine exhibit of Flemish tapestries. But the highlight was, as it always is, the architecture of The Getty Center itself.....simply stunning! The gardens are also amazing. If you're coming to LA for the first time or are a repeat visitor, but have never been to The Getty Center, please put it on your 'Must See' list. And, if you want a special treat, have lunch in the Center's restaurant....it's pricey, but when you're in Valhalla, you want to eat with the Gods are having.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyT684

We are so glad this was recommended to us, as it was an incredible experience.There is a small monorail ride up to the museum from the car park and entry to the museum is free. I would recommend getting there early enough to spend a few hours there, we got there a bit too late and only allowed 1.5 hours which was a mistake as we missed a lot because of this.All in all we had a great day and would recommend going here on a sunny day so that you can enjoy the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalalaurenr

The docents are very knowledgable and so pleased to be there. Then we split into ones and twos to see exhibits of special interest - Robert Mapplethorpe, The Silk Road, post-impressionists.

50,A day well spent in a beautiful place!,"It was my first time going to The Getty. I'd never been to such a vast art museum before, so I was very excited to see what it had in store. For one, the center itself is gorgeous. The architecture is thought out, clean, and futuristic. The views from the building overlook LA and are simply breathtaking. You can see the entire city from the museum.On the inside, it's just as awesome. I checked out the Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium exhibition, and it had over 100 of his photographs.The European paintings were magnificent. Most of them went all the way back to the 1700's, and we're still vibrant and detailed.The coolest exhibition had to be the Cave Temples of Dunhuang. It's the Buddhist art from China's Silk Road. The museum has actual replicas of the caves, so you feel like you're walking into the caves and experiencing all the art and storytelling. It's amazing!The museum is very large, so it definitely can take up most of your day, but it is so worth it because there are so many beautiful things to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliaformica
50,Great Museum and almost free,"The Getty Center is free to see except that you have to pay $15 to park in their underground garage. The architecture is quite interesting and there are plenty of interesting paintings to make an afternoon fly by. The Gettys lean toward Renaissance art and it's collection is limited when it comes to Expressionism although they had a Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and the other usual suspects. The audio tour is also free and well worth getting. I learned a lot from their narratives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanceMan00

50,"Spectacular Views, Stunning Architecture","There are very few places in Los Angeles where you'll find a better view of the city than The Getty Center and Museum. Perched high atop a hill, the Center offers both gorgeous views of the surrounding area and also beautiful modern architecture.The Center was even featured in the movie Star Trek: Into Darkness, as Starfleet Headquarters, and it manages to look both futuristic and elegant—testament to the genius of its architect Richard Meier.From the parking garage, visitors are taken uphill to the Center by a sleek electric train, and can explore the complex at leisure. The art and sculpture collections are housed in five different buildings and in-between are gorgeous landscaped plaza, reflecting pools, and fountains (though as of this review they've all been drained by water because of a severe drought). There is also a huge Central Garden that was designed by artist Robert Irwin.The art collection has some wonderful works by Van Gogh, Gauguin, Rembrandt and Degas, and they also have photo exhibits that feature different works over time.Every part of this complex is ridiculously picturesque but make sure to go outside the galleries to the back of the complex where you'll find breathtaking views.There is also a cafeteria and a cafe, and make sure you save some time for the gift shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GilCheah
50,World Treasure!!!!,The Getty Center is truly a world treasure! The architecture and the inspiration in this mountain top museum is breathtaking. Visitors from all over the world come to see Richard Meier's famous creation. The views looking out to the sea are awe inspiring and the entire layout of the museum is delightful. The collections and exhibits are always wonderful and it makes this a place one should visit often. The food service is outstanding and the staff among the best of any museum I have ever visited. The guided tours of the grounds and the exhibits are always informative and the docents provide an exceptional educational experience. The organization at the museum is first class and I enjoy visiting here often not only to admire the exhibits but also for the serenity of the complex and the happy feeling I leave with always.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normana698

It isn't a negative, just a heads up. There are elevators inside but the outdoor stuff is steps. Views are absolutely worth it!Parking is $15 and a little limited but admission is free. Food is available & a little pricey but don't miss this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbor

50,Couldn't Rate This High Enough - Outstanding!!!!,"The Getty Center was an unexpected gem and really the highlight to our trip to LA. Admission is free, but there is a $15.00 charge to park or you can take the Metro. The center is huge and I suggest you look at the website and get an idea beforehand as to what you want to see. We came initially to see the illuminated manuscripts displaying until the end of June. The exhibit was beautiful, well put together allowing a close up view of these beautiful, priceless pieces from around the world. We also enjoyed seeing gorgeous paintings from Rembrandt, Goya, Monet and Van Gogh's Irises. Stunning!!!!!The Getty Villa is about a half hour away. I didn't realize that, so we weren't able to make it there. Just a heads up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdxtraveler52
50,"Superb architecture, views and art","Stopped off here after a quick visit to Venice beach. I was in awe of the beautiful stone sweeping curves and cubist architecture. This must be the best place to see all of Los Angeles laid out before you. Inside round every corner, every artists work you could wish to view all in one place. And all of this was free including the tram ride although parking was $15. Word of advice. Wear quiet shoes. The gardens were also exceptional. There are cafes restaurants and coffee carts too. You could spend a day there but we didn't have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliamanning2015
50,Fantastic must see,What a find! This centre provided us with the opportunity of seeing such exquisite works of art and antiquities in a massive complex. The centre has free entry but you pay $15.00 for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3343MRkimh
50,For art enthusiasts!,"The Getty center is another amazing spot that you only pay for parking, admission is free. Some people may recommend this for families but besides the monorail ride up to the Getty there isn't much to keep the children entertained, with that being said there are some breathtaking views to be seen at the Getty center and the gardens are beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353greggl
50,Glad I went to this lovely place.,I have lived in California for over 25+ years and this was my first time going. I'm glad that I did. I went the Thursday leading up to Memorial Day and first thing in the morning. Parking was easy and taking the tram to the top although I had to wait it was not for long and there were many schools visiting. I was impressed by how very nice the folks who worked there are...they smiled and seemed eager to help. It also is very nice that it is FREE. You just pay for parking which was $15.00. This is a must see as the gardens are lovely as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValleyGirl4u
40,Always interesting,"We enjoying coming here a few times a year to see the current exhibits and revisit some of the permanent collection. Although entry is free, you will pay $15 to park (it is theoretically possible to arrive by public transportation, but I've never seen anyone do it). There is always something interesting here, including the views of the surrounding area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryw534
40,Sunday Fundate,My boyfriend and I decided to spend the evening at the Getty and really enjoyed it. We are both So Cal natives but hadn't explored LA in several years. The grounds are huge and well kept. The art exhibits are very informative. We did not get through the whole center so we are planning to return. It's great for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kdsmith76
40,Nice museum,"My hubby saw an article on the Caves Temples of Dunhwang. We came early and there was no line. You have to go to the ticket table at the top of the stairs and get a timed ticket. There is a time limit in each of the 3 caves which could be a bit longer since there was no line. I can see later in the day a shorter time if there is a line. The guide in the first room explained the paintings but the other 2 guides didn't offer any descriptions and just told us when the time was up. You can leisurely walk around and visit the other exhibitions. Admission is free but parking is $15, Be sure to read the signs to pay. Only levels 1 and 4 you can pay cash. We were on level 2 and had problems with paying with our credit card. We put it in the machine as indicated and nothing happened. I noticed other people were having problems too. We went back to level 1 and just paid cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moosh2423

50,perfection,"I admit, as a native Southern Californian, I had not yet been to the Getty Center. I know. The Villa, yes. But my desire to avoid the 405 kept me away. Well, I'm glad I got over that. This place is glorious. Surprisingly well laid out for its size. The maps of the different exhibits are easy to understand. I am a big fan of impressionist art so having a chance to see some of my favorite Monets was a treat. Gorgeous sculpture garden and gardens. The views are incredible, of course. I hit the Garden Cafe and , like all museums, was a little overpriced but delicious. Amazing collection. Go. Soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pathwitheart
50,"Truly a ""world class"" collection.","Without a doubt; one of the world's greatest collections of art By the great masters. Paintings, sculptures, period artifacts and many other fantastic treasures. There are numerous pavilions; it would take a few days to view the entire Getty collection.Spectacular views of Los Angeles from the Getty.

50,A highlight of any trip to LA,"We've been to the Getty twice, once before the drought and once several years into it. The museum itself is spectacular and the exhibits are really worth taking the time to see. Sadly, the once-fabulous gardens have suffered greatly from the drought. Fountains that enlivened the landscape have been turned off to conserve water. Really hope the gardens will one day return to their former glory. Meanwhile, the views from the Getty are still superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalitmoreGirl

Pleasant to get a snack and sit in one of the courtyards in between seeing fine art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelermom
50,Fab afternoon at the Getty!,From the tram ride to the gardens and everything in between - what an awesome visit my son and I had at the Getty. We thoroughly enjoyed the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit and the gardens were insanely beautiful! I was reprimanded by a security guard for pointing at a painting (which was odd - I was at least two feet away!) but we had a good giggle at that. I could have stayed all day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EFG136

40,"Amazing art, grumpy old ladies","The grounds art was truly amazing. We had a great time seeing art from people we've read about our whole lives. It's amazing the place is free! I was impressed at the collection, and only wish we would have had more time to check out the museum.The only downside was that there were a couple older staff members (maybe volunteers) who felt it was their job to rob the joy from kids. I saw a couple preteens giggling and walking around, only a few yards from their parents. The staff member was quick to chase them down, scold them, and then turn and scold their parents. I understand that this is high-quality art and kids can't run amuck, but there is a much more tactful way to resolve a couple kids enjoying art a little too loudly than a ""power play"" that makes them hate places like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexLaneky
50,A Must See Museum,"First of all, this museum is a gem shining on top of a hill. The whole museum is free for the public. There are sculptures on the ground and art collections in different galleries. We went there to see the cave temples of Dunhuang - an exhibition of Buddhist art on the Silk Road. (May 7 - Sept 4, 2016) It's an excellent exhibition of paintings, embroidery work, and statues. They also have replica caves for visitors to gain first-hand experience of looking at painting from floor to ceiling inside a cave. (This exhibit requires timed tickets. It is still free. But visitors have to get admission tickets at a nearby stand.) Because of the amount of visitors, one cannot spend too much time in the cave to study the art. Be sure to wear a hat or borrow an umbrella from the museum while you're waiting in line. The Californian sun is quite intense! Also have your camera ready. One can see the city from high above. The view is quite spectacular.There are public buses that take visitors to the outside of the museum. It's very easy and convenient to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rydes
50,Art and architecture,"We loved the Mapplethorpe exhibit and the stunning views from this fabulous building. Good collection of European and American Art, and good photography exhibit.

50,Among the world's elite art centers,"The art collection covering so many continents and periods is extraordinary. Its campus makes the Getty Center one of, if not the most exceptional art facility in the world. Unlike most of the other great galleries of the world, the Getty Center is free. There are four buildings interspersed with beautifully and cleverly manicured gardens perched on the hills above LA. From the parking area you take a tram up to the center and are greeted with a panoramic view of Los Angeles and its surrounding area. If you want to spend time taking in all the art and then stroll the grounds, you will need to plan for visiting most of the day. If you like art, or amazing places with panoramic views, the Getty Center must be on your bucket list. It is reason alone to visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillTex33

I am eager to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2282TMsuzannes
50,Must visit when in LA,I got there around 3:00PM after visiting downtown L.A. The view is amazing. Although you can spend many hours indoor and just visit all the exhibits . You should reserve a large portion of your time to be outdoor. Taking a walk in the garden just relax and enjoy the vista.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeh2013-NJ

50,Breathtaking in so many ways!,"I dragged my husband to The Getty and we both found it amazing! Overwhelming in size and concept it was incredible to consider that someone could conceive something of such grandeur and make it happen in the way it is. Even the (free) tram from the car park at the base of the hill up to the Center is amazing with views out over LA. The gardens are registered artworks in the permanent collection and the sheer number and variety of artworks on display is incredible. I love the impressionists and to be able to see some of the masterpieces up close on such a scale really was awesome. Manet, Monet, Degas, Van Gogh...and then the Maplethorpe photography, and so many others, and the grounds. We were there for over 5 hours and did not see it all, but we ran out of energy, weary from travelling. Definitely watch the orientation video when you arrive, it is really good. An amazing place, I highly recommend a visit! And it is free entry!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redbeck06
20,"Lovely Exhibits, Unwelcoming Staff","I was looking forward to seeing this museum because I had heard good things about it.We arrived in the early afternoon -- parking was a breeze and there weren't that many people taking the tram up to the museum, so it was quite a nice ride. Had a few snacks before we entered the exhibits -- the chocolate chip cookies are really good!We wanted to avail of the audio guides for the exhibits (headsets), but the staff told us we couldn't borrow any because we didn't have government-issued IDs to leave with them. I told them that we are foreigners and are not from the US, but they pretty much just dismissed us and didn't seem interested in helping or offering us any alternatives.The various exhibits were lovely. I especially enjoyed the Greek sculpture and Expressionist painting exhibits. However, I found the staff to be incredibly overly protective of the art pieces, to the point of making us feel unwelcome and a bit insulted by the manner in which they told us to ""back off"". I thought it was a bit unnecessary.In addition to this, one of the staff members also proceeded to interrupt our discussion about an art piece just to warn us (using sign language and stilted English, as they probably assumed that we couldn't understand the language) not to point at the artwork.We are educated adults who understand the importance of respecting the artwork, respecting the museum ambience, and respecting other people's experience of the museum. So while we were quietly making our way through the rooms, there were staff members loudly speaking to each other from opposite ends of the exhibit rooms, or lounging on the seats.Objectively speaking, I really wanted to enjoy this museum, but the staff honestly just ruined the experience for me a little bit. Please just cordon off the art pieces at a distance that you feel is appropriate or place them behind glass boxes if you are so uncomfortable with having people around it.Other than that, the exhibits are really interesting and the views outside the museum are wonderful. However, I am glad that I did not have to pay anything for this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W4826FVandreag
50,Great Museum for all,I have been to this museum on multiple occasions and I am always amazed at the incredible works of art they possess. This truly a World Class Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3418TEjasonc
50,Architecture and views are spectacular.,"The Getty center is free to visit, but there is a charge for parking. Depending on the day of the week lines can be long getting from parking but they move very quickly.The Getty Center space itself is incredible. The white stones of the building shifts color during the day as the sun changes position. The garden path is interesting because for every point across the path you can close your eyes and experience a different soundscape from the water that runs from the top of the hill.The restaurant offers world class cuisine and is pricey for the casual visitor, but there is also a cafeteria for the more budget conscious, and the quality is above average, but it priced as you would expect for a museum.We go frequently just for the experience, but the permanent collection is not all that interesting if you have visited the larger museums in Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radius360la

Wide variety and an array of healthy choices are available (and at reasonable prices). Spend a couple of hours or spend the whole day. Wander through the lovely garden areas.Whatever you enjoy, you will find something to love here. Take the family, or out of town guests.You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579richm
50,Must visit site,The Getty Museum is famous worldwide. Both the venue and the artwork are a must when you visit LA. You will have to drive a bit out of your way - in spite of LA traffic- but the ride to the Museum itself is also worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVD53
50,AMAZING FOR ALL,"I love the Getty and it is great even for non-museum folks. I sent my brother who does not like museums and even he really enjoyed it. There is so much to see and even if you don't want to go inside just the gardens and sculptures are wonderful.

Great place to take a walk along the paths and enjoy a lovely California day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmartinez2016
40,Our weekend homel,"Honestly, I've been tlhere more times than I can count. From around opening day to now, guesstimate like 200 visits or so. That's a lot of visits, I know.It's the default place to take out of town visitors though, and the concerts, discussions, lectures, make each trip worthwhile.That's all fine and dandy you're likely thinking. Tell me something that shows knowledge of the Getty, right? Okay, having taken both garden and architecture tours dozens of times, look for the Richard Meir stone. That's all I'll say. Also visit the garden selectively at various times of the year to enjoy... that's all I'll say about that too.A stop at the restaurant is also well worth it. Take some coffee or tea up to a nice Vista point also. You'll be glad you did.There is a helicopter pad hidden somewhere. Find it for bonus points.Parking has always been an interesting issue. Hey, it's LA. Deal with it. Take a bus to the Getty if you can. The tram up is fun but walking is good exercise. I've done it many times, think of walking down at least if you can't do the up.I've had the obligatory celebrity sightings, you will too if you go enough, they like to use the back entrance BTW... and no, I'm not going to tell where that is.My main goal was to encourage you to wander... that's why I keep going back.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Divining_Rod
50,LA's very own castle!,"I've been a fan of this place ever since watching it being built on a mountaintop along my 405-to-the-Valley commute. The complex has something to capture the interest of all ages, whether your kids want to find fossil imprints in the stairs and walkways, you wish to see iconic paintings, or you are drawn to the latest exhibitio The museum itself is free, but parking is now about $15/car - so take a full car of prospective fans. The cafeteria is good - I've never eaten at the restaurant, but can't imagine it being disappointing. And be sure to say hello to my personal favorite marble, Bernini's Bust of Pope Paul V in the East Pavillion, Gallery E201- I always expect him to say something!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfvalleymom
50,LA's Cultural Jewel,"The architecture and location are equally exciting to the art collections. It doesn't have the most expansive collection but they've done a good job acquiring some very important work (especially in the impressionist room, my favorite btw) and their rotating exhibitions are always top notch. Take time to get lost wandering around the grounds and taking paths that are lessor traveled. The architecture has many hidden surprises and the views of the beach across the basin are virtually unrivaled. I suggest sunglasses because the white stone can be a bit bright. Must see in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4636FXmichaelk
50,The Getty Museum,"If vacationing in LA, The Getty Museum is a must. The tram from the parking lot to the museum itself is pretty awesome.

Incredibly beautiful pieces!They also have kid friendly exhibits and the museum offers various options for lunch.A must see for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SED4102
30,Unfortunately...,"Architecturally stunning, with a tram ride to,the top that even adults and parents love. Sadly, while the edifice is remarkable and gorgeous, the art itself is singularly unimpressive and unispiring; even many of the temporary installations lack coherence and quality.So, go,for,the extraordinary gardens and landscaping, as well as the magnificence of the structures, but save your artistic yearnigs for the Broad or LACMA..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kens338
50,World Class - The Getty,"When exploring Museum venues to peruse in LA/SoCal, top of the list belongs to the Getty. With it's hilltop site overlooking LA, the Pacific Ocean and beyond, the experience is multifaceted and transformative. Breathtaking architecture, exhibits always pushing our imagination, and food/restaurant options that could double for date night.One need not be an accomplished art purveyor, nor an art major to simply leave the world behind for the day, and gently yield to a Getty immersion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGWink

50,Not to be missed,"The Getty Center is a not to be missed attraction in Los Angeles. The grounds are spectacular and, on a clear day, one can get a beautiful view of the ocean. Given that we are Angelenos, we go to the Getty on a somewhat regular basis. Their art exhibits are exceptional. It's best to look at their website to see what is being featured on the day that you plan to visit. In the summer months they offer evening concerts and events that are usually free of charge. No worries if you don't have a car or simply prefer not to drive, the two bus lines that stop right in front of the Getty are the 734 and 234. Best of all, the Getty Center offers something for people of all ages. Don't miss this LA gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPG625

40,"Great view, cool buildings and ok art.","The views from the Getty are fabulous and well worth the visit.Getting there is a little tricky even though it is organized. You have to take a tram from the parking lot, and they are very limited in the number of people they allow in each car.We had lunch there at the Garden Terrace which was a good option. We had a Caprese Focaccia sandwich, which was good with chips/crisps. It was quick and hit the spot.I would say that the art needs a little more investment. Although there were some of the standards, they weren't necessarily great examples with a few standouts. It is worth one visit, but not sure two would have much more unless there was a great exhibit.We saw the Mapplethorpe exhibit, which was well done.Finally, the store was very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globaltravelfan
50,go here!,"This stop would be worth it just for the view of the adjacent Hollywood Hills on the free tram ride, and to enjoy the various viewpoints to LA from the hill, but that's only the start. The architecture, gardens, not to mention sizeable European art collection, are well worth four hours or more. We didn't get a chance to try the food services other than snack cart, so probably more time would be ideal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiayvr
40,Inspiring,"Very hard to get to as the directions on the Getty Center website were well out of date. Turned out, there was a bus to & from downtown that would have been quicker than the 2 hours it took me to get there.However, the architecture, sculptures & gardens were amazing. Didn't see a lot of the exhibitions as I had to get back to catch my flight home. Well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annenewzealand
50,Great cave,So neat seeing the cave set up. Best thing it all was FREE to see. Love looking at the painting and statues. Also had pictures and a lovely garden walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianef721
50,Fabulous!,"I loved the gardens the best, but the entire museum was incredible. I highly recommend a visit anytime you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisacate
50,Place to visit for all ages,"There are no words to describe this beautiful place in the most amazing location. It has something for everyone: art galleries, outdoor gardens, sculptures, places to eat and shop! Make sure to clear your entire day to fully enjoy your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vlad_Image
50,Must see in LA,"Visiting the Getty Center was fantastic! Lots of art on display but not too overwhelming. The garden is also great for picture taking. Best part of it is that there is no entrance fee and you could get headsets/ipod guides (also free) so you could learn more about a specific item. My friend and I went on a weekday, took an Uber to the Center entrance then we rode a tram going up the actual museum. There wasn't much of a crowd then but I'm not sure about the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496jessicag
50,The Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Buddist Art on China's Silk Road,"The Getty Museum has built replica caves on a one to one scale of a fifth century, a sixth century and an eighth century cave from the site of Mogao, China. To enter the cave, one must go to a table on the plaza level next to the main entrance and obtain a free timed ticket to enter the replica caves on the lower level. The tickets are timed at 15 minute intervals and entrance is admitted in groups of 12 persons. It is quite dark in the ""caves"" and I would recommend that persons with balance or vision problems stay away as the caves very limited light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patgammon
50,Wonderful experience and museum,"This museum and gardens is a sight to behold.While the below ground parking is a little hard to deal with overall well worth the visit.I came on a Saturday at 3PM thinking to beat the rush. Well I ended up parking on the 6th level of 7 levels of parking. No spaces in the top 5 levels.This speaks to its popularity but the parking is a bit of a issue.You will pay for parking (timed) but access to the tram and the museum is free.You elevate to the ground level and take a tram to the mountain top museum. A scenic trip of several minutes.The museum is well laid out with upper and lower floors that beautiful compliment the works of art with the spectacular views of LA and the mountains in a 360 panoramic view.Well worth several hours or more to encompass all the wonderful works.There is a nice store, coffee shop and some food offerings.Wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest42n8
50,Must See Place,"A beautiful place with lots of wonderful sculptures, garden and art. It is like a museum but also a place for contemplation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rimjhim1
50,Very good collections and gardens,"Everything is organized so well that one can enjoy in architecture, gardens, art, panoramic view, without getting tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olgica2015
40,Excellent art collections and architecture tour,Spent a morning at the Getty - April 2016. Took the free architecture tour and learned about the creation of the center and the trust created by John Paul Getty. Had time to tour one exhibit plus the Mapplethorpe visiting exhibit. Worth the time to spend a full day here. Nice on site cafe for lunch and great views. Recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625tomc
40,A worldclass museum,"Getty centre should be on everybody's itinerary on a visit to los angles. The museum is atop a hillock and requires a tram ride for transportation. An introductory film initiates you into the splendours. The museum has a great mix of european and american paintings, pencil sketches, photographs over the centuries by renowned artists like Rembrandt. The landscape is fabulous with sculptures sprayed for enjoyment. It also gives a great view of the pacific. Perfect place for a day's family outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajeetn2015
50,Incredible views,Great museum with tons of free tour options. You pay $15 for parking but it is free otherwise. The views of the city are amazing. I would say this is a must for visiting LA especially visiting LA on a budget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfbowling
30,Great short fun,More of the art lovers thing and good for scenic photography. They had an exhibition going on which was one. A tram takes you there to the uphill but you can either take team back or walk on foot once you are done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anuj865

50,Great museum,"The Getty is a really fun place to spend a day. The gardens are lovely and the building is really neat, and they have events in the summer where you can drink and check out art while listening to music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsRubySongbird
50,Exhausting,Fantastic place to spend a dayIn fact you'd need at least two to do it any justiceBring your walking shoes this place is vastTo many interesting things on site to listI suffered from information overload after a full day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petethepipe
50,Stunning archtecture and grounds,"The Getty is an amazing campus of architecturally distinct and beautiful buildings and grounds. As the excellent docents will tell you, the main garden was done,not by a landscape architect but rather an artist. It is an amazing work of art. There is an extensive art collections but not much of the more modern and sculpture that is my interest. That said, we spent a glorious 4 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djstoll808
50,Stunning vistas and architecture,Heartening to see so many people in the gardens and galleries on a Sunday. Free admission. $15 parking. Bring your family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/876mik
50,Gorgeous at night,We went at night and caught a beautiful view of the city lit up. Be prepared for a walk it was packed just before closing. The newly renovated building is beautiful. We went for the view of the city and we were not disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/variyajewelry
40,Absolutely beautiful with great exhibits,I went to The Getty for the first time recently and I really loved it. It was a bit windy the day we went so we weren't allowed to go down into the gardens which made me sad but it was still a lovely visit. The Louis XIV tapestry exhibit was fantastic. Wasn't too crowded when we went on a Friday afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrie_enne
50,Great artistic pieces both inside and out,"We came late in the day so it was not as crowded but most of the vendors were already closing down (coffee, juice carts, etc). The water restrictions were tight so many of the fountains were turned off to preserve. But nonetheless the place is massive with a lot of great works all throughout the compound and great views of LA. You must pay for parking and take the train up, no other way to get there. But once there, it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawadjie
40,Lovely Sunday museum outing,"Enjoyable outing at the Getty.Beautiful views, architecture and sculptures. Food was enjoyable too.The Art of Food special exhibit was informative and very glad we attended to see the unique history and uses of food, utensils.Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BIGARFIELD
50,Take your time to visit!,"I didn´t have enough time to see all the place, but i found it very beautiful... I did the garden tour, and it is very nice to know the concept behind every tree and flowers... It is a very nice place to spend some good hours walking, watching the collections, and just being there in the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajimenat2016
50,Cave Temples of Dunhuang and Robert Mapplethorpe,"We visited the opening day of the ""Cave Temples of Dunhuang."" On site are three spectacular replica caves containing Buddhist wall paintings and sculptures created from the 4th through 14th century when culture and commerce flourished along the Silk Road. Pick up your timed tickets to enter the replica caves when you arrive (to the right of the museum entrance). We had no trouble getting tickets as we visited the museum in the late afternoon but be prepared to wait as the timed tickets allow you to stand in line to enter the replica caves and not to enter the caves at the assigned time.At another Cave Temples of Dunhuang exhibit, be prepared to sway a bit as you experience in 3-D the interiors of three other caves - it felt as if we were actually on site. Again, there are lines as only @ 20 people are allowed each time for about a 5-7 minute 3-D film immersive experience.Because of the crowds, one couldn't linger inside the replica caves - that's unfortunate as more time to view the objects closely would be welcome.We also visited Robert Mapplethorpe's photography exhibit (closing July 31, 2016) His black and white photographs clearly capture his fascination with the human body, both male and female. I would caution taking young children to the exhibit as some of the photographs are controversial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796ja
50,"An amazing place to visit, and not just for the art collection","We used Uber to take us to the centre, and were delighted to find a dedicated drop off for Uber cars; up a short flight of stairs and you are right at the garden leading to the entrance to the train ride. The layout of the centre is so easy to navigate, with lifts taking visitors to every level. The galleries are spacious without feeling sparse, the artwork is not huge in number, but definitely worth the trip to see, including works by Van Gogh and Renoir. We particularly enjoyed the gardens, with a panoramic view of the Los Angeles skyline, not to be missed. We were also surprised at how reasonable the prices were at the cafe, although one could bring your own lunch and immerse yourself in the serene garden setting. It was an experience way beyond our expectations, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695maxt
50,wonderful,This is a beautiful place to visit. The art is amazing....and the building and grounds are just plain gorgeous. If you are in the area it is a must to see. We had a nice light lunch on our visit....everyone was nice and helpful. GO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryhY373XZ
50,"A beautiful place, a great day, in LA","You can't visit LA without a visit to The Getty. There is nothing like it. The size, architecture, garden, vistas and of course the collections and exhibits. You can see art pieces that are thousands and hundreds of years old while also experiencing contemporary and sometimes controversial art in the form of photography. Admission is free! There is a parking fee or you can Uber, taxi, private driver, or bus. There is a restaurant as well as self serve casual when you are hungry. Try to move through the exhibits chronologically. You can opt to take a tour with a guide or get a headset and go at your own pace. I found it impressive to be standing a few feet from Van Gogh's Irises which the museum owns. Plan to spend a few hours. Once you are hooked, I recommend a visit to it's sister; The Getty Villa, Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLDFoodie
50,Fantastic,"Go. Just go. While we able to spend only a couple hours there, if I ever find myself in LA again, I would plan to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TG192
50,A Must-Do,"I am a local, and this is my absolute favorite spot in Los Angeles! Amazing views of the city and ironically serene given you're looking right down in the 405. The best view is on the outside terrace of the southeast building. For the most thorough and informative experience, be sure to use the audio device and take the docent led tours---both of which are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCACUNA
50,Half Day at The Getty Centre,"How to fill in the day prior to late flight back to Australia. A trip to the Getty Centre will do it nicely. Wonderful architecture, breathtaking views, the sculpture garden is beautiful and the art collections are magnificent. Could easily spend two days here. A nice café with good coffee, drinks and reasonable snacks and a restaurant if that's what you need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roaminginthegloming
50,"Wonderful place to visit, and it's free!","I'd highly recommend a visit to The Getty Centre. You can catch an Uber to the entrance, then catch a free 'tram' up the hill. There can be long lines but they move fast. The trip up the hill gives great views across LA. Once you're at the centre, you will enjoy an incredible garden, amazing buildings and an unsurpassed collection of art. The whole thing is free, so what are you waiting for? It can easily take up a quick one hour visit, or you could spend the whole day. Highly recommend it to everyone: friends, couples, families, old and young.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_M_13579
50,A wonderful day trip,"This is simply one of the best places to spend time in the city. One of the only places we like better is its sister museum, the Getty Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller606660
50,Gorgeous place!,"I understood entirely why it's rated the top attraction in Los Angeles. The entire place is beautiful, never mind the art. There are so many things to do, we spend some time there and did not even see half of it. The best part is that you only pay for parking, the museum itself is free! Definitely will visit again when I come back to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954cristinat
40,Very enjoyable and Free!,"We went on a Saturday; it was easy to drive to, easy to park, easy to get to the museum entrance via the tram. We didn't use the audio tours. We saw the Mapplethorpe exhibition and the regular museum impressionism exhibit, the central garden, and a movie about the China's Cave Temples of Dunhuang. We enjoyed all of this. The food is expensive. The museum gift store is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkj123
30,Free and good for a few hours,"We drove to the Getty Centre on our last day in LA, as we wanted something relaxing to do before going to the airport. The centre has a small collection of Impressionist paintings, some Manet, Canaletto and Cézanne, which were fantastic, but to be honest I was quite disappointed with the museum as a whole. My favourite pieces were Dancer Taking a Bow (the Star) by Edgar Degas, and Lion at the Zoo by Thomas James Dixon. We stayed at the museum for the whole day, but in truth, whilst I am an art lover, I wouldn't have stayed as long as we did. We only really stuck around because we were waiting for our flight.I had heard the Getty Centre was quite wonderful, but we were left a little disappointed. It would be good for half a day perhaps, and it does have some good pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbyOlivia
40,A obligatory place to visit,"We enjoyed the views, the art, the culture, the architecture. All senses were alive to enjoy everything. You have to experiment all that in the Getty. Always amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/330faithb
50,A SPECTACULAR VENUE,"I can see how it compares in some respects to the Met in NYC or the Brit Museum in London. Getting there in L.A. traffic is a downer, and getting home 28 miles away was worse. Okay, so make sure it is open, try to go on a weekday, talk to them and try to time arrival so you can find a parking space. We arrived on a Thursday about 1:20 pm and drove until some parking spots were opening from folks leaving...ended up on level P3. Off to the tram. Today it was a bit cool and breezy which suited me but my bride is always cold and did not bring a jacket. After the tram to the top we realized we just missed a major exhibition of Chinese temple cave art, which opens on 7 May. We toured five of the galleries and the gardens. All was very nice. I had expected to see tons of photographs, however they were only in the temporary Mapplethorpe exhibit. Some of the large stone walls gave me a feel for what the wailing wall must be like! I was impressed to see that one of the men's rooms had been set up very artistically with very unusual faucet handles, lots of marble surfaces, and lots of satin stainless steel walling; unusual. We spent about four hours and loved it. NOTE: the attraction is free admission but the parking is always $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyboy1320
50,Great,"Everything is perfect at the GC, from parking to the exhibits. One of the best museums in the world. Ideal for children too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romanbiker
50,And it's free!!!,"Even temporary exhibits like the current Mapplethorpe are free to the public. The collection has stupendous highlights and the venue itself is nothing short of breathtaking. I was amazed to see so few people. For those who say LA is a cultural wasteland, this place is all you need to know. The original building still houses the Roman and Greek collection. The newer building has the Impressionist classics like Van Gogh's lilies.Note: the remote location means that transport can be a challenge especially during rush hour. Free wifi makes it easy to call for an Uber car before you take the 5 minute tram down to the drop off center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesR787
50,So Much to See!,"There is so much to see here at The Getty. We only had about 4 hours and it felt like we still hadn't scratched the surface. Upon arriving, you get to take a tram up the mountain to the compound. The ride up offers gorgeous views of the area and you can even see downtown LA at certain points. Once you get to the top, there are many options on how to spend your time. Initially we went to the cafe to eat. They had many food options to choose from. It was a bit pricey for cafe food, but still within reason. We then decided to take the free Architecture tour which runs about an hour. I would definitely recommend taking this tour as it was informative and really helps to get a point of reference on what inspired the design of the buildings and how they took shape and look they way they do. Then we visited a few of the galleries. The most impressive exhibit we saw was the Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit. Definitely not for children, but exquisite photography and spanning different phases of his career. I only wish I had more time to see more. I will definitely be back next time I'm in LA to discover more of this amazing museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammiches
50,A Cultural Adventure in a City Oasis,"This was my second trip to the Getty Museum, and I have to say I was even more impressed on the follow-up visit. We went to see the current Mapplethorpe photographic exhibit. It was fantastic, and then we found ourselves wandering from building to building enjoying what each one had to offer.The setting of the museum is spectacular with the vistas that spread out across the valley. There are beautiful garden areas with water features that you can walk through. I even saw people picnicking on the lawn.There is a tram that takes you from the parking area up to the museum itself. Everything is very well organized. There is a cost for the parking but the museum itself is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randall_travels2015
40,A more open art museum experience.,An easy museum experience. Multiple buildings with their own concentrations. Lots of room. Nice patio with great water feature (when there's no drought). Lots of rotating photography exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS42
50,LA's Best,"Having been to many of the great museums around the world, whether it be in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Madrid, Rome, etc., I can truly say that the Getty Center is an absolutely world-class museum. Tremendous artwork, sculpture, photography, dining facilities, panoramic city views, architecture… The Getty Center has it all! And a great little tram running from the parking lot up to the museum itself! An absolute must-see for anyone coming to Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298brucel
50,Beautiful way to spend the day,"We had out of town guests and this was the perfect way to spend a day. The Getty Center is free admission with a $15 parking fee. They have ample handicap parking spots on the first level. You board a tram from the parking which takes you up to the center. We packed a lunch and there are many tables with shade throughout the grounds to eat. Bring a blanket if you prefer to sit on the garden's lawn. There are many exhibits to enjoy. Our party split up and everyone went to what interests them. The views of the city and beach below are breathtaking on a clear day. I would recommend 3-4 hours. Tip: Put your water bottle in a bag or they will request you leave it outside of the exhibit unattended. Once they see it, it was too late to add to the bag.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z755CYlaurab
50,Amazing Museum!,I visited the Getty Center on a recent visit to Los Angeles. This is definitely one of the best museum I have ever visited in the world. The collection is beautifully curated and the grounds and setting are magnificent with many viewing terraces through the buildings. There was no entrance fee and the parking fee ($15) was well worth it for the convenience. Do not miss this museum if you are in LA -- it's truly wonderful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John2015
40,Great architecture,"Nice place to walk around and look at art and architecture. If you are interested in this kind of thing then it's definitely a must do. If you're not and just looking for things to do in the area give this one a miss. Great space, good art, pretty gardens. Current exhibition on portraits is interesting though some parts are really X rated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophia_goes
40,Definitey Worth the Day Trip,"We've been to The Getty Center before, but this was the first time with our teenager. He wanted to see Noir:The Romance of Black in the 19th Century French Drawing and Prints (charcoal drawings) exhibit they were having. All the other exhibits they had were great and I really enjoyed the diversity. Literally there was exhibit for everyone.There is a lot of walking, all day walking, so bring comfortable shoes. Plan ahead of time which exhibits you want to see, because you will not be able to see them all. Before you leave, I recommend going to the 2nd story patio's overlooking the 405 fwy to checkout the incredible view of W. Los Angeles. You will want to take a panoramic shot from there so don't forget your camera. If you pack a lunch, do yourself a favor, bring it with you on the tram. You can drop it off at guest relations, then pick it up when your ready to eat, instead of having to go down to the car and back up. Also, if you happen to go on a rainy day, leave your umbrella in the car. The Getty Ctr provides umbrellas to use while you are there. They are located at all the door entrances. If you have the option I would recommend going on a weekday. We went on a Saturday and by 12pm it was too crowded. The only bummer was they had the water turned off, so no waterfall and the grass was starting to turn brown. I'm guessing they had to implement water restrictions due to the drought. Other then that it was a great day, loved the exhibits and definitely worth the trip into L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinorahv112
40,Beautiful location plus good shows,"We have been here several times and it is always a treat. Even if they. Did not have interesting shows the views are worth the visit. The lovely buildings have many vantage points to enjoy. The shows are great, always well curated. The permanent exhibitions are fine as well. A top attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wywyno
50,Art and a room with a view!,If you have not heard or read about The Getty this is an LA must see! You literally create your own palette atop one of the highest metro peaks LA has to offer. With ocean views to the west and city views to the north-south and east this is a view not to be missed. Let's talk about the art. Ranked in the top 20 mini major museums of the world the collection of renowned works will satisfy your viewing historical reference forever!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billsK9646SI
30,Not great for a 3yr old,"We met family who live nearby for an afternoon visit with our respective children, aged 16 months and 3 years on a Sunday. Parking and connecting light rail were perfect. The gardens were beautiful and there was a small family section which was good for interaction and relaxing too.However, the staff varied greatly in their approach to children. I was made to feel embarrassed and unwelcome on more than one occasion - and our 3 year old is pretty good. Some members of staff were on at us if our toddler even walked too close to ropes or railings around exhibits. One member of staff in the family area was really quite rude. Having visited a great many museums around the world - and being a responsible parent - I had not experienced this to that extent.Most staff were fine. But rules like drinks containers must be inside your bag (not even allowed in a backpack drinks pocket) seemed a bit over the top - it would be enough to say no food or drink to be consumed in the exhibition rooms.There were lots of eatery options. We dined in the main cafe which gave an amazing variety of options.Our 3 year old was too young to be interested in the tapestry's and furniture (small exhibits) and too old to be carried or pushed in a stroller quietly.It may have been easier in a smaller group so our son could have explored at his own pace.The building and grounds were beautiful, as we're the views. So worth a visit and great that entrance is free too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonnieHall82
50,Outstanding museum and gardens,"The Getty museum is a free attraction (except parking costs) in the Bel Air part of LA. It is an expanse of beautiful, modern and clean white buildings that are beautiful in and of themselves. The museum has everything from painting to sculptures to photographs to tapestries. But the Getty museum is not just about the art, it is also about the green grassy hills where kids run around and the beautiful gardens. That was my favorite part. There is a cactus garden as well as a sizable main garden with water feature, flowers and trees. It is wonderful and peaceful - a great place to sit and relax. I highly recommend a trip to the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159

50,Absolutely fantastic!!!!,"The architecture of the buildings and the gardens, not to mention the art are all absolutely fantastic! The views overlooking the city are breathtaking. There are lots of places to sit and admire the views outside and a cafe if you need a snack. There are signs that say ""no alcohol past this point"", so I presume alcohol is served at the cafe. The tram ride to the center was fun. It's so worth the visit. Also, if you visit both the Getty Center and the Getty Villa on the same day, (which is totally doable) you only have to pay the $15 parking fee once. Great deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolacabana
50,Great place to bring a picnic and spend a day!,"Amazing art museum, but that's not all the garden and architecture are amazing. You can easily spend a day here (on Saturdays in summer it opens until 9pm). It's totally free with excellent guided tours....the architecture and garden tours are great, really informative.

50,Amazing experience,"From the moment you arrive, you can see that this is going to be an experience. We took an Uber to the Center and then caught the tram upto the Entrance. It is quite astonishing that there is no entrance fee - the only cost is parking if you have a car. We took advantage of the I-pad guided tour and then made our way to the building which included the Robert Maplethorpe photography exhibition. It was outstanding and so too were the other exhibitions in that building which included some amazing pieces from the Impresssionist era including the Blue Irises. But its not just the artwork that's impressive, the buildings themselves are amazing. The Center is immense and the views from the center over LA are breathtaking. We also wandered through the gardens, which on a sunny Spring day were beautiful with the roses in full bloom. We really enjoyed our visit and if in LA again, would be keen to return to see more of the exhibition. By the way, on the way back into town, our Uber driver told us that he proposed to his wife in the gardens of the Getty 18 years ago. Very romantic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8487PVjennyg
50,Still in awe,This review is for the Getty Center on top of the hill in the Sepulveda pass. I visited the Getty Villa in Malibu approximately 20 years ago. I was very impressed. My son is 19 and was showing an interest so my wife and I took him this past weekend. The layout of the Getty on top of the hill is interesting. You park and pay $15 and then take the tram to the museum. It's a little confusing what you are and are not able to take pictures of however there were plenty of people who are very helpful and would answer your questions. Unfortunately there are a lot of children that attend to be bored and run around however the no sense or guards we're pretty good at corralling the children and shooting the parents glasses I didn't see anyone removed from the premises but it wouldn't surprise me if that hasn't happened in the past. This is a must-see. This is a must-see for high school and older children. I'm sure there are children that are in elementary or Junior High School that would mean a lot from this however most young children or more of a nuisance. The coffee cart was reasonable for what you got we did not eat at the cafe or the restaurant. It's sad to see some of the water features in the ways of fountains turned off due to the drought. I'm sure that there is loss of water due to evaporation but again I was sad to see the water feature is not working because it is a closed system and I can't imagine you're going to lose that much water. All in all a wonderful day was spent. I would suggest a fast walk through at 3 hours ample time without sitting in the gardens yet seeing everything at 5 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brado142
50,My all-time favorite museum!!!!,"I LOVE this place. I would give it a 10 on a 5-point scale. It is a peaceful location up on a hill. On a clear day, the views are spectacular! I love walking around the campus here. The buildings are filled with beautiful and varied artwork and the grounds themselves are breathtaking. Great garden too! I've been here with just my husband and I've also taken my young children. They do a nice job having some programs to help kids to learn about the artwork in a fun and interesting way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliejames227
50,Fantastic modern museum,"I was encouraged to visit the Bill Graham exhibition showcasing his genius, incredible Fillmore collection of artifacts, famous guitars and stage outfits from the 60s and 70s. While this exhibition may be over, the brilliance of this museum is. It. Everything they present is done perfectly. Good for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MusicFlyer
50,Beautiful garden and collections,Fun day at the museum. We walked around the gardens and viewed a few exhibits. Had a nice lunch in the cafeThe museum is free and so are the recordings and headset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532sued
50,Sublime,"Great art on display, the architecture, views, and feel of the place is amazing. One of the best places in LA, don't miss it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/proukakis
50,Must do,This is a must do once in LA. The great masters of art and also nice seasonal expos (we saw the Mappletorpe photos). One could easily spend a hole day here. If you arrive after 4PM there's a parking discount,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariliafredini
50,Architecturally Amazing,"My husband and I live nearby and visit the museum often The exhibits are world class. Some of the exhibits have been, Turner, Maple Thorp, Woven gold tapestries from Louis 14th, 15th and 16th, Herb Ritz etc. They also offer countless lectures and films.The architecture and gardens are spectacular and allow for a more relaxed museum experience. The museum is open late on weekends. There are refreshments. This experience is fun for the entire family.There is not admission charge, just $15 for parking.Enjoy your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lshaw3010
50,Maplethorpe and the Irises!,Great events and showings here at the Getty.. You can spend days in this hilltop venue! Maplethorpe was a showing.. But dont forget to check out the Irises..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeGeary
50,Great art place,"It took us 3 hours to glance a piece of the iceberg. There are so many amazing paintings. With the supported iPod, we learned a lot too. We will definitely pay another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longz2014
50,Great place...,"... to take your time strolling through, taking in all that this place has to offer.Many wonderful things to see. Even the building is so exceptional you can't help to be in awe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/688martyh
40,A miracle,Absolutely amazing that this still exsists. If this art could talk!!! Well worth visiting and showing support to the community. If you have a choice regarding days...check the tours out as in the week there is only one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hantonlock
40,Vast Art Collection,"Plan to spend at least 4 hours here. It has multiple buildings all filled with different art. Pay once, and go to the Getty Villa after. You can pay once for parking here and visit the Getty Villa the same day for free. Also, food is extremely expensive, but there is a beautiful outdoor lawn where you can have a picnic if you pack food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semonas
40,Beautiful views,"There is so much to see here. First of all, it is free, but the parking is like $20, but since you don't pay to get in, it balances out. The Getty is a peaceful and serene place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_valleygirl
50,LA must-see,"Amazing views, diverse and outstanding collections, and a great respite from all the driving you do when visiting LA. Best of all, it's FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666ka
50,"Wonderful, not to be missed!","If I was local, I would visit The Getty at least once a month. It is so lovely and a great place for taking pictures. This was our first visit and we barely had enough time to enjoy the inside because we spend so much time outside enjoying the gardens and views. I definitely plan on visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinagirlinnj
50,One of the best collections,"Highly recommend this place. Very big and nice collection of furniture, paintings, lights, rugs and more from as early as 1600 and 1700 we enjoyed every single moment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375beni
50,Great place!,"Beautiful gardens, great displays and nice view of the city. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours there. The restaurant is also very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaBear250
40,Wonderful experience,"There were 4 of us and while the weather didn't cooperate it was a great 3+ hours. We were not allowed kin the garden because of the rain and the architectural tour was also cancelled because of the rain but there was still much to see and experience. I loved how they provide umbrellas for everyone and the volunteers were most helpful.Only criticism was the indoor restaurant as it was poorly designed. We waited in a rather long line and when inside the restaurant, it appeared that your choice was to go left for prepackaged food or go right for fresh sandwiches. After making our choices we realized that had we continued on the right side we would have found another 4 or 5 stations serving various food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robsy5111
50,Spent Hours There,"Great place! Loved seeing all the historic paintings and artifacts. You should set aside the whole day for this activity. Lunch at the cafe was a little pricey, but it was good food at least. Tip- remember what level you parked on! Many people in the elevator didn't remember where they parked and where going up and down on every level looking for their car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeMc89
40,Stunning attraction I wish I hadn't waited so long to see,"It took me 6 years living in LA to get around to visiting this world class attraction. How I wish I hadn't so long! Its easy to overlook what on one's doorstep: of all those of this ilk in Los Angeles The Getty deserves to be among the top of those to make amends and see.If there was a need to put in tangible terms how much money was to be made from oil, this Center is the living embodiment. The range of art on show is incredibly impressive, both the permanent collections as well temporary exhibits.The grounds are expansive, ideal to sit, linger, bring a picnic even. There are sculptures dotted among the gardens that reward the explorer. Benches afford shade and reflection.The restaurants and cafes on site were of much better quality and value than most I've experienced in many cities. And that's important: all the walking and viewing takes sustenance to make full use of the day. I noticed the museum's research facility is housed right next to the restaurants. Scientists need regular refreshment too!This is a world class exhibit run extremely well. Parking at the base is quick and easy and efficient driverless trains ferry visitors to the main building and grounds up the hill and back.It took 6 years to find something right under my nose. With the caliber of Getty's rotating exhibits and the experience overall, I'll be back a lot sooner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GGDLA
50,Best views of LA,"One of my favorite spots in LA...You can get your dose of impressionists (which I love) but even staying outside, in the cactus garden, or admiring the view from the Pacific to the downtown, is awesome",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrojanGirl
50,Nice and free,Nice place to go on a sunny day. The garden is a piece of art itself. The architecture is special but very white so wear good sunglasses or this place will give you a headache. The art collection is great if you like paintings and have a lot of time walking around the various exposition. Free except the parking. Recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmcq11
50,LA must see...,"Great art, great architecture and an absolute LA highlight! Come early to avoid the crowds and plan to spend at least half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexanderh901
50,Very Interesting Sculptures,Really enjoyed visiting both Getty attractions. This one reminded my husband of Italy. Definitely worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneC246
50,Always and amazing visit!,"Living in the LA area we are fortunate to be able to visit the beautiful Getty Center whenever the weather is perfect for an outing, we fancy a bit of history or an exhibit peeks our interests. The gardens are magnificent and views from on top the hill are wonderful on a clear day! Exhibits always are changing so every time you walk the huge halls something different peeks your interest.You need to pay $15.00 for parking but to me it is a bargain for all the beauty surrounding you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jellybean51
50,Can't be missed while in LA,"Most visitors to the LA area are focused on beaches and Hollywood (which are awesome) but if you have time, must visit The Getty Center for a little bit of culture. The Getty has wonderful art and stunning architecture. The entrance is free, all you need to do is pay parking. They have a great outdoor and indoor café. It's a place to chill, take a nap on the expansive laws, see the famous Van Gogh ""Iris"" and do a little bit of shopping at the Museum store. I've lived in LA for over 30 years and I still make a point of visiting the Getty at least once a year. They always have interesting exhibits and the Museum is small compared to other world famous museum so it's entirely doable to enjoy for just half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmenInLosAngeles
30,Not a top priority in LA,"The Getty has a vast collections of different arts in a nice modern buildings. Also they have nice parks there and a view on LA.But if you are a European coming to visit US, you are better off skipping it and concentrating on visiting sights that represent and give flavor of USA.In Europe there are too many better alternatives in the collections of art and culture areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DmitryB320
50,Extraordinary place!,"What an astonishing facility this is! Gloriously sited on a hillside overlooking the LA sprawl, splendidly outfitted, richly endowed with art and artifacts -- and all of it free for everyone. The Getty Center is truly an exemplar of American philanthropy at its best.Do not miss visiting this extraordinary place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EGDandMGD

50,Beautiful,Really enjoyed the works of art (both paintings and sculpture) in this spectacular setting. Cannot recommend it enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDG609
50,Stunning site and good exhibitions,This was my primary reason for staying over in LA for a couple of nights and it was very well worth it. Very well organised and although of people there were many there was no sense of crowding. Access is by little train from the bottom of the hill where car parks and taxis are situated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888desg
50,Budget-Friendly Activity,The Getty Museum was lovely. Lots of art by the masters. They have wonderful exhibits. The best part is that it is free. Great for budget travelers and families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
50,Southern California Jewel,"What a joy to get to live so close to such a gem. It's massive quarters and open concept make this museum one of my favorites. The garden is spectacular. I took my young boys here in the fall and because LA weather is so constantly mild, it is perfect any time of year. Highly recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarisolM52
50,Simply Spectacular,"The art at the Getty is just OK, since they only started collecting in the mid-20th century. But what they have is first rate and the exhibitions are great. We saw a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit, which is split between the Getty and another museum in LA, and a tapestry exhibit, both of which were excellent. The architecture itself is perhaps the biggest feature of the whole place. The garden, which is more of an art work than a garden, was just OK. Sort of a failed garden, if you ask me. Incredibly enough, the Getty is essentially free. You park at the bottom for $17/car to park, and that's it, and take a tram to the center itself. We went there on a Saturday morning and while there were a lot of people, it was not crowded. No problem in getting lunch at the café at 1:30...no lines and plenty of seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrinceConsort
50,Amazing indoor and outdoor space,The gardens are wonderful; the galleries beautiful; the restaurant lovely. Wonderful place to spend a few hours or a whole day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savtiLosAngeles_CA
50,A Good Museum with a Million-dollar View,"The Getty Center is unique in the art world, not because of its holdings, but because of its first-class exhibitions and its spectacular setting. Many of the exhibitions are not to be missed, including, for the example, a recent one featuring Hellenistic bronzes which afforded the one-in-a-lifetime opportunity of seeing one third of all the extant late Greek bronzes under one roof. (A museum is lucky to have one or two of these in its collection at all, and they generally do not lend them.) Another recent show brought to Los Angeles a spectacular selection of tapestries in the collection the French Kings Louis XIV-XVI from the Gobelins, Beauvais, and other manufactories. The textiles here were in a superb state of preservation showing nearly original colors and generously woven with gold-wrapped thread. Get on the mailing list, get advance notice of the wonderful exhibitions held at the Getty, and plan your visits accordingly.The permanent collection of paintings is good and growing, but, naturally, it cannot outshine the great historical collections of Europe. Because the Getty is well endowed and usually gets what it goes after, its new acquisitions generally represent the best of what comes on the market today. The collection is being built solidly one Pontormo, Bernini, Manet, and Van Gogh at a time. There is a good permanent collection of photography that is well worth the trouble.If art is not reason enough for your visit, there are always the grounds and the complex of off-white travertine and steel buildings perched on one the prime pieces of real estate in Brentwood. The vistas are panoramic with the finest being the view of the gardens, the city, and finally the ocean from the second level terrace. Other reviewers on this site have already lamented the decision to drain the once-beautiful fountains on the grounds. We can only hope the directors reconsider their politically-correct water policy in drought-ridden southern California, taking into account that beautiful public spaces with flowing fountains can foster an appreciation of water as a precious resource. (If we can enjoy the beauty of parks and fountains in public spaces, as people in European cities do, maybe it becomes less important to replicate them privately.) The Getty's sister museum of antiquities in Malibu is similarly spectacular with regard to their setting and architecture. Both museums are well worth a visit for this reason alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcO3467NX
50,College Night at The Getty,I went to support a friend who had photos in the exhibit. It was free to get in. They had bands and djs playing and lots of stuff to do including a drawing class that anyone could participate in. Saw some great exhibits including Van Gogh's 'Irises' and a Mapplethorpe exhibit. Everything was well laid out. The views the architecture and the gardens are all superb! I would recommend everyone coming to LA to go and visit The Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piquet49
50,Art lovers !!,"The place is a great secret right in L.A. Parking was simple, then a monorail to the museum level. Excellent gardens, waterworks and views. I am a fan of Van Gogh and Monet. They have a great collection of art from different places and eras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669pedrom

50,an aerie above the city,"beautiful gardens, and a lovely romantic restaurant in the middle of the grounds. Free admission but $15 to park (yikes). I took a Metro bus which lets you off right in front of the parking lot. Cost me $1.75. Way better and no wait to get out when it closes either",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieAmy2014
30,...wanted to see what the hype is all about,"OVERRATED!!! The garden is nice and so is some of the art collections; architecture is good...now, everybody and their dog is there, traffic just off the 405, tram is a joke so either walk up or take advantage of the buses on site...everybody says you can see LA on a clear day; rare this is and even Angelinos know this; the day I went was a clear day and you can see downtown LA aĺl the way to the ocean...now, if you really want to see the ocean w/o all the nonsense I mentioned above, I highly recommend the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades!!! Much much better! Why just see the ocean when u can actually touch it? It's just across the PCH west from the Villa!! Admission at the villa is also free but you must have tickets/print-out before you get in; yes, controlled and in order! Not at the Center; what a joke!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertc710
50,Amazing,"The Getty Center is a great example of Art and Architecture, where Architecture also becomes Art. The pieces are well displayed. The Getty itself is large, beautiful and artistic. You can easily spend an entire day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadiras
40,Definitely worth a few hours,"Visited the Getty on a very rainy Thursday morning which unfortunately meant that the gardens were closed. Although only mildly a ""culture vulture"" I found the Getty held my interest for quite a while. The exhibits are well laid out and the building over several levels easy to navigate. Easily accessible from the Inter state with good parking. As I found throughout my visit to the US the bag security check was an example of 'box ticking' therefore did not take long. You are transported up the hill from the parking area in a modern tram/funicular which is a nice experience in itself. Enjoyed my visit and would recommend to others, especially when you can look around the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fleckapuppy
50,The wow factor,"Beautiful views and amazing art, the Getty Center is a must if you are visiting Los Angeles. I live here and hadn't visited in over a decade and I'm so glad I went last week, I had forgotten what treasure was in my own backyard. Have lunch and a take in the views from the mountains to sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5006CDjans
50,Amazing collection and beautiful gardens!!,"Getty Museum has an amazing collection of paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, etc. The North Pavillion has work from early 1300-1600, such as medieval and Renaissance sculptures and paintings. The East Pavillion has work from years 1600-1800 such as Italian, French, and Spanish paintings. The South Pavillion has work from the 1800s, 18th-century paintings, and lots of furniture in the European decorative arts collection. Finally, you will find Italian decorative arts from the years 1700-1900, such as world famous Van Gogh and Monet paintings in the West Pavillion.Outside, the gardens are very beautiful and peaceful. There are lots of flowers and a small waterfall, so it is an ideal place for a photoshoot. Food is a bit overpriced in the cafes, but at least the museum is free!!! The tram is also free and picks up people about every 5 minutes or less. However, not very many people can fit inside, so if there is a long wait some people prefer to just walk up the hill. Parking is $15 and $10 after 4pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xannemaex
50,Keep coming back for more!,"Although not a huge fan of Richard Meir's architectural vocabulary, I do like the hierarchy of spaces and vistas from terraces and unexpected nooks and crannies. Water features are also a highlight. Landscaping is a delight. Do take advantage of the docent led tours. The permanent collection galleries are a wonderful must-see. The interiors are extremely well done. I particularly enjoy returning to see the changing exhibitions of their Photography collection. DO stop at their cafe which is reasonably priced for a museum cafe. And leave enough time to explore the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shubhrajha
50,"Excellent museum, even for kids and non-museum types. Beautiful buildings, just lovely to hang out and enjoy the views!!","One of the most beautiful museums in the world and a fun place for kids and those who may not necessarily enjoy museums. That's because the setting is so beautiful and the vast open spaces are perfect for kids to run around in, for adults to walk around in and ideal for taking amazing photos!! The fountains no longer have water due to the drought, but still beautiful. Highly recommend getting the free iPod museum guide (you just drop off a photo id and they give you an iPod with an audio museum guide - with short, fun explanations of various paintings, sculptures, etc). They often have events including music and tours. Check website calendar. Museum itself is free, but parking is $15/car or $10 after 4 pm (close to closing time at 5:30 pm - except on Saturdays - open until 9 pm). Great restaurant, but book in advance. The coffee carts and other cafes are not great and not always open - so, take drinks and snacks for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ubbabe
50,"Art, where art thou? Thou is here!","A venue not to be missed whether you're into art, or not. A place not to be missed on a beautiful sunny day in LA. The architecture is world class as is the European art from prior centuries. A stroll around the grounds provides a wonderful way to enjoy the gardens as you venture from one art gallery to another. When a break is called for you can dine in the museum restaurant which will provide you one more attractive reason for a visit.The vistas of LA from here are just one more enhancement of an experience that should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisman2016
50,All around fabulous,Everything about the Getty museum was first class.We got there just before the 10 o'clock opening on a Sunday and had no trouble parking. They say the garage fills up fast but we could have arrived later. Don't follow gps. It will take you thru the neighborhood behind the museum with no entry. We did see some beautiful homes though. The museum is free. Parking is $15. You can take uber later in the day when the garage is likely full.The campus sits on a hill overlooking LA. Views are stunning. Bring a camera. (Almost everything inside is photo-able also.)The architecture and gardens are as beautiful as the art. Marble travertine and glass.There is a separate tour just about that.We did two of the frequent free docent tours. Highly recommended. Staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. There is also a free iPod based personal tour. We used these very little. Skip y the introductory short film.The permanent collection is magnificent. There are always special exhibits as well. There are some kids activities but come without them if you can. You will be able to spend more time.We had a nice salad for lunch at the cafe. There is also a regular restaurant. Prices were reasonable by LA standards. Nice terrace seating. Bathrooms were spotless like everything else.Overall top rate throughout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3850YNdavidw
50,beautifully designed museum with a beautiful story to it,"There was so much to see both outside and inside the Museum. We started off with a garden tour - the tour guide was excellent, the Getty center has such an interesting story behind it, everything you see from the building to the specifically selected flora to the position of the trees has a reason behind it. The garden was definitely my favorite, as well as the overlook views of LA. The museum itself has a lot of variety of art, everything is interesting to see. Apparently every day the museum allows 100s of school children to visit for free. Another neat thing about this center is that it is innovative - they constantly change the exhibits as well as the design of each room of the museum.*Free admission, just pay for parking, there is a nice shuttle ride to and from the center*Must see if you are in LA, nice quiet little gem to get away from the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SY1239

Bring a basket fill with cheese, wine, grapes, etc. and enjoy the tranquil sounds of nature. Visiting the museums is always exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pacunningham76
40,A worthy use of at least a half day,"While there is a great collection of world class art, the facility is interesting and also part of the experience Great views, take time for coffee at least and enjoy the design aspectsThe trip up the mountain is the least attractive part of the visit, but relax, it will be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476ronh

40,"Terribly impresssive, for some!","The Getty Center is an amazing testament to one man's wealth and ostentation. There is no question but that it represents ""all that money can buy"". But for some, myself included, it comes at the price of a lack of warmth, individual taste and personality. It is spectacular, but non-personal. It tells you nothing about Getty, except that he had vast wealth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/needham
50,THE GETTY CENTER MUSEUM,The museum is awesome! There's so much art and antique furniture to see that you will want to plan to be there for a good five to six hours to see it all! An amazing collection that everyone should see at least once in their lives! Remember to wear a pair of sunglasses for your walks from building to building because all of the walkways and various outside areas are white stone that the sun glares off of big time. Admission is free. Parking is $15.00. Trust me...it's well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisS192
50,Wow! A work of art!,"I had no idea that this was no ordinary art gallery! You could spend a whole day here- there are sweeping views, numerous sitting areas, food, drinks (even alcohol!), lawns, gardens and that is before you step foot inside! Staff was very helpful as well. This is a MUST see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenMcG_09
50,Best L.A. Attraction!,"While out of town visitors usually have the Hollywood sign, beaches, or Universal City top of their list, I routinely prioritize a visit to the Getty Center. Even if they are not museum types, the view is the best in the city, and it's fun just to grab lunch and sit outside. Little kids like the tram ride and many child-oriented activities, and yet even the most sophisticated aesthete can find something special. Highly recommended! The museum if free but parking costs $5. Try to avoid major holidays - traffic can be miserable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PickyTraveler710
50,I would give this place 7 + stars,"I went to the Getty Center on a Sunday afternoon rather by accident, I had heard about the stunning views but that was about it.. ...However this place is like from another world. It is a huge complex with an amazing athmospere, I thought the whole complex feels more like a walk in sculpture or model for a perfect world. You find several museums on the grounds with the most equisite pieces of art, also a sculpture garden, relaxing areas, unbelievable views of LA, restaurants, museum shops . You can easily spend the whole day there and if you are travelling with small kids they can roll down the landscaped slopes or play in the artificial creek, if you travel with older kids that freak out when they hear the word "" museum "" you may want to tell them that the Getty Center was a filming location in Star Trek.You can bring your own food if you want and admission is free.Parking is 15 $ for the day , which is very reasonable as everything else is free.Just plain perfect, never seen anything like that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mberlin2015
40,"Free Admission, $15 to park","The garden is pretty and offers a nice view of LA, but my family says the drought has definitely changed the gardens.

40,Worth the visit,"The grounds are spectacular. The mix of industrial construction and greenery was refreshing. The art work itself was pretty unimpressive to me but then...I'm not an art appreciator. I love natural art like God's work therefore the views from the top were more impressive to me!

50,A lovely museum. . Now charges for parking but other then that free.,"A friend of mine, in NYC art circles told me that the Getty could buyall the other museums as they have so much money. Nice view of LA fromthe museum set on a hill. The gardens are lovely. It is a very pleasant wayto spend a day, the restaurant is good but you can buy cheaper fare if you wishat stalls. La's usual fine sunny weather, not too hot most days makes ita pleasing outside, and relaxing spot as well. The museum offers talks, and severalactivities. It is definitely a great place to visit.

It was wonders after wonders.Unfortunately, I reached it too late and had less than 2 hours until the Center closed for the day.

From outside there are Incredible views of L.A., landscaped gardens, gorgeous courtyard and terraces, and sculptures.

This was one of those unexpected gems - can't wait to return on my next trip to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285maryellenr
40,Amazing garden!,"I love the Getty Center, but not just for the art. The ride up to the museum is by tram, so you get to enjoy views of Los Angeles before you even arrive. The modern architecture is great for architecture buffs, and there are nice eateries on the premises with outdoor seating, so it's even great for a long lunch. My favorite there is the garden. Incredible, colorful, modern design with unusual plants that many may not have ever seen because they are particular to the desert climates. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenpK9940PH
50,World Class all the way.,"This place was unknown to me. On a rainy day while visiting Southern California we decided to visit the Getty. I was OK with it. Well we got there the parking is $15. Then you take a team or monorail up to the buildings. We'll be ready to walk some and be ready to be amazed. There are multiple exhibits. Statues from 200AD, furniture from Louis 14. Exhibit ( changes) by Maplethorpe and my favorite the Impressionists. Vincent Van Gogh, Renoir, Gaugan ... On and on. If you have even a passing interest in art or any of these things or manuscripts this is a must stop. Oh it's FREE. The restaurants are everyday fare but pretty pricy. Bring a lunch and save some money and be happier. However ( we didn't) the food is good. Either way you will have a great day. The vows are great even on a rainy day. They have umbrellas for your use also FREE. This is a great and memorable stop. I want to go back again and see those paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeltaBiker

50,Worth all the great reviews,"We started with a stroll through the garden, hoping to avoid the midday heat - beautiful! Then on the museum galleries. The spacing of building with walkways between allows for breaks of fresh air between exhibits. The free head set/ipads are SO worth it, at least for non-experts. Just punch in the number next to the exhibit for 1-2 minute added commentary. Pieces by many well known artists, and some not so famous. Great displays, not crowded. Food at the cafe was good and affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anneo344
50,Wish I had more time at this beautiful place,I was so impressed with the Getty Center. Not only is it beautiful but easy to get around. I only had time to take the basic tour to see some of the art and the gardens. I didn't get to all of the art nor to the tapestries but all that I did see was wonderful. I went to lunch at the restaurant and would recommend it to all. Especially the cheese board and sweet potato ravioli. The gardens are a must. I just wish they had names with the plants since I don't know as many as I'd like and they have many wonderful varieties.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legsohara
50,Spectacular spot for a great afternoon,"As a native Los Angeleno and neighbor to the Getty, I forget how beautiful it is to spend time there.

But just the essence of the building makes me breath deeply & feel pleased about being there. Getty's architecture is magnificent with many aspects to ponder.The garden isn't so great at this time of year, but as the season goes on, it gets very lovely with beautifully colored flowers. The 'creek' running down from the higher elevation is sweet. There are many great views of the surrounding area, plus of LA.And they have a terrific gift shop.

Plan for traffic on 405 freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolyn557
50,A great museum that believes in education,"The Getty collections continue to grow and to amaze. The temporary exhibitions are original, cohesive, and well planned. There is little doubt that this location has become a major site for educating the public about art, about how works are preserved and taken care of over the years. It must be visited and absorbed as other museums must learn from this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653gabrielw

50,"Great Art, Beautiful Gardens, and Great Food","The Getty Center is a wonderful place to spend a day.The galleries have a fine collection of art. You will not be able to see it all in one day.The architecture and gardens at the Getty are worthy of a visit on their own. You could spend a couple of hours just enjoying the views and the landscape.The restaurant is first rate. It is beautifully decorated with great views of Santa Monica. The food and service are excellent. A bit on the pricey side. If you want a less expensive lunch or dinner, there is a cafeteria one level down from the restaurant. It also has beautiful views and the food is good. But I prefer a little more elegant dining.There are free daily docent tours lasting about an hour each. Schedules can be obtained at the desk of the first building as you enter off the tram. There is an architecture tour, a garden tour, a tour of special exhibits, a focus tour on one specific time or artist. The docent tours are free. They meet just outside the gift shop in the first building as you enter. I have taken each of these tours several times and have always learned something new.Check the website for special events. There are concerts and lectures which are usually free, but sometimes there is a small charge. Some events require reservations.The museum is free, but parking is $12 per vehicle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
40,Great day!,A great place to visit. Beautiful architecture and an excellent collection of art surrounded by gardens. Enjoy the indoors or outdoors as suits your mood.

50,Really is a Must-Do,"The Getty is beautiful and has wonderful history. If you like art, they probably have some for you. Between the great visiting exhibits and their core exhibits, there's a wonderful trove of culture at the Getty. Food is expensive since they kind of have you hostage.

50,Great way to spend a half day,"I'm not a big art museum kind of guy, but this place blew me away. You have to take a tram from the parking lot ($15 for parking) just to get up the hill. When you get to the top, you are treated to a great view of the whole LA valley. On a clear day you can see for miles (aside from the LA smog). The art is laid out in series of connected buildings. The architecture and gardens are worth the price of admission alone, and the art collections are great. Even my young daughter enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souperdave816
50,"Archiecturally, one of the finest museums anywhere. Plan lots of time OUTDOORS!","We only allowed one day and should have allowed a week for the Getty Center. Given our short time, we focused on appreciating the architecture inside and out. The gardens in early December were serene, but don't assume the museum was empty. Far from it! We each picked one collection we wanted to see indoors so we could appreciate what we saw rather than ripping and running. We also had lunch at one of the restaurants with lots of outdoor space. We weren't wearing black. Strangely, over 80 percent of the people eating in the restaurant were dressed in all black. Next time, we'll spend a whole week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoPegasus
40,More Impressive Than I Expected,"Recently restored in all of its glory, the Getty Center is definitely a Los Angeles icon. I had not expected the building to be such a prominent part of the experience, and frankly, I thought it would be much smaller. The tram is wonderful and provides awesome views as it winds up the hillside. We visited at the end of day and decided to hike back down to the parking garage (we were told that it would only take 15 minutes.) In the heat of the afternoon, it became apparent that waiting for the tram would have been a better move. The displays are not voluminous, but the selections are well thought out and representative of each room's theme. The architecture and gardens are art in themselves and the views in many directions are phenomenal. Try not to rush things, but rather take in everything in its time. Its collective splendor will impress you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desp76

50,A peaceful museum,"We went to the Getty when we had a day-long layover in LA. It was the perfect place to take in some beauty and architecture before getting on a long international flight. The Getty sits up on a hill overlooking the city. It's bright, quiet (though busy with people!) and beautiful.

50,"Great views, architecture and art","If you are interested in art, architecture, landscape and gardens and would like to see breath-taking views over LA, The Getty Centre is the place to visit.The Centre is built on a mountainside, overlooking the city. In itself it’s an architectural must see (architect Richard Meier), highly geometric structural forms above and eight levels of parking hidden below ground, not to disturb the landscaped environment surrounding the Centre. There is a lot to see and do here, visit the art in the museum, go on a (free) guided tour to understand the architectural ideas of Richard Meier or visit the gardens and enjoy the views and scenery.If you are looking for a visit to a significant cultural centre, with a spectacular city view, then this is it. But if you only have a limited time in LA, probably better to head to the MOCA and The Broad downtown, although these exhibit contemporary art, rather than the Getty with outstanding examples of mainly pre-twentieth century work from the European tradition. Certainly allow three plus hours for a visit to the museum, but add time for the journey to it. We went by car, I should think public transport could take a while longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5042FYanthonyp

50,Highlight of our LA trip,"The Getty exceeded my expectations in many ways. The King Louis XIV Tapestry exhibit was mind blowing, the art, and buildings were incredible. But possibly even more impressive was the staff throughout the campus. They were the most respectful and kind staff even when they had to remind people of certain rules in some of the exhibits. The view of surrounding LA and the Pacific Ocean was only a bonus to this amazing visit. Highly recommend!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinastew
50,Stunning artworks,"I visited The Getty during a quick two day trip to LA specifically for museums. The day before we went to the Norton Simon.All I can say is, WOW! This is a great art museum by any definition. And, it's free to the public. Parking, however is not free. But $15 for shaded, underground parking is a small price to pay for what you get.The museum itself is amazing and has a great collection, especially of European art from the 14th through the 19th century. They have everything from Monet's haystacks to Renoir's beautiful ladies to Degas' ballerinas to Rembrandt's portraits. They have a large John Singer Sargent full length portrait. I even had the opportunity to sit and soak in a JMW Turner seascape while Honey Bunny went to find a restroom. I could have sat there all day.There was one proctor, old older fellow, who was standing near the room with the Turner and I asked him if they had others by him, but he said regrettably that they had taken a second one down for cleaning. We got to talking about other pieces to see and he told me there were seven Rembrandts to look forward to in the 16th century wing. I could tell that if I lived in the LA area, he was a guy I wouldn't mind getting to know and becoming friends with.Anyway, the only regret I have about this visit was that I only had the one afternoon and after having walked the Norton Simon museum the day before, I was pretty well walked out. I would love to have three or four days to just wander the museum, very slowly and take in all the pieces at a leisurely pace. Maybe next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec77

40,Worth a visit,Wonderful property with a cracking collection of art and sculpture. Lovely gardens offering superb views of LA. Slightly suprised more local artists were not being showcased as the impression was mainly european artists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMole
40,Love art? That's ur place in LA,The place is spacious for art worms .. Free wifi in the lobby area. Place is nice and cosyVery big that you will definitely need breaksFree of charge except the special exhibitions.Nice place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhanna62
50,A great museum,"we're used to being asked to pay quite a lot of money when we visit museums in major cities and to our surprise, aside from the $15 parking fee, there was no charge to enter and enjoy this museum with its excellent collection and beautiful gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adanacsim
50,Thrillingly beautiful,"Wow, you just can't imagine. The Getty is simply stunning. The entire complex, and the staff were helpful. Parking was tough but free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66christophert
50,A Must See in LA!,"If you enjoy visiting museums, seeing great art and architecture (and exhibits), and experiencing beautiful open grounds, the Getty Center and the Getty Villa are must sees in LA.You should plan to spend at least half a day at the Center (and could easily spend the entire day.) Admission is always free, but you will pay for parking ($15).Add another minimum of 2-4 hours at their Villa. (The Villa is about 15 miles away from the center. We had a car, which made the trip over easy for us). Again, you will only pay for parking.Dedicate a day to both, and you won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenfromNY
50,First Class!,"How rich are the Gettys? Seriously. This is an absolutely AMAZING space and place. Once you arrive you'll hop on a tram which takes you up, up, up to the grounds and exhibits. You could probably spend all day or at least all afternoon here. See some art, grab some ice cream, hang out on the grounds and enjoy the most spectacular views of LA you can imagine. The art is priceless and gorgeous, but honestly, that was not the draw for us. We just enjoyed being here. Thanks to the Getty family for making art so accessible to all us poor people :)))LOVED IT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandBAtlanta
40,Beautiful Views and grand architecture,"The project is fantastic. The architecture and design, combined with the view is stunning. I didn't appreciate the art as much as I am not an Arty person. But ensure you go on the Architecture tour, and he prepared to be amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomj131
50,"Getty is a ""must see"" for la travelers and citizens alike",The Getty is a unique la experience in and of itself. The tram that delivers tourists to destination with breathtaking sweeping views are worth the trip alone. The art is the icing on the cake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132williamb
50,Beautiful art and perfect view,"The art is well organised, accept the irisses of Van Gogh which is surround by romantic art which is not where Van Gogh shoudl be",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grummelNetherlands
50,The best free Attraction in the USA,We visited The Getty centre on a very rainy day in LA the Centre is 5* in every way from starting to finishing your tour.The Art and historical artefact collections on view are simply amazing.I will let the photos do the talking but if you are in LA try and plan time too visit this amazing location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StanleyA766
40,Art Maze,"This museum is located on a mountain side, with a great view of the surrounding regions and beautiful roof gardens and architecture. The food in the cafe is great and the exhibitions change every few months or so. There are many things to see and even some hands-on activities for kids and adults. The garden was well maintained and the flowers are blooming bright. Everything about this museum says, ""Visit me."". The buildings are well designed and everything was great. I enjoyed my visit a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762af
50,One of the best cultural experience...for free!,"It would certainly be one of the noblest and wisest ways for you - if you're a billionnaire that is - to leave a long lasting cultural legacy that will be cherished by millions of visitors year in and year out for ever, perhaps. The legendary oil tycoon Paul Getty just did it with this ""Getty Center,"" which comprises architectural gems, lovely gardens, precious artifacts, fine arts, and absolutely spectacular views. Even better, it's free to fully immerse yourself into this artful experience (except a nomial parking fee).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foipop
50,Excellent and free,Top class art gallery and the Robert Mapplethorpe photographs were definitely my favorite. I loved that everything was free and that you could join a tour for free if you wanted. Great garden and architecture as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damody
50,Fantastic Getty Centre,We had arrived in LA the previous evening and had 4 hours to fit something in - so not really knowing what to expect we got an uber ride over and had a really excellent time - the organisation and service was great and the tapestry collection magnificent. Great views of LA from the buildings and lovely gardens to walk in.Food concessions were cheap and there is also a cafe.PS its free entry ( parking is charged),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andim122
50,"Art, gardens, architecture and free to all","Everything you hear is true. The setting itself is art. The architecture and gardens are so beautiful and calming. They are worth going on a beautiful day. The art collection is diverse and spans several centuries and the special exhibits vary. After walking through the many gallery halls, we went out and laid on the lawn and just enjoyed the sunshine and then walked through the gardens. We ate at the cafe which was quite reasonably priced with a broad array of selections. The pho in particular was quite flavorful. The whole experience made for a lovely afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soleil2jours
50,"Spectacular Views, Amazing Exhibits","This free (you pay for parking) museum is amazing. On a clear day you can see the entire Los Angeles valley, out to the ocean. Right now (April 2016) there is an amazing tapestry exhibit from Louis XIV. Their collection that they have year round is extensive and incredible. Some truly amazing viewing. I didn't have time to see it all, so i'll be going back next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiShellery
50,Beautiful and Thought Provoking,"This is a must. The setting and the architecture are simply stunning, and an extra-ordinary tribute to JPG's willingness to share. T without charge. The thought provoking comes from the huge emphasis here on objects, with meaning and context added in as an afterthought. It's a real contrast to the great European art collections in this sense, and it's possible to critique the Getty for its acquisition and accumulation of things. Mind you - at least they paid for them...which is more than can be said for (say) the British Museum. That is a product of Empire, while this is a product of free enterprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MASBuk
50,The Site as Spectacular as the Museum,"There are numerous spectacular museum collections around the world that overshadow the often stunning structures in which they reside, In the case of The Getty, its staggeringly beautiful architecture, buildings, and landscape design compete with the extraordinary collection it houses.We were glad we heeded the advice of other Trip Advisor posts and arrived prior to its 10 AM opening. Several school busses transporting dozens of children from second graders through high schoolers were lined up in the parking garage as we pulled in. The tram we rode from the parking structure to the museum had a Disney- like quality as it quietly, and efficiently took us to the museum's entrance. Numerous highly friendly and helpful volunteers greeted each tram as its doors opened suggesting where to begin the journey.We started by acquiring the free iPod and headphones (which I HIGHLY recommend).The iPod is set up so that many, not all, works of art have numbers beside them that when programmed into the iPod gives the visitor helpful background on the work of art, making the device an electronic docent. We then sat for a brief video on the construction of The Getty and got further helpful information on how to proceed with the tour. The various buildings are accessible off of a large, stunning, courtyard that houses a generous number of chairs, tables and numerous food carts.The collections were diverse and each in its own way, reinforced John Paul Getty's vision for sharing his passion for art and antiquities with the public FREE OF CHARGE.One cannot emphasize enough, the beauty of the buildings, the extraordinary care and maintenance of the gardens, and the extensive use of the highest quality building materials used throughout the complex. We found ourselves studying the architecture of the structures as much as the works of arts.I suggest allocating three to four hours at a minimum for the visit, dressing in light layers and bringing a hat as the temperatures varied from outdoor to in and the sun was intense.The only charge for our visit was the $15 parking fee that is paid as visitors exit, making this the best bargain of our visit to Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megkellercogan
50,nice afternoon,"this is one great museum. not only for the items in the museum, but also the building itself. look at the outside walls carefully and you will see fossil impressions in the marbel or granite. not sure what stone is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dulovi
50,Excellent museum with amazing views,"This is an exceptional museum housed in an architectural gem atop a promontory offering excellent views of LA. What more could one want? Gardens? Ok, they're here. The gardens themselves are considered works of art. Even more amazing is that the museum is free. Parking is about $15, and do arrive early if you can. We did not and were stuck in a train of traffic spiraling through the only parking garage for about 20 minutes. However, once out of the garage it was worth the hassle parking. The kids loved the tram that takes you from the parking lot up to the Getty at the top of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisterbay716
40,stunning grounds and impressive exhibits,This is a stunning museum. The building and grounds are very photogenic. They have wonderful exhibits that rotate pretty frequently. You do have to pay $15 to park. There is nowhere else to park but then everyone gets in free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellysp2016
50,"Incredible museum, vistas, and serene flower gardens!!","We got to the museum around 1 P thiking we;d breeze through the museum. We couldn't possibly imagined that we'll have to make another trip here to see the rest. There's a $15 cover charge per car, no museum entry fee. The entire museum is handicap accessible. There's reasonably priced food in the outdoor bistro. Plenty of docents are available to discuss the varied pieces around the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
50,Fabulous,"Unbelievable! Architecture alone was worth the trip. FREE! Views of the city and ocean were fabulous. We had an inexpensive, excellent lunch on the terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyA243
50,Amazing that it's free!,"There is so much to see at the Getty. I spent a really nice afternoon there browsing. The exhibits are great (my favorite was the impressionists exhibit) and the views are lovely. The grounds were beautiful, even with the water features turned off for the drought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahMynah
50,outstanding center for arts and architecture.,"We were blown away by the ambiance and experience the Getty had to offer. This was a must on our trip to Los Angeles and what a difference from the hustle of the city. The Getty offers stunning architecture, beautiful gardens and, of course, world renowned art and sculpture. Even if 'art' is not your thing, you will be inspired by the setting and feel of the place. I suggest you take a packed lunch as I suspect the food is quite expensive and there are so many places to sit and enjoy the ever changing vista. This is a center that is fully accessible and inclusive. The friendly staff and volunteers are on hand to make sure you get the most from your visit. The Getty is free to visit and the parking fee ($15) allows you to stop at both the main center and the Villa. Unfortunately we did not have a chance to visit the Villa but that gives us a good excuse to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisafJ4400LX
50,Beyond beautiful,"My 17 yo son and I went on a Saturday evening, arriving right at sunset. While the inside exhibitions were wonderful, the grounds and views of the LA area were the real draw. Would like to come back again to spend more time roaming all of the buildings, patios, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lokaykg2016
50,A must see in Los Angeles!,"Whether your visiiting or live in LA, you need to make your way to the Getty. This is not only a museum with a wonderful collection of art, but the buildings and grounds are also fabulous. The balconies have great views of LA and on a clear day you can see all the way to the ocean. Other than a parking fee, there is no fee to enter the museum.You will need to go more than once to take in all the varied exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
50,Worth every minute,"Great location every tourist should visit. Parking was 10 USD, shuttle and entrance are free. Enjoy the view over LA from the terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/new-catz
50,Incredible view and awsome architecture,"Amazing museum, the garden is worth the while by itself and with extra time to contemplate it. Do the architecture and the garden tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383leticiah
50,Beautiful and scenic day out,"Absolutely stunning views of LA, with the added benefit of taking in masterpieces from around the world and from different eras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynAshby
50,This is a top attraction for me!,The museum has rotating exhibits all the time. When we visited there were some hundreds of years old tapestries that were huge and really told some stories. They were quite amazing. We spent the rest of our visit looking at paintings done a few hundred years ago. There much to see and do here. This was our third or fourth visit. The acoustic sculpture behind the museum is a fascinating piece as the sound changes as you walk down the path along a babbling brook. The gardens are also beautiful. We found that we were worn out after 4 hours of enjoying the museum. (We are in our 60's) We are planning a future trip to The Getty again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerier216
50,Museum Comples on the Hill,"A superb view of Los Angles, the Pacific Ocean, and the mountains. There is a tram ride up to the top where several museum buildings are arranged in a most artistic way ,surrounded by California style gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973galen
50,Beautiful grounds- pack a picnic,"This is an incredibly calming area to visit. We spent more time outside than inside the museum. Pack a lunch and bring a blanket, as this is a place to picnic and relax, with prime people watching and views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priyas454
50,An icon of LA,"The Getty really does live up to its iconic status. Where else do you get the chance to stand nose to nose with some of the most famous and precious works of art in America, for free? The atmosphere is relaxed, not stuffy. And if you start to feel a bit claustrophobic strolling the hushed corridors, you can always take a walk around the beautiful gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906dough
50,Simply Amazing. And that's not even talking about the museum,"I spent about 4 hours at the Getty on Saturday. I could have spent 8 hours. Wonderful museum, wonderful art, wonderful architecture, wonderful views, wonderful place to walk, to eat. Just amazing. Don't go just for the art. Go for the views and a light lunch. But I recommend getting there by 11am so you don't have to wait on any lines. And feel free to park on the lower levels. There's no real benefit to taking the first parking spot you see. The ""compact"" parking spots are tight - drive further to get a ""full size"" spot. You'll be less stressed about parking. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfb571
40,Stunning Building,"The Getty center is an amazingly cited, designed tour de force. The collection though very good, for a provincial institution but is outshone by the setting. The setting is on the other hand world class. We spent about 3.5 hours here and pretty much saw the whole collection but ran out of time to walk the gardens given the traffic hell that is LA. We got there from Long Beach at about 10:30 AM to avoid the rush hour weekday traffic and found a traffic jam getting into the parking lot. We lucked out because someone pulled out of the garage stall just as we inched up to their spot and scored a quick and close parking spot. The line of cars went off in both directions to what seemed forever so we were lucky till we got into the queue for the tram. It was worth the wait for the views on the left side of the tram but these views were just a hint of the fantastic vistas offered from the building's many plazas and balconies. Bring a camera for the views. This was the only time we used our binoculars on this weeklong trip and it was worth the weight. Will be back again for a tour of the gardens/grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottderrick
50,Spectacular architecture in beutiful settings. Spectacular galleries,Up on the hill lies a beautiful collection of modern buildings housing wonderful art! The whole setting is a framework round the art it houses. The impreessionist galleries are particularly my favorite. The walk up and down the hill is a great alternative to the tram-ride!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ges
50,Stunning,"Crowded parking garage, but worth it for the stunning views and diverse art. Definitely compares to museums in Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlpell
50,Beautiful Buildings and Gardens,Well worth a visit. You pay for parking but otherwise it is free. A tram takes you up the hill from the car park and the views are spectacular. Lots of interesting exhibits and the gardens are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BronwenSydney
50,Fine Art and Fine Architecture in a Beautiful Location,The buildings are magnificent. The gardens are beautiful. The art on exhibit was gorgeous. A truly peaceful and lovely experience amid the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZhuhaiBill
50,Saturday Afternoon Exhibit visit,"The Getty is quite a beautiful destination. Firstly it's free and only $10.00 to park. Perfect place to visit whether solo, with that special partner or with family and friends. So much to experience and absorb no matter what you taste level is. We visited the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit and truly a quality show. This is not an exhibit for those under 18 as it does have graphic content. The Getty grounds are lovely and you can lie on the grass, sit and enjoy the scenery and stroll. Los Angeles is still under a water crisis so the pools and fountains remain dry. We actually peeked into their upscale restaurant and menu and here too it can be a nice way to enjoy the visit with a moderately priced lunch or dinner. No open bar only beer and wine. Always something to see here so go and check it out. You can spend a day or simply go for several hours and experience specific exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264kenf
40,Nice place,"Been there on a Friday afternoon when it closes al 9. If you arrive at 4 parking is just 10 instead of 15... From parking to the museum you can walk 0.8 miles uphill or take the tram. The museum is well organized and has mostly European paintings and sculpture. The impressionists were present too and we loved it. The views are spectacular, the cactus garden and the circular one beautiful. People were picnicking there. Was fun. A cute Friday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aburel
40,The best view in LA,Great views and beautiful art are the draw here. Go early ! I can't stress that enough. The tram ride up is fun and the cafe was good. Maplethorp exhibit is .....interesting for adults,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaypowen
50,Great Museum,Our family went to the museum a few months after it open and it was an unforgettable experience. Great parking and exceptional exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaE7048SV
50,must see museum and views!,"The Getty center is awesome! We spent only 2.5 hours there which was a good start, but there is plenty more to see. We started with an architectural tour, which was very good. Then we wandered into the special exhibits building and then into the American building. We ended with a walk through the gardens. We had a clear day with amazing views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abh345678
50,Awe inspiring,You can easily spend a full day here - a free art gallery and garden with great views. Perfect place and you don't even get asked for donations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alan19192016
50,Art with sweeping views,"This is not to be confused with The Getty Villa which is down the road and needs a reservation.The Getty is free to get in with the exception of parking and some rotating exhibits. You can make the trek up the hill to the museums or you can wait for the tram. Just depends on your patience and stamina.On the Getty grounds you'll find fine art, photography and sculptures. Theres also a collection of Louis the XIII furniture and art. They have a lush garden and sweeping views of the pacific. Ive come here sometimes to enjoy some wine with friends. Its also great for families or if you want to just take in the art solo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaezaJay
50,"Unbelievable beautiful, a rich collection. A MUST to see.","We visit the museum . First the architecture, second the place, third the organization and than last but not least: the collection, all amazing, all top!!An amazing beautiful and rich collection with an very high diversity. A interesting museum for every person on this earth. Also beautiful to visit the Museum with kids. Take a look on the site of the Getty museum for more details about the collection, but our advise is: GO !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5921NNpeterv
40,Great collection,Well worth half a day spent there to see a great collection under one roof. Master pieces of well known artist can be seen in this musuem set in serene surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Menenz
40,A beautiful view of the city,We went to The Gettysburg center for a short visit with friends from out of town and saw only two of the expeditions. The center is an important addition to the museums of Los Angeles although if you only have a limited amount of time I would choose a different place to visit as it will leave you wondering where the time went. The Gettysburg does have a very good restaurant and one of the best views of the city so if you have the time and want to enjoy a good lunch and the view I would make a reservation and enjoy. The parking is at the bottom of the hill and costs but the tram ride to the top and the museum is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7708AUruthb
50,Enjoying the staycation,"We are enjoying our staycation and decided to bring the kids to see the Getty Museum. Where else can you see great art, architecture, gardens, and views of LA? Arrived around 10:30 a.m. and took the tram up, we had decided to walk back down to the tram after we were done. Make sure you get the free audio tour. They give you an itouch & headphones, show you how to use it and off you go. When you are viewing the exhibits there are numbers on each piece and you just punch them in and it tells you about each item. Much better than a group tour as you can go at your own pace. There were many school kids there on field trips but the place is so large it doesn't feel crowded. We were there for about 4 hours and didn't finish up all the buildings. We will definitely be back, this time we will pack a lunch and have lunch in the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinmom8
50,Had no idea,What a wonderful treasure! No need to pay for tours as there are guided docent tours all day long. We spent the whole day and couldn't see it all. There are elevators for when you get too tired for the stairs. Also cafes and restaurant. But next time we will bring picnic food. Only problem is lugging it around until you decide to eat. The views of LA are also wonderful if you are lucky enough to have a clear day like we did. There is a good website. Just google it. The Getty. Not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragsgolf
40,Beautiful Grounds-- and Free,"Why not go to the Getty? That's the real question. Amazing grounds, gardens, views, and buildings. Rotating art, some is really impressive, other works are meh, but for free... one of the best free attractions in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MykeC166
10,Go early or give up,"By the time we navigated the short distance from our hotel through road works and a confusing gps, joined the throng trying to get a park and realising it was $15 just to park when we could have walked or got a lift from our hotel we then emerged to a huge queue to get in and just couldn't face it. We have been to fabulous museums all over the world and have not doubt that this would be one of them. If you can't get here before opening I would say don't bother. We enjoyed a free park and walki up to the Hollywood sign instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kitmeister
50,Worth a visit,This place is free to enter and accessible by car( parking cost $18). You park your car and then board a tram up to the museum. The place is beautiful - the art work as well as the outdoor garden displays. the views over LA are also great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rykony
50,Worth allowing a day.,Fantastic art display. I recomend you get the audio. It is excellent and easy to use.Some very good displays of modern art.The tapestry displays are excellent. American furniture and home ware is also good.Very accessible for everyone. Plenty of room toe view in comfort without being too crowded.Views from the centre are fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brisdi
50,An architectural wonder,"I love this place!!!! I have been many times and learn something new every time. I come more for the architecture and the beautiful views more than the art, but some of the art rotating through can be quit good. They have a tram that takes you to the top and sets you off to explore the multiple buildings and beautiful gardens. A great place to come for lunch and enjoy the gardens and views outside. I can't recommend the Getty enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandh871
50,Wonderful museum,"Very beautiful museum grounds. Great place to sit and have a coffee or snack. Nicely organized into 5 buildings, easy to see all the exhibits and take a few breaks in between. The gardens are spectacular! Lots of school classes with kids running around during weekday hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dogblue309
50,Don't Miss,"I have been to the LA area a handful of times in my life and, though being aware of The Getty Center, I have never chosen to stop there. I'm so glad I finally did. If you have the time, I would say a minimum of three hours, you will love it. Forget for the moment that it's an art museum, you can go there and just stroll the grounds and feel you had a wonderful day. The museum is free after you pay the $15 parking fee. From the parking complex you take the tram up the mountain to the absolutely beautiful architecture of The Getty. I have never been so impressed with architectural design. If you arrive at a time when the line for the tram is too long you can use the walkway to the museum (a little over a half mile). Go expecting to take your time and relax. Seeing all the art the museum has to offer is probably not going to happen unless you spend the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaryS863
50,A must see while visiting LA!,"There is so much beauty here - in the architecture, the plants, the artwork, the views. You can be as energetic or as chill as you want here. We went after a 4.2 mile run on the beach and decided to just to hang out in the grass and enjoy the surroundings while relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenalewis100

50,Fantastic place,"We would have overlooked this museum if our tour guide didn't recommended it to us. We happened to have a few hours unplanned, so we decided to check it out. It was lovely! The architecture was incredible especially after we followed a museum tour on this. The collection was interesting, and thoughtfully organised. We enjoyed a healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced lunch with a amazing view. Don't miss this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryjoakley
50,just being there,"The architecture of the Getty Center makes it possible to just be there, sit for hours and feel good. One does not even need to see the art. I enjoyed two guided tours and the French tapestry special show is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927catharinac
50,Get the Getty!!,"A must must visit for anyone who is coming to El Lay (lol).The visit starts with a monorail ride to the Getty centre which offers breath taking views of the city and the ever so bustling highway.Further up.. The centre has an excellent collection of painting, murals, antiques to keep you occupied for the entire afternoon.All in all a wonderful experience that to at just 15$!!Definitely worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51rashmim

40,Beautiful but a bit disappointing.,Amazing building but the art collection is a bit disappointing to someone who is used to the museums and art galleries in Europe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izas548
30,Beautiful Building,"We enjoyed our visit to the Getty, mostly because of the beautiful architecture of the building, the breathtaking views and the gorgeous gardens. The art collections are better at the LACMA and the staff at the LACMA is way nicer and welcoming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
50,Wonderful Art Museum,We visited this museum in March 2016 and were incredibly impressed by both the architecture and the art collection. Entry is free and that even includes the very good guided tours which are well worth taking. The cafes and restaurants serve excellent food at low prices. After visiting the inside it is imperative to walk around the beautiful gardens which are artistic masterpieces in their own right. The only downside is poor access by public transport or by very expensive taxis.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chidham
50,"A ""must see"" in LA","I'm an LA native and I always suggest visitors take a trip to The Getty Center while here. Admission is absolutely free of charge (but there is a fee for parking).While the building and grounds are impressive, I personally find the permanent collection to be a bit bland.

They had both an architecture tour and garden tour when we where there this week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukeJAllen
40,Free attraction in LA.,"Definitely one of the places you want to visit if you're into art. It has many collections of paintings, sculptures and other great pieces of art work in there. The site itself is also beautiful and has a nice scenic view, so worth a visit if you're visiting Los Angeles. And of course, as many stated, it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clevin_Ling
50,A beautiful building with a great collection.,"This building complex is in a stunning mountain top setting reached by a monorail. The collections were excellent, but we were particularly impressed by the two garden we visited. The cactus garden was unique and the ornamental garden surrounding a water feature was beautifully presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T6074MHpaulb
50,Favorite place to bring my tourist friends in LA,"World class art, gorgeous sweeping views of the city and ocean from the observation deck, and beautifully architected infrastructure and gardens. I recommend going earlier in the morning and taking the art overview tour. Then you can take the architecture or gardens tour and get a sense for what the grand plan of the Center was. They also offer other more specialized art tours throughout the day. The docents are all really knowledgable, and best yet, it's all free, only paying for parking. On summer weekend nights the Getty offers a series of local musical artists. This is my favorite place to take anyone who visits me in LA; I'm always surprised how many of my family and friends have never even heard of it.The Getty Villa in Malibu is free with your parking at the Getty Center, so why not make a day of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortcircuit601
50,Must Do,"The Getty Museum is a free activity. If you drive there, you will only pay a small fee for the parking. The Museum is located on top of the Santa Monica Mountain and has a magnificent view.

50,"Renaissance masters Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Monet, Degas et al","If I were to tell you that you can see the art of these masters for free, you'd say I was kidding... but YES, you can see these for free at the Getty. We spent a few hours here to get over our jetlag, but I wish we had more stamina to do the place justice. It is definitely worth the $15 parking and effort to get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roamas

40,Architecture,"This is a fantastic place, but do think much of its charm is in the architecture, could spend hours wondering the yards and the building, very interesting and beautiful, stunning place. The exhibitions, the permanent ones are pretty blunt compared to most of the ones you get in Europe, historically educating tho. Worth the visit most definitely, whether or not you're an art fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annaelile
50,Great Museum for Free!,"The museum is amazing for its art, sculptures and special attractions. The only thing is that you have to pay $15 for parking.

Parking $15. Check website for address as GPS inaccurate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RittSq
30,I don't know..I guess the gardens...,I have been unimpressed with the shows up at the Getty. I swear my friends and I could curate it better in our pajamas. All that money and they can't put a great show together to save themselves. But here is what is nice. A trip up for the view. Not on a super packed weekend. No way. But in the middle of the week or if ona weekend make it late in the day. Buy a coffee up there walk around the gardens and take a look at the magnificent view. Which will be better than anything inside the buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
50,Don't miss it!,"One of the finest museums I have ever visited, but it's more than a museum, it's an experience, and we spent almost the entire day here. Entrance is free, parking $15.

50,LA must-do,"The Getty Center for sure should on the short list of LA must-dos.

The only fee is for the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronnystam
50,An oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle,"The Getty Center is a terrific place to go. To see art, to see the gardens and to escape the hustle and bustle. A great experience, we love the tram ride to the top and the children's room. The permanent exhibits are terrific and the temporary ones are always spot on.Food here is good, but pricey. Not a lot of shade, but they offer parasols for your stroll about the grounds. When the weather is clear you can see across to downtown. Very well laid out. I take all my out of town guests here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannb406
50,Cultural Experience At The Getty!,You will not be disappointed with your visit to the Getty. You can bring a bottle of wine and a picnic basket to sit in the garden for a romantic get together for two or if you have visitors from out of the city bring them here for a cultural experience. You will need at least half a day to take your time to see everything. It is free to get in to the different exhibit buildings but you have to pay to park. There is a train that will bring you up and back down again to your parking area which will start and end your day with some nice views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCourt2015

I had visited the Getty when the only location was in Malibu, but this was my first trip to the ""new"" center.I took my 13 year old son to absorb a little culture, and was pleasantly surprised to find him generally interested. They do a fantastic job of displaying the various artwork, with plenty of descriptions about what you are looking at.They have a good variety of tours available, so surely there is at least one you'd be interested in. I look forward to my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamquestar
50,Get to the Getty,"A trip to The Getty Center is one you won't regret. I can't say I am the greatest appreciater of art, but there is so much to see here, there is bound to be something that takes your interest. I really enjoyed the ""Noir: The Romance of Black"" exhibition which is showing until May 2016.Each pavillion showcases paintings, tapestries, sculptures, glasswork etc. There are mediums and pieces from around the world and spanning centuries. If anything, make sure you see Van Gogh's Irises!!The gardens are well worth taking a stroll around or sitting in for a while. So I'd recommend visiting the Getty on a sunny day, despite this being a museum.The cafe food is average..but then you are not visiting here to eat. Entry is free and parking is $20 for the day. A great activitiy for families, couples or just on your own - I really enjoyed just taking my time, and it ended up being most of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicao140

You only pay for parking, the rest is all free. They have world class permanent exhibits and also numerous exhibits that rotate thru the many buildings that make up the Getty Center. You ride this cool tram up to the top of the mountain, and then the entire Getty ""campus"" is in front of you. They have all the masters and enough varied art and art forms to satisfy everyone.

50,Eight Wonder of the World,Great experience to visit the Getty museum in Los Angeles. Admission is free. Parking is maybe $10. Grounds are beautiful and offer amazing views of the city. Art exhibits are also wonderful. You should plan on at least 2-3 hours to see the Getty inside and out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryTraveler240
30,Peaceful and beautiful gardens but…..,"Beautiful architecture and peaceful garden, but collection is just average. Do not see the need for pornographic exhibitions as that is boring and no longer shocking. Beware if you have young children to look for the signs advising you of this. Parking fee of $15 is ridiculous as this was to be a free museum, but broke LA must find ways to make money. Long lines for the tram on weekends. The views are lovely and the cafe is not bad, but expensive. Guess, I have just seen better museums in the United States, so I was not all that impressed. Just my opinion as an artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailySanDiego
50,Amazing,"This place is fabulous! Beautiful property, architecture, gardens and exhibits. Had 2 scavenger hunts that my 11 and 8 year olds found enjoyable and got them engaged in the place.

When you arrive to the Getty, it is remarkable to have such a fantastic oasis on top of a hill surrounded by the bustling city below. You can virtually see everything around you and see all of LA. The buildings are beautifully design and extremely well maintained. The gardens are always perfect and a great photo spot.Check out the restaurant if you have time, their food is actually pretty impressive and service impeccable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jumbofresh
30,Just an average collection,"The gardens are beautiful to walk around and the views of LA are nice if you are lucky enough to come on a good day. Otherwise, while the museum is free I don't think its worth the $15 parking, time wasted trying to find parking and waiting in line to get up to museum via monorail. The collection is just average. For example, they have one Van Gogh, a few pieces by Monet, a few works by Degas , a Renoir, a few by Manet. These aren't even the major pieces of these artists. I honestly found the museum overrated, sure the architecture is great but this isn't the the number 1 thing to do in LA. You can find better ways to spend your time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s2094
50,I steal garden ideas at The Getty,Thanks JP!The gardens and Richard Maier architecture at The Getty are simply amazing. I take photos on my phone and email them to my landscape architect to add to our home gardens.My kid LOVES The Getty too. Just pay to park and then you get to ride a train?

With a place so easy to get to, one should not pass up the opertunty to experience a lovely day in LA! The people movers are the best ride in town they wisk you up to the hilltop jewel and as the doors open your adventure begins. Time stops for me when I'm there.

You pay $15 to park in the parking garage where they then tram-ride you up (about 5 minutes) to The Getty. The Getty is free otherwise. It's beautiful and has many exhibits. We only had time for one painting exhibit and the gardens, but would have loved to utilize the docent tours and visit all the art. Give yourself plenty of time. If you need to be somewhere prepare in advance for the tram ride back down as there can be lines. The first hour is free to park, but it's not a lot of time to go up, to see really anything, and get back. It would be worth the time to visit.

This is what you can do if you are well-funded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneAgain02
50,"Getty Center for art, music, picnics, views","The Getty Center is an excellent getaway from the bustle of the city. If you are interested in top notch art, you will find stunning collections from illuminated manuscripts, to contemporary photography. If you are an architecture or landscaping buff you will enjoy looking at the building and gardens. A documentary, ""Concert of Wills"" is a fascinating look at the creation of this landmark. Sadly, for now, the garden fountains are off due to the drought. When running, the fountain starts at the top patio and trickles down through a landscape that evokes waterfalls, mountain streams and woodlands, ending in a zen pond at the bottom. If you're not in the mood for art or architecture and just want to enjoy a beautiful day, bring a sketchbook, or take the kids to the garden for a picnic and roll on the grassy hills. If music is your thing, check Getty's ""Live off the 405"" live, free events. Museum entry is free but parking is a bit steep. Shuttles are available, the Getty Center is served by Metro Rapid Line 761, which stops at the main gate on Sepulveda Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahCalifornia
40,A day at The Getty,"We went to The Getty to celebrate an anniversary as we as a couple enjoy fine art everywhere.This was not my first trip, and I have also been going to the Getty Villa since before it's renovation and knew it so well I could be a docent there. I venture to guess that the same architect did the renovation there, as the new restaurant area is completely out of character with the integrity of the original Villa building. A shame,. I say this, as a designer myself.Because of the remarkable collection of important, breathtaking art, one has to give the Getty Center a four star. The galleries as separate rooms are well arranged with regard to collections, and if one goes only for the spectacular art collection within the walls, then all is there. As a full day, which includes some food and an enjoyable experience in the exterior common areas, the Getty Center falls short of adequate for an establishment of such reputation.Unlike the Getty Villa, the building however, from an esthetic perspective could as well be a gargantuan cement mausoleum. Full of angles and corners, massive unpainted cement exterior walls, and not enough greenery and plant life in the exterior areas to render a respite from the stark hard cement structure. Unlike European museums done in a minimalist style, it misses the mark entirely.So art is there, but to enjoy a day there, including an enjoyable experience at the restaurant and open areas to relax a little,it falls short, in comparison to other places where one has art and esthetic beauty, restaurants and gift shops such as the Huntington library and art collection in San Marino.The art is there, but the balance of serenity is not. Perhaps after the drought is over in Los Angeles ,it will be improved. Hopefully, then the experience will be complete .Soleil M",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soleilm525

Once you park and take elevator up, there was long line up for tram and bag check. We walked up, so quick look through the bags (not in line up) and about 20 minutes to walk up. It isn't super steep but doable for average person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoonermomma1
50,"""Brilliant, well worth a visit""","What a great visit to this wonderful museum. The architecture of the building is fantastic, and there is so much to see inside, and you get great views over LA. The gardens are very pretty too. The Museum is free ( $15 for car parking) we went by public transport. As the museum is set high up a hill, there is a free tram to take you up. The audio guide is free too on production of ID. There are plenty of places to sit and have a rest. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bluebell212013

50,The Views Alone are Worth a Visit,"I am a local. The Getty Museum is a must see while in Los Angeles. You can spend as much or as little time at the museum, as you wish. The grounds of the museum are spectacular. The views (especially when the skies are clear) are worth the visit alone. The restaurant is nice and the cafeteria works well with if you are travelling with children. It is easy to get to (by car, by bus). Walk the gardens, view the art have a meal and enjoy the views. I have gone as an adult only trip, a family with young children and a family with teens. It is appropriate for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretapar
50,Favorite Stop in LA,"A great way to spend a day. Its free and fabulous, with a breathtaking view of the city. The architecture alone is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquaBend
50,A L.A. must see!,"This is definitely a top destination when visiting Los Angeles. The permanent collection is full of masterpieces and there are always interesting temporary exhibits. The buildings alone are a marvel. And, the view is magnificent. You can see all across West L.A. to the ocean. Admission is free but you have to pay for parking. It's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566KarenP
50,"Great art, great views, great food.","Its definitely a world class structure and an example of art to admire before you get inside to look at the art collection, which is as good as collections in Europe. Sometimes I go and just go into two buildings not all four so I can slowly take the pieces in and still have time to wander in the garden, check out the spectacular view [day or night] over-looking the city, or grab a bite to eat. You can get a good lunch at the cafe and a great lunch at the pricey restaurant that overlooks the valley; its worth it. Always a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarafix
50,Nice place to visit...,It is a place that when in Los Angeles it should not be missed. Nice collection of art and no charge (except for parking). Nice view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalifSue
50,Beautiful cultural event,"I have made several visits to the Getty Center alone, with family and with out of town guests. It is the perfect spot in LA to spend the day, enjoy exhibits, relax in the beautiful gardens and have lunch in their fabulous restaurant that offers great food and service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/o1012016
40,Beautiful day in the springtime sun,"We had a wonderful day at the Getty. My sisters were visiting and we had brunch there in the restaurant. After Brunch we strolled through the gardens, and also in the galleries. there was beautiful scenery and we felt on top of the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spygirl55
50,"Love great art, views and good food - this is it!","We live nearby and go there all the time. They always have new and interesting exhibitions. The food in the restaurant is almost unfailingly good. We usually go for a late brunch on Sundays (2-3 p.m.), and we always order their shortribs with a good bottle of red wine. Service is good, ambience is excellent with white tablecloths, and the views are fantastic. Ask for a window table. It is located just off the 405 freeway, south of Mulholland Drive. There are 2 gift shops, one small and one larger. They sell art books, prints, scarves and other interesting objects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCD2
50,Beautiful Surrounding,"This is a great place to take leisurely strolls, view beautiful artwork and gardens. A great afternoon of peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/demerits
50,Nice museum park,"There is lots to see at the Getty centre, architecture, gardens, different exhibitions. The food at the restaurant is good too and the best thing is it's free. However if you travel with taxi or public transport it's a bit painful to get there. But worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irisg658
50,Great Venue!,Magnificent architecture inside and landscape design outside...plus art! It is a fabulous day spent at this lovely location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354tedb
50,Always a Treat,"I love to take guests of LA to this unique experience. From the galleries of fine history and art, to the architecture and landscaping and vistas, its a must see in my book of LA things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamPurtakiss
50,"Free entrance,parking is currently $15 per car, tram ride to the Center is free.","You won't regret visiting the Getty Center. There's just so much to see, and you get a magnificent view Los Angeles from there. There's a lot of paintings, sculptures, and art exhibits, there's an activity center for kids, the buildings and the facilities are modern.It's a bit tricky to find the parking entrance by GPS so it is important to follow the signs. The parking entrance is under the freeway, and the only way to the Center is by riding the tram which is accessible from the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnasY3576YX
50,What a beautiful place,"Whether it is enjoying the setting and the architecture, or the collections, your day will not be misspent at the Getty. It might be a little hard to get to (but what in LA is not?), but is well worth the effort. I had been wanting to go since it opened, but never had the opportunity. I'll go back though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wgou
50,World Class Art,This is a fabulous side trip to make in LA. World class art and wonderful garden tour. Take your tennis shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213LAnone
50,My Number One Recommendation in LA for Adults,"I have lived in LA all my life. If you have got kids you have to visit Disneyland. But for adult entertainment I prefer The Getty. It is beautifully situated on top of a hill overlooking the LA basin and down to the ocean. The museum is always rotating new exhibits. And the Restaurant at Getty Center is one of my favorites. It is expensive, but very fine dining where you can get fresh light fare and a glass of wine. We also like to take a walk in the gardens. This is a walking museum. While they have handicap ramps, it is most easily traversed and enjoyed by the stairs between the museum's grounds levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smc777
20,A trip down non-revelant lane,Not to sound unintelligent. ..get ready for it. As an African American i found this center to be of no interest. I could not feel myself in any of the many rooms. I love history and just felt so left out of this time period. The garden is awsome and the artifacts are beautiful but this place speaks to Anglo english culture and nothing more. If you're African American do yourself a favor and spend your time and money elsewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427harryc
50,Plan to spend the day.,"A great setting for great art. Even if you don't like art, spend the day in the gardens, enjoying the view and pausing for a snack or a meal. Electric car chargers are available. Enter the underground parking structure and head towards the exit. Keep left and the chargers are on the narrow, north (I believe) wall. You pay for parking, not for the museum. Busy on weekends. Arrive early for less stress. If it is raining, umbrellas are supplied to get from building to building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL9604CC
50,Top attraction for out of town guests,"When we recommend the Getty museum to visitors who have never been there before, they are hesitant about spending too much of their L.A. time inside a museum (especially if they are not passionate about art). So we tell them it's free, so no harm checking it out for an hour. Invariably we drop them off saying they want more time, and so we pick them up later in the day. Especially if it's a nice, clear day, it's nice to spend time outdoors in the terraces and gardens between the buildings, and then venture back inside to see more masterpieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVPURINS
50,one place that has so much to offer,"A beautiful museum with great art work and a beautiful garden to walk around, plenty to do.Do take the advantage of tours that they offer. You will get a lot more of enjoying the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EFongS
50,Eye Candy,"I am an Artist so the Getty Center for me is an amazing place. Their rotating exhibits are always great. I have seen Bernini, French Drawing, Photography and painting exhibits. Their permanent collection is also great and you could spend days studying the collections. I highly recommend dinner or a nice lunch in their restaurant. The food is excellent. Try to go on a day when it is not too warm as there is a lot of walking especially if you want to explore the amazing gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylK358
50,Always a Delightful Experience,"Have been there many times over the years. Never disappoints! The temporary featured exhibits introduce new and interesting art and artists.

50,Best view in the city,The views from the museum are amazing. Be sure to take a docent led tour - you get so much more information. An absolute must visit if you are in Los Angeles. In addition they have free concerts and their restaurants are very nice. Do not miss!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledY3269JY
50,Versatile & interesting,If you like art you will love The Getty. Try to take the architectural docent led tour which gives you a lot of information about the physical body of the museum & the garden tour also if time permits. Nice eating places. And if you have the stamina it is nice to walk up & back down the drive instead of taking motorized transport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dnthv1
50,"Beautiful setting, beautiful view.","The Getty Center is a marvel in so many ways. The architecture of the building alone is well worth the visit, but there are also intricate gardens to explore, a vast museum worth of art & history to absorb, and a breathtaking view of Los Angeles.The permanent collection is impressive but be sure to check out the guest exhibits as well which have ranged from war photography to medieval illuminated manuscripts.The Getty Center really does have something for everyone. You can sit in the courtyard and have coffee and relax, or you can explore the museum and gardens, or all of the above. It's a great day for the whole family.The best part, it's free! The only thing you have to pay for it parking, which you can avoid if you take public transit or carpool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hshaukat
50,"Breathtaking views, and an explosion of artistic beauty.","The location alone is just unbelievable - the architecture itself reflects such a flowing spirit. Add the world class art, amazing surroundings and food options makes his an exciting adventure.

A truely worth visiting time and time again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4demama
50,A great view of LA,"The setting of the Getty is magnificent. What is showing in the galleries almost doesn't matter. From the time you enter the tram which carries you to the top of the hill you are treated to great vistas to the east and west. Beautiful views of downtown and the ocean on a clear day make you never want to leave. The Getty grounds are also wonderful for roaming and reading or just having moments of quiet contemplation. The gardens are beautiful Lots of places for coffee and a very nice restaurant (though the hours are limited) The exhibits are generally interesting and worthwhile. You could easily spend a day here. You have to pay for parking, but the Getty is also accessible by bus. Reaky a must see on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WinifredN

Lovely way to spend an afternoon. Various rotating art exhibits are interesting. The art collection is decent, nothing spectacular.

50,A place to enjoy.,The Getty Center is a place where you can take your family - young and old - the view on a clear day is excellent - the architecture spectacular - there is a garden - the food in the restaurant is superb. The exhibits are interesting especially the non permanent collections - the bookstore is well stocked - there are lectures and special events listed on their website.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSilton
50,Must see in LA,"Even if you are not an art lover this is a must see for a visit to LA. Beautiful grounds and a garden and both casual and upscale dining with amazing views of the city. It's also free, though they do charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becauseIcan
50,Not to be missed,"With both a world class art collection and amazing surroundings, this museum is well worth the time it takes to visit. Plenty of indoor and outdoor spaces to sit and enjoy the beautiful surrounding mountain scenery. We loved the tapestries and furniture. There are constant tours you can participate in or use the audio available to enjoy a self guided tour at your own pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3792LMericm

The docents who give the complimentary tours of the museum are very friendly and helpful. Definitely coming every time we visit Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lacymoon
50,Will go back again and again,"There is so much to see, it's hard to take it all in during one visit. However, we sure tried. We were able to give ample attention to 3 of the buildings' contents and have a snack, too. The gardens were stunning and fun to roam; the exhibits were impressive. I can't wait to visit LA again and will definitely put this on my list of places to revisit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyM260
50,Always discovering something new...or old,"The Getty is like no other museum in the world. It's the only place I must visit on every trip to Los Angeles. And it never disappoints. The Exhibitions Pavillion always seems to have a magnificent exhibition (the current one of tapestries of Louis XIV is breath-taking) and Research Institute always seem to have something unique and intriguing (the current one on artworks related to food and festivals is extraordinary). The West Pavillion always has a good photographic exhibition (such as the current one on daguerrotypes). The bookstore is among the best at any museum. And the café and restaurant are excellent. But the most spectacular features of The Getty are the architecture, the gardens, the view, and the overall setting. There are more substantive art museums in the US--The Metropolitan Museum, the National Gallery, and those in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis--but no museum experience is more exhilarating than a visit to The Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanB801
50,Wow so cool,"We absolutely loved our visit to the Getty centre today. And it was all free!!! We caught an uber there and when you get to the carpark, the train takes you up to the entrance. They provide you with complimentary head-sets and iPods where you just enter the number of the individual piece of art work and you hear commentary on the piece.The gardens are spectacular , the architecture is amazing and the works of art are really cool. A great day out and my family loved it too .We also ate at the restaurant and the food was exquisite too.Definitely worth the day out .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndeborah

50,Could spend day here,Worth the trip. It's free except parking is 15.00. Easily accessible off the metro bus stop. Volunteers even on a Tuesday to help make this place special. Thank you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeyparsons
50,Inspirational Retreat,"Flew down to LA from Seattle to take my wife to the Getty for her birthday and for a little inspirational retreat. We arrived at the Getty at opening and left at closing. I was initially worried that we'd run out of things to do spending a whole day there but it turned out to be an absolutely fabulous experience. The time really got away from us as we toured each exhibit, the gardens, vistas, and even the museum stores. We took three tours--a museum overview tour, garden tour, and architecture tour--which really enlightened us. We had all three meals there--coffee and pastries at a food cart for breakfast, salad and a wrap at the Garden Café, and a gourmet dinner at the Getty restaurant.At museums like the Getty, with all its natural light and outdoor space, you never experience museum fatigue. If you start feeling overwhelmed by all the paintings and art, take at stroll outside and relax on the lawn. Refresh.After our dinner at the Getty Restaurant, we had about an hour to stroll through the museum and tapestry exhibit. There weren't many people left at the museum. A weather front had come through which brought a heavy misty rain to the top of the hill where the museum stands. It was like walking around in a cloud and created a wonderful fairy tale atmosphere. It was the perfect touch to an inspirational and beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeattleRican
50,Beautiful museum and view,This was a very nice place to spend an afternoon when the weather is nice. The museum and the view are worth going for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janb3321

50,Hidden gem.,Entry is free. Parking $15. Wonderful place for the whole family. Never overcrowded. Go on their great tours of the gardens and the museum to have a much better appreciation for the place. The cafe is real handy so you can spend a whole day on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9612RAkevinb

50,Wow!!! The building and space are more impressive than the art!,"Amazing building and space. Best views in L.A. You can see from downtown to Santa Monica and the Pacific Ocean. Several cafes and food/drink kiosks on site with great places to cool your heels for a beer or glass of wine. Multiple free 1-hr tours (we did the Collection Highlights, which is good for folks new to art).$15/car, so very affordable for everyone.Give yourself at least 2hrs, but you could easily spend 5-6 if you had lunch at The Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnenc
50,Magnificent,"I have driven by the museum several times and decided I would stop in and visit. I'm so happy I did. It was so beautiful. My traveling companion wasn't excited about the ride up there nor me trying to kill her when I ordered something that had a honey comb on it (forgot she was allergic)... But through it all, we enjoyed the beautiful flowers, modern art and architecture, the light meal, people watching and the wonderful views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ApolloGenito
50,Must visit,"The displays in the museum are first-class. But the spectacular hilltop location and gardens alone are worth a trip to the Getty Center. As locals, we often take out of town visitors there, but we like to go on our own, too. Be sure to take a camera if you enjoy taking photos of views, plants and amazing landscaping. Admission is free, but parking costs $15 per vehicle. A tram delivers you from the parking lot up to the Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PupWalker89

First you park u Sergio's d and take a tram to the top of the hill where this glorious place sits. You enter a main building which unfolds into a courtyard which sits in the middle of five buildings all filled with exquisite works of art. And the gardens! Beautiful! We saw the likes of paintings by the Masters - Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet etc. There was an exhibit of breathtaking silk tapestries from the 1600's Italy and France. Mindblowiing! Free admission, $15.00 parking which has to be paid before you leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Javajude

A GREAT FIND!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerriB189
50,Lovely at any time of year,"We visited the Getty Center on our way to take our visitor back to the airport. Not only is a great place (inside and out) but it makes ""going home day"" something other than travel and hassle. Their special exhibits are always interesting (this time ""The Edible Monument: The art of food for festivals""). For the first time we took a close look at the sculpture garden at the bottom of the hill - well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
50,Incredible and for fre. Just pay for the parking,"Incredible museum located on the top of a cliff with a 360 view of the ocean and the city.

40,A must see if you have a few days in Los Angeles,This is a unique museum because it was a private collection. The Getty House on the Coast highway is also a great place to visit but the hours of operation are limited. The views of the Los Angeles Basin from the Getty Center are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryf820
50,"Spectacular , not to miss","How in the heck can All of this cultural enrichment be free, not to mention the garden & the view. The parking is 8.00 but it's acceptable by bus and the trick is to park for free in the valley and bus in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madaven818
50,My favourite place to go in LA,It is just a cool place to relax and see art for free. Definately a must do in LA. Amazing view. During the week it is more relaxed cause it has less tourists/people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniel_samo

My teenage girls liked it here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinska2019
50,Beautiful Landscapes,The Getty offers beautiful views from LA. The Building is amazing. The staff is very friendly.But it should have more contemporany art to match such a incredible architeture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiog482
50,The highlight of my California trip,From the paintings to the sculptures to the architecture of the place--twas all great. The garden is also wonderful plus the scenic view of downtown LA. I cannot wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marmelisms

Great coffee cart and eateries.The architecture was amazing as was the little tram ride up to the Centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/segwayoban
50,Good time at the FREE museum!,"This was a great museum, although it is huge and you can't expect to see it all in one visit! We recommend doing one of the free museum tours; there are many to choose from throughout the day. There is a fancy restaurant, but we recommend buying from the cafeteria if you want to have a meal there. Also, the view from the cable car that takes you to the center is amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682lb
50,"If You Love Paintings, This Is The Place For You!",I visited the Getty Villa last week and found the art to be beautiful but there are not as many paintings as I knew resided at The Getty Center. I've been here previously many times and I found it just as I remembered. It is huge and the different wings hold different art. Each wing has many balconies so that you can step outside and gaze at the entire city of Los Angeles. The view is unmatched. The art is unmatched and I will continue to come back when I need to take it all in and appreciate what can be done at the hands of an artist. Makes me wish I had some artistic talent. Here is a tip- you can pay the parking fee ONCE and visit both The Getty Villa and The Getty Center on the same day!!!!! I just learned that and I live in LA!!! Great money saving tip!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetogoCalabasas
40,A gorgeous place,The Getty center and the villa are both very interesting. While the art isn't as impressive as the art institute it is worth the trip. Check out the mummy. It's a lot of walking so comfy shoes are a must. Only caution is you must have tickets. The tickets are free but parking is plentiful and costs $15. per car regardless of the number of guests. I think a visit is worth your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlowerLover117
40,Great for views and gardens and if unsure about the art,"Free entry to this hill top wonder - although parking is $15 Even if you are ambivalent about art, then the gardens and views are wonderful.

50,Not to be missed!,"This is a must for any visit to LA. Located high above the city, allowing spectacle views. The plan of the museum keeps ""museum fatigue"" to a minimum. The tram ride from the parking lot to the museum is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrappe
50,Peaceful & Serene Getaway,"Awesome is the word that comes to my mind. You can go up there and just wander around the gardens, take in some art work, dine at the beautiful restaurant overlooking the hills/canyon, or just enjoy a coffee and some culture. This place is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,Best View in L.A.,Experience the great architecture as well as the art. This museum is one of the must do in Los Angeles even if your not into art. The gardens and view is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craiginchicago

Super way to spend a sunny Sunday in Los Angeles.Tip : If its busy getting back on the tram to parking garage - walk down - enjoy the views and walk off the yummy French Toast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesalda2016
50,Lovely museum and grounds,I didn't get the chance to see all of it; likely need multiple visits. The grounds are nice to walk through and the individual buildings offer nice-size bites of a particular medium or era.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viewsaskew
50,"Great variety, great value","Visited here on a recent Saturday morning. We were surprised that the only charge is $15 for parking. A tram car takes you up the mountain to the museum, where you can browse through several buildings of art exhibits as well as outdoor gardens. The views are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixpalz
50,Art that grows with the seasons--the Central Garden,"I'm not a gardener. But I love art and the Getty Center Central Garden is art at its finest. Robert Irwin's design for this sprawling masterpiece is simply stunning, with a message that we can all embrace: Earth's gifts can be enjoyed for their sheer beauty, even when placed within sight of one of the largest urban areas on the planet. My wife and I spent so much time in the garden that we didn't allow ourselves enough time to visit the indoor galleries. Which means, of course, that we will likely return.We'll start the next visit, however, with another stroll through the garden to absorb the subtle changes envisioned by the artist as the seasons change. To truly appreciate his vision we suggest you take advantage of the free 45-minute guided tour. It's well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S0Lsearcher
50,Surreal. Pictures cannot describe the beauty of The Getty Center,"Unbelievable. Nothing else can describe the views, landscaping, buildings, vibe, culture, and abundance of smiles seen all of the grounds. Everyone was in awe of The Getty Center. How can one not be w/ the incredible views and serenity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabePelus
50,Always Something New and Beautiful to See!,"We've gone many times over the years, from school field trips when the kids were young, to recent visits. It is beautiful inside and out and has so many beautiful objects of art you can never get bored and there is always something to please all in the crowd! The grounds are beautiful and views are spectacular. A lovely place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileenandmarkk
30,Found this fairly boring,Lots of exhibits and such however found it to be a little boring overall. Large buildings filled with lots and artifacts and paintings however got over this fairly quickly.Nice views and the garden is alright. There was a bit of construction going on when we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Pones
50,World class Museum AND IT IS FREE!,"Park on the north side of Sepulveda, take the tram up to the site, enjoy a world class collection of art, sculpture, see a performance, have a snack or a meal (the first green out of your pocket) and experience an afternoon of smelling the artsy roses.The only downside to a day at the Getty is mistiming your exit, and getting onto the 405 freeway with 2 million other Los Angelinos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retiredgenman
50,Impressive architecture housing impressive art,"Griffith Observatory and Hollywood are always the top LA attractions that many know, but the Getty Center should be on the top as well! Even if you aren't a museum person, the architecture itself is an impressive fest to behold and the garden is beautiful to admire. Of course it's even better if you are a museum person: as impressive as the architecture, the collection is a heavyset European arts collection ranging from the Hellenistic period to contemporary as well as masterpieces from other art cultures.You may need at least a half-day to explore the multiple floors of the many buildings in this out-of-the-world museum complex, but be sure to pick a beautiful day so you can take a break from art to see the beautifully curated garden and the high vantage of the LA skyline!Bring your own food though. At least with the Saturday-only Garden Terrance Cafe, the food is overpriced and mediocre.Anyway, the whole museum itself is free! However, parking is $15 and public transportation is unreliable. You have to ride the tram uphill from the parking garage but if you don't want to wait in line, you can take a 10-minute walk to the museum. Come early though, because this place gets crowded later in the day!Bottom line is that this is a must-go destination in Los Angeles! You can't miss this impressive sight inside and outside the architecture!---tl;dr version:1) Impressive buildings with beautiful garden2) Wide variety of European antique and artworks3) Free admission, but $15 parking4) Bring your own food",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayyen93
50,Must go at least once,"The Getty center is a wonderful place to go. If you live in the OC or LA area you may forget or find less interest to explore close to home but this museum is great! It's free, plenty of space to explore with many different art pieces to discover or just come out to have lunch or gaze out to the horizons of Los Angeles. The Getty is very big so it definitely take up all day to see the whole place. Go check out the Getty Center!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569chid
50,A wonderful visit,"There is so much to see and do there. There is art, gardens, views of the city and even solitude. Probably not a place for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixelpanderer
40,The Getty Centre,This is a great free museum full on paintings fabrics and statues. You can get a bus for $1.75 dollars from the city centre. Entrance is free and there is a restaurant on site. Take a good camera for the amazing views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonH387
50,One of the Best Museums in the World,"The Getty Center is one of the best thought out and designed museum I have ever been to. It is a very special gift to the general public.When you enter the grounds, you park in a very large parking garage with ample parking and take a tram up to the actual museum.The 15 dollars you pay for parking (2016) is the only money you will need to spend, unless you want to eat in one of the two restaurants (with many food options) or espresso stands.When the tram stops you find yourself high in the Hollywood Hills on your own little mountain top looking out at Los Angeles and the Pacific ocean. You could literally never enter the museum and have a wonderful time, walking the grounds and it's various gardens and sculpture and enjoying the wonderful architecture of the museum itself, designed by Richard Meier.The museum itself is laid out in such a way that you never experience the museum fatigue that can often happen. If you do need a break from the art, you can step outside on any level and take in an amazing view and refresh.I have been to museums all over the world and The Getty Center is such a gift to all of us.Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timzorrr
50,Beautiful place to visit,This is a great place to take your family. Get the Ipods for the tour and enjoy the history. Our teenagers enjoyed exploring on their own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MargP
40,"Amazing views, so-so collection","Not sure why the collection left me cold, but there just didn't seem to be must of interest to me personally here. The views of LA are spectacular and worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strfdtravllr
50,Beautiful architecture and views!,"The views of LA are worth the trip itself. The day we went, there was quite a bit of smog, but, it was really great to see the city from on high. The museum is also amazing and in a beautiful building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PEZHEADS
50,"Astounding art, architecture and views...not to be missed!","A must see experience if you are in the area. This is a place where the building itself almost overwhelms the art it houses. And what art! Four sections house art from the dark ages through today, featuring both paintings, sculptures and photographs. The building is a riot of glass, wood, landscape windows and ondulating walls on different levels and part of the experience is going down a hallway and finding a glorious terrace, balcony or window with jawdropping views! The museum garden is built as a ground sculpture into which a manicured garden has been placed...view it from one of the balconies above or take a tour. Getty offers free self guided audio tours, as well as free specific tours with a guide. Outdoor courtyards both within and outside of the museum entrance provide spaces to sit, rest, or have a coffee/snack. Hungry? Go down one level and choose between a very nice cafeteria with hot and cold food, or a fancier (and pricier) sit down restaurant. Despite all the levels and entrances, the museum is handicapped accessible and easy to maneuver. Upon arriving you park your car and stand in line to catch the little train that takes you up the hill to the museum (every 5-10 minutes); views are amazing. You can also walk but it's bit of a hike which Getty makes attractive with shallow steps and beautiful landscaping. The museum admission is free, but the only way to get there is to drive and park your car for which they charge you $15. There is no bus stop and it is difficult to walk and bike there (it is in a remote mountain neighbourhood of LA). If you start out super early, you can do the Getty Center then drive to the Getty Villa...if you do both on same day they only charge you parking at the first site and the second site is free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaphneG962
40,Great place,It was a rainy day so decided to find something inside to do. The place is actually free entry and you just pay for parking. We left a donation but that is voluntary. It has some great art to look at. The real food museum was a let down as it wasn't what we were hoping but the rest was good. The choice of food in the dining area is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRGrove
50,Truly Amazing Art,"The art work displayed truly is amazing and spans a few centuries. Walking from room to room with one of a kind pieces. I was very impressed that Mr. Getty collected and shared from his wealth to benefit museum goers and to preserve and care for the works. I could easily go back, but I live out of state. The works are so extensive that it is in a few buildings. The location looks over LA high on a hill. What a gift--thank you Mr. Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthia4125
50,Loved this Trip!,"I've often checked art exhibits at The Getty online, but to see it in person was a whole other experience. The gardens and grounds were out of this world. They reminded me of my trip to England 2 summers back. I highly recommend a trip to The Getty as an absolute MUST for anyone visiting Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320ckb
50,Amazing collection and admission is FREE,Unbelievable artwork and tours (guides and self -guided with iPod Touch are FREE. Only pay for parking and food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScoutWebster
50,Must Do,The Getty is an attraction that you should go to at leaste once in your life. Preferably more than that. Fill the car up and spend the day. I've been many times over the years and it's always worthwhile from stunning views to absolutely priceless art...so much to see you will get information overload so several trips may be required. One of the finer museums/art collections in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CewtonrRamone
50,"Beautiful Views of the Los Angeles Coast, and an Amazing Collection of Art","The Getty Center is a phenomenal museum with a myriad of pieces of artwork. The various works span over a thousand years of history, and cover almost every area of the globe. The buildings are a fantastic display of architecture, each with its own theme and unique design. The facility is clean, parking is great, trams are free, and admission is free, although the parking fee is $10 to $15 per vehicle at the time this review is written. There are lush gardens with fountains, and long walking paths where you can enjoy the pristine grounds. I highly recommend visiting The Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steevvoh

50,"Gorgeous, Free, Just Pay For Parking","What's not to love about the Getty? The dinner restaurant facing the sea at sunset hour is superb and romantic. Make a reservation for a sunset view window. And check out the acoustic concrete walls all around the museum.... your drumming, percussive hands are capable of marimba.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MotherTravels
50,A jewel and for free. Art for all!!!,"I never thought that I would find such a lovely and well-settled place for free in LA. The Getty Villa is home of a very big and valuable art collection that is diplayed in a building that resembles an italian villa of the time of many sculptures and paintings are from. The gardens are really beautiful and, indeed, they make you feell as if you were in a villa. The plants, the water fountains, the ""atmosphere"". Much effort is put here daily so you can get a real sense of all that art. The Getty Center is a more modern building with a huge collection surrounded by LA in its splendor. In the inside you melt with art; outside, you just breath the environment. You can spot the city from there. Do it! Is for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phd-organa
50,An absolute jewel in Los Angeles!,"Beautifully manicured gardens, an art collection to get lost in and all minutes from the entire city - Calling for reservations is always a good idea since it is a favorite spot for school field trips.. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596erike
40,High Class Art and Gardens,"We visited again the Getty center. They have a few areas where they change the exhibits every 3 or so months. So there is always something new to see. There is an area to go with your kids and do art of your own. The gardens are exquisite, you can count them as another work of art. They have a lawn and you can bring your own picnic and a blanket and enjoy the sunset. They also sell food and drinks. During summer their is music by the park.Fun fact for kids, after you park you take a tram ride uphill.Entrance is fee, you only pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,Arrive early! Spend the day!,"Those who know me, know that I will go to great lengths to avoid traffic and crowds, but both LA's traffic on the 101 and a crowd at the Getty are worth tolerating for a visit to the Getty! If you love museums, art, horticulture, water sculptures, or architecture, the Getty has it all!! A very modest parking fee onsite, leads to a delightful monorail ride to the top. Like a kid in a candy store, it's tough to decide what to do first!! The plazas and sculptures are stunning, the collections fascinating, and the gardens and water features are not to be missed!!If time permits, take one of the free tours for in depth information regarding the collections, grounds, or architecture. And enjoy lunch onsite from the excellent cafeteria where every diner's tastes can be met!Traffic? What traffic? Crowds? What crowds? Arrive early, and spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayneK373
50,You cannot miss this,"The Getty Center is a huge complex of building perched high on a hill overlooking Los Angeles. The complex itself is stunning. The architecture itself and the gardens could easily be just one visit. There is a nice tour that discusses the architecture. The collection within the museum complex is mammoth and a little overwhelming. You really need to be selective and just pick a couple of things to see. The size and breadth of the collection is overwhelming. This is really a museum that you need to visit several times. Currently, there is a special exhibit of tapestries on loan from the French government that starts from the reign of Francis I and goes to through the reign of Louis XIV and beyond. It is stunning. There is a great cafeteria with lovely views which provides a nice break from the intensity of the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtons
50,Beautiful and free,"The architecture of this place is beautiful. I could just sit and stare at the buildings for hours. There are some amazing views of the city. We walked through some exhibitions and they were great as well. My 6 year old son had fun in the garden and loved tumbling down in a few places. The family center is sad so not worth going in If there is a line. Also, the food in the cafeteria was good except for the pizza. The dough tasted stale. We had burgers and hot dogs and they were all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gazurdia123
50,Impressive Architecture and Collection,We had a wonderful visit to the Getty Center in January. Besides the great art and architecture we were amazed that there was no entrance fee. Only parking fee of $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannlin
50,sunset views!,"The building and the sunset view are both 6 stars. The art warrants a look, but that wasn't really the highlight for me. There are better collections down the hill. But it's a fun experience taking the tram up to the museum and perfect for a relaxing afternoon. Cafe was great too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelainieM
50,Architecture for Ever,"This is the kind of project built to last and become a future landmark.

50,Beautiful Museum with a Beautiful View,Good outing for a sunny day because you will want to explore the grounds outside of the museum but the inside of it has more than enough to keep your attention. All of the pottery and other artwork is impressive and they do allow pictures of everything which is nice because some museums don't. Parking isn't free so try to bring cash for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881tamarav
50,definitely worth a visit,"This is highly rated on the things to do list for a reason, the artwork was engaging, and the garden simply amazing.

50,Fascinating Exhibits,"This is the one place I make certain to go when I visit family in Los Angeles, no matter how brief the trip. While the collection is especially good for medieval art, there are many other periods of European art covered. This is one of the few museum complexes where I've been able to spend an entire day (just over 8 hours) without feeling either overwhelmed or bored.Over the years, I've seen several intriguing exhibits including one about Pissarro and Cezanne which took paintings they'd done side by side to highlight the differences not just in their styles, but in their visions of art.Entrance fee is the cost of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427caras
50,"Great way to show LA views, culture, architecture and gardens","I was here 15 years ago and remember my kids having a great time running around barefoot on the lawns and playing with the water. The Getty does not seem to be very big but you wonder where all the people lining up in a Disney like lines waiting for the tram to get there all went. Great architecture, gardens, museum and views and you also get a little serenity away from the madness down below on the 405.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toyo3
50,Whether you are visiting or live here it is well worth a visit!,"The Getty Center is a tremendous place to visit. The artwork or expositions speak for themselves. Always check online to see if their is a showing that interests you and even if not the house artwork is spectacular.The Getty Center itself is a work of art. The stone was mined completely out of one quarry in Italy, so the buildings and architecture themselves are stunning. The grounds are always immaculate and impeccably groomed as well.If you go up the day after a rain the view from the back is amazing, I could see all the way down to Long Beach Harbor. They have different level of restaurants for every budget and palate. Even if you aren't a huge art fan or museum goer it so worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zuza11

We found the Getty Centre to be readily accessible by public transport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m_h_trips
50,Always a Perfect Place to Spend a Sunday,Brilliant Design for Museum in LA to include and integrate inside and outside spaces seemlessly. Parking is 15 but the museum and transport up to it are free. There is something here for everyone. Old Renaissance to sculpture to photographs and gardens. The food is good and quite reasonable. Lunch is better priced than dinner and the cost of the wines are quite far.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
50,"Getty Center is FREE! Pay for parking only, bring a Picnic if on a budget!","Let me first say this:Get there EARLY!This museum with rotating exhibits and with magnificent gardens is a perfect setting for feeding your cultural appetite and having a memorable picnic on the beautiful grounds.There is no cost for admission, only parking, but there is the rub! You have to get there EARLY to make sure you can beat the inevitable crowds on weekends and Holidays.The Getty does have interpretive guides (docents) and it is worth renting out the self-tour devices offered in multiple languages to get up front and personal with the art and exhibits.Don't miss out on the opportunity to meander through the gardens!

I then drag my guests to the building that holds my favorite 1800's Dutch painting SPRING by Lawrence Alma-Tamada.The food courts may be a tad pricey so I recommend that you take snacks in a lunch bag but the gift shops are great and the introductory film about the Getty is important to watch as the first thing to do before walking around visiting the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daleo170

50,Must see for history/art lovers!,"I enjoyed seeing the many Greek/Roman statues although many were copies of the original, while others were Renaissance pieces with mythological allusions. But as a history (classical) buff, I was very content with the pieces of display. There were also displays of Medieval manuscripts, Victorian royal home decor, and more contemporary photographs. Of course, the view on the top floors of the buildings were amazing.I spent most of my times looking at the classical sculptures, and I wished I could stay longer than 2 hours, because there were just so many things to see! The gift shop has cool items, and this one is bigger than the one in the Getty Villa, and they have different items for sale.The line to take the tram up from the carpark to the museum itself could be long during weekends, but it was worth it, especially when the place is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmabearx
50,tapestry exhibit,We saw the wonderful tapestry exhibit and then went to the restaurant for lunch with a friend and the food was great as well as the service and the views. We have never been disappointed when we visit or have a meal in the restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316tonis
50,Amazing Visit,The Getty Center was an amazing place to see. Just the views from the Getty Center are worth the trip. The place itself is amazing and you could easily spend a whole day walking around. Would highly recommend to anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarH9114OH
50,"Spectacular art, views, and architecture","This is one of LA's jewels. The museum is free, although you have to pay for parking. The Richard Meier designed building, clad in white marble that reflects the golden California sunlight, is amazing, with stunning views and surprising details. The art, of course, is world class. The garden is designed by committee, and changes often. If you are visiting from out of town, skip the tourist traps and go here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaKellyMartin

50,Go in the middle of the day!,"Beautifully designed museum! This is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, and is reasonably priced. The tram up to the museum is a short scenic ride, but you can walk up if you want a short hike before seeing the exhibits. There are quite a few food choices if you want to eat at the Getty, there is also plenty of space to bring a picnic and catch a view The only caveat is that it is located off the 405 freeway, which can be a bear. Time your trip accordingly to avoid traffic and you will have a wonderful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyl587
50,Best view of the city/ good impressionist painters,"I just go there two or three times a year to enjoy the calm and the view.

Romantic place at sunset too.Strongly recommend for tourists and also locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmomo

50,A truly unique experience,"I had always wanted to visit the Getty. I had time Sunday AM and drove there. There was minimal wait at the time I arrived. It is a bit overwhelming to cover 1000 years of art in one day. However, I was able to see many works of art and found the experience quite special. The sole problem was that the Cafe was closed and there was a one hour wait to find a table at the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCtraveller1147
50,What a wonderful place,"What a place! From the initial tram ride up to the extensive collections and beautiful gardens, this was one of my favourite stops in LA!

Would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodieb305

The exhibits are always masterfully done and admission is always free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyB873
50,Spectacular Views and great art!,"From the tram ride up the mountain, the great art exhibits, the beautiful gardens and the views, this place was such a wonderful experience.

We had 4 people in our car so that's a very inexpensive visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monta_777
50,Fabulous Collection of Art in a Spectacular Setting,"This visit was the highlight of my trip to Los Angeles.

50,Amazing Place-FREE,"This museum campus houses a large collection of paintings, sculptures, and ancient objects which are housed in a series of spectacular modern buildings on top of a small mountain outside of LA. The architecture and views are worth the trip. And admission is free. After parking in the parking structure proceed to the enclosed tram which takes you up the mountain. Everything is handicap accessible. The only thing you pay for is parking and food... and gifts in the gift shop. There's a very nice cafeteria with indoor and outdoor seating It's worth spending the day or whatever time you have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skip1951
40,More than just a museum,"If you are looking to get outside and enjoy the wonderful LA weather, the Getty is a great place to go. For just $15 for the parking you can spend the day in their beautiful garden and taking in the spectacular views.As a side note, if you want to eat while you are there just keep in mind that their ""restaurant"" is expensive for what it is. The food is better than one would expect but still expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauratR6495KD
40,"World Class Art, but Dreadul Dining","The Getty is so overwhelming, both in terms of scale and the priceless collections, that you can only absorb a fraction of it in a single day. I focused on specific exhibits, but after five hours, had barely scratched the surface. Their fine dining restaurant was an extremely poor experience. After waiting 45 minutes for a small charcuterie platter, I asked a bus boy about the order because my waitress was no where to be seen. She didn't check on me once. Wonder if ""older woman dining alone"" had anything to do with it? The ""seasonal fresh fruit"" was a few scattered blueberries plunked in pesto on one side and a balsamic reduction on the other. Blueberries on a meat (dry) and cheese (stale) platter? The maître d' said he was sorry. Bring your own lunch or go to the café.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestnuthouse
40,"Modern buildings, gardens, views of ocean and L.A.","Since I am more of a contemporary art fan, there wasn't too much at the Getty to spark my interest. If you like European Christian art from the centuries ago, this might be the place for you. The grounds are breathtaking, and I could have spent more time admiring the gardens and views of the ocean and Los Angeles from on high. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irispiral
50,Beautiful gardens. Amazing views,"This place is absolutely stunning, from the architecture, to the landscaped gardens to the views of LA. Definitely a must visit for anyone travelling to LA whether it be your first or last. We weren't really into the art gallery side of it. We looked, but we were more blown away just looking at the building and its surrounds. Walking through and around the garden. And just staring out to LA's skyline. The photos just do not do this place justice. Only bad thing, it took us a little while to get an uber. But worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923melissaf
50,Wonderful day.,We arrived early and still parked on P6. As we were leaving (3 pm) the parking lot was full and cars were circling around for spots. Go early!The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The views are spectacular.The art work was magnificently displayed. Great collection of art.Food is very expensive and mediocre at the Getty. We did not go to the restaurant but the cafe. Take a lunch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillySpr
50,Visit if only for the view!,The Centre like the Villa is stunning. With amazing architecture. Spotlessly clean. The views breath taking. Amazing works of art from around the world. $15 parking that's it and if you visit the Villa on the same day you pay no extra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mavwag
40,Stunning art and architecture,"Wow, what a museum! The setting is breathtaking, situated at the top of the Santa Monica Mountains, with a view of the city and valleys below. It’s worth visiting for the view alone. The architecture is also beautiful, purposely designed to reduce museum fatigue as much as possible, allowing for lengthy and in depth explorations of the incredible art within.The artwork contained inside is incredible. There are masterpieces from Van Gogh, Manet, Monet, Cezanne, Renoir, Degas, Titian, Rubens, Bernini, the schools of Da Vinci and Raphael, and a whole lot of Rembrandts. My journey started in a building full of medieval art, such as illuminated manuscripts and altarpieces, and finished in a building full of iconic Impressionists. Along the way, I became transfixed by some amazing works by Jean-François Millet, Michael Sweerts, Gerrit van Honthorst, Lucas Cranach, Fernand Khnopff and James Ensor. I managed to squeeze in a visit to special exhibition on the Tapestries of Louis XIV. Unfortunately, despite spending the large part of a day on site, I didn’t get to see the exhibitions or installations in the research centre — there just wasn’t enough time.There is free wifi throughout the museum, and plenty of food and refreshments available, albeit at the usual overprice museum rates. The entrance is free, but parking costs $15.00. I enjoyed a highlights tour hosted by a knowledgable and personable docent. I also had a great conversation with a staff member at the information center, who was incredibly passionate about his job and the artwork at the museum. My visit was soured by the conversation I overheard between staff members as I rode an elevator with them in the parking lot. They were quite rude and derogatory towards visitors, and they awkwardly hushed themselves when they realized I was not one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bocadey
40,Beautiful,"I had a wonderful time at the Getty Center. It's small enough that you don't feel like you have to rush to see everything, but large enough that you still get to see a lot of diverse art. The grounds are beautiful as well. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcalibanh
40,Must see for art lovers!,"My in laws who are LA locals said this is a must see for visitors. Admission is free, but parking is $15.00 per car. After parking visitors ride a tram up the hill. There are many art exhibits including the Monet's Water Lilies painting. There is also a beautiful desert garden and view of the city below. I gave it 4 stars because of the variety of art-my husband thought the museucused too much on portraits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJ_EBs007
50,Unbelievable Destination for Art Lovers!,"As with the Getty Villa, the Getty Center has free admission w/ just a parking fee of $15. In addition to the treasures in its collections are the architecture itself and gardens surrounding. Our draw was a Daguerrotype Exhibit, which did not disappoint. If you have never seen one in person, you must try to some day. Learning some of the process, history, and value of this first form of photography was almost as special as seeing so many shown together. Speaking of photography, if you want a panoramic shot of Los Angeles, step outside and to the left of the gift shop. It's yours for the taking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
50,Gorgeous views and amazing art & architecture!,"I absolutely loved my afternoon wandering around The Getty Center. It was a clear sunny day and the views were spectacular. You can see the mountains, the urban sprawl of LA and the Pacific ocean. There is also amazing architecture, beautiful works of art, gardens and sculptures dotted around the center. All for free (including the audio guide)! The self-serve cafe provided good lunch options and a welcome rest break. I had a delicious and filling made-to-order ham and salad sandwich from the deli station. My hotel was a convienent 20 minute bus ride away from the Getty, with the bus stop directly opposite the entrance to the center (and tram ride to the top). I thoroughly enjoyed The Getty and would highly recommend as a 'must visit'.Visited February 2016.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796alisonp

50,One of the Jewels in LA's Crown,"The Getty Center is one of the most beautiful places in Los Angeles. An architectural gem, the views of the LA basin and out to the sea are unrivaled. The art inside is as spectacular as the view.Parking is a pain but worth it. Try to take what limited public transportation we have here to get to the lot and then take the cool tram up to the site.Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandisonk
50,not to be missed,"A great collection in a superb location - an essential part of any visit to LA, along with the Getty Villa. A full day is required for each to do them justice without rushing. The Center is just off the freeway but not well signposted and lots of people get lost using GPS - don't rely on it and check out the location very thoroughly before going. We wasted at least 30 minutes fiddling around before finding the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/probono28
50,Must see,"This is an experience you have to go through when visiting Los Angeles. I say ""experience"" because it isn't simply your regular museum.

50,Arts and views,"The museum's admission is totally free but the parking (if you go by car will cost you $15; $10 after 4:00 p.m.) An alternative is to take the metro bus #234 Hilgard-Westholme if you leave from the Westwood villa. Once in the entrance you will take a train (also free) that will left you at the museum's gardens. Plan this visit with time because this museum is walk-able in and outdoors. Beautiful gardens to picnic, stunning views and priceless pieces of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiasoto
50,An absolute treasure.,"This place blew me away - if you like architecture, art, gardens and beautiful views this place has it all and it's free. What an amazing legacy for LA.

50,Return to Getty Center,"If you appreciate a great place to see art, this is a place you need to visit at least once. The buildings, grounds and view are spectacular. Need to pay for parking but admission is free. Strongly suggest arriving at the parking lot when it first opens and taking the tram up to the top. This way you will avoid the big crowds that grow as the day goes on. When you enter the main area, you can rent a device so you can get an audio tour which is helpful to understand what you are looking at. There are seveal shops with good variety of books you can purchase. If you get hungry, the museum has a cafeteria which is actually pretty good. Also a restaurant if you prefer more formal meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439garyt
40,Huge museum on top of the hill!,"Beautiful garden, beautiful Los Angeles views and a lots of art work to see.It is probably hard to experience everything in one day.

I hope they will make it bigger or something more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akanem2013
50,this may be the best museum in the world,"It certainly is one of the best settings and they have the biggest budget, so that is a great place to start.

50,Breathtaking,We visited with a group. The architecture is amazing and worth a tour of its own. But then you enter the buildings and enjoy some wonderful art. But then there is more.

Its gardens - check out the Cactus garden!- offer plenty of space to lay down with a book, or walk around and glaze. Cafeteria and a classy and not too pricey restaurant with an incredible view are available too.On the museum side, this is one very dynamic place where the permanent exhibit of European 17, 18,19century paintings as well as the many photographic exhibits -and I am just listing what I am particularly interested in- justify repeated visits all throughout the year.I run a Motorcycle guided tour business in LA and one of our favorite rides goes from the Barham Bridge to Mulholland Drive to the ocean with a mandatory stop at the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brunolab

He built this one to replicate an Italian villa - complete with marble floors and walls, hand painted ceilings, pools, gardens and a beautiful view overlooking the Malibu shore and Pacific Ocean! Before or afterwards you can enjoy seaside dining for lunch or dinner at Gladstone's Restaurant practically across the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamuelVeta
50,Unbelievable Experience,"The architecture, grounds and scenic, panoramic views are as memorable as the art itself. Such an amazing venue and a must-see when visiting Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChipJ492
40,A Nice Hour or Two But Lower Expectations,"This is a wonderful venue and great place to see in Los Angeles. An easy place to visit with plenty of parking and a nice place to walk around. Great buildings; great views and most relaxing. Nice views of the west side of Los Angeles and a great ""over view"" of the area. However, don't go if you expect to see anything major in the Getty art collection. There are pieces here and there; there are reproductions here and there. It's fun and informative. It has almost nothing of the collection that would make it worth a special trip ""just for the art."" A nice fun place to visit if you want a pleasant couple of hours. Not what I would call ""the"" museum experience you may expect from a venue with ""Getty"" in the name. The restaurant was a decent plus experience - worth going for a nice meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
50,"Beautiful Location, Beautiful Space!","For those that think LA is all traffic and smog, take a detour to the Getty Center and enjoy a tranquil and gorgeous view of Los Angeles. From the ocean views to the beautiful gardens, to the top notch museum, The Getty Center is not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8815XZstephaniel
40,Amazing day! A bit frustrating parking,"So it's a drag to get to, but totally worth it no doubt. By far one of the greatest things to do in LA, but for one reason or another, we could park until 1 pm. Well it was near one, but we had to wait till one exactly to get in, only problem is that there is literally nothing even near the Getty to go to in the mean time, save a small gas station and housing area. The Getty is free but parking costs, so go have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaJ805
50,Beautiful Views and Magnificent Buildings!,Get a parking reservation and the rest is a dream! Take the tram up and experience views of LA and the ocean like none other. The museum and gardens are amazing and the museum is second to none. It is truly and experience unto its own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swisscss
50,Beautiful Museum!,"We loved The Getty...especially the gardens. There is so much to see and do at The Getty. I would suggest taking a few of their tours that are offered all day long. We did a tour of the gardens, and a Getty highlight tour. The docents were knowledgeable with a good sense of humor. The views of Century City and downtown LA were great! Bring your camera your going to take a lot of pics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rg2000
40,Free entry and beautiful gardens,I wasn't very interested in the art work inside the building (but that's not their fault) but the building itself and the gardens are wonderful and are worth the visit. The staff are friendly and the hot chocolate with ice cream is delicious ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125davido
50,Incredibly Interesting Visit,"We spent the better part of a sunny afternoon here and are really glad we did. We began with a very good lunch in the restaurant, sitting window side with incredible views out to the ocean. We also took one of the architecture tours and explored the gardens before touring the exhibits. We stayed to watch the sunset over the hills.You could easily spend a full day here as there's always something going on and new things to see. Take the tine to get here and you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShadowyMan
50,An oasis in the big city,It was a pleasant place to spend some hours inside the galleries or outside in the beautiful gardens. There are also good variety of options to eat and great views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucilion
40,Nice location and views,This place is good for sight seeing and the cafe is very nice. The museum is ok but feels a little awkward with all this transplanted art and replicas from the Mediterranean. However the stroll in the gardens is worth the trip .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiast
50,"Wonderful collection of art, beautiful architecture",Go earlyish in the morning to beat the crowds if visiting on a weekend. Also try to visit on a clearish day as the views of LA are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucer292
40,Give it a 5 if You Like Art,"I could never understand the excitement about old pictures. If you're good then paint the picture. It seems like a lot of brouhaha to me. I'm sorry. I would be the board member to cut the art program in a budget crunch. I just don't get it. That said, there were many paintings and sculptures of old world masters like Van Gogh, Dumas, Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Manet, and others. There is an unusual, very symmetrical garden to walk through. The architecture was clean and appealing. There were a lot of people there but the line went quickly. We got on a line that zig zagged back and forth along the ropes, had our bags checked by security, and caught the cable car to the museum. The view of the surrounding area from the grounds of the center are breathtaking. There are three different places to eat and a family room for kids to play in. Mr. Getty was a great philanthropist who wanted to bring the beauty of the world to the common people. The foundation did a pretty good job of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melodycthomas
50,Great facilities with great view,"Really worth the time to visit Getty Center. Magnificent modern facilities with unbelievable panoramic views of LA. Worth the trip for views!Excellent exhibits on display. Enjoyed the Louis XIV tapistries on display on our visit,.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skinisin
50,Wonderful Visit,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to this amazing Museum.The whole experience of the parking & arriving by train was unique.We were able to join one of the guided tours of the gardens which was very interesting.Using the audio tour, we enjoyed the rest of our visit to this wonderful Museum.All the staff were very helpful & informative.I very much look forward to visiting this Museum in the future.Highly recommended for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainestone1250
50,Even in a downpour,"...the Getty Center is worth a visit. I went with a group of photographers to shoot the gardens and the architecture, but El Nino had different ideas. We got steady rain and winds, blotting out any hope of a view beyond the balcony railings.But it was an excellent day. I saw exhibits, then went out for a few photos in the rain, then dipped back into the galleries. Even on a gloomy day, the skylights provide natural light. Most galleries are positioned within easy reach of an outdoor space, and walkways between are covered. The Getty also provides umbrellas, thoughtfully positioned at the exit of the tram and at the entrances and exits of each building.So even though we came for the outside views, we appreciated the architecture, the design, and -- of course -- the glorious art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscar505
50,"Stunning, engaging and surprisingly varied exhibits","We loved the variety of exhibits and views on offer at this must see free attraction. The audio tour providing 90 second or so explanations of many art and sculpture exhibits is excellent. As are the impressionist paintings by Van Gogh, Monet and particularly Renoir as well as many other European artists. The gardens were beautifully kept and exhibits themselves. The varied views of LA are stunning as is the architecture of the centre. All so photogenic. We taxied to and from the centre which was trouble free. There are a variety of dining options available not all good value. You could spend at least half a day here if not more. A must see LA attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonE857
50,Allow half a day minimum and include sunset!,"Absolutely loved this place. The setting is gorgeous and if you are there for sunset you wont be disappointed with the photos! The building is stunning, and the artwork varied. We arrived an hour before closing and it was not nearly enough time so allow at least half a day. We will return another time as we loved it so much. Well organised, clean, and beautiful. Not to be missed. The views of LA are amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markzz2
50,"Great exibitions, beautiful gardens with statues","We really liked the architecture of the Getty Center and the beautiful gardens around it.Very relaxing, and great for art lovers. Even for a teenager there was plenty to see and explore.(The only thing we didn't like is the long wait at the line up to the trains. There must be a better way!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happike
50,Amazing Exhibits,"Visited late January 2016. The tapestries exhibit was truly amazing, as were their paintings from the 1700 and 1800's with paintings from many of the masters. We spent about 5 hours there and only saw about half of the exhibits. You pay for parking ($15 for all day, less than that after 4:00) and there is no entry fee so the price is right! It is a lot of walking and lots of stairs. This is definitely worth your time if you have even a passing interest in art of any kind. They also had photography exhibits and others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJMueller723
50,Unbeatable on a nice day,"Wonderful place to bring a picnic and hang out for the day or bring visiting friends to show off the stunning views of the city and mountains. The art exhibits change frequently. Each building has its own gift shop related to what's on display. There's one shop with thoughtfully curated kids' stuff, too - puppets, books, arts and crafts supplies. I found the cafeteria food to be fine, but not outstanding. The museum is free, but (plentiful) parking is $15 per car (less after 4 pm). If you take the bus (there's a stop right at the entrance) or cycle or cab there, there is no entrance fee. The wait for a tram to go up or down can be long at peak hours! It's an easy walk down; not sure how strenuous it would be to walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraj171
50,"One of the best museums anywhere, and fab surroundings","A don't miss if you are in LA. It's a little out of the way, but once you arrive, it's worth the trek. The parking is easy, and once you arrive . . . Waaaaah . . . just spectacular landscaping and a fine collection of art. One of my favorite places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balkans_Phile
50,"Magnifcent artwork , landscaping and architecture","The Getty Center is a rarefied museum in its breadth of artwork, gorgeous views of LA , beautiful landscaping and fabulous architecture. The buildings alone are worth the visit. Truly enjoyed the afternoon there with my husband and 20 something son. Neither are art lovers but all of us enjoyed the whole experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiAbloom
20,"Poor location layout, nice buildings and garden","We planned this visit towards the end of day (3 pm, when the center closes at 9) in order to avoid the crowds. Parking was an unreasonable $15 ($10 if you park after 4), which was offset by the fact that the center can be visited for free.There was a long line of cars waiting to get in and given the small confines of the garage, this led to bottlenecking and a long wait to eventually find a parking space. Once that process was completed we had to wait in another long line to get transportation up the the center itself. That line seemed to move faster, but it took about an hour from the time we entered the garage before we finally reached the attraction itself.There are some nice views of LA and photo points, but be prepared to walk lots of stairs to get to these points. The exhibits are not very well thought out as many rooms contain only small numbers of paintings, sculptures, tapestries, etc. and you have to go to many different buildings to see everything. There was nothing earth shattering about anything we saw, although there were some nice pieces to be seen they were simply too far in between.It would be better to visit an art museum where you have the ability to see numerous pieces at the same time, with the ability to enjoy them, ask questions, etc. If you plan on seeing everything, this easily becomes an all day affair, which is not good if you are only in LA for a short time.Although not specifically related to the center itself, traffic was bad on the way but I guess this is to be expected in LA. On the whole, just a bit disappointed that this was listed as the #1 attraction in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375christopherk
50,One of LA's best attractions,I get a lot of visitors from out of state and I am a renowned tour guide for Los Angeles. On my three day tour generally is a fairly long stop at the Getty. The building shows what a billion dollars will buy. It is an architectural masterpiece and the grounds and views are spectacular. I generally take visitors to the period rooms and the Impressionist galleries. It is a must see!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philly1314
50,Museum is the Tops!,This the museum is not only a great place to see fabulous art. The views are breath-taking from Downtown LA to the beach. The hour docent tours are informative and interesting. Take the garden tour and have lunch in the restaurant. This is truly an LA adventure for a low cost day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nik27
50,Awesome,"Beautiful art ,beautiful gardens unique....back in LA I have been discovering so many wonderful places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940evag
50,Amazing!!,Place is amazing and Great view of LA. Plus its Free!! But parking is 15 Dollars which is not bad. Go on a sunny Day and enjoy the Garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeKtor89
50,Extraordinary place,"This is a spectacular museum. The white travertine architecture, the beautiful gardens and the hilltop setting are already amazing. But the collection of art! I have rarely seen masterpieces in such pristine condition . There are stunning, famous works like VanGogh's Irises , and Rembrandts, Velasquez, Titian, Rubens as well as all the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. What is so extraordinary is that this huge and impressive art collection has been purchased over the past 40 years. The European museum's great collections were amassed over hundreds of years. The Getty Centre is an example of American culture, philanthropy and daring at its best, totally unique in the world. At to top it all off, it is all FREE!My husband and I went two days in a row and still did not see it all. Wonderful, simply wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoniqueW502
50,Stunning!,"Aside from the obvious draw of the incredible works of art, this building and its landscaping are an attraction in themselves. The architecture, from afar, doesn't seem like much, but when you're standing on the terraces looking out at the city, it's truly spectacular! Worth the drive.It's also worth noting that entrance is free, but parking is $15. Not a bad trade-off if you're going with more than one person in the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapleLeafGirl02
50,Amazing place,Wow! What a beautiful place! My family enjoyed exploring this place. Nice place with gorgeous architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TommyT15
50,Excellent museum,"It's awe inspiring the way art has been preserved, restored and showcased. Definitely recommended for anyone who appreciates beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonvoyage003
40,An Awesome Place,"The Getty is a great place to go and relax. It's a soothing atmosphere coupled with unforgettable fallacies. What makes the Getty so wonderful is the soothing cream colors of the travertine tile. My favorite experience at the Getty is the music on Saturday nights over the summer. I went in 2014 and it really left a great impression on me. Family, friends, couples, or class trips, I would recommend the Getty. Informational and above all peaceful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themachine306
50,"Lots to see, including the destination itself","We were on crunch-time, having only 1 day to stuff on our own around Los Angeles, so we made a point to go to the Getty Center... I greatly enjoyed the display on medieval illuminations, and there was an exhibit on tapestries running as well. The views from the various balconies were impressive, including looking down on the courtyard and gardens. Would have loved to had more time to see more of the exhibits and visit the research area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1938JLchrism
40,Beautiful place!,"The place is gorgeous, the colors incredible, and the pictures you can take in this place are probably breathtaking. When i visited, the only thing that was a little off was that the little pool was shut off for some reason, but everything else was very clean and filled with history and art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GianP1192
50,My first visit to the Getty,"We took our visitor from Australia here and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I strongly recommend this interesting museum to anyone that takes interest in art and history. There are also places to get food and gourmet coffee, or you can bring your own picnic basket and enjoy it on the lawn or at park tables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funnygermangirl
50,Inspirational,So much to see. The art is amazing. The iPod audio tours are informative and help to expand my ability to appreciate what I was seeing. The setting is also amazing with a stunning view of LA. I want to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/333MaryP333
50,Wow is how I would sum this up!,"You'll definitely need a car to get here and it's well worth it.It's not to far from Universal Studios, so I would recommend pencilling these two attractions for a 1 day visit.We spent the morning at The Getty Centre and it was amazing. The weather was beautiful - warm, blue skies and the sun was out. Great weather for taking beautiful pictures!The architecture is amazing and the ambience is really surreal - really peaceful.Your ticket price includes a tour headset in lots of different languages, so you can tour the building at your own comfort whilst listening to the history.We had lunch at the restaurant and there was a variety of different foods - a little bit pricey but I would say it's worth it. There is a cafe if you want something light or alternatively, bring your own food and sit out by the gardens - lots of outside area to sit, eat and take in the views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minibubblegum
40,You can spend half day easily!,"A lot of beautiful art. Restaraunt had poor service. Best part of the meal was the desert! We were there from 4-9pm...took architectural tour, which was informative..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandalB7399CH
50,What a delight!,"Everyone must visit The Getty Museum in their lifetime. You would be amiss to omit this culture beauty. Beautiful property, onsite eating area, periodic music on the lawn, beautifully kept lawns, and then the displays of paintings. Plan to spend several hours to walk through the entire display of paintings, don't rush or you will miss their integrity. Once a month, painting and sculptures from other parts of the world are displayed for your enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamanthaTula
50,Takes more than one visit...,"Only had a few hours to visit so just viewed the special exhibition and of course had to see Van Gogh ""Irises"".Next time, I will get there earlier to enjoy the gardens and see the other galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IluvHoratio

50,Fascinating Place and Collections!,"I enjoy every moment i spent times in Getty Center. I spent a day and it's not enough. A little bit far from Downtown LA.

On a clear day the view from the top is the expanse of LA and ocean view.The docent tours are well done. The exterior architecture and garden is my favorite.The art varies.

50,Amazing,"Highly recommend it! Outstanding buildings. Take the architecture tour it's so interesting. Views are spectacular. Gardens are fab. Restaurant is terrific. Clean spacious and most acceptable food. Then there is the ART! Wonderful exhibitions that are temporary as well as their permanent collections. The outing is a ""must"" when visiting LA. Parking in a multi storey car park then catch a mini train up to the museum. Don't forget to look at the sculptures alongside the train stop at the base.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillousa
50,Amazing grounds and views!,I visited here with my daughter and her good friend. This is quite the place to visit! From the parking lot you ride a tram up to the center's grounds and galleries. I suggest an early start as the place gets very busy later in the day. You pay $15. to park and the tram and entrances to the galleries are free. There are several buildings of permanent and changing exhibitions. We didn't have the time or energy to take it all in on one visit! Besides the galleries and beautiful grounds they have restaurants as well as a daily schedule of tours. The views are spectacular and you can see as far as the ocean. It's well worth a return visit to catch up on what I missed this time around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruceb96
30,Meh....beautiful building,"We had really looked forward to seeing this be for our 8 day visit was up. After all, we had been to the Getty Villas and loved every minute.Nothing about the displays wowed us; some actually bothered us. Examples can be found in the photography area. Perhaps if we had been given more information about why items were displayed, we could've felt what the artist had intended.Anyway, if you have 1 day left, do something else fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdevoy22
50,Great collection of art.,"Great collection of art, well laid out in a purpose built building which is just as beautiful as the collection it holds. The gardens are also nice to spend time in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tailormadeitinerary
50,Fabulous architecture and views,"Moved from LA to Seattle 20 years ago, and finally found time to include this place on one of our visits to see family. The Getty is really a treasure and a huge asset to LA. Of course one can view more extensive collections in the US and Europe, but this small, choice collection is very well arranged and manageable in an afternoon. Views of the city are amazing, and architecture in a class by itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azzure

It's a nice tram you get to see the city as you climb up.Once inside we did the introduction film it's informative and only 10mins.Did get a tour guy, but with the map you when where to go. Each exhibition was wonderful, although I don't have a creative bone in me I can still appreciate them.The buildings are Beautiful the layout is good looks big but you can do it. Wished I packed a picnic on all the Greenery they have by the garden.It's a definite Must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katzeee8

40,Almost always very good,"I've been here about 15 times over the last 15 years and its almost always very good. This last time was the first time it wasn't due to the fact that I managed to visit when several exhibitions had just closed, had not opened yet, or were inexplicably closed so make sure you inquire before you go if you wish to see only new exhibitions. I inquired and yet several were closed for unknown reasons. The new exhibitions I saw I found mostly uninteresting. The Edible exhibition at the Research Institute I found to be lacking in explanatory background. Still, this was the first time in 15 visits I didn't find it very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cubecritter
50,Wow,"I love both! I prefer to have the Ville one first since sometime it close by 5pm but the Center is closed by 9PM. No admission fee but $15 for the parking, if you finish two museum in one day, you can get the pass for next parking. The museums are wonderful since I am not the Fine Art major but it shocked me enough, I can really touch the history and feel the old time. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_O5727DZ
50,Amazing,"So glad we got there early - the car park opens 9.30. Parked easily, got quickly through security, onto a connecting tram right away and entered the Centre as soon as the doors opened at 10.00. When we left mid-afternoon the entry lines were huge and the car park clogged with people searching for spaces. The Centre itself is amazing. A wonderful piece of modern architecture providing views from the coast right across to downtown LA. The formal gardens are delightful. But the main event of course is the Getty collection and it is awesome. There are probably many national art collections around the globe that would be envious of what's on display. And arriving early also means more time to appreciate it. The freely available self guided audio tour hugely enhanced the experience. When we returned ours as we left people were queuing for sets to be returned. So yet another good reason for getting there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobSlee

40,Lost In Museum Land,The art work stored in this museum is world class. This is a must visit for anyone with artistic tendencies. I just wish they would have made it easier to travel from exibit from building to building. I must have gotten lost 5 times. You might want to bring your lunch if you dont have your own trust fund. I spent 40 dollars on a cafeteria lunch for 2.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream402524

50,The Getty Museum,"I only got to experience the museum, but if you are an art lover this is a place for you. My oldest son and his girlfriend love the arts...me, not so much. However, I am grateful that I had a change to see this beautiful place. It was a great place to go on a rainy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKoreenRS37
50,"GORGEOUS VIEW, BEAUTIFUL DESIGN!","This is the 2nd time I've visited this place. The view is amazing, I mean, people even come with their kids for an activity. Beautiful exhibits, wonderful nature, fresh environment, a lot of grass and green, and gorgeous view from the top and architecture makes it a wonderful joyful experience. And do not leave your camera at home :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90selena
40,See some very impressive works,"The Getty collection would be worth visiting if it was in a tin shed, which of course it isn't. The collection was great, the grounds were impressive as were the buildings. I found the campus a bit confounding. Make sure you get the free map that I didn't get. All of the buildings look the same and none of them have ""Art here"" signs. There was more walking and fewer chairs that my arthritis was happy with. I could have stayed much longer if there was a chair in each room to allow me to sit and enjoy the works at my pace (rather than my arthritis's pace).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmS3206GT
50,The MOST amazing place! It's like a dream!,"For get everything that's going on in your life and in the world The Getty is a world of its own!! An experience not to be missed. From the art collection, antique pieces, furniture, history and gardens you just can't imagin something like it until you've experienced it. The building alone will amazing and fascinate you. Then top it all off with a billion dollar views!! You haven't travelled America unless you've been to The Getty, and don't forget The Getty house on the CA coast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuluTheExplorer

50,"My second visit, and I still love it","I was last here about 5 years ago, for less than 2 hours before it closed. This time I arrived at 10am and spent 4 hours there to really get a good chance to look around. Architecturally it is spectacular, beautifully laid out with so many spectacular view areas for contemplation, photography. Inside, the art is presented in order (by building) from oldest (1300's) to latest (late 1800's), so if you are only interested in a particular era, you can focus on that. They have many very well-known pieces, from completely recognizable names, so even novice viewers should find plenty of art to enjoy. The galleries are large enough so that you have plenty of room to step back from the paintings to really see them, but most are not behind glass so that you can also get up close to study the brushwork. I found a few of the rooms quite dim and poorly lit - perhaps that was to protect the paintings from excess light? After touring the paintings, I wandered around the spectacular grounds, which even during the January winter season (and drought dryness) looked beautiful. Much thought has been given to garden design, using plants that are drought-resistant, and although there was not a lot of color, the variety of plants was interesting and many I'd never seen before. A suggestion - please label the plants so they can be identified. There were many sculptures outside scattered on the grounds, and the most impressive one was a Henry Moore sculpture of mother and child, located on the lower tram level.Unfortunately the weather was cool and hazy the day I was there, so it was harder to see the ocean, but I remember from my previous visit that on a clear day the views are spectacular, to Catalina and beyond. You also get to see some spectacular mansions from this site as well. This is a beautiful and inspiring place to spend your hours, and a wonderful respite from the usual frenetic pace of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lornas936
50,"Beautiful Views, Great Collection of Art","The Getty is a fantastic museum hosting an impressive collection art. Some of the works include originals by Van Gogh, Monet, Degat, Piscasso, and Renois. The museum is located in the hills of L.A. with incredible views of the mountains and the city down below. Admission is free to the public and definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdortiz
50,One of the finest gem of LA,"This museum should be in everyone's list visiting LA. Not only it boasts amazing and serene bird view but the place itself is spectacular. The paintings, the year round exhibitions are great way to get someone interested in art. The museum has very modern feel to it starting from architecture, gardens and view. It can be great on someone's list who is traveling solo,couples or with young kids. I will not recommend it to hyperactive teens :)Another important point, entry is free however parking is $12. And Selfie stick is not allowed :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899indus

50,Will visit this place again and again and again,"This was my second visit and I have also visited The Getty Museum in the area which has very different architecture style and houses art works from different era. It also has very nice gardens with unbelievable views. However, The newer and modern Getty Center is free for admission with only about $15 for parking. As hinted above, the architecture details, the views, the garden, the art displays including Van Gogh's Iris (The original, of course! Someone did question that of our tour guide.) and the guided tours are all excellent. The cafeteria also serves very decent food. The Cactus Garden offers an open view to the Los Angeles skyline and the Pacific Ocean. There are many spots here and there offer great views of mountains and ocean. A true gem if you enjoy art and nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S4613HDkarent

30,Not an Artsy Family,"We are a family of 4 (10 yr old boy & 13 yr old boy) we went here because it was ranked #1 things to see and do. It was beautiful but just not our cup of tea. Did not realize it was mostly art, paintings, sculptures and landscaping. If you like that kind of stuff you'll love this place. Our boys prefer more of the adventure hands on type of places and interactive museums. Unfortunately we didn't make it back out in less than an hour so we had to pay $15.00 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDF3854IV
50,You've got to go,"Right from the start, this was exceptional. Spectacular setting, spectacular views, fantastic art. You really need to go there. Maybe J. Paul Getty was a bit odd, but his collection is unbelievable. Well worth the visit. If you do go there, do not eat at the restaurant -- which is over-praised and pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScoutMolly
50,"Don't miss this amazing museum, and plan to spend the day!","The massive Getty Center is a short drive from Pacific Palisades. Built of travertine stone, the museum fuses the organic nature of its surroundings with its strong architectural elements. It sits high on a 110 acre hillside overlooking LA. This museum is a must for anyone near the Santa Monica - LA area, but if you go, plan to spend the day. The museum is free but parking (in a garage) is $15. A free tram will transport you to the top of the hill where the architect Richard Meier designed this expansive contemporary museum. The extensive 134,000 square feet of gardens surrounding this museum were designed by artist Robert Irwin who called his creations “a sculpture in the form of a garden aspiring to be art”.We picked up the free iPod Touch for the mobile tour of The special exhibitions called “Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World” as well as for all the permanent collections in the museum. We were especially pleased that the iPod Touch is equipped with a special telecom assisted hearing device allowing people like my husband to clearly hear the descriptions of each exhibit.It was especially warm in the late morning for the Getty Center Central Garden Tour but I was eager for the tour despite the heat. Free umbrellas were offered for sun protection but since I was juggling my camera and a water bottle I had no free hand for an umbrella. I looked for shade. Although the tour focused on the gardens, much was explained about the architecture and the unique collaboration between Meier and Irwin. I was especially impressed with the rebar sculpted bougainvillea on the lawn beneath the museum. As good as the garden tour was, we were both glad to seek the cool air-conditioning inside the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelleygirl2
50,Priceless,"This is one of my favorite places to spend an afternoon in Los Angeles. The exhibits house large collections of work from either the featured artist or a wide range of art from a specific era. The views are breathtaking whether you are admiring the skyscrapers of Downtown LA or the sparkling waters of the Pacific Ocean. You may bring your own picnic or enjoy a simple lunch from the café, either way, you will have an opportunity to enjoy the surroundings, weather and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicasV28NM
40,"Great views, great food and events pity about the art and architecture","The Getty is a great big beautiful series of boxes on one of the most scenic settings in the city. I love to come here just to eat. The all-white toilet-tile architecture is not very imaginative, and the spaces don't flow. After some 20 visits I'm still confused as to how to get in and out of the separate pavilions and which is which. Also, let's face it, the art is second rate, though very well presented. Pity that the Getty wasn't created at the turn of the century when its billions could have gotten it access to the treasures it deserves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burbatana
50,"Various art exhibits, but the Buildings and views - Wow.","The tram or train takes you up the hill and the buildings are impressive. Besides the various art buildings and special exhibits, astounding views of Santa Monica and Century City. You can pack a lunch, but the cafeteria is really nice and the food is decent. We got the cheese and fruit plate and wine and beer are also sold. There's coffee vendors also. Sometimes they have music concerts. Makes for a nice vibe. A gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0ckettWriter
50,Spend a few hours here,"This is a fantastic museum. Located on the edge of LA, off the 405, The Getty hold many contemporary exhibits of world renown artwork and has a fantastic view of the city. It is free to get in, but parking is about $10-15. There is a tram from the parking lot to the entrance. Lovely gardens are located in the courtyard, so be sure to walk the grounds to see these and the outdoor sculptures.Exhibits change often, so check the website for what is showing before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmom352
50,A must stop,This museum is by far the best one I have gone to. I usually am not a museum fan but my girlfriend is and we decided to go. It is so big that you would never see it in one day and the best thing it's free. When we were there they had a tapestry collection which was amazing. I would definitely recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc0425
40,More than an Art Museum,"The Getty Center is much more than an art museum. It is a research facility, incredible gardens, grand vistas of the city and much, much more. The best part is you only have to pay for parking if you arrive by car; there's no admission fee. The adventure starts from the minute the tram ascends the hill to the summit. The museum itself it enormous, spread over several buildings and many levels. Beyond sculpture and paintings there is a vast collection of pre-French revolution furniture that has been displayed in recreations of French chateau room from whence they came. As you wander in and out of the buildings be sure to look for fossils embedded in the travertine tiles of the building exteriors. The gardens are exceptional, start from the plaza level and follow the water stream to the sunken maze gardens. The best days to visit are after a gigantic rain storm when the skies are clear. You can see all the way to downtown LA and Long Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman

If you plan on eating in the beautiful restaurant, make reservations. As a rule they do not take walk ins. The goal is not making a profit on the restaurant. It is a convenience for persons who want sit down service for fine food. Picturesque view while dining. Of course, the Getty has a treasure trove of exhibits and with more than adequate parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanb623
50,The Getty Villa,"If the ancient world is your thing, or even if you are remotely interested, this is a must see. The architecture of the villa alone is worth the visit. The fact that it houses a stunning collection of mostly Graeco-Roman artifacts is just icing on the cake. The villa is as near an exact copy as one can get of the Villa of the Papyri destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius on the Bay of Naples in 79 CE. Complete with copies of the artworks found during excavations in the gardens of the original. Looking out over the Pacific, you can only imagine a similar view over the Bay of Naples.

50,"Amazing views, gardens and galleries","Met up with friends and spent the better part of a day walking through the wonderful art galleries. There is an amazing collection of paintings by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Manet, Rembrandt among many other famous artists. There are sculpture and decorative arts galleries as well. The galleries are well planned and easily viewed.There is no charge for entry but there is a $15 charge to park. We arrived in a taxi and were driven right up to the main entry.Even in January the gardens were worth seeing. There is a cafe which serves salads, sandwiches, soup, pizza and simple fare. There is also a restaurant with full service. We chose the cafe to allow more time to look.When you first arrive, you can take the free tram up the hill or simply walk up the hill. We arrived around 11:00 a.m. and there was no line. At the end of the day there is either the tram, shuttle bus or the option of walking down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41SharonT

Great place for kids.Parking and tram can sometimes be hassle (n.b. this may be a jaded LA viewpoint). The period of art for a lot of the permanent collection is not of interest to me. Is 10 degrees colder than the surrounding areaAll in all, though, I'd put in near the top of places to visit when coming to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831curtisd
50,Incredible!!!,"Words fail me in trying to describe this amazing gallery of art and architecture. The parking was well organized, the tram to to the centre was a way to shift gears and see the grounds, and then BAM!!!! The centre is linear and so well aligned that it is a magical place. The docents are are enthusiastic and passionate about the place and their guidance is well worth the time. A lunch in the restaurant is special for the food AND the view. No trip to LA should be without a stop at the Getty Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiA706

50,Much more than expected,A beautiful building with an impressive art collection and other interesting sections.The architecture is spectacular and the collection of old masters is on a par with the great European museums.

50,Amazing....,"The Getty is awesome! My wife and I went on a dreary rainy day last week while in LA. We focused on the inside first due to the weather and 3 hours later the rain and fog lifted and we were treated to the grounds as well. The Dutch Masters and the Impressionist rooms are phenomenal, while the Miyako exhibit, the Daguerreotype installation, and the special tapestry show were all fantastic. I cannot say enough about the magnitude and quality of art on display. Parking is $15 but wasn’t a problem on the day we visited – the tram is worth it, as there is plenty of time to walk around the plazas and gardens. A must visit spot when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dupetersentravel

We appreciated going through all the exhibits and walking the grounds. We had a lite lunch at one of the cafes and we were able to sit outside to enjoy it. The quality and variety of the art was a special treat!! An LA must for any art lover!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm

50,One of L.A.'s highlights,"I've been to the Getty a few times over the years, and each time I've really enjoyed my day there. Although there is a fee for parking, the museum itself is free. Note that the Getty is closed Mondays, so plan your trip accordingly.The complex itself isn't that large, but each of the pavilions has many levels, so you could easily spend the entire day wandering and admiring the art. Some of the notable artworks include van Gogh, Monet, and Rembrandt. And if you're not a big art person, you can still enjoy the Central Garden and the panoramic views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniko8
40,Beautiful Setting,"Tremendous views and exceptional site overshadow the art. You don't want to miss The Getty Center, but get your ""art fix"" elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMRNJ
50,Jaw-dropping amazing,"What can I say that hasn't been said before: the Getty Center is a jewel. There are several ways to enjoy the center and I highly recommend obtaining the FREE iPod touch to deepen your understanding and enjoyment of the art and exhibits. You can check out the iPod from the desk at the front right of the entry atrium. Most of the pieces have a code number on the information card which you type into your iPod, and then a short narrative vignette describes in more depth about what you're looking at. It's fascinating to hear the curator's point-of-view about the piece, often describing details that I would have otherwise missed.Besides the self-guided iPods, I also recommend catching one of the free tours offered throughout the day, especially the Collection Highlights Tour. A well-informed docent will lead you thru the pavilions and share highlights of the collection. What's great about this docent-lead tour is that you're given a special headset that's tuned to the docent's headset, so you can hear the narrative clearly over all the other general background noise. It creates a sense of tour intimacy with the docent even though there are many people swirling all around you.There are many places to sit and rest, and you'll need it as your legs will start to wear out with all the walking around you'll be doing. There are a variety of food options available as well, from snacks (central courtyard) to cafes to a full-service restaurant.The views are amazing. We were lucky that it had just rained so the skies were clear. We could see downtown Los Angeles, the San Gabriel mountains beyond, and all the way out the Pacific Ocean to Santa Catalina.There are gallery guides and guards throughout the center, and all were very helpful when approached.Parking could be an issue, so be sure and check out the parking situation on their website. If you do park in their underground garage, be sure and pay/validate your parking ticket as you work your way to the entrance. There are pay stations in all the parking-elevator lobbies. (As of January 2016, parking is $15.)The Getty Center is truly an amazing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bensS6705TN

Everyone enjoyed the entire time we spent there. It amazes me that except for the parking fee, it is free!!!The café is a bit expensive for what you get. My husband and I split a sandwich and the 'kids' had cheeseburgers ($10.) Drinks are a bit expensive but the food was good.We were blown away - almost physically - when we went outside to the deck over looking LA area. We could see as far as LAX - from what we were told a rare event. Some of the gardens were in winter mode - kind of dead - but the view wonderful.The store was loaded with books and jewelry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/02corvette
50,A CAPTIVATING EXPERIENCE,"only $10 for parking. Gather up a load and split the cost. A fun tram takes you through the hills up to the museum. There is something for everyone-Collection of art, beautiful gardens and water features and amazing architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimB577
50,Such a spectacular view!,"The view of the California mountains from the Getty Center is breathtaking. I honestly explored the gardens and the grounds far more than the museum itself -- took the architecture tour. It was a beautiful trip, and a great place to take pictures or have an outdoor lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaVU
50,Get to the Getty,"Just a cute little tram ride up the hill and you have the most spectacular view of the LA Basin, from the ocean to the Port to downtown. The landscaping is unbelievably beautiful, and the buildings are exquisitely architected. Absolutely stunning. The art is displayed in an abundance of well chosen space and features Impressionist and Classical. THe food at the cafeteria is very I'mpressive. A visit is like a trip to the great museums of Europe but much quicker. Definitely worth a half-day or more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marklG8499ME
50,Great Art and Great Vistas,"I love art. And architecture. Also nature, mountains and the sea. The Getty has all of those. How lovely to wander amongst the tress and hills on the edge of the city and be able to weave in and out of galleries full of magnificent renaissance art! One of my constant struggles is to sacrifice time outside in a lovely climate to visit the museums and galleries I so adore. The Getty allows me to do both. We arrived late in the day and were not able to take it all in, but that is all the more reason to go back. Great giftshop, too! Did I mention I love museum and gallery stores? They have the most exquisite and imaginative gift items -- great for early holiday and birthday shopping! I'm California dreaming again. Can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnowGoddessDiva
40,Awesome views,"Awesome views of the city from up high. The artwork itself left a little to be desired when compared to the Art Institute of Chicago, but considering it was free, not bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikefromwellington
50,An Outstanding Art Facility High on the Hills in Los Angeles,My wife and I spend early December in Los Angels visiting places that were on our bucket lists. This was on my wife's list as she spent time working for Getty Oil in the 1980s.Both she and I were blown away with the size and variety of the art here. Especially for a free facility (you pay for parking).You could easily spend days here and have a good day each day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6stanb
50,Love it!,The Getty Center os a beautiful place to visit for all ages. They offer lots of different exhibits and wonderful outdoor spaces to meander and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207rachelg
50,Spectacular!,"Disclaimer - we only viewed one exhibit while at The Getty. However, we did go along with the architecture and garden tours, and that was definitely worth it! The views are amazing, and the architecture is incredible, and the entire grounds had a very soothing, inspiring atmosphere. I would recommend arriving early. We got to the parking ramp about 45 minutes before the museum opened and did not have any problems finding a parking spot or taking the tram to the museum. I did notice there were long lines as we were leaving. Take a picnic and enjoy the sights and sounds of the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AinsleeB
50,A Inspiring place,"The place presents with calmness and has a great view to the city from a hill. Besides the art, the layout of the building, garden, and walking path promote tranquility. A good place to be alone and maybe meditate a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelpeopleH
40,"It took a decade to build, a decade well spent indeed.","As part of the landscape tour, we walked the property while listening to the guide explain to us the grid of trees versus clustering of trees.It was the moment under the rebar Bougainvillea sculpture that the garden reveals herself to us. The central sculpture garden has become a wishing well, but the pathways around it give a homey feel.The museum and its collection is vast. The architecture and genius of Richard Meier, grand. Travertine is the queen of the property, she appears everywhere, in various forms, immaculately presenting herself to us viewers.Take an Uber to this property, plan to spend a day with your family, don't forget to take a picnic, the sunset and sky look most beautiful from every possible angle. You also get a great view of Catalina island from the west wing balcony.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purpledash
40,Nice view,"This was a nice outing. The view and the gardens were lovely. I also enjoyed the art collection, but it isn't the same caliber as the major museums in other world class cities. Also, there was a traffic jam getting into the parking garage and then a long wait for a security check before getting access to the tram or the path to the museum. By the time we arrived, the kids were hungry for lunch and the cafe was very crowded. I guess this was poor planning on my part. I would advise others to arrive early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlk11
20,"Too Many Trams, Stairs, Elevators, Etc.","My wife is disabled so we chose to sit in the sun in the assigned smoking area (not our choice) and enjoy the view rather than deal with the confusing and difficult layout. On the plus side, while congested and pricey, the cafeteria food was good. I'm sure the museum content was excellent but just not very accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SN359
50,Fantastic children's center,"I have been to the Getty several times and love the outdoor spaces and the restaurants. This time we spent much of our time in the children's area, which is probably the best children's space in an art museum I've ever seen. There were several age-appropriate activities tied directly into the museum's collections, and my toddlers had a fantastic time and did not want to leave. I wish we lived closer and could return more frequently. I'm so glad we did this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phillytraveler71
50,Wonderful day!,"Loved this place. Very fun for the entire family. Can't wait to return. Free. Pay for parking only. Thank you, Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Certainly #1 Attraction in LA,"We have been to many museums around the world and this one most certainly is at the top - NOT JUST BECAUSE: the exhibitions are beautiful; the explanations - just right and the campus is exquisite, but because of the thought that has gone into it to make it a delightful and meaningful place to visit and the elegance in which it is put together. We arrive at midday during the weekend. We had no problem finding parking and despite the crowd it was easy to make our way around even with small children and a stroller. The tram ride from the entrance to the Center to the campus offers gorgeous sites of the city. The kids also enjoyed following the tracks and observing how the tram makes its way.The hands-on Family Art Room is full of fun for little ones offering a fun introduction to art. The different levels, patios, stairways, and gardens are spacious and allow kids to run around.We visited the tapestries, French art during the time of Louis 14th and the paintings, each room leaving us with new insights and a good feeling. While looking at the amazing portraits from hundreds of years ago, I couldn't help thinking that they were the ""selfies"" of their time. Human nature has changed very little over time. The only thing that has changed is the technology.The restrooms were plentiful and easy to get to. The cafeteria offered a variety of wholesome food at reasonable prices; seating was easy and there was no shortage of chairs. Unlike other places, we have visited, we did not find ourselves chasing tables or chairs.Even the Tray Return at the cafeteria made it easy for visitors.Definitely a place to visit more than once. We will be back, And oh, did I mention that it is FREE???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517judyy
50,Wonderful museum - you won't see everything in a day,"Beautiful architecture - incredible views - wonderful collections - we saw some of the general collections and the tapestry collection from Louis XIIIV - There are several excellent food venues, a special room for children's activities - beautiful gardens - well worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bookwoman328
10,Poor Management on directing traffic to the parking lot.,"To day Jan 2nd , took my nephew whom from Hawaii to visited the Getty Center. When we got there , both direction of the road was in a stand there . We waited in traffic about a good twenty minutes before we were directed in a drive way . And when we got in , was told to turn around cause the lot was full , I asked what did you say ? He said the lot was full , then why let us in , and was told the lot was full and need to turn around ? why not not just put up a sign on the Road way to let people know the lot was full ?? in the first place !! I know I will not take my family to visit any time in the future .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/songl648

50,Wonderful,"The Getty Center should be on everyone list when in LA even if one does not like art. The ride up to the museum is on a tram and it in itself is wonderful. It is a beautiful group of buildings and a wonderful location. The views are magnificent of the LA basin. I loved the cactus garden. Besides all of this, there is some great art to be seen. Gift shows through the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Estjwm

Wish we could have had more time + included the other Getty site as part of this tour. Beautiful grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1799ERlindas
50,Minimum 2 hours.,"Not much time, so we went up to see the architecture, gardens, a special exhibit of tapestries (wow!), and the impressionist paintings. Did this quickly in about 2 hrs by arriving near opening time. Staying longer and grabbing food at their several options would have been a good day. Lots to see. It was getting crowded with a long line of cars to enter when we left around noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyB789
50,Eye candy in every direction,"This is the place to go to titillate your visual cortex and wallow in privilege--your privilege of getting to enjoy exquisite architecture, gardens, views, and art for free, and Getty's of being in the position to bestow so much richness upon the public. Visiting the Getty was my favorite part of my LA trip! Be sure to make time for the Getty Villa as well on the same day--your parking fee at one includes parking at the other. They are 30-60 min apart depending on traffic, and the Villa closes before the Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliat687

Well worth a visit, all it will cost you is $15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46guyp
50,It's not just a museum!,"It is a wonderful place to visit when in LA. It has free admission, you just pay for parking. You can take a tram ride up to the center or walk alone the winding rode. We chose to tram up and walk down at sunset. The museum has a variety of galleries that are all beautiful to visit. They also provide free headset tours or free timed guided tours. We took the free guided tours for the gallery highlights, the garden tour and architecture tour. All tours were amazing, I especially enjoyed the garden tour and walk around the grounds. The views are unbelievable! Go spend the day enjoy the views, It's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerip833
40,Great view and great collection,An amazing place with fantastic grounds and an amazing view. The art collection (especially the European masters) is very impressive. However avoid going there on holidays when parking is full. It took us an hour to get out of the parking lot !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarenal2014
50,Very nice,"I'll start with the parking: they have on site big garage and a back up opposite, across the hwy when this one is filling up. If you come mid week, off season, you probably won't have a problem. But when it gets busy, it fills up within an hour or two than they close the access to both garages and you are left to drive on the hwy with no other parking close by, so you'll have to abort it. So if you are coming in busy times, come early...After parking you will enter the waiting area, from which you will board a tram or bus for a short drive up the hill to the place itself. The place is huge, comprising of few buildings and levels, and may be a bit overwhelming, not understanding where are exhibitions and which. The grounds and mostly the views are quite spectacular in clear days. Spending time depends how deeply you wish to explore the exhibitions. We did not care to do that to the extent, but between the views, some of the exhibitions and some food, spent there over two hours...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilan7
40,Excellent visit - get there early.,We were there December 26. We got there at 1000 and it was delightfully quiet. By the time we left at 1300 it was getting very busy (we were en route LAX for return flight to UK). The queue/line at the bottom of the monorail to access the attraction was significant. Great venue. I want to come back with a picnic and enjoy the grounds with more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgarn33

Usually early spring and fall.I like to get there early in the morning, I wish they allowed visitors at dawn.The view from The Getty is magnificent, the architecture breath taking and the collections are noteworthy.You can get a coffee and snack at the open air restaurant and the gardens are beautiful even during the CA drought.Well worth a half a day of anyone's vacation.Bring your camera gear, tripod and all you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BodhranBeater

50,Enjoying an afternoon at the Getty.,"Sometimes you miss the things in your own backyard. I've been to the Getty Villa off PCH when I was a teenager, but not the Getty Center. I still remember watching the Getty being built and its finally time I get around to a visit. ""The Getty"" Center is open to the public and is free. However, parking is $15, free for the first hour and $10 after 4 pm. Our visit was on a Tuesday, the week between Christmas and New Year's day.The Getty's underground parking lot opens at 9:30 and the actual center opens at 10 am. The website suggests getting there early - they're not kidding. We arrived at 11:15 and it was bumper to bumper getting in.A free shuttle will take you up to the center and return you to the parking lot following your visit.Upon your arrival you'll see the grounds and buildings are immaculately kept and are equally interesting as the exhibits. The architecture and construction of the center is fascinating.Exhibits continually rotate through the museum, check the website for current exhibits. One current feature is Woven Gold; Tapestries of Louis XIV. The tapestries on display are immense and take several years to complete. The mechanics behind the construction are fascinating and are worth taking the guided tour to learn more about this. The only unfortunate aspect of this exhibit is there is no photography allowed.We wrapped up our visit with a self-guided tour of the gardens. This is well worth the time. The artful design of the gardens lend themselves well to the overall architecture and appeal of the center.There are several coffee carts, two cafes on site and a restaurant which one of the docents referred to as ""pricey"". If you prefer the restaurant reservations are a must as it will book up quickly. Our option was the the Cafe. It's a cafeteria style setup which for its offerings is pricey. The $9.50 small pizza was very good, but the Alaskan cod was rubbery and accompanying sides awful. I look at this as a captive audience scenario similar to airports; they have you and if you're hungry you'll pay the price.Overall, we had a great time exploring the exhibits, soaking in the culture and taking in the wonderful views. The food seems to be a hit or miss. I should also mention the facility and exhibits will consume a full day or more. If you're not a local, you should expect a second day or be frugal in what you want to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speed454

Parking $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msjessies
50,Wish we had had more time to spend here,"We wen to the Getty while we were visiting our daughter during Thanksgiving week. We took two tours, one of the highlights of the exhibits and the other the garden tour. They were good tours and I would recommend both of them. We were fortunate to be able to take both tours as we were limited for time and had to go directly from one to the other. Following lunch on the grounds we had a little less than an hour to walk back through the museum and also the grounds. Their exhibits change and also the plantings in the garden change seasonally and it would be fun to return for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opieks

Loved beautiful garden and spectacular review. There are several sections for paintings and statues.According to family members this was one of the busiest day they have seen.

I was excited to see the iconic Van Gogh painting of Irises and hear a docent speak about it. We also had a very nice lunch in the cafe. The views of the city were also great, even on a cloudy day.

30,PROS: Amazing location with incredible views of LA... CONS: Art is not my taste and they've let the gardens go,"This is the most underwhelming office park of a museum... it looks like the headquarters of an insurance company high up on a hill over the 405. What a waste of money and opportunity. Richard Meier really dropped the ball on this one. I know it took years (or decades) to get approval, but in the City of Angels, why isn't there something, I don't know, more heavenly about this place? You can see it for miles and it just doesn't inspire. Compare this to the stunning Disney Hall, which sadly is hidden in downtown by lowrise buildings.Enough about the disappointing exterior. Inside, the art is just not my taste. To each his own on that.What I used to love about the Getty were the expansive gardens, which were expertly planted and maintained. Very austere but beautiful. Now it's all junked up and not cohesive.The best part of the Getty are the amazing city views, from downtown LA to the ocean. It's really peaceful if you find the right corner to enjoy the outdoors. Doesn't say much about the museum when you can't wait to get outside, but I would recommend coming here just for that vista.One good thing is the crowds have lessened over the years (or they use public transportation) so it's way easier to get parking in the garage on Sepulveda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrew-s-wood
50,A good place for art,"I'm not a crazy fan for art, however, I do love this place! 这里是免费的，但是停车要15刀（下午4点之后停车是10刀）。来后可以乘坐免费的小火车，也有免费的讲解。这里有梵高的《鸢尾花》，也有很多美丽的画和雕塑。最主要的是，这里可以看日落，也可以看LA的全景，风景非常美丽。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904yuanl

I went with a friend of mine and my significant other.They have pretty impressive artwork, specially from Europe, of course.I had a bad experience when I thought about checking my phone. Two security guards saw me taking it off from my pocket, and they suddenly started to yell at me telling my I couldn't take pictures there... and I was going just to check WhatsApp!In the other side, the conditions of the museum are really nice, very bright, very good condition of artwork, everything is clean and the dudes at the restaurant were really nice and helpful.I would go again... if I can avoid those guards who yelled at me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicepawn

Lovely exhibit on Louis the XIV tapestries which I got told off at for taking a photo of. Very wheelchair accessible there are even wheelchairs to borrow by the tram, so we schlepped dad and I think he had a nice day out. Amazing views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniekustner
50,Wonderful and diverse modern building,"We visited this outstanding institution during a holiday vacation to the L.A. area. There is no charge for entry, but a $15.00 charge for parking (altogether very reasonable, and free if one takes public transportation there). From the parking area, to the tram and access to all buildings, the area was very friendly to a partly disabled person on a mobility scooter (me).This unique and modern series of structures offers a very diverse collection of art from ancient to modern (primarily paintings and sculpture). While there, we had a very nice late lunch at the restaurant, which was OUTSTANDING with a menu which was as diverse as the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncleBob
40,"Worth the drive - art, architecture, gardens","The Getty Center offers a variety of experiences for visitors with different interests. It gives a spectacular view of Los Angeles - you can see all the way to the beach. For this alone it is worth a visit if you're visiting Los Angeles from out of town. The architecture is also very cool. Richard Meier broke away from his white cubes to give us off-white travertine stone cubes. I say this somewhat sarcastically, but it really does make all the difference. Inside and out, the buildings are beautiful and calming, and the travertine evokes something sort of archaeological with its surprise fossils. This sense of discovery is amplified by the experience of arriving via tram as it slowly bends its way up and around the hilltop. I really liked the tram the first few times I went. Angelinos had anticipated the completion of the Getty Center for so long that the tram just heightened the already existing suspense. Now, by the time I board the tram, I'm still bitter about paying $15 for parking (a price which doubled over the span of about 3 years), and I just want to get to the museum already. The slow pace of the tram pains me. It is a reminder of the way in which many things in LA are destinations or events. One rarely decides on a whim ""Today I'm going to the getty for an hour,"" because it takes an hour just to get there, park, and ride the stupid tram.This is unfortunate because the art (or right, this is an art museum) is truly fantastic. Everyone loves impressionists and post-impressionists and Van Gogh irises truly impress. There's a Louis XIV portrait that is an historic icon of the absolute monarch and a jewel-like David painting of Telemachus and Eucharis that is a personal favorite. While I love their painting collection, the Getty also often has changing exhibits that are very well done and is an amazing place to view photography. Their photographic collection is extensive and it seems like there's often a new exhibit that reinterprets their holdings.I've heard many people speak of their love of the garden. It's nice. Not my favorite aspect, however. Still, I usually walk down there every time I go. If you want impressive gardens (plural) go to the Huntington.Also, since you're usually up on the hill for awhile, it also helps that they have lots of food options. No art captive likes to starve.Enjoy the getty; it's worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teatour_karen
50,Perfection on a hill,"I've visited the Getty Center many times. I've travelled extensively, and seen innumerable museums around the world, but the Getty remains one of my favorite places. Admission is free and parking is $15. The architecture is striking and astonishing. It is worth spending an hour with a docent for a free talk to explain the architectural concepts. One wanders through rooms of art and then suddently a shaft of light slashes in from a skylight or I find myself on a balcony with a breathtaking view overlooking the city. I just feel good being in this place. The gardens don't offer much in December but earlier in the year they are magnificent. The restaurants offer good food. I'm not so much a fan of their permanent collection but I always enjoy the photography exhibits. They have enough temporary exhibits to capture the interest of most people. The Getty is a special place in this world and Angelinos are lucky to have it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1
40,Worth a Stop (But be prepared to walk in circles),"I admit I hadn't much liked what I'd seen of LA in my first few days. Endless lanes of traffic and the Los Angeles County Museum was closed on a Wednesday the week of Christmas.(never even considered checking for that...) But the Getty lived up to its billing with amazing views, some interesting aspects to its collection, lovely garden and fascinating lay out.The signage is poor, which is a problem because of the convoluted floor plans with terraces, circular staircases and lots of blank spaces between different wings. I just gave in to feeling completely disoriented.The main gift shop was interesting and there's lots of lovely outdoor seating. The tram from the lot to the entrance is great and easy to use.I recommend you visit if you're in LA. Enjoy the vistas!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marycN2457KJ
50,Spectacular,"Unique institution at the world level.A ride on a train car. A view to forever. Brilliant architecture. Exhibits at two directions. Permanent collections. Exhibitions that seem narrow but when following them open to the entire world.Performing art, photography, dining, viewing.This is a treasure of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeniVidiFrui
50,Getty Center,"Paintings, gardens, great views of LA (once not smoggy..). The terrace is nice to relax after you visit the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek
50,The Art is not only in the galleries,"A trip to the Getty Center does not begin with the art that's housed in the Center; it begins with the tram up the hill to get there. Magnificent views of the city are evocative of what's to come. The art, sculpture and decorative arts from the middle ages to the impressionists are smartly and carefully curated to delight the novice and the connoisseur alike. Arrive early to go on the docent-led tours---they end at 2:00PM. They are invaluable and make your visit that much more enriching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImAGlobalTraveler
50,A Must See!,"The Getty Center is a world class museum. For us, one of the most interesting parts of the museum are the grounds. They are truly magnificent and landscape designers must see the extraordinary design. You truly feel transported and a day at the museum makes you feel as if you are some place other than Los Angeles. The exhibits fluctuate - sometimes there is something of interest but oftentimes, we prefer different types of art than are on exhibition. Regardless of what is currently on exhibit, one should still visit The Getty Center because it is one of the major museums of the world and to witness the architecture and design of this museum is worth the visit alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravelersJD
40,Great way to kill time when waiting for flight at LAX,Beautiful architecture and grounds filled with amazing known artists from Van Gogh to Degate. If you like artists from 16th-18th century then this is a great place to see. Free Admission - Parking $15 per car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dollyt730
50,Gorgeous scenery and lots and lots of art and artifacts to see.,"The center, in addition to the Villa, are the two most interesting places to see while visiting L.A The center has the art work while the villa has the ancient artifacts. Both places well display their ""goods"" and the physical ""plants"" of both are to die for. Don't miss this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tradeesq

50,Allways A Fantastic Place To Spend A Day,So many exhibits to enjoy. If it's your first time I would suggest taking the free guided tour. The guide will describe great ways of noticing the differences in how the artist created their works and what to maybe look for in what the artist was trying to convey. They also provide ipods that explain the different artworks if you want to explore on your own. The outside garden is a great place to take a break while enjoying it's beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SurfCityBeach
50,"So much to see, so little time","I love this place, no shortage of money behind it to make it's art open for free to the public. It's my second time to visit, not bad considering I lived in Iowa and now Colorado. Back to the point: a huge diversity of permanent as well as rotating contemporary art. Also, I consider the facility itself to art, the architecture is incredible and creates awe in just looking. I find that the drawback is selfish: I wish there were more art from around the world, and I understand the emphasis on European art (it has to start somewhere). In any case, I hope the Getty keeps growing, diversifying, and being an essential player in culture and art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandSusan
50,Amazing,"Wow this is a must if visiting LA. Views to die for, amazing art and photography. Went by public transport, dropped right outside. Free to get in, great food. All in all a fabulous experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195alisonc
50,fine selection of art.,beautiful building. Schoolclasses everywhere but they know how to behave ( thanks tutors). Entrance free but food a little pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doolaard23
50,SEE THIS!,"If you care anything about art, architecture, landscaping, photography or just want a great view of LA and the mountains and the ocean - go to The Getty. It is free and incredible! Parking is $15 I think but well worth it and no reason not to make this a 'must do' on your LA trip.Wear your best walking shoes and plan at least half a day for a turbo visit and a whole day or more for a thorough visit. Five buildings and 3 floors per building of art and artifacts at this location alone. There is another Villa in a different area with even more art and it looked incredible as well in the video. When we go back we will see the Villa. The grounds are sculptured and lovely but still simple and relaxing. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lojomu
50,Love the garden,"Peaceful oasis in the Valley. Beautiful garden, always interesting exhibits, plenty to do for various ages. Make sure to check the calendar for the latest events & show schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cosmogirl-la
30,Great for the views,Cool building but it's badly laid out and we gave up trying to navigate it in the end. It's probably better for those who have lots of time to find their way around. The building was stunning and the exhibits were very good but quite repetitive. That could be because we cut our trip short though. The views were beautiful abs it was definitely worth seeing if you have time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellejenkinsuk
40,"Lovely architecture, shame about the painitings","The paintings are not first rate and other museums have better examples. The collection appears to be an example of collecting by numbers - Turner - tick, Gainsborough - tick, Cezanne - tick, but none are memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benedict_J
40,Beautiful Location,"While the aspect of a museum didn't interest me too much, I did find this modern facility to be very accessible and it provided great views of the city.There is a fee to park with convenient transportation up the center. From there you can access gardens and exhibit areas. Even if you are not interested in the exhibits it's worth walking through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyleratCP
50,"Views to die for, oh and amazing art!","The gardens themselves are a work of art, the restaurant amazing, the tram ride fun and a great way to keep cars out of your life for a few hours, all these things are terrific. I feel like these things alone are worth the price of admission.And then there is the art! It is best to plan a whole day here with breaks, or perhaps just go several times. The displays are so numerous that you almost need to pick and choose what you are going to tackle and I know the pieces displayed at any one time are the tip of the Getty collection iceberg.A not-to-miss experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WinecountryMartha
50,Outstanding views!,My friend's girlfriend dragged us 3 guys to this place while on our vacation in LA last week. Needless to say it completely blew my mind and any expectations. The art exhibits were cool and the garden outside was really nice. The views of LA were amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegrizz88
50,A Time to Remember at the Getty Center,"So much to see while there, art work, beautiful gardens and water falls, food court, and much more . Easy to get there on the tram or walking trails. The architecture was unbelievable gorgeous ..not to mention the awesome views from different areas...a must visit when in the area !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0phia2014
50,An amazing place,The architecture and gardens are truly magnificent. The collection is primarily European paintings but there is also an excellent outdoor sculpture collection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbgannon
50,Exceptional Haven for the Mind,"If you need time to just let your head wander away from it's physical containment called your skull, let this be the place. Entrance is free, but you pay for parking. A tram will take you up into the hillsides where you will get a spectacular view of the city, while you walk around the excellent architecture and gardens. Explore the interior galleries for beautiful collections of art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,Art can be fun,A summer arts visit at the Getty was inspiring. The art works leaves you in awe with such beauty all around. The architecture is clean and stunning. The views around the building are not to be missed. Time to be hungry and check out the food stop. Expensive but good. The visit is well worth the time even the tram ride up the hill. Take your camera and kids too. It's a beautiful arts experience and very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeLoisD
50,It's not just the exhibits.,"One of our favorite places in Los Angeles. I'm not a ""museum person"". Some of the exhibits (especially the special exhibits) are very interesting. But the buildings and the grounds - the architecture, the gardens, the restaurant and the views - are not to be missed. Take a docent tour. You will return again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724aal
50,A treasure of treasures with an amazing view!,My wife and I took some time to stroll around the museum and also take in the view which was amazing. A must see if you're visiting Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonphoto

50,Breathtaking!,Free admission? What?? The art pieces are only part of the experience. The facility is beautiful!! Make sure you visit the gardens and catch the view of downtown LA at sunset. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinsoun
30,"Feels special to everyone, not so much to me!","I guess you really have to go and the crowd factor was well managed. But I just did not feel the ""wow"" factor here. Art was OK but I felt the hype was more than the actual experience of being here. Views are great, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007
50,VISITED AN EXHIBIT,"Well trained docents, everyone is very accommodating. The grounds are great to take a walk. Lunch with a view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488vasilisp
50,"Beautiful, serene","Looove the Getty Center. It's situated high on a hill and you ride a cool rail to get in. The buildings are such a gorgeous white and I highly recommend taking a tour to learn why the architecture is the way it is and why the colors that are used were used. There's a beautiful cactus garden and a great view of LA. The day we went was not very crowded so the whole area feels very spacious and peaceful.Compared to the Getty Villa, which was also beautiful, I'd say I like the Getty Center more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystalxpink
50,One of my favorite places in LA,"I go to the Center frequently...and always take visitors there. The architecture is wonderful, the special exhibits are sometimes small but always very well curated. You can check their website in advance to check what is available; the frequently have free drawing classes which, even if you have never done this before, are very relaxed (trust me, no experience required to have fun). A coffee on the terrace is a treat. Its astonishing to me that all of this is free (except for the parking fees, which are unavoidable really, as the bus service is very time consuming). Bring a sweater as it always a little chilly (compared to the rest of LA).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljm_8
50,Much to do besides viewing art!,"I have been there many times. You can take children and ride the monorail, which they love and has a wonderful view, as many times as you want. You can bring a picnic and eat on a lovely terrace overlooking the gardens, then walk all the way to the bottom of the garden and back. There is a children's gift shop that is marvelous, and a children's activity center with things to paint and do. Everything is free except for parking ($15), food and shops.If you arrive by bus, there is no charge to pay.I would not bring children on a rainy day, but there would be no problem for adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poetrydancer

50,Do not miss this museum!!,"Incredible modern architecture. Built in the mountains with breathe-taking views of Los Angeles. A visit to the Getty is a must when you are in LA. Even the parking is perfect. A comfortable indoor lot that is attached to a state-of-the art tram to transport you to one of the outdoor sculpture gardens. There is so much beauty inside and out. The exhibits range from modern paintings to photography to amazing rooms full of period furniture and world class antiques. Since the views are spectacular, try to visit on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancykM5075JZ
50,First quality art museum in fab location,"I have been to the old Getty Museum on PCH a number of times and although I loved the old mansion it was in, I always felt the collection lacked a cohesiveness. It's as though John Paul Getty collected one piece of every great artist and put them on display. Nice pieces but no theme. The new museum changes that dramatically! This is a beautiful collection of buildings that actually have a great art collection! And it is all free! You only pay for parking. This is a must see for any visitor to the LA area just to see the setting and views. But, stay for the art. It will also be worth your while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmW421OZ
40,Wonderful experience,"So today I visited the center with my family as it was a highly recommended place of interest in LA. I'm not a big fan of art museums but I must say that I was impressed by the works on display. It is both indoors and outdoors which provides ample space for families with children (to run around?) and is extremely wheelchair accessible.I came just in time for the opening of a new exhibition, which features tapestries that belonged to King Luis 14. The permanent exhibitions were also very impressive.An audio guide is available for free rent and admission is also free. Several tours including architectural tours and highlights tours are available.Dining options and shopping:- there are two cafes and one fine dining restaurant. I ate at the Getty Cafe for lunch and it was pretty decent with a good price.- there are two main shops, including. A children's shop (very cool) and a main shop with a lot of art things and souvenirs.In conclusion, I think the Getty Centre is an inclusive and engaging place for people of all ages. If you're a fan of the outdoors, you'll love it. If you like indoors, the same applies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debyong123
50,Excellent Museum,"Free admission but $15 for parking and it's STILL worth it. Ride a tram up the mountain from the garage to the museum. Views from the patios were fabulous. The collections are amazing. Get a free portable electronic device to listen to informative podcasts on the artifacts. If you want to see everything in 2 or 3 hours, you HAVE to keep moving and be selective in the podcasts you listen to. There is SO much to see. There are places to eat on location but we didn't use them so I don't know what prices were like. Be sure to take time for the gardens which are well kept and beautiful. Elevators are available for the handicapped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blabink
50,A beautiful way to slip out of Los Angeles for a bit...,"Wonderful Art and Architecture, spend time walking through the gardens, a must!Get to the top for a great view of L.A., even the tram ride is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeC692
50,The Nexus of Nature and Culture,"Never will you spend a better $10 than that for the parking lot of the Getty Center. After that, unless you want a refreshment or can't resist the offerings in the gift shops (a distinct possibility), the experience is free. And what an experience!The Getty is on a hilltop in the Santa Monica Mountains from where you can see the Pacific Ocean, the San Gabriel Mountains, what seems to be all of LA, and (on the late fall afternoon when we were there) an endless string of lights from miles-long traffic on the 405. We happened to be there when the most incredible sunset blazed purple and pink and orange and coral across the sky. Truly spectacular.The architecture, designed by Richard Meier, takes your breath away. With rough-hewn blocks of fossilized travertine on the facade and a central plaza encircled by the wings of the complex, it seemed to be a modernist take on an ancient ruin (to me). Although it's distinctly modern with walls of glass and angular juxtapositions, the warmth, texture and color of the Italian travertine combined with the gardens and serpentine curves of low, dividing walls appear ageless and reassuringly solid.The exhibition halls have been created to display the decorative arts and paintings in context with their style and period. It's like viewing art at The Hermitage, if the guts of the St. Petersburg palace were transported into an exciting, contemporary shell on a commanding hilltop.And with all of this, I haven't even talked about the art, which is a very satisfying collection of European and American from medieval times to the present. You will want to allow a few hours to take it all in. And then, you'll want to return often. If you don't mind getting in traffic, late afternoon does offer the chance of one of those amazing sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilyK88
50,My All Time Favorite Museum,"The architecture, gardens, permanent collections and special exhibits, surpass anyone's expectations. I love this place, inside and out. Sometimes, it's a beautiful day and we don't even go inside the galleries. The outdoors and gardens are enough. Other times, we do focus on the exhibits and there are plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notfromla

50,LA Visit Not Complete without the Getty!,"Having lived in LA for 20+ years, I have had the opportunity to visit the Getty Center and the Villa many times. If possible, try to visit both but, if that is not in your itinerary, don't miss the Getty Center. The Gardens alone are worth the trip. The view is second to none in Southern California. Whatever exhibit is there is worth seeing and… one of the best restaurants around. Usually in Los Angeles the view is sacrificed to the food or vice versa but here you have both. Even the tram from the parking lot to the Center is truly a trip. And...this was one of the last times I have seen an operative pay phone in a parking lot! Check out the website for details as it is very helpful. A lovely way to spend a day or just a few hours. I have returned often and will again; the best of The City of Angels. Note...I had to check one time for my visit bu it was one of many. Have gone with friends, family and just the husband! It is free but there is a parking charge....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albertalu
50,Beautiful architecture and art not to be missed!,Lovely location for awesome photos. Allow plenty of time to enjoy the outdoor landscape and art museums. We spent most of the day here. Stopped at the cafe for a deliciously memorable treat with awesome views. Service is wonderful. Food is refreshingly healthy but a bit pricey. Fun for the entire family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thrive6677
50,Incredible art for free!,"The Getty is a palace of art high on a hill overlooking the LA basin. The building is incredible and the gardens even better.

50,An LA must see.......,"No trip to LA is done, without at least one visit to the world famous Getty Center and Getty Villa Malibu. Wether you're a visitor, or live in the LA area, I highly recommend this place as a must see for all, and one trip is not enough. It's rare that you get the perfect combination of serenity, education, fun, and mind expanding experience that is unique to these two venues. Also, after leaving, it makes you want to go home a research more. I can't say enough about this place, go and enjoy, wether by yourself, your family, group, significant other.....:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALANOVICH
40,Spectacular Views,"If the weather is good, the panoramic views from LA to the ocean are truly amazing. I don't think there's anywhere in LA with better views. The buildings and Robert Irwin-designed garden are also worth seeing and the core collection isn't bad, with some excellent pieces scattered throughout. Watch for special exhibitions like the Turner show. I also recommend the high-end restaurant, but get reservations if possible. Parking is expensive and can be iffy later in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CastAColdEye
50,On a clear day this is One of LA's best places,"Family friendly, great place for a date, celebrate a birthday or anniversary w/friend - yes, there's world class art - the actual things they put in history books but there is also paths that weave through gardens, a fantastic ($$$) restaurant where the view is one of floating above the city. This is one of my favorite places and I discover something new on every visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hampy8

50,The richest museum,The Getty continues to shake up the art world with its aquisitions. The Getty also occupies one of the great real estate sites in the world with magnificent views of the Pacific. Money was no object to the development of this site.There may be no better place in all of Los Angeles to spend a day. After strolling through the exhibits you can stroll through the gardens which are also magnificent. Plan on having lunch at a restaurant or in the gardens. After you see the Getty Center you may also want to visit the Getty museum at Malibu a marvelous recreation of a Roman villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk189

50,Art and architecture with a view,"This is a must see when in Los Angeles. First, the views from the Getty Center stretch from the ocean through the entire area. Second, architecturally it is beautiful. Finally the art collection and the various exhibits are great. There is also a cool tram ride up the hill. Just sitting in the plaza having a coffee is fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195EMW
50,Love Getty with the kids,"Living in LA we are choosy about which sites to visit to avoid big crowds, tourists etc. Yet I have always loved visiting the Getty with my kids (under 10). Main reason: there's a little something for everyone. You can see art if you want but it's not overwhelming. You can just stroll and enjoy the beautiful gardens and spectacular views. It never feels over crowded and packed. I love their special events on certain days/nights, music etc. sure win for the whole family whether you are a local or not. My other favorite place like this (but much much bigger) is Huntington Gardens in Pasadena (avoid in summer because it's too hot in Pasadena).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventuregirls90210
50,Disneyland for the culturally starved,"Make a reservation. Getting to the Getty can be trying but it's worth the trip. Parking is easy. You pay for parking and, other than food, you're done reaching into your pocket. A train takes up to the museum grounds. The grounds are an outing on their own. Landscapers or horticulturists will guide you around the grounds as a side trip. My wife and I loved that.The museum is well laid out. Being Southern California, outdoor space lies between some of the exhibits. There's not a dud in the entire place. Food is unremarkable but it's food. If you go to the Getty Center, your ticket will work as free admission to the Getty Villa. Make an appointment! The Villa is filled with antiquities and is wonderful.Like all museums, there's usually more to see than you have the stamina for so check their schedules and plan what you really want to see. Similarly, there's a lot of walking so taking little children may become an issue. There are lots of spots to sit and relax but just be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petersX9848NC
40,I can spend all day just staring at the ceilings,"This is a lovely relatively smaller museum but it is gorgeous, I'm sure they are constantly changing exhibits so there is always some new to discover. Heads up you must purchase your tickets in advance and there is only a small cafe on premises (very charming) but limited so make sure you eat before heading out there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maridaniam
50,The Greatest Gift Ever Given to Los Angeles,"Quite simply my favorite place to visit in L.A. And all you have to pay for is the parking. The collection of art and antiquities here is amazing. The architecture is amazing. The gardens are amazing. The views to the south and west to the ocean and to the mountains is amazing. And there is an opportunity to have a very nice meal here at one of two nice restaurants and enjoy the ambiance of the locale. Great special exhibits on a rotating basis, there is always something new here to see. Can't get here often enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryL392

But it is not only the collection, but it is the grounds, the views, the layout. The Getty has it all.Just remember you will only pay for parking, and you want to make sure you arrive early as parking spaces can be a premium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA
50,"Beautiful art museum, stunning views!!","We recently visited The Getty with friends who live in Vietnam. It was their first time. It was the day after Thanksgiving and the weather was lovely, the sky crystal clear.The Getty itself is so beautiful. The gardens and walkways that meander through the grounds are so lovely. I love the stream that courses through the gardens. As I mentioned, the sky was clear and the views rivaled the treasures displayed inside.The museum is well laid out and viewing is easily accomplished with the art displayed in a thoughtful, sensible manner.Lots of choices for dining. The museum stores are lovely and well stocked with beautiful unique items, especially the children's store. And no entry fee! What a great deal. Load up the car with family and friends, pay $15 for parking and you'll enjoy a wonderful day in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1947annie
50,"If you are in Los Angeles on a clear day, just go",Amazing place. Where the buildings and landscaping are as good as the fabulous art. It's a must on business trip or vacation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lslondre
50,More than just a museum,"If you are from California/Los Angeles and have never been, or you visiting from out of town, The Getty Center is a must see place even just once. Allow for a certain amount of time to truly be able to look and explore what the Getty has to offer. From Art works to historical finding to the gardens, there is something for everyone. This is a great first date spot too in my opinion. As an Otis art student in my 20's, I used to frequent this place a lot before the remodel. Now its just exquisite and as an adult I have even more appreciation for this spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD819
40,Amazing views on a clear day,"Check the schedule ahead of time as the exhibits do rotate. Also, during the summer months, there are concerts outside at night which are really nice also. When clear, you can see for miles.. makes a nice afternoon..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relax810721
50,Intriguing European Paintings from 1600's,"In 1611 King James of England released the King James Bible in English. Many of the paintings include scenes of incest (Lot and his daughters), War (David), Adultery (Joseph with Potiphar's wife), Polygamy (Jacob with Leah and Rachel). Surely the Holy Scriptures were state of the art at the time. Maybe the Scriptures deserve a fresh look for today's reader.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracS6478RN
50,Beautiful city vista & masterpieces throughout,For a wonderful afternoon amid masterworks salons and innovative buildings plan to visit the Getty Center in the Santa Monica mountains. We had a great time for a late lunch and warm afternoon walk around the terraces and gardens. There are food carts where you can get sandwiches and non-alcoholic drinks. The staff are very helpful with provision for the less mobile part of our group. The audio tour players are well designed and easy to use. The parking at the bottom of the hill and tram to the top provide a stress free buffer between the traffic below and the artwork above.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resorteye
50,Amazing Place… a Must when visiting LA,"This is a beautiful museum that rivals museums throughout Europe. Yes, the architecture is modern, but it is truly beautiful. The grounds are peaceful and thoughtful and the art collection is worth visiting. Take half of a day and enjoy lunch at the restaurant. Even my teenagers enjoyed it. I recommend the headphones and let the kids walk on their own… everyone has different interests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/igirlsd
50,Great art and architecture,We loved visiting the Getty centre. The building itself is as impressive as the artworks and the gardens are as peaceful as they are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_blt
50,Always Great,"What's not to like?Fantastic location with great views of LA on clear days. A world-class art collection. Wonderful restaurants. Free! (well, you do pay for parking, but we try to visit after 4:00 when it's $10 rather than $15 - and if you plan a full day, you can park at both the Getty Center and Getty Malibu for one parking fee in the same day).Richard Meier designed the campus and the extensive use of travertine is breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash

50,Excellent place to enjoy asthetics,Just amazing - I love wandering around and finding beautiful things. The staff is helpful and the bathrooms are always clean. The grounds are always well maintained and they changed the exhibits frequently. The only thing that is a bit dodgy is the how the doors close on the tram so quickly. I was there with a handicapped group and we almost became separated! Maybe have some staff available to accompany slower individuals to alleviate this potential hazard? Otherwise The Getty is always a day to remember!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraM291
50,Art Indoors and Outdoors,We went only for a special exhibition but we couldn't help noticing the quality and quantity of both indoor and outdoor art. Exhausted by the oils? Go sit by a waterfall. Tired of the garden? Go visit the sculpture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drwtwilner

50,Great visit even for the non-Art enthused,"Because of the high ratings we chose to visit The Getty, it was not a disappointment. Neither my wife or I are overly art enthusiasts, but that didnt matter because we had a great time. We already had dinner plans in Malibu so we headed out to see the Getty Villa as well, since it was more of the same it was not as interesting because we had our fill.Its a great visit even for the novice, we spent 3 hours there and only looked at the exhibts on the first floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longwayfromtexas
50,Great views and some pretty good art,"There's always something interesting to see at the Getty Center in Brentwood -- very good changing exhibitions, as well as the permanent collection. Of the latter, van Gogh's painting ""Irises"" is a top hit, and deservedly so -- it's simply gorgeous. For food, you can grab a bite from cart,cafe or cafeteria, or have a more formal experience in the dining room, The Restaurant, which is pricey but offers terrific food (try to reserve).One of the true highlights is the view -- you can look to downtown from one side, and the Pacific Ocean from the other. Yes, you do have to pay for parking, but admission is free, so pack the whole family or all your friends in the car for your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuckyO
40,Beautiful way to spend a couple of hours,"Check before you go what exhibition is on and if it interests you it's a beautiful place to visit , easy to get to ( well sign posted ) free entry but $15 car park fee ( you must book car park in advance ) the views from outside are sublime especially in a clear sunny day , it's lovely to walk around the beautiful gardens . Inside it's a lovely space to view whatever there current exhibition is . Only one place to eat and drink with not an extensive choice . But some lovely places nearby once you leave to eat and drink .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
50,Great stop in LA,This is one of the best art museum in West Coast on a fabulous site. I think I can spend all day here each month without a problem. The site is sort of an oasis in this expansive messy city of Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jungblee
50,very much LA!,This is a must to see in LA: both villa and center. We took a few tours: every docent is another treasure of the Museum. They were fun and informative. We also attended play at the Villa. It is only available in the summer and it is performed at the Villa amphitheater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tani101
40,If You Have an Afternoon Free,"If you have a free afternoon and feel like doing something different than your usual get in your car and drive up to the Getty Center. It won't take long from anywhere in LA (although I can guarantee there will be traffic when you get to the 405 Fwy, but no biggie) and when you get there you'll be glad. Beside the semi spectacular views from everywhere around the Getty Center(sculpture gardens, panoramas of the city, etc) the collections are well curated and presented and you are not likely to find their ilk anywhere else in the US.The entire experience is pleasurable and challenging , and plan to spend 2 or 3 hours there. The restaurant is very good, with all kinds of sandwiches, dishes cooked to order, salads, etc. In fact it is higher quality than the average American restaurant, especially one at a Museum. All in all a visit to the Getty is something you won't soon forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreggySue
50,Amazing art + extraordinary views,"Not only it has great art, like Irises of Van Gogh (my favorite art piece of the world) it has lots of sections, and lots of different kind of art, modern and pop art, but its architecture is fabolous. The building is amazing, the little train you´ve gotta take (the museum is no top of a hill) entrace is free, you just pay for parking (recomend flat rate) Go early cause you´ll like to stay all day!!! The are also amazing gardens, and, cherry of the ice cream: there are like terraces al round the building, (that´s on top of a hill) and the views are just worth paying the parking!!!! Jaw droping!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroc556
50,"An Amazing Museum, Great Permanent Collection and Great visit shows, a WOnderful place to spend the day","The Getty Center is Amazing. One secret is that it is a wonderful place to go for the day, sit and read or meditate in the gardens, have a really nice meal, and not even bother with the art.Having said that, The Getty Museum, only one of five components to the Center, has a world class permanent collection, and hosts world class traveling exhibitions, and is always worth a visit. A true Gem of the Southern Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerstraveler_11
50,Spectacular art and architecture with a view of Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. First of all, it's FREE! Parking is fair and it is all around one of the best places to spend an afternoon escape in LA. The exhibits are eclectic- ancient, pop-culture and photography. There's always something new and they never disappoint. If you are visiting LA, put this on your lists of must visits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/necolec

50,Lovely views,"You get there by parking (paid) and taking a free tram (every five minutes). It has the most amazing views. Galleries and art are pretty good - we saw the Japanese photography exhibit. It's very spacious and if you have young children, there is lots of space outside for them to run around where parents can take turns to look at the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hobbyistravel
40,Great Venue & Lovely Art,"While some museums have better art collections, few have as good a setting as the Getty: beautiful gardens, lovely buildings and wonderful views. The staff is uniformly helpful and approachable. The food on offer is at least ok.If you haven't visited, please treat yourself the next time you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garysV5444LK
50,"Harder to find with GPS on, turn off follow directions.","We had a hard time finding the Getty Center, GPS is wrong, REALLY! Turn off GPS follow the signs and you will be there in no time! We were there all day and really had a lot to fun. Other than the National Gallery in Washington DC the Getty is maybe the best Art Museum in North America. I am sure there were pieces we did not see as we were there until closing, the museum itself is a work of art and there are great viewing positions of the surrounding areas via the outdoor sculpture parks. Many art pieces from ancient to modern. “A+”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mebyrne57
50,A calm and perfect escape filled with ancient AND pop-culture history!,"Simply... Perfect! The Getty Villa could not be better, honestly. If you're looking for a place in the crazy LA scene, where you can ESCAPE the bustly and traffic... GO to the Getty Villa. First, it's stunningly beautiful. Second it's big... but ""small"" enough to manage a day-long stay... where you can soak in the art, culture and surrounding and NOT fight a hige mass of tourists. The architecture, gardens, location, scenery, fountains are all superb and the ancient art is unbelievable... especially for LA! The staff is friendly, the food is very good... gourmet... and the setting is great! We have made a tradition of spending the entire Father's Day there each June. Helpful tips: 1) plan ahead. Space is limited - which all goes back to my comments about the crowds; 2) approach the entrance from the south [Santa Monica] side, as you cannot make a right-hand turn across traffic on Pacific Coast Highway, if you are coming in from the north [Malibu side]. It is DEADLY to attempt, let alone, illegal. 3) go early... like 10:30 and take it slow. Have a nice lunch and then hit the second floor of the museum or the gardens in the afternoon. The museum store is filled with great - quality items... and affordable. The Getty Villa is a hidden treasure in Los Angeles... Go and have a great time. I don't work there... I am just a real fan of the artifacts and the history of the Getty brand and I love to immerse myself and family in that relaxing, culture filled and unique Pacific coast lifestyle. It's why I decided to make LA my home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardrG7342OV
50,Great place for a warm afternoon,"The art is great... the vistas are great... the buildings are great... but best of all... people watching.. Sit in the center court with a cup of coffee and a book and watch the world go by.... Kids that will never be able to afford the art work, talking with teachers and staff about the things they ""LOVED"".. Young love, hand in hand, to see the life they might be able to live.. and the Seniors, absorbing all the spectacular views and art... What a great way to spend an afternoon.... while your guests absorb the GETTY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassV8048IT
50,Plan to stay the whole day,"Extraordinary permanent collections. Temporary exhibitions are also outstanding...and diverse. Go early to beat the crowds. Take the time to rest. It's a big place!On a clear day, you can see all of LA and parts of Orange and San Bernadino Counties, Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands. On a foggy day it's as if you're inside a cloud. The food in the cafe is great (and no reservations), but can be very crowded during peak meal times. Call ahead to make a reservation for the restaurant.Note: Although the museum entrance is free, parking is $15 per car ($10 after 4pm). You can always take a bus or get dropped off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjnkira
50,Nothing Less Than WOW!!!,"A trip to the Getty is unlike a visit to any gallery in the world! Arriving at the parking structure, getting shuttled up the mountain, looking out on the L.A. Basin as you ride, then disembarking the tram and being instantly overwhemed by architecture of angled lines into space, curves and glass in every direction is all downright overwhelming. Soon, one moment you are face to face with a Renoir, the next you are doing a selfie on a balcony opening up the most spectacular view of L.A. imaginable, framed by the Hollywood Hills.Every civilized, cultured visitor to Las Angeles owes themself a trip to the INCOMPARABLE GETTY!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiianDon

40,Loved learning about gilded frames,"This is a place to savor both the art and the architecture. At the time of our visit, one of the special exhibits was on the history and design of guided picture frames. Our guide was knowledgable and so glad to answer all our questions, and she gave us new perspective on an aspect of art we had never really thought about before. This is one of the LA area must see places for art lovers.

50,Memorable Day,I love art museums and have visited art museums in major cities all over the world. The Getty Center is at the top of my list. The grounds and architecture are impressive. The views of LA are beautiful. The galleries are well curated and provide an excellent viewing experience. This is a great cultural center and is worth a day trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigking
50,Wonderful........even if you don't like museums the views are amazing,Could spend days in the Getty Center just gazing at the wonderful art works many of which left me spell bound and in total awe. This is a cheap day out the only cost being for parking so if getting public transport you have no entry fee. The views are also fantastic with 360 degree views of LA. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courts48

50,Amazing Museum!,"This museum not only has a wonderful collection, but has stunning architecture to match. I've never been to a museum before where you can effortlessly move-on any floor-between the collections inside and the spectacular views of LA outside. The Getty is a museum AND an experience not to be missed in LA.

I have a good background in art history so that worked well for me. There are free docent tours available. I think the grounds and architecture are as interesting as the artworks inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maryloualso

30,Getty Center Is Fussy With Little Payoff,"The stunning surroundings and gardens of the Getty Center cannot make up for the fact there is something unseemly about an art museum that seems to emphasize its buildings more than its art. The center itself towers above one of LA's freeways with views of the ocean and the wealthier sections of that city. Visitors must park and take a tram (or walk) up a long slope leading to the center which features several Richard Meier designed white travertine buildings that house libraries, research staff, performing arts venues, cafes and galleries. During our visit, the galleries contained a small collection of impressionist paintings, drapery and costume drawings, two exhibits about food, a small exhibit about daguerreotypes, and most powerfully, a series of photographs by Ishiuchi Miyako, a postwar photographer whose images range from American influence on her hometown of Yokosuka to clothing remnants of the Hiroshima bombing by the U.S. This was the most gratifying part of our visit to the center. Yes, the architecture is hailed because it evokes permanence, beauty and tradition, and emphasizes the play of light in some of its rooms, but I'm afraid it fails in its efforts to match the drama of the surrounding landscape, or serve as an appropriate environment for what turned out to be a somewhat limited collection of exhibited art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322janetc

50,Views: great; architecture: very good; art: okay to very good,"The Getty Center is primarily a research and education center. The art collection is mixed. Great: Louis xiv furniture; illuminated manuscripts; rembrandts; and other odds and ends. Great: the views from various terraces, balconies and plazas..especially in the winter months when there is less smog. Mixed: some of the architecture is great, some not so great....definitely the reflecting glass wall and the central plaza are great.The issue with the art......Getty bought many B and C pieces of art in order to have pieces from various periods, schools, movements or genres, these are mixed in with a few A pieces. As a result, the viewing experience is a bit chaotic. In addition, the architect (Richard Meier) paid far more attention to the envelope than to the internal galleries. Many of the galleries are, at best, marginal places to display the collection. As a result, you have a mixed collection not displayed at its best.Do not miss the illuminated manuscripts....the Getty has one, if not the, best collection in the world. Unfortunately, only a small portion of the collection is displayed at any one time...but whatever is on display is worth viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attillathehun
50,Amazing Getty Center,"One of the best family walks in LA. The garden is awesome, the place - top of mountain - is incredible, and the views, oh, the views... you must go to see with your own eyes.

40,Come for the view,"As my title states, the Getty sits atop the beautiful cliff overlooking the 405 and most of Los Angeles. The museum is free, the only charge is the parking. You take a tram that takes you all the way to the top. Unfortunately the museum itself does not have much of an impressive selection. Time to time you may find a michaelangelo or Picasso only there temporary for restoration. Make sure to visit the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldinc

Visitors are transported by train to the museum, located beautifully on top of a hill. The building is very interesting, clearly well designed... which does not mean 'arty'.The collection is rather average, certainly for those who have visited museum about classical art, and European art before. It's nice and that's about it. Nothing thrilling or exciting, really. Having had only three days in LA I most certainly should not have included this visited in that short period of time.

40,Something fun for everyone,"We visited the Getty center the day after Thanksgiving upon a friend's recommendation. Though there were many visitors, everything was well organized. Parking was $15. We had to wait in line for about 15minutes for the tram. There was also an option to walk upto the center (3/4th of a mile uphill). The views of the ocean as well as the city up at the center were amazing. There are quite a few eating options: coffee shops, cafes and fine dining options. We picked the cafe where we had Mexican food which was pretty decent though a bit pricy as expected in such places (~$12 per person). The gardens are beautiful and the museum has a lot to offer as well. We enjoyed the Renaissance painting section the most. There is no entry fee other than parking. So, it is a good way to spend time with family while enjoying art and great views. One thing to note is that this is different from the Getty Villa. The parking once paid covers both the Center and the Villa for the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinasuk

40,Tranquil late night visit,Beautiful location and very tranquil during a late evening visit. Traffic on the highway can be very busy during the day so the late opening provides a good opportunity for tranquility and culture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sligo1966uk
50,Unbelievable architecture,The Getty is easily one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. The views and architecture are almost unbelievable. At times I felt as though I was on a movie set based in some Utopian future and that's just the architecture! There is also an impressive art gallery and amazing dining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benwack
50,Beautful Place,My husband and I like going the Getty Center. We take all of our out of town guests here. Great views of LA and the museum is fabulous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoAdventure
50,Beautiful museum with excellent exhibits and views,"We arrived late afternoon as the sun was going down and the light on the museum was lovely. There are a number of places to step outside and have a beautiful view.The exhibits were excellent: not overwhelming in number and nicely laid out.There is an excellent restaurant here but we did not have an opportunity to dine there.If you go, also drive down to the Getty Villa, less than 30 minutes away, without traffic. You should get tickets for the Villa online (free) so you can reserve a time to visit. You will pay $15.00 to park but then can get a voucher to park free at the Center (or visa versa) if going on the same day. Both are worth visiting and will take a whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larkette
50,Don't miss this beautiful place!,"Exceptional architecture, very well planned for easy in and out, parking, trams, tours and smart spacial design. Grounds amazing with spectacular views from LA to the Pacific. Variety of art collection is interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rola733
50,Spectacular,Short and simple...this place is unmissable! Love the gardens and the galleries. Such a wonderful way to spend a sunny California day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonmatson
50,The beauty of art,"First of all the entrance is free but the parking is not ' many people arrive there by bicycle or public transportation. the villa is amazing , totally forgot myself there...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Y4069NV
50,Stunning views of LA and a wonderful arts precinct,We were only able to fit in a quick visit here but it was a very impressive gallery and the gardens and buildings are amazing. A definate highlight of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtapestry
50,Beautiful Museum,"This is one of my favorite museums in L.A., The art is great of course , but I also love the architecture tour and the garden even the cafeteria is great lots of dining options. Great way to spend a day and there's even free umbrellas on rainy days and craft area for kids. Great views of the city and the famous 405 freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603lailar
50,"Art, atmosphere and great views","I have visited LA three times and finally got to the Getty Centre and it did not disappoint! We loved the exhibitions, the gardens and the great views! The buildings were fantastic and it was a true highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frostygirl1
50,Magnificent,"Art, architecture, and such gorgeous gardens. I can't wait to go again. Plan to spend quite some time. Be sure to take your camera. Pay to park, museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyZ168
50,"The Getty Center Los Angeles, Calif.","High above the 405 freeway sits the J.Paul Getty Center. There is also the J.Paul Getty Villa located in Malibu California on the Pacific Coast Highway.Because of where the Getty Center sits, high above the City of Los Angeles, it commands a view from downtown Los Angeles over Hollywood, Mid Wilshire, West Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and then ending at Santa Monica and the Pacific ocean. The Center is constructed with architectural grace and beauty with it's exterior gleaming in white alabaster marble throughout the facility. With the Centers beautifully designed garden and talented artistic garden personnel, changing plants seasonally and with it's exquisite lawns, trees and shrubs. One can sit peacefully with the bustling city far below, The Getty Center can feel like you are in another country when it's just minutes away. But the other story is it's wonderful galleries and special exhibits scheduled throughout the year as well as special screenings held in the evenings. This is surely something every tourist and Angelo's should not miss for they will be missing one of L.A.'s most treasured sites all made possible free of charge from the J. Paul Getty Foundation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianL368
50,Stunning architecture. A peaceful getaway from hectic LA.,"A haven in the midst of central LA. Off of the 5 it is a quiet tram ride to an oasis of viewing beautiful pieces of art. The views are inspiring. Landscaping is an added benefit. LA has much to offer but The Getty is a lifetime memory. The gift shop has beautiful one of a kind gifts such as scarves, pen and ink sets and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psycheinc
50,Art Heaven,"So many art pieces, so little time. Wish I had more time to explore here. Allow for ample time to see all of the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N9553ZKlisam
50,Fantastic afternoon!,"I visited the Getty in 2001 so I was excited to return a few weeks ago with my dad. Parking has gotten better (underground, costs $15) and the tram was pretty quick.We got food from the cafe that overlooks LA and had decent sandwiches.The Getty has all sorts of art, from modern photography to the Hellenistic World exhibition (I believe this has ended now) and everything in between. It's a truly great collection without being too much to take in during one visit (as one might find the Louvre or MET or British Museum).The garden was just as lovely as I remembered. And the views of Los Angeles are stunning. Well worth the visit given that it's only really parking that you have to pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,Getty visist,Excellent place to spend and few hours and have lunch! The exhibits are awesome and this is a kid friendly museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisagE6502IN
50,Beyond Any Museum I've Experienced,"I believe this is the largest dollar amount contract awarded to an architecture firm. The Getty Center cost nearly $1 Billion to construct. Richard Maier (sp.) was the architect and the facility is stunning. Many activities are scheduled throughout the day and you can't go wrong on any of them. The architecture tour is particularly interesting. Exhibits change frequently, but the appeal of the Getty is its opulence. Everyone should visit it at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757jbr
50,Great views of LA,"If you're looking to get some breathtaking views of LA, enjoy exquisite architecture, as well as see many fine pieces of art then this is definitely a place you should stop in. Parking is relatively cheap ($15) and is totally worth it as you can literally spend over half a day here. Much to see as far as the art, architecture and views are concerned. Definitely bring a camera with a lot of storage as I had to delete some older items to snap some pics (luckily I make regular backups). The lift was also really cool as you get to see some nice views while you are on your way up to the Getty Center. The staff was really nice and friendly and even pointed out some of the more pristine pieces. All in all this was definitely a place I would visit again in the future; I didn't get to see all of it as I was so caught up in reading up on the art. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959estevang
50,Amazing place to spend a day,Los Angeles has many top rated museums but my favorite is the Getty. The museum is free but you do pay for parking. The fun begins with a train ride from the parking lot to the top of a cliff where the Getty awaits you. There are several buildings to go through and the architecture is spectacular. The lower gardens are grand and you really need to take time to walk them. The exhibits are are world class and there is always something new to see. This museum is a must see when you come to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5185ENjs
50,Great Museum,The museum is in a great setting with fabulous views from the gardens. It's a small enough museum that you can see pretty much everything before museum fatigue sets in. It was a great way to spend a day with friends visiting from out of town. I can't wait to go back with my kids (ages 4-16 and I will take all of them). Definitely watch the introductory video when you get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieandjeffw
30,Boring to me unless exhibit is cool.,"I thought it was very old and not that interesting unless the exhibit that is going on is worth it, I would say pass. But is you like old stuff and antiques, check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelinmd
50,What an amazing legacy to Los Angeles,"After messing up one trip on the bus to this centre we finally got there. If using the metro bus then go right to the end of the line to the veterans ctr and change to another bus that will drop you outside the museumThe entrance is via a little train as its high up on a hillside. Its free to enter and there are several exhibition halls some free art classes were offered so if interested you should look online and pre book so you know when to go. There are several shops in the buildings offering similar fare but with a link to the buildings exhibition. There is a cloak room where you can leave your coats and bags with an attendant and there are a few places to have a snack and coffee. Toilets as is the whole complex is spotless. The exhibitions were very interesting, I personally would have liked to see some more modern work but that's the luck of the draw as to what's on at the time. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and would go again if in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZBunny
50,Great Museum that is free to enter,We took in various exhibition and garden tours and enjoyed a full day at the Getty Center. So much to see and do that one day isn't sufficient to do it justice. The docents were great and everything is well organized and sign posted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edbrown1
50,One of LA's great locations,"This isn't the greatest art collection in the world or even in LA but the Center itself is as much of an attraction. Great vista views to the ocean and the downtown. It also has great outdoor spaces to rest and relax. You can go in the afternoon, see the art, walk the gardens outside, have lunch or a picnic and even stay for some of the concerts they have in early evening. Truly one of the greatest LA locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation
50,Delightful Repast,"Make reservations and enjoy a magestic view from a window side table overlooking endless vistas. Start with Aperol and Prosecco to set a sunny mood then enjoy some crab cakes with julienned mangos and delightful charcuterie platter. The charming waiter tried to entice us to share a wee dessert sampling, but we were too full!Then, stroll around the grounds, admire the numerous gardens and sculptures then concentrate on one pavilion as this place is huge! Return visit required!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DueLupiMeaford
50,Great Museum and Spectacular Location,"The Getty is an art museum that is the right size. If you have ever been overwhelmed by the size of a collection, then I think you will enjoy the Getty. A great variety of art and an unusual and spectacular garden. The architecture is worth the trip. The price is right because the museum is free, just pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7547RJjohnm
50,Gem!,"This architectural beauty is a gem of a museum! With outdoor gardens including tropical plants (bird of paradise) as well as a comprehensive collection of succulents, there was something for everyone in our party. Outdoor sculptures ornamented the arrival space, taking the tram up the hill to the main building provided amazing views of the LA hills. Once at the main exhibition halls, there were plentiful wings of art on display including, but by no means limited to, American, European, and Egyptian styles spanning a multitude of periods. There is also a cozy reading room where one can read about design, décor, etc.- quite a nice respite from walking fatigue. Outdoor stalls dot the landscape, as well as a cafeteria-style eatery, and another ""fancier"" restaurant with wait-service. This is a great place to spend an entire day, at an easy and do-able pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliveolives
50,Two for the price of one,"This was our first visit to LA and a friend highly recommended the Getty Center. She was right. We got there on the last day of the bronze sculpture exhibit, which was outstanding. The Center provides iPods that are pre-loaded with audio narrations of many exhibits, although not every exhibit is narrated. You can easily spend an entire day or more at the Center -- there's just so much to see. The buildings are very modern and the grounds provide spectacular views of Los Angeles from many different elevations and angles.Another nice feature is that by paying the parking fee, you get to visit the Getty Villa and park for free there. The Villa is only a few miles away, and I would highly recommend visiting it also.There are several places to eat within the Getty Center, including a restaurant, although one of these -- a cafeteria-style eating place -- is pretty well hidden. The facility is built on a hillside, so be prepared to walk up and down steps and steep slopes, although there are also elevators.My recommendation is to get to the Getty Center as soon as it opens, spend an entire day there, and try to get to the Getty Villa if you have time before it closes, although I don't know if the 2 for 1 parking deal is honored for visits on consecutive days. Plan on eating lunch there. The food is good and is not unreasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnny1947
40,Best free attraction ever,Located out of town it will cost around $20 to get there from Hollywood but once there definitely worth it. Entrance fee is free. Too much to see in one day. Lots of art and unusual historic exhibitions including hundreds of years old manuscripts. Great day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871frankg
50,One of my favorite places in the world!,"I love the Getty Center. The art is comprehensive, but not a world-class collection. The views and location though, are fantastic. I cannot recommend it enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202ajs
40,What a gem in the big city!,"My day at the Getty was so nice as they have the parking and tram to the museum well organized and run. I enjoyed the trip to the top in the very clean tram. Once there, take time to walk around and enjoy the views of the city. The exhibits were well displayed, signed and organized. The special exhibit about historical foods was interesting, informative, and made me hungry. Don't miss the garden whatever you do. Very tranquil and a variety of plants, trees, and water features. Check out the Getty Villa in Malibu the same day if you can. It is not that far of a drive, but your parking is paid if you attend on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgloid
50,Amazing place to visit,Highly recommend for people who likes art and architectual. Free entrance but there is fee for parking. The audio tour is free and will give you inside story of those famous art. We were there for six hours and just barely covered some ground. I was told the exhibition always change and would like to visit here again next year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanje1
40,Never discount what might interest you!,"Educational, interesting and pretty. Free guided tours, gardens, architecture and ors. We visited for 3 hours, would have liked to stay longer! Roman artifacts, culture, architecture presented in a way that enabled us to step back in time and soak up the experience offered. $15 parking on site, no complaints!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YSR4509
50,WONDERFUL ART AND GROUNDS,"We traveled with friends to the Getty to view the art. What an interesting and entertaining venue. All types of art, paintings, photos, sculptures, carvings and more. Beautiful grounds which were clean and well maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck8700
50,Go for the gardens,The gardens are spectacular and worthy of the trip up the hill. Even if you're not an art lover you'll enjoy the expansive views of LA below you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916cavej
50,Must see LA!,"Traveling on a train(!), a stroll in a magical garden, throwing coins in the enormous water sculpture in the middle of such garden, a beautiful view of Los Angeles, a grassy lawn to sit and watch the clouds, a place to eat some really good fries...oh, and did I mention great art? Even if looking at paintings do not appeal to you, this is a fantastic place to visit in Los Angeles. Look for fossilized foliage in the Italian marble, have a great burger in their cafeteria. $15 for parking & free admission is well worth it. ProTip: Go to the customer service desk and pick up free (!) tickets to the Getty Center in Malibu while you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911Traveler007
50,Everyone already knows this is a don't miss in LA,Adding my voice to the chorus. Don't miss this if you visit LA. Go on the Architecture Tour! It is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaR993
40,Good Collection of Art from Ancient Greek & Roman World,"We visited the Getty Villa as the Getty Center was not opened (close on Mondays). The Getty Villa has art pieces from the ancient Greek and Roman world dating from 6,500 BC to AD 400, and comprises galleries organised by themes. Entry is free but there is a parking fee of US$15. Definitely worth a half day visit if visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannychan_sg
50,Amazing. Just amazing.,"One of the best museums in the world. One room has the famous Ban Gogh Irises plus a Manet, Monet, Pissaro amongst others. Great docent tours and the outside gardens host an incredible view of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanneromo
50,A MUST!,"There's not much I can say about the Getty Center that hasn't already been said but I will say if you're in LA ...... you MUST go!!Where else in the world will you get so much for a mere $15 parking fee??!! In one room alone we had the pleasure of seeing original paintings by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Rembrant, Monet & Picaso to name just a few!If you're not into art, enjoy the amazing landscaping, beautiful grounds and stunning architecture. Lots of places to eat too - if a little expensive - or take a picnic and settle down and enjoy the breath-taking views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cerris1
50,4 amazing attractions in one locale!!!!,"This was my second trip to the Getty. My first visit was a quick trip to the Getty 10 years ago. I have been espousing the ""wowness"" of the Getty for years to my girlfriend. We finally made it a week ago.I mentioned in the header it is comprised of four attractions. The first, and by far, the most recognized is a world class art museum. Van Gogh's Irises, up close and personal, amazing!!! Rembrandt, Monet, etc... for an admission price of free.... pretty impressive gallery line up!!! (parking is $15.00.)The second gem that the Getty offers is the architecture. The angles and the use of windows to capture light is beyond impressive!!The formal gardens and the water features (unfortunately, the vast majority of h2o features were not operating due to drought.... bummer!!!) are amazing.I saved the best for last. If there is a more impressive vista point in the LA basin, I am not aware of it??!! The Getty was constructed on top of a modest mountain. There, you have views of Malibu and the Pacific, downtown LA and Hollywood. Views that will take your breath away!!! I must admit, we were there on a ""chamber of commerce"" weather day, not a cloud in the sky with limitless views.So, if business or travel takes you to LA, put the Getty on a must see bucket list!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rghjunior
50,Beautiful,Very nice place to see Greek artifacts. The entire Villa was beautiful and the gardens were refreshing. Plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshab379
40,Well Worth the Trip,"As you walk up to the main entrance you're welcomed by a stunning entrance that is beautiful to behold. The museum is broken up into four main pavilions and one for special exhibits. There are works of art spanning from the 1600s to art created after the 1800s. The center for photography has an amazing collection of images. In addition to the beautiful works of art, there are numerous gardens througjt out the grounds. You will also be captivated by the stunning views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psedillo
50,Absolute Perfection - A must see,This is a gorgeous place to visit and has a stunning collection of art. It also has excellent food at the cafe and beautiful gardens. It is free except for the parking $15 and has a small tram to take you from the car park to the gallery. I wish I had gone for the whole day as it is a most divine place and has amazing views. You can also visit the Getty Villa using the same parking ticket in the same day but to go there you need to book in a time. I wish I had spent more time here and not bothered to go to LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strategicallyb
50,Art on the mountain,"The Getty Center is a wonderful attraction for an person, couple, or family. You pay $15 to park and ride the tram up the side of the mountain to the Center, which is free. For $15 you are treated to a huge collection of art from some of the world's best. Picasso, Rembrant, Van Gogh, Bernini, Ensor, and many, many more. I took the one hour tour with a guide and was treated to some of the Center's best works with insight from an expert. And where you need to take a break from the art, walk outside and take in the breath-taking views of the city and ocean down below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradR528
50,Despicable Los Angels! We've got it All!,"I trip to Los Angeles is not complete if you don't visit our incredible Getty Center Museum. You will be awe-struck by the setting and whether you visit to see a specific exhibition, a lecture or a music/theatre piece you will leave knowing that you must return again and again and again . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todde914
50,Getty Center,"Incredible campus, even if the kids don't like art. It's worth the trip just to see the gardens and view of the valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634jesseb
50,Just Go There,"It's beautiful, its fun, its an amazing space. Well worth a visit- make time to go there when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBSH
50,"Great museum, amazing location","Free admission, $15 parking fee. A best buy in LA. The buildings and grounds are an attraction unto themselves. Add to that, world class art works and this is a must see for anyone who loves art. Also see the Getty Villa in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnny007
30,"Pretty, but a little bare.","I was a bit underwhelmed by this one. It's a beautiful house, has some nice exhibits and a great gift shop, but I was a little underwhelmed, especially after visiting the Huntington Library.They do, however, do a great high tea in the afternoon and they have all their ducks in a row when it comes to parking. Those alone are worth the trip - reservations for tea are required, btw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HillaryJohansen
50,Awesome Museum and Grounds,I had not been to the Getty since the year it opened. I throughly enjoyed my whole time there. The Impressionists were impressive to see even though I had seen many impressionists before. The art work throughout the museum is purposefully hung with frames than enhances the art work. The architecture of the entire complex was a delight. The gardens peaceful and beautiful. The Getty is a must see in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbara115de
50,Museums and gardens,"This is a must see for visitors and residents in Los Angeles. The art is medieval to impressionist, the architecture of these spectacular Richard Meier buildings and the gardens a lovely complement to the four marble buildings of the museum itself. They have a great collection of photographs as well.A perfectly fine cafe offers a wide choice of lunch dishes from grill to pizza to sandwiches to full hot meals. Their restaurant is very good. It is a lovely way to spend a day or an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec
50,A must visit,This is the best museum in California and hosts an amazing collection. Great place to have lunch as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mountain88
50,A Must-See,"Your visit begins with a super-cool tram ride up the side of a mountain (watch for deer feeding just feet away, as well as an awesome view of the 405 and Sepulveda Pass). Stepping out of the tram, you're greeted by friendly VSAs and stellar views of the magnificent all-white granite buildings which house artwork and offices. First stop: Visitor's Desk to pick up a map, and then go across the way to get a free audio guide, or join one of the several daily art, architecture or garden tours (all wonderful; some of the docents are outstanding and offer little-known tidbits about J. Paul Getty, the architect, Richard Meier, and Robert Irwin, creator of the Central Garden). Plan to send several hours here, as in addition to seeing spectacular art (Van Gogh! Rembrandt! - I love the Dutch Masters), you'll want time to have a relaxing lunch at the cafe (lots of good selections) or restaurant (reservations recommended; a little pricey but the service and atmosphere shine), as well as just sit and enjoy the gorgeous views of the city and the lovely gardens. Parking is $15; a small price to pay to access this awe-inspiring place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelgirl90049
40,Grand,A great range of art works for all types of interests. The shuttle ride up was lots of fun and the cafe had a great range of choices. The kids loved the outdoor garden. The buildings and surroundings were grand and a work of art themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diamonds321
50,Just the buildings and the view are worth the visit.,"The art is almost secondary to the gorgeous grounds and the buildings. Fantastic hill top location with views of the city and the ocean. I just loved ""being"" there. And there is some great art too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chl0e48
50,Added and suggested information,"Hello all! Yes, admission is free. However, parking fee is $15.00 before 4 p.m., $10.00 after. I suggest you eat before you arrive. Your Getty experience should begin while driving north on Interstate 405. Look straight ahead slightly to the left up on top of the hill. That beautiful architectural masterpiece is waiting for you. You see, the building is art all on it's own. Upon arrival you'll be directed into the underground parking structure. Please remember your parking location. Make your way to the elevator lobby and up to ground level where you will catch a tram that will take you up the hill to the Getty center. Take time to admire the exterior surroundings. Eventually, you will get to the beauty of the interiors. Head towards the visitor center and begin you official tour (s). Also, look for the free docent lead tour. Regardless of which building you choose to begin your tour, I highly suggest you end the day in the garden. Then find a spot on the hilly grass area which borders some the buildings foundation. Stop off at the eateries on your way out just for future reference. Hope you enjoy, take care.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GilPico
50,If You're American this is a must see!,"I'm not a cryer. Not that there is anything wrong with it. However, placed in front of Van Gogh's Irises the tears welled up from emotion.This is an incredible, permanent, collection of artists. The rotating exhibits have been phenomenal every time I've attended.Little Cafe and Restaurant for a perfect date.Walk through the gardens and take a moment to see all of Los Angeles.Make time for the Getty - know how much it will cost to park ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monica_Riehl
50,Beautiful art and grounds,"This is a wonderful place to spend the day looking at beautiful art and exhibits, it is not child oriented but good for teens and up to gain some culture in the everyday LA race.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiel534
50,Most amazing museum in Southern California,"This is a spectacular museum, and probably the best on the west coast. You should visit this museum and its sister museum, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3106XUsusanh
50,Just Amazing,"Costing several billion dollars to build and stock, it is an amazing museum. The quality of the art and artifacts, the building, the views and architecture is outstanding. Extremely enjoyable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiiOno
50,Excellent in Every Respect,"My advice to my good friends and colleagues when visiting a world class museums is to take them slowly and in deliberate chunks. The Getty Centre is a perfect example. Just viewing the gardens and the grounds could be an entire visit on its own. At my last visit, this is exactly what I did. I went with a very knowledgeable friend who knew the detailed history of the construction of the site, and it was so riveting that I felt that I had had my fill for that trip. Of course we couldn't resist visiting the gardens, and my friend ended up buying a book on the gardens there to find inspiration for his own gardens not too far away. I see 5-10 more visits in my life time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbilmer
40,Great architecture but contents not my favorite,"What a wonderful building, site, and complex. Architecture is great. Cafe and amenities are good. Flow and display is well done. My disappointment was in the museum contents. Lots of 16th-18th century stuff that I'm not interested in. I like Impressionist and after, and there were a few good pieces but not much. I would recommend anyone take a visit nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoBuoy
40,Great facilities,Magnificent facilities and the view is wonderful. Traveling shows are well presented. Basic art collection is so so but expertly mounted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1063_12
50,A must for visitors and residents,"We went here for a special exhibit on Greek Bronzes, and had a wonderful lunch at the restaurant. Nice day with excellent views to the ocean and mountains. A lovely place to visit on a warm sunny clear day for excellent views of LA. The art is very nice and quite extensive up to the modern era. Come here for classical art and the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russzVanNuys
50,Breathtaking,"Not your typical museum, you go from one building to another to see the pieces and god forbid if you get too close to any pieces, there are people that are quick to tell you to get back, they don't want you to breath on the pieces but considering everything, I would say that's probably a good thing. The only bummer is the parking..takes forever to find a place and then you have to stand in a Que to ride the trolly up the hill..the Que is in the open and, it seems, it a major wind tunnel, where you are praying for that tram to hurry up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandamZ5928HD
50,Beautiful day at the Getty,What a great venue! Had a nice day. Love the exhibits. Didn't have too wait too long. Not a lot of traffic that day which made it a breeze to get to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logandf
50,Definitive L.A.,"I am so lucky to live in a city hosting one of the great museums of the world. And lucky me, living and working a mere minutes away. From it's outstanding permanent collection to it's one-of-a-kind exhibitions, it marvels with each visit. On the grounds, a world-class restaurant to accent the best view in Los Angeles. Hundreds of thousands must pass by each week on one of the busiest thoroughfares in the entire country. I wonder how many have invested the time to enjoy this gift to the senses. I hear new languages being spoken on each of our visits, so it must be a hit with the vacationing crowd. I would urge Angelenos who have not made it here yet to get thee to the Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tgr57
40,The Getty Centre,"We were not disappointed by the views, or the art. We arrived about 11am, there was a queue for the tram which takes you from the car park up to the centre. this seems to be a bottle neck but you can choose to walk, it is about 20 minutes. We didn't as it was a very hot day. The art is as breathtaking as the views. Sculptures are beautifully placed and there is so much to see one visit is not enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyc36

40,Looking for a Lovely few hours?,"If you have a few hours to spend... And you want a place to escape to, whether you're a tourist or you make LA your home....come on up to the Getty. You start your journey with a little train traversing up the mountain while enjoying a spectacular view. Upon arrival, you exit and feel yourself transported to somewhere magical. A tour is recommended...garden, exterior...whatever your interest. The Getty is one of our major attractions in Los Angeles. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507bethanyf
30,"Good - better than average, less than great....","I loved the old/original Getty in Malibu; I was there the last day they were open; several months later, the Monstrosity on the hill was built = everything Getty hated.From my understanding, John Paul Getty built the original - a replica of one of the houses destroyed in Pompeii - to allow the normal person to experience art up close and personal, in an intimate, visiting-your-friend kind of setting. It was lovely - a pace to escape the madness of LA.The new Getty on the hill overlooking the 405 - has grown on me - I no longer hate it, but....I don't love it.One has to pay ~$20 to park for a typical visit - then wait for the tram - or it's about a 20 minute walk uphill (I prefer to tram it up/walk back down) - once you are at the top, the views, depending on smog, can be spectacular. The gardens are beautiful. The original collections are good. Their specials can be spectacular. There is usually tons of tourists and it doesn't have the charm and sophistication which the old one had. Side note: The Old Getty is now back open and it has lost it's charm and I don't go there very often, only when people are in town. You do have to book old Getty in advance due to limited parking.Getty on the Hill is great to show out-of-towners that LA does have some culture and views, on a good day, is worth it. Choose a day after it's rained for clearest views.. I have also taken many dates there- you can see if they like art, how they react to crowds, and sit on patio, chat and relax.Worth checking out - but expect to pay a price for parking and endure crowds on the weekend/during summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

50,What a surprise,"To be honest, none of us would have thought about going to a museum/gallery during our vacation, but the high rating on tripadvisor kept us interested... and we were so glad we did. Incredible views, great architecture and the chance to see some masterpieces in real life. One of our biggest suprises ever.

50,A must in LA,This museum is amazing. You need to make the small trip when in L.A.. Entry is free if you pay 15$ parking. If you come by Uber or cab it is free. The views over L.A. are out of this world and the artworks you can see are worth it. We will go back. You can also bring lunch and pick-nick in the great gardens. The cafe serves good food. You will not be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpmessier
50,We went to see the Ancient Bronzes,"We visited Getty Centre on a glorious day at the end of October. We went specifically to the special display of ancient bronzes, these were very, very impressive but I think may no longer be showing. However, we also saw the photography, the contemporary Japanese and Post War Shadows that we also enjoyable. The views across Los Angeles to downtown and to the sea are spectacular and access is as easy as it is anywhere in LA with free entry (parking is $15). Also the cactus gardens and other gardens are worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydneysida

Definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susieh1015

Parking is $15 for a free museum, tram ride up the side of little mountain to the top. Views of the Pacific, LA, mountains. Art was not as impressive as expected but still makes for nice outing to see the building, gardens, check out the exhibits and enjoy nice views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgomez2468
50,World class at its best!,"This museum is an absolute must. They have collections for every aficionado -the masters, decorative arts, sculpture, photography, contemporary arts, and everything in between! The beautiful buildings and gardens are worth it in and of themselves. All for free! Do not forget to make reservations at The Restaurant and be treated to an amazing view coupled with extraordinary food and service -the starter of liver mousse was out of this world delicious! It's not cheap, but splurge anyway, you will be glad you did. As locals, it should go without saying, but we will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheersToLife

30,Nice Building with Great Views,"If you are expecting only original art, don't go here. The collection contains many copies of works, possibly made as practice pieces for the works that they have conserved.If you want to enjoy a tram ride that goes from the parking garage up the hill and then enjoy the buildings with their stunning views, then this is fun.Relatively expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/977he

50,Don't miss this if you're in LA!,"Definitely not to be missed. Even if you are not an art lover, the architecture and sheer views are worth the visit.

The special exhibits, are always wonderful, as they concentrate on either one artist or a theme. The grounds are exemplary. Walking in the gardens is so peaceful. The landscaping is breath-taking. I've always said I want to go up there and just sit in the gardens and breathe in the peace and tranquility. I've never done that, so far, but one day I hope that dream comes true. The restaurant is exceptional and the food and service are first rate. It's a rewarding visit culturally and a feast for the eyes. See it if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoloC167

40,I wouldnt say its fantastic but its pretty great that you can spend a whole day,"To be air, it was at a rush (about 3-4 hours there), to be honest you need 5hrs and above. The queue is pretty long so watch out especially the queue for the monorail (the only way in and out, i wonder what would they do in the event of an accident or incident)the galleries and security are screwed with some asking you to take pictures, some dont give a damn whether you do or not, and some are vultures that would even want to check your phone for pictures.Be very aware its closed on monday. I asked my uber driver to detour to santa monica beach when i mistakenly went on a monday.But there is nothing entertaining as in a play or visually stimulating, but its great for people who like the arts, sculpture and still life.The art is fantastic and there are endless galleries with a maze of rooms (mainly about christian art), but its fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackLin84
50,Getty was Great!,We spent a day at the Getty and just loved it. Fabulous site and we took the Garden Tour.

50,Incredible art/architecture,This museum is really a must see if coming to LA. Really awesome architecture and 360 degree views of LA. The art exhibits are grouped in such a way to compare and see the contrast between artists. The bronze exhibit was very interesting. The exhibit features pieces that were recovered from the ocean floor after a shipwreck was discovered. The restaurant was really good and the grounds are immaculate. Definitely going back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derikl2013

40,Worth the visit but a long taxi ride,"After our flight from Melbourne we were wanting to visit the Getty. The concierge advised us that public transport was impractical, so we got a cab. $95.00 later, including tip, we arrived. The views are great and the museum good, but after visiting Europe and the Musee D'Orsay plus the Louvre we found it a bit underwhelming.We had booked a tour of the amazing Villa but when presenting at the Information Desk found that the Villa was about 20 kms away. Another $95.00 taxi back home to our hotel. OK, but wouldn't do it again. On our stopover when departing L.A ,for $1.00 we went to Santa Monica....Wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wengenbound

50,THE FOOD IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE ART,"Since the museum itself has probably been reviewed thousands of times, I would just like to address the cafeteria. My friend and I arrived around lunch time, on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. There are several distinctly different lines leading to the various food choices. At the entrance to each line is a stand-up menu, so there's no guessing when you reach the server. I opted for the Jerk Chicken, with rice and ""blistered"" broccoli. Never having heard the expression ""blistered"" used to describe a vegetable, I asked the charming young server what it meant. He not only told me the meaning, he even told me how to cook it myself. Well, the entire dish was really delicious, although I would warn anyone thinking of trying it to be aware that the Jerk Chicken is very spicy. I happen to love hot foods of all sorts, but none of my friends can tolerate it. That's just a word to the wise. Now, my friend ordered a taco salad. Her server asked her which kind of meat she wanted - pork, chicken or beef - and she chose beef. The posted price of the salad was $10.95, but she was charged $16.95 for it. The Cashier had to explain that it was the meat that boosted the price. Perhaps my friend missed that on the menu, but somehow, it should have been made clearer. Her salad, by the way, was also delicious. If you figure in the cost of parking, $15, that brings each of our lunches up another $7.50. Not cheap, but not outrageous, either. The setting itself is worth everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisW536
50,Don't miss the Getty,"This is great place to visit with family- there is a dedicated children's area and something interesting for kids of all ages. I am a local, but I visit the Getty an average of 4 times a year, not just for the exhibits but also for the tranquil and relaxing atmosphere in the gardens. It is free to visit, but you have to pay for parking. No worries; it is easily accessible by public transportation. The cafe serves delicious food, but there's a picnic area if you don't want to eat there. If you have time, go to the Getty Villa as well to view an excellent display of antiquities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953evem
50,Fun Mid-City Escape!,The traffic is the only bad part about going to the Getty. Once you get past that the views are breath taking and the art ranges to suit a little of everyones taste. I like going here and having a nice picnic with friends. There are not a lot of gems like this in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727eves
50,Don't miss the Getty Center,"Great world art, beautiful setting with fantastic views of the city, beautiful building, free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKO1033
50,Getty Center- a must see.,"We took a private car service to the Getty Center. Be advised that there is an extreme amount of walking from building to building in order to see the exhibits. At times, you have to come out of one building to get to another and if it is a hot day, you will feel it. Obtain an umbrella to keep the sun off. The exhibits were diverse. Note: The Food Court is very expensive. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich on wheat was $4.98, bring your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ladyaries100
40,It's all about the architecture and the view,"The buildings and grounds are beautiful. Very well done and the views of the city are stunning. The art is really good, but I've never really looked at the art except for special exhibits, which they ave all the time. Think you still need to reserve parking if you are going to drive. If you go early you can do the Getty Villa on the same day as well and they honor your reservation there. The Getty Villa is in Malibu and also worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philetos
50,"I absolutely love this place, both artistic and romantic. gorgeous sunset!","It's modern, stylish, filled with lots of fine art, and most importantly, it has a breath-taking romantic view.

Four huge galleries of art covering a wide range of ages and styles, we only had time to visit the West Pavilion. The artworks are beautifully displayed in large airy rooms.There are several options for eating at the Getty, we just had a snack on the terrace but there's something for everyone.Sadly the trams were out of order the day we visited which meant quite a wait for shuttle buses, though we could have walked had the day not been so hot - and if we'd had the energy!A great place to visit and spend a few hours, and for only $15 per car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisGG1950

50,R.O.I,"Should be at the top of anyone's must see list when visiting L.A. The location and views of the city, the Pacific ocean are by themselves, worth a trip.The scope of their exhibits recommend them as more than just a gallery, museum etc. Print photography, an improving collection of paintings by the masters, sculptures, visiting scholars, workshops etc. Visiting exhibitions are always worth seeing.The museum is free but you need to call to reserve space. Parking is easy but, getting there via the 405 Fwy can be, um, challenging. Definitely also check out the Getty Villa on PCH (about 20 min away).The Getty is a stunning example of what philanthropy can be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadBlake
50,Its not about the collection,"The Getty (Center) is all about the gardens and the views. The architecture is really special especially as one can wander back and forth and never go inside or outside, whatever the case may be. The collection is adequate and great for young students that need to learn about differences in period, style and particular artists. The special programs and exhibits are usually exceptional so that going for a specific exhibition will be very rewarding, but the real joy is just walking around and looking at the views and the gardens that change from season to season. As a native, one really gets to see it best when friends or relatives from out of town visit, but its now easy to park, easy to get up and down and just a delightful way to spend half or a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LewS_11
50,Love The Gardens & Architecture,"The Getty Center is a ""must see"" location on your trip to LA. I also like to visit their original location in Malibu which has been upgraded significantly. The architecture and gardens are spectacular. Not so excited about the art. The restaurant is excellent, but out of at least five visits, the fog has prevented an ocean view. It's a great place to just enjoy the wonderful ocean breeze and relax. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626gaild

50,Tram to art,"The Getty Center not only has a very large collection, the works are housed in architecturally interesting buildings located on a hill overlooking LA and are reached by a tram (or a walk uphill if it's not hot). There is such a diverse array of art from different eras, furniture, etc on display. Plus there is a lovely garden area you can explore and a cactus garden to view (not accessible). You are allowed to take non-flash photos of the art and items on display as long as they are owned by the museum. Plan for at least 3 hours here. We had 3 hours and it was barely enough to get through all the buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAtourist
50,Among the Great Museums of the World,"This place offers the full package -- great art, wonderful architecture, fantastic views, stellar gardens.... Even the food at the cafe was great. There is no need for a long review here -- if you are in LA and have any interest in art or architecture, this is a must-see attraction.A few tips.... 1. We elected to walk from the parking lot to the museum and back -- recommended if you can stand a 1-mile walk up a hill. It was a nice, peaceful 15-minute walk on which we enjoyed the evolving view of the surrounding city as the elevation increased.2. We took the 1-hour ""highlights"" tour upon arriving. This provided a great overview of the buildings and their contents, setting the stage for the next 6 hours of wandering around.3. The audio guide provided great info. I wish we had remembered to bring our own earphones.4. There are lots of places to sit (inside/outside/shade/sun, etc...) and enjoy snacks or just take a load off. There is no need for visitors to exhaust themselves, even during a full day visit.5. Food at the cafe was very good, diverse and a fair value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertR402
50,Mind Blowing,This was not on my list of must sees but so glad I did it. Amazing the size and scale of it. Gardens are gorgeous with fabulous views across LA. Please do yourself the favour and get away from the crazy traffic of LA and head up the hill for some tranquility and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babs2205
50,"Great Art, Great Building, Great Landscape",You can't take it all in one visit... There is too much to see. I recommend that you take a tour or tour. The garden tour is rewarding the the art tours are educational and interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funflowertrips
50,Beautiful place,"Beautiful museum with a rich collection, there's a transfer to take you from the parking lot to the museum. Be ready to spend more than 2 hours here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisOrtizH
50,"Stunning architecture, beautiful art, wonderful views","A great museum experience! The architecture of the center is outstanding as are the views of downtown LA, the mountains, and the ocean off in the distance as it is way up on top of a large hill (but not to worry there is tram to the top). The art collection is very good, nicely displayed, and well worth seeing. Rated very highly by this art museum aficionado.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrising
50,Meaningful...,"To see the great works of legends of the past lay their vision on canvas, iron, marble, or other media always leaves me in amazement!!! A nice place to spend a few hours enjoying these great works of art. On a clear day, have your camera ready for great pics of the ocean view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xelha92
50,Excellent arts plus great view of the city,Only need to pay $15 parking fee for your car. Free tram ride up the hill to the Getty museum. Modern design with beautiful view. Spend at least a few hours. Very relaxing and beautiful view inside and outside. Lots of painting and sculpture for various period in history. Must see for sure. Also outside the view of LA skyline is the best part too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVictorT
50,Art museums should be a solo affair,"Armed with my trusty audio guide, I spent the entire day at the Getty! Besides the enjoying art collection, the Getty also has beautifully landscaped grounds for you to enjoy the outdoors, as well as check out the view from the top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82chewyb
50,great art collection,This Center is free. All you pay is a $15 parking fee that is good here and the Getty Villa which is also free.The building design is very unusual and pretty. There is a free audio guide that has many different tours. We took the highlight tour that was a good overview of all the art on display and still spent a couple of hours there. There is so much on display you would have to go back many times to see everything. The paintings are by some of the most famous artist in history starting in the 1500's to the 1900's. There is a good sculpture collection too up to modern style.There is food available here but be prepared to spend a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waikoloa01
50,Go for the art and go for the architecture,"The building itself, and gardens are a work of art. We were disappointed, but understanding that due to the drought all but one of the garden's water features are turned off. Allow many hours to see the whole collection. We concentrated on the buildings and just sampled the collections. Had a wonderful day. Museum is free. Parking is $15 unless you leave within an hour. We arrived shortly after opening on a weekday. Many classes of schoolchildren were about, but didn't hamper our experience. Cafe is great, very innovative dishes, but VERY expensive, we spent $42 on salads, drinks (non-alcoholic) and a shared dessert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrewsMom
50,Unique place to visit,This is another Los Angeles gem. Take time to visit this unique property- It has something for everybody- Do not leave with out checking it out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754cathyn

40,beautiful views!,"This is a very interesting and fun place to visit. The free monorail takes you up to the top where the museum and gardens are. Beautiful views and botanical gardens outside, and gorgeous artworks inside. There is a good permanent photography exhibit and usually a few great traveling shows for temporary viewing. For example, my last visit was to check out a Turner painting exhibit, so wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twilight26
50,"Both architecture, exhibitions and view of LA.","Both architecture, exhibitions and view of LA makes it worth a visit.We drove an RV and luckily we arrived early since they do not have much space for large vehicles.Our boys were 8 and 14 but both enjoyed half a day there. You can borrow and iphone with GettyGuide that is videos and audio recordings. You just enter the numbers by the art work.Admission is even free but parking was $15 (RV paid only car price)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758andersm
50,Stunning Architecture + Views!,"This is a ""must see"" art center--you won't be disappointed...the architecture rivals the art that the beautiful buildings contain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taratree
50,"Wonderful Art, Views and Food",This is an amazing complex well worth a visit and offers multiple ways to spend your time enjoying you time there. My son and I started with the restaurant and had an elegant three course meal with wine pairings that was great. Pricey but really not for the value and was an unexpected pleasure. The exhibits are interesting and include some that change. The gardens and views are beautiful and relaxing. We arrived via bus on a private tour. There was a fee for our bus but there was no charge for the museum. I understand there is a fee to park private cars but no other charge unless one wants to eat or drink at some point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEA830
50,Beautiful,The Getty villa was absolutely stunning and full of beautiful art. Its an awesome site to visit and the only cost is for parking. The only downside is all of the water features are not functioning due to the drought here in California. I totally understand but feel it takes away a bit from the experience. I will totally go back again when the water features are operational!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniedE5983ZO
50,How can anyone not rate this a 5* attraction?,"We travelled to the Getty expecting the sublime - and we were not disappointed.Fully deserves its World Class status - both for the architecture of the Buildings, its terrific situation and also but not least the sheer quality of the Exhibits.Particularly liked the various rooms re-created in the French style.TIP TO OTHER VISITORS.Do make sure that if you are travelling by car using GPS - you set the right co-ordinates into the GPS. In our first attempt we ended up in a cul-de-sac in a very nice neighbourhood near to the Getty - next to a sign saying ""If you are looking for the Getty - recode your GPS with xxxxx.So lots of others have made the same mistake.Takes nearly 15 minutes to find where you need to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,Once in a lifetime cultural experience.,"The Getty Centre is an architectural marvel, which you can discover on the 46 min guided tour; highly recommended since it takes you to special areas not normally used by the public. The tour also covers the history of the Centre and the various sections such as research and conservation.The artwork and sculptures come from many of the masters (Monet, Picasso, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Van Gogh). It is just jaw-dropping to see so many iconic works in one place. I just do not have space to convey the importance of this great museum to the culture of LA. Guaranteed to be a winner.There is parking but you have to get their own train uphill to the centre. I visited from Australia and had to catch ride share to and from the Getty, because public transport is practically useless in LA.Lots to see with 5 galleries/buildings plus stacks of incredible sculptures all around the buildings. There is an audio tour but it slows you down a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsN3015EP
50,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"Free tickets online, wonderful exhibits, great architectural tour, nice cafe. What else can you ask for? ...ok, maybe working fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norsketech
50,Supremely Incredible,"It's worth visiting just for the view - high atop LA. But there is so much more - several modern buildings with incredible collections of art. The grounds are so beautiful - it feels like an ultra-modern college campus. Visited with children ages 11 and 9. Was even interesting for them. I probably could have spent a few days there, but with kids I'd suggest a few hours. Plenty of dining options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariapG7936ZT
50,A Must See When You Come To Los Angeles!,We go to the Getty at least 1 a year. They always have breathtaking exhibits! This museum takes a lot of pride in their professionalism and appearance. I would go on a week day if you can to avoid the weekend crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamS7088TO
40,Fantastic views fantastic buildings,"Fantastic buildings, great views when LA. Is clear. Best viewed from upstairs balcony.Varied collections of art. Exhibitions are usually the best. Highlight for mr Monet haystacks in winter. Don't forget the statues from outside. Do a tour. Free and leave regularly. Time spent here 10.30 to 2 which included a lunch rest but that was a brief walk through the whole collection. If you are an art buff you would need much longer.Get there early at the weekends. We went in the morning but by the afternoon when we were leaving there were crowds waiting for the train.High on the ridge so from car park everyone catches a little train to the top. Extremely well organised.Plenty of people on hand to ask questions.Gardens are unusual and beautiful varying from desert garden to a manicured sections. Umbrellas are provided for rain or sunshine heat. Lower on the hill.Different eating standards so you get a cafeteria meal or a more up market meal off the forecourt where you arrive. Plenty of coffee places to rest. Good views from eating places. Reasonably price meals.Difficult to get to The Getty as the local call it, if you don't have a car. There is a local bus but the locals can't tell you which bus. We took public transport to as close as we could get and then walked (too far - don't recommend that option) Taxii the way to go. Plenty of taxis to get back as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593susiev
50,Gob smacking,"Fantastic views, mouth watering exhibits just not enough time to see everything. Excellent disabled facilities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64allen
50,What a wonderful place to spend a day,This is a must see for anyone visiting Los Angeles. What a beautiful building located on the hills above Los Angeles with great views of the city. Plenty of parking with a complimentary shuttle to the top and best of all this is all free. We could not believe that there is such a great attraction that has complimentary entry. The paintings and sculptures were fantastic and the gardens are gorgeous. I would recommend this as a must see for visitors to Los Angeles and locals alike. We also had lunch at the restaurant which was really nice. Great service and good selections on the menu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mouse037
50,Museum,"Questions for you.. Love art? Enjoy beautiful Gardens? Views of LA and Santa Monica coast? What about food and dining? It is all at Getty Art Museum. Find what you like and enjoy.

You will too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheIsofAll
50,Always fun to visit,"My family and I have been visiting the Getty about once every 4-6 weeks since it opened. It's a marvelous museum which is a must see when visiting Los Angeles. A fantastic permanent collection coupled with excellent special exhibitions make it a special place to visit. It doesn't matter what is currently ""showing"" just go and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,A museum everyone should visit,"Many of L.A.'s museums have a ""free museum day"" once a month. The Getty Center is free every day of the month. Don't make the mistake of thinking it is somehow a second rate or sub standard affair. This is a world class enjoyable educational experience.Paintings, etchings, books, sculptures, furniture, scrolls and much much more. Even the architecture of the buildings are a work of art. Take advantage of the free Ipod's that provide an audio tour of the exhibits.Parking is right off the San Diego freeway in a private parking garage and it does cost $15 during the day ($10 after 4PM) but that is small price to pay for 3 to 4 hours of enjoyment.So, whether you want to see paintings from 400 years ago or sculptures that are 2000 years old, it is all here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569edr
50,Undiscovered Museum in Los Angeles,"Very elegant, smart museum, with very different arts there, well shown. It is probably my favourite museum in LA, due to the paintings, that are really awesome.The design and architecture of the museum is great, and the views, even better.In the visit, if you want some rest, have a coffee in the cafetería outdoors.The access to the museusm is free, you just have to pay for the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbotma
50,Hidden value in the middle of the city,"This is the richest and largest private foundation that collects art in the world. The J. Paul Getty foundation not only funds the museum and the displays, but also funds research and conservation efforts of antiquities. The center is a must do experience when visiting LA and the US. The permanent exhibits are remarkable examples of the Roman and Greek civilizations. The French and Barouque furniture section is truly extensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada
50,"The Impressionist Room at the Getty has Val Goh. Monet, Renior.","I love the view, the Impressionist paintings, Photography exhibits, and good food and wine, coffee whatever you like.$15 for parking is the only fee. Great to get the audio tour for the backround of the exhibits for best impact.I visit monthly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC

50,This place is beautiful,"From the architect buildings, gardens, art galleries, and beautiful views of Los Angeles, this place is a must-visit place. The cost is free so expect a lot of people. This place is great for taking photographs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingyangs6
40,Essential LA tourist spot,"Been to the Getty Museum on at least four occasions, and definitely foresee more trips in the future.The attraction of the Getty is more than just an amazing art collection; it's a giant complex of galleries and exhibitions, with amazing views of LA.When visiting the Getty, plan for at least a half day on the grounds. The parking lot is a bit hectic, so just be patient.Once above ground, consider the hike up to the top museum area, but there is also a tram, which is fast and convenient.This is one of those must see attractions in LA, and regularly has new exhibitions to go along with their permanent collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannyrogue
50,"Must see art and property, Architectural Blss",The Getty is simply gorgeous and the art on exhibit is always work the visit. The grounds are spectacular as are the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Good Museum with Great LA Views,"I live in LA so have been here many times and often bring out of town guests to Getty Center (not to be confused with Getty Villa which is not at this location and very different.) The Getty Center has great views of LA and the garden is great. Of course, there is great art here, however, we prefer LACMA, and have our memberships there and Skirball (they seem to have the special exhibits.)If you are in LA for a few days, it's worth the trip, preferably on a nice clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneDJ2
50,GO!,"The views alone are worth the visit, not t mention the wonderful and eclectic collections. Special exhibits too. The café is good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
50,"Extraordinary, world-class art museum","This is a place you will remember for the rest of your life. Stunning architecture set on an incredible bluff overlooking Los Angeles. The art ranges from ancient to modern. The galleries are well done. There are many little nooks throughout the buildings to sit and look at art or scenery. The cafe has a lot of options, good food, and not too pricey. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bentonian
50,The restaurant is fabulous,"We went for the wonderful show of ""Ancient Bronzes"" but I think you really must go to the ""Restaurant"". We thought that our two lunches at the restaurant were superb. The restaurant is beautifully situated with wonderful views of Los Angeles, but it is also a culinary delight. The wine list is also excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinB413
40,"Take a day to visit the two Getty museums, since the other has the more visually 'romantic' pieces.","You'll need a few hours. Lots of walking up and over and down, lots of rooms to see, lots of history to consider and absorb. That Getty had the resources and passion to collect and action to finish such a facility is as wondrous as the works housed there. The reliefs and mosaics are incredible: modern puzzles. History buffs will really enjoy it. On a hot day, plan to hydrate well at the multiple cafes/kiosks on site since the extensive multi year renovation. marvel at how much money The Getty Foundation has amassed to be able to offer such a collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akcol
50,Awesome Museum,"Pay for parking only? What a great deal. $15 for admission of three. My two girls had a great time looking at the bronze exhibit, photos, and Loius XIV furniture and tapestries. The tram ride up the hill was breathtaking and beautiful with its views. The museum is currently in water conservation mode so the fountains were not in operation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinB788
40,Great view,Getty center is really really nice place to go. You have an nice view over the city and the art is just stunning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dany260185
20,I did not think it was worth $15 Parking. The works there are average.,"I am jaded by seeing finer works at the Met in NYC and other places. We went there because everyone was talking about it. What we found was expensive parking, a monorail, and more attention paid to the construction of lovely buildings than the selection of artwork installed there. The collections were often haphazardly clustered; and none of the works were what we would call ""major"" pieces of the artists represented. They looked like they selected one of this or that perhaps, at auction so that they could claim they have the artist's work there. Don't waste your time. On a hot day you are routed from building to building- it must be ridiculous in the rain....when LA is lucky enough to get some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodielicious2
40,"Wonderful collection, beautiful area","The Center is beautifully designed and the exhibits were great. The Center is a little hard to navigate and to figure out where some of the exhibits actually are located. The ""orientation"" film in the visitors' center didn't help with that. Also, there is an unfortunate lack of water fountains and restrooms on the upper floors. This necessitates walking (or taking elevator) down to the bottom floor if you need a swallow of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scurrygirl
50,It's totally free!,"The Getty Museum is a jewel in the heart of L.A. It is easily reached by public bus and once there you can enjoy the vast expanse of lawn by taking a picnic lunch and making a complete day of your visit.

50,Artworks within Artwork,"As you embark on the shuttle, you begin to experience art. You rise above the city of angels into a magnificent world of beautiful gardens and buildings that house wonderful artworks that vary with exhibits. If you get there in the afternoon, you can leisurely sip in the art with your eyes for a few hours then come out into the open air on the hilltop and savor the beauty of the sun setting. I felt an indescribable sensation of complete pleasure at the end of my visit which is still lingering in my memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tchenbw
50,A must visit in LA,"This is place is beautiful and neat on so many different levels. Clearly, the collection is wonderful, but I also really like the setting, architecture as well as the gardens. A couple of tips: Upon arrival the tram line can be long, if you are able choose to walk up to the center, it is a fairly easy stroll- take advantage of the free tours, we took three and all three were lead by very knowledgeable, dedicated people. If you are going to do only one, do the garden tour, otherwise you could miss a lot of neat thing.- food and drinks are a bit pricey, so bring your own if you wish, but if one considers that museum is free (except for $15 parking fee), it is still a great deal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleksz
40,The Getty Center: art in a travertine office block,"Perched on a knoll with a panoramic view of Los Angeles (Santa Monica bay to downtown) the Getty Centre is a must see for visitors to Los Angeles. While Richard Meier's travertine office block design is nothing to look at from outside (I can only imagine what Frank Gehry would have conjured on this site), the interior is a delight and you can wonder the well-appointed grounds looking at reflecting pools, intricate botanical arrangements and (of course) the views for hours and not feel remiss if you don't actually look at the art. As far as that goes, the monumental endowment guarantees that every time you go, they will have added some new and interesting pieces. While not quite up to Norton Simon or LACMA levels, the collection is very impressive and the Getty's photograph collection is unparalleled. Admission is free, but you will pay $15 to park your car. If you come on weekend evenings in the summer months, you will most likely see live music and great food in the centre courtyard. All in all, a great excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956tedt
50,A Worthy View,Spectacular view from every angle of the property. A collection of art worth it's reputation. Spend the time wondering through the amazing cactus garden. It's one place in LA you don't want to pass up,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252darlenew
50,"Great exhibits, beautiful setting","The Getty has to be located in one of the most beautiful settings I've ever seen for a museum. Architecturally stunning, it is perched high on a hill overlooking Los Angeles with some great views.The Getty also hosts some wonderful touring exhibits in addition to its permanent collection; it is worth checking to see what is going to be on display before you go. The museum itself is free, though parking is $15 (and there is no free parking within several miles.) They also provide free audio guides to the exhibits.The only real downside is getting there. Since it is located just off I-405, and the traffic on the 405 is pretty horrendous, be prepared and allow yourself plenty of time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/friskycelery
40,Stunning Museum,"Stunning building and glorious views across Los Angeles. Beautiful grounds, and super Bronzes from Europe exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterflyfish13
50,It's a must when in LA,"The Getty is a must when you are in LA. Not only you will see amazing art and that they are constantly having new exhibitions, but it's worth going just for the grounds. It is simply gorgeous! The view is fantastic, the whole place is unbelievable. I used to take my kids there to absorb a little of art and to play around in the water areas, in the grass hills, run around through the gardens. It's all in one place. It's great for all ages. And it is Free! You only need to pay $5 for parking, that's all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilafajl
50,Best value for such an Iconic Atracction,"Entrance is free, just pay for parking and you will enter this Iconic attraction which showcases one of the most spectacular grounds that make you feel your miles away from busy Los Angeles. Bring a picnic and eat at the some of the most beautiful gardens inside. The art collection is above average but the history and the architecture tour is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank
30,Exhausted by the endless steps,This museum offers a great view of Los Angeles and a fine art collection but you have to go up and down interminable steps. It has elevators but they don't take you where you want to go. At the end of the day I was exhausted by the steps which were absolutely pointless. Badly designed museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olgapU6461GY
40,Art at the Getty,The museum is not far from the Universal Studios Hollywood that I bring my guests to this place after a round at the studios. It has a lot of art and painting exhibits from all over the world. The location is superb with a complete view of Los Angeles and its surroundings. It's a the top of the hill and to go there a tram is provided. You can get a lot of pictures up there. They also have a botanical garden with cacti and flowers. There are also restaurants to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chameleon2015
50,Make a Saturday of it,"From whatever direction you come, you have to negotiate the I 405, and it is usually rush hour on that highway, so try go on a Saturday when the traffic can be a bit lighter and the place stays open until 9pm. If it is your first time, don't rush. Go into a gallery, go out into the fresh air, enjoy the views, have a coffee, go to one of the exhibitions (there is usually a fine one in the oft-ignored Research Institute building), visit the garden (a work of art in itself), go into another gallery, have a fine lunch in the restaurant (not cheap, but good) or in the self-service cafe, look at the architecture, examine the texture of the Travertine marble. Ignore the tram if there is a line and walk up. Walk up in any case. The way to enjoy the Getty is to treat the whole thing as an experience rather than just ""visiting a museum"". NB While the museum is free, the parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B172ZRdavidg

50,Excellent Exhibits in a Lovely Museum,"The Getty is a beautiful museum in a beautiful setting. One can visit many times because of the wonderful changing exhibits. We went last Sunday to see the magnificent exhibit, Power and Pathos, Bronze sculpture of the Hellenistic period. It is there until November 1, 2015. We also saw a thought provoking film,"" Things Left Behind,""on an art exhibit in Vancouver of articles of clothing and items from Hiroshima. Whenever one goes to the museum, there is something new to see; or one can come to review the permanent collections or just to enjoy the environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IleneT_18
40,Greek inspiration,The art here is outstanding and we went to the second location at Pacific Palisades - the setting of a Greek villa (transition mansion) make it spectacular. Much to see - don't miss the unique collections.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slc37918
40,A modern twist on Museums,"I was never really a fan of arts museum. However, after a hesitant visit it compleatly changed my mind.It starts with a train ride from the basement parking lot located carved inside a mountain, which by itself is a piece of art. Then once you step off the train it feels like you were transported to a futuristic center with a window to the past. They have some of the most diverse art and sculpture from around the world from all different time periods. Pieces from Van Gogh to Leonardo da Vinci and art from heist movies can all observed here.After you step out from the building you will be walking into a garden which is comparable to the hanging gardens of Babylon. You will be atop a mountain top with luscious greens and flowers and a view of California as far as your eyes can see. Don't forget to bring your camera.If you ever visit Los Angeles don't forget to make this one of your stops. Free admission superb learning experience and a garden with a view that will mesmerize you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92mohammadr
50,Building sensational and the collections are amazing.,Had not been for quite a few years and really entry attended a photograph show from a world class Japanese female artist.Parking now easier than ever than a short monorail ride to a magnificent easy stair case or easy slight walkway for all others.Exhibitions change every 6 weeks and the building itself is an experience in itself.City view are awesome especially at dusk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yodotdog
50,"Numerous stunning exhibits; one incredible, panoramic view!","The Getty Center (affectionately known as just ""The Getty"") is an absolute must-see attraction in LA! It offers world-famous paintings, lithographs, drawings, topiaries, and artwork of all kinds. The exterior grounds are breathtaking with their shrubs, flowers, trees, sculptures, water features, and expansive lawns where you can sit, relax, and just take a break. Despite the museum's grand scale and enormity, touring all its many halls, rooms, galleries, etc is not difficult. The food is reasonably priced as far as landmark attraction food items go (e.g. a LOT cheaper than Disneyland). Aside from the parking (which is very ample and affordable), admission to the center is FREE, only adding to its value proposition as far as tourist attractions go. I've lived here for five years now and have been to the Getty five times and will continue to go back thanks to their ever-changing traveling galleries and exhibits and the many scheduled speakers and sessions.I love The Getty, period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero

50,Eye candy for art lovers,"The Getty along the 405 freeway is a treasure trove of wonderful art! To begin its FREE! That's right folks FREE! However, the catch is that the parking is $15 per vehicle. Once you park you will directed to there people mover which is a computer driven monorail. This is enjoyable because you can see the view of the mountains(there are grape vineyards out there!!! who would have guessed!!) its a beautiful view. Once you have reached your destination you will be in awe of the 360 degree view of beauty! Your are surrounded by mountains and a very lovely museum. One tip go right before sunset the view is breathtaking! WARNING: I am ADHD so my review will bounce everywhere. When entering the main building make sure you get a map because this place is HUGE and you can get lost. Also download GOOGLES because when you take a photo of the art(in certain areas) it will give you a description. The downside is that there is a musty smell from the art but you will be in such awe that its bearable. There are several buildings and each has its own wonderful are exhibit and landing outside with view. This is a great place for the kiddies also because outside has rolling hills of grass. You can sit down to a picnic or go down to the wonderful flower garden that is like a open maze. in the middle of the maze is a beautiful maze that is one continuous green bush. Because of the drought in California the Waterfall will most likely shut down, but maybe in the winter they may turn it back on. It would be very educational for the children because you can follow the waterfall to where it begins. The whole place is open air between buildings so there is plenty of room to roam and for kids to run around. The food is a bit expensive but tasty and of course you could always bring a picnic lunch ( I have). There are all sorts of classes for every age also. Its a beautiful place to spend a day with the classics or modern art and relax!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnawhi
50,Very beautiful museum!,The Getty Museum is a very beautiful museum. Beautiful grounds and gardens. The view is spectacular. I must return to see the other parts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimthetravelingdiva
50,Don't rush through this Los Angeles Gem!,"The Getty is one of the few museums in the world where the grounds, the gardens and the building itself are works of art equal to the art displayed inside its galleries. Make sure you allow enough time to take the free guided tours covering the building's architecture and the gardens. There are also free guided tours of the major works of art in the galleries and the special exhibitions. The views from many of the various porticoes and patios are breathtaking from the ocean to downtown. Also it being Los Angeles, you get a bird's eye view of the 10 lane Route 405 cutting through the Sepulveda Pass. Don't miss the new acquisition of an early Bernini sculpture of Pope Paul V from 1621. There is a very good cafe and restaurant as well. This is a don't miss sight on any trip to Los Angeles. The museum is free. You pay $15 dollars for parking. There is a special rate if you also want to visit the magnificent Getty Villa in Malibu in the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnw59
50,Getty. My fave place in LA,"The art museums are smallish in comparison to Chicago or NYC. But the architecture, gardens and wrap around views are what I love about it. And the feeling here is just special. Food: At least three choices. Very small cafe and kiosks, super gourmet cafeteria style restaurant. Not a cafeteria! With gorgeous. Jews. And lastly, my fave is the fancy gourmet restaurant Great food, ambiance and vie s. Perfection. This museum is free to boot. You only pay for parking. Or take a bus. And then no fee at all. Where can you get all this!? Unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chi-Girl999
50,Beautiful building and view,"Yes, I do look at the art as well :), but if I want to just have a nice day getting away I love going up there. We live only about 40 minutes away from there and I like that tram ride up the hill and the beautiful entrance stairs to the museum. The whole building just has a fantastic vibe to it - to me everything else it secondary. It's made from beautiful materials and has so many interesting angles and view points. It's a great place for architectural photography.The galleries are spacious yet intimate enough to focus in on individual pieces. I recently went there for my birthday and we had a nice lunch sitting outside and enjoying the fantastic views.The garden, in my opinion, doesn't do the museum itself justice. It's pretty small and it's not a welcoming place to hang out. the paths are narrow and the spectacular ocean view is largely covered up. (Why in the world did they do that?!)Perhaps some of the plants there are rare, but the garden as a whole didn't seem to be very lush. Perhaps we have a drought and they're saving water. Anyway, the only thing that I really liked about the garden were the metal trees covered in bougainvillea plants.The art? Sure, it's great, but like I said, I just love hanging out up there and spending the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736mb
50,"""Amazing, beautiful and exquisite!""","The Getty Center is both educational and enlightening. With artworks from around the world and priceless paintings one is is awe of the absolute talent, no, inspiration it must have required to complete such incredible pieces. You really need more than a day to see the various collections. The entire complex is also a creative design with distinctive elements shared across the campus. Go early and plan to stay all day. Outside, traffic on the freeway will be a nightmare so you might as well plan to stay all day or spend the day close by until traffic breaks at 8 pm! Wear comfortable shoes and plan accordingly. A treasure to be sure with awesome views and panoramic vistas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samdiego2
50,Best Public Space in Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is an amazing public space that provides a great permanent collection, great rotating exhibits, and spectacular grounds. The Getty makes you feel removed from the crazy traffic of Los Angeles and provides a truly serene experience. Definitely bring a picnic and eat near the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rendellj
50,Beautiful Gallery,Would definitely recommend attending The Getty if you ever can. The buildings themselves are beautiful and the views are spectacular.100% recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaInfinite
40,"Spectacular views, interesting architecture and an average collections beautifully displayed.",The Getty Center is the Getty museum located in the Santa Monica mountains with amazing views across the LA basin and the coast line. On any type of day it's worth the trip for the view. The architecture is interesting and dramatic. The collection is beautifully displayed and has some nice pieces while the overall quality is improving slowly. They do have an active series of special exhibits and lectures and concerts so check the schedule to see what is happening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEIreland
50,A Destination as much as a Museum,"This place should be on everyone's list who visits Los Angeles. And if you live here, as I do, it's to be considered one of our finest resources. Okay, you know from the other reviews that it's a museum with a stellar collection and really exciting changing exhibits as well. But it's also got a terrific upscale restaurant worthy of celebrations (it's a birthday pick in my family) - I love the chopped salad with cranberries and blue cheese --the food is exquisite and the view incomparable. It has a cafeteria style option that is not expensive and filled with tasty and original options, it has demonstrations and lectures of art techniques (one of Getty's strong theories about how to bring culture alive) it has a tram ride up the hill to get there that in itself is a pleasure - you can even see a private vineyard on a Bel Air hill across the freeway - it's a real hit of the complexity and beauty that is our city. The book/gift store has enticing choices including beautiful jewelry and unusual souvenirs, and the grounds themselves are spacious, peaceful, and filled with places to sit and write, picnic or stroll. It is an ideal place for writers to come and work. The parking is expensive but there are buses that take you to the Getty from nearby areas and it's always possible to arrive that way. If you're a visitor, plan at least 4 hours here. If you're a local, don't forget this place to eat, to write, to refresh. Every time I come here I say to myself...""I must get here more often."" It's a tonic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoxVoyage
50,Amazingly beautiful!,"I love the Getty-it is so beautiful and relaxing. The location is the ""everything"" of LA. Taking the teens here is great because it is free (except for parking), there are great things to do and places to go before and after, it is LA chill...nobody bugs you and you are free to wander as long and however you like.

If it's just adults I recommend spending a little bit more time indoors.There's something to do for all ages: the museum is family friendly so little kids can be outside. My favorite was that you can be outside most of the time. You can picnic there too!We went with my 16 yr son and my 19 yr son. They were both pleasantly surprised and didn't complain at all! The museum is located on a hill so there's a beautiful view of the city when you visit the center. The architecture is spectacular and there's a nice view everywhere you look. It's very well organized so the lines move fast. There's a wait to get in to park but believe me it's worth it!I liked it even more than the Louvre because it was stress free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Custer2013

Neat gift shop as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshuaW620
40,Amazing place...just not for me,"Was taken to visit the Getty with friends recently and although it is an amazing place, I personally did not enjoy it. Wonderful place for education, art and culture with nice gardens. The Getty admission is free but there is a $15 car park charge. You park your car in the car park then take a short tram ride up to the center itself. The views of the city are stunning. With 5 different areas to cover, this would be a full day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillyDundee

50,"How lucky are the residents of LA to have such a fabulous ""Free"" museum?","We decided that ""The Getty"" would be the perfect place to walk off our sleep deprivation (after a long trip from Sydney to LA). This place had been on my radar to visit for some time and I was not disappointed. While it probably wasn't ideal to visit in a jet lagged state - it was still easy to see what an amazing place it is. We enjoyed wandering around the numerous exhibits for several hours, although I would imagine it wouldn't be hard to spend all day here. My only tip is not to forget your sunglasses - I forgot to pack my sunglasses and while the day started as overcast it soon changed to a hot and glaringly sunny day. Given the place is all white sandstone, it was actually very difficult to see when walking outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathD625

50,Must do!,"If you like art, this is a must do. While I'm more a fan of contemporary art, the Getty's collection is simply fascinating. The exhibit ""Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World"" (runs until 11/1) was fantastic. Of course the Getty is more than just the art, it's the architecture and the gardens and the views. From the tram ride up, you are transformed to a place far removed from the hustle and bustle of the 405 below. Great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Showman500

The museum is very beautiful, with magnificent architecture and grounds. It is also great for all ages since the museum is so user friendly with written and taped explanations, plus tour guides are readily available. There are also handicapped access through out the museum. I have take high school students on ours of the museum and they have loved it, gaining an appreciation of art.

50,"Beautiful, worthy of #1 attraction in LA","ATTENTION: be warned about your GPS directions trying to get there. Instead of the Sunset Blvd exit, you'll want to take the Getty Center Dr exit and the entrance to the entire area is actually from the east side of 405 along Sepulveda. My GPS tried to take me to the south side of the Center going through a neighborhood. Not the only one because there was a sign warning people. I don't have anything else specific to add about the center itself other than the title of my review. Recommended at least about half a day for the visit (4-5 hrs).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huadao15271527

50,"Absolutely awesome place to visit; it's a ""don't miss"" attraction","What a great experience this is for adults. Kids? Well, you know how your kids can be at museums so use your own judgement. There are a lot of outdoor venues here and lots of open space but it is, after all, mostly a museum. One advantage is that the costs of admission is the parking fee so the charge is per car rather than per person. There is a lot to see and you'll need at least 3 hours once you get off the tram to orient yourself, explore, take in the exhibits, enjoy the outdoor gardens and enjoy the panoramic views, etc. It's a wonderful experience. Do a little research on their website before you go. This will make your visit even better. I hope this review is helpful to you/yours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baltoborn

50,LA's Finest,"More often than not, LA doesn't make your list of top cities in the world when you think of Art Museums. But if you visit just one of our many amazing museums, the Getty should be at the top of that list, and will forever change your mind about LA being an art-less city. A simple visit to the building and grounds itself is a treat! The Getty is free, except for parking, so load up all your friends in one car and head on over. Then you'll take a fun tram ride to the top of the hill that the Getty Center complex is situated on, with a gorgeous view all around. Once inside the grounds you have access to paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts from around the world. But my favorite aspect of the Getty is the Photography. Their Photography exhibits, both permanent and temporary, are simply spectacular. They put together some of the most renowned artists works and display them with such integrity, that it's truly inspiring. Once you've been throught the buildings, take a walk through the exquisite gardens and take a luncheon on the patio overlooking the grounds as the breeze from the nearby ocean envelopes you. It really is the best way to spend a lovely afternoon in LA! (Museum is closed on Mondays!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikiMustTravel

From the moment you get there, the entire experience is breathtaking, and for a jaded New Yorker this cultural retreat is a true delight. I look forward to visiting the Getty every time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterkT5094EC
50,The place to take your tourist friends,"This is one of my favorite places on earth. The collection is not overwhelming in size, and the architect made such beautiful spaces with fountains (now dry from the drought) and light. The garden also is unique and lovely. Great place to bring a blanket and picnic as well; and the restaurants have great quality food. Please go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondravaz
50,The view to end all views,I never get bored of seeing the city lights of LA. There is something about the way all the areas of the Getty frame the view that make it amazing. Walk about and explore every nook and cranny and you will be rewarded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaaaayyyyyeeeee
50,Awesome,Great museum in every respect. We did the highlights tour. One hour packed with really personal insights by the guide. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YPOS
50,Must Do/See in LA,"In my opinion- #1 must see/do in LA- beautiful complex/park with amazing vista point. Museum collection is very good- Rembrandt, Rubens, Titian,van Gogh- simply not enough space to list all of them. Cultural oasis in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vyv50
50,Amazing Place!,"The Getty Center consists of several buildings by famed American architect Richard Meier around a central open area. As one would expect of Meier, the buildings are of white travertine, imported from Italy. If you tire of the buildings and exquisite gardens, there's an equally fantastic art collection. The museum has kid-friendly activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/professoressadarte
50,Amazing Place Worthy of a Full Day's Visit,"Amazing architecture and art makes the Getty Center a ""do not miss"" destination on any trip to Southern California. It's a nice contrast to its classical sister museum, the Getty Villa, also worthy of a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmavensny
50,Incredible setting away from the LA Traffic,"We love returning to The Getty.They take you away from the LA traffic with the parking lot located at the bottom of the hill.tram services run every five minutes to go up the hill. you can also take a hike and enjoy the scenery and wildlife ( we often see the deer's that live on the hill).The Museum is world class, the options for eating there go from the best ever coffee cart, to the cafeteria and the seat down restaurant.try to select one of these days after a good rain ( or winter storm ) to enjoy the best panorama of Los Angeles from the San Gabriel Mountains to Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
40,A very interesting place,"A really beautiful place to visit, and free of charge - we enjoyed going here to see some of the wonderful Bronze sculptures, and the art exhibitions. In addition, the gardens are beautiful and also worth walking round on a nice sunny day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippin1960
50,Beautiful grounds,I am not really into museums but the Getty center has something for everyone beyond the exhibits. The grounds are beautiful and the view from the top as well so it should be definitely on your must see places whether you're visiting LA or live here. Great place to go for a few hours or spend the whole day. They have a restaurant that's pretty good but a bit pricey but they also have smaller cafes that sell sandwiches and snacks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NilooG
40,Nice place to visit,"Very interesting place to visit. The outside gardens are perfectly manicured and a pleasure to view.Be prepared to do a lot of walking,however there are plenty of benches and places to sit.The inside offers a multitude of things to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13les13
50,More than a Museum,"Wonderful day trip on beautiful grounds. Great art, not an overwhelming quantity, but because the works are always changing, it's a fun place to visit over and over. The gardens, the views, the endless travertine all combine to provide a lovely day. The cost is $15 for parking, but entry is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traderjane
50,One of the world's great art museums,"Incredible collection of European painting (pre 20th century) and photographs, set amongst beautiful gardens (worth a visit even if you're not an art lover). The Richard Meier-designed museum is a masterpiece and sits on top of a hill with great views of the city. Set aside the better part of a day to spend here, it's not a visit you'll to rush.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinTravis
50,A Museum Which Does Credit To Its Collection,"Rarely have I visited a museum and felt at once so appreciative of the vision of its benefactor and the accomplishments of its curators. There are so many features on the site which are intended to enhance your enjoyment of the various collections that I couldn't do justice to them all in this brief review, except to say that you will probably find some more of your own!To begin with there are the magnificent views of LA and its coastline which can be obtained from almost every balcony and terrace attached to the five major pavilions. Then there are the carefully manicured gardens, neat even by the standards of Beverly Hills, still somehow refreshing despite the dry water features and peppered with interesting sculptures. 'The incomparable collections of the old masters and masterpieces from the 19th speaks for itself but for the visitor, some of the most memorable items of display could be found amongst the decorative arts, especially some astonishingly beautiful examples of French inlaid furniture. We were also fortunate to visit during a special exhibition of Antiquarian Bronze Statues, the finest collection in one place I have ever seen.A ground plan is essential as the spacious layout can be a little overwhelming and the excellent cafe is best visited before the midday queues form.The fact that there is no admission fee seems to increase the value of this collection at the same time as enhancing the dignity of its visitors. Go and be impressed! If only all tourist attractions reach this standard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,$15 and an amazing afternoon,"Only fee involved is a $15 carpark fee. Very amazing museums inside, paintings, sculptures, etc.Pack some food, you can have a picnic in the glorious grasses outside the museums. What a beautiful place! Not much food sold inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pocky_11
50,A Monumental Museum,"Some of the artwork is priceless. Take all of the guided tours, especially if you are not a connoisseur of art. The architecture and the grounds are simply beautiful and the views of Los Angeles from the Getty Center are breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J639VIjohnv
50,Beautiful architecture!,"The Getty Villa is a great place to relax, learn, or even eat at the cafe. The architecture speaks for itself and the gardens/fountains are as beautiful as the exhibitions. The upstairs balcony is where you'll get some of the best views. The only downside was that the water was turned off for the fountains due to the drought, but that's no fault of this place. Of all the places my girlfriend and I visited in Los Angeles, this was her favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad707
50,The Getty Center,Great way to spend a day in Los Angeles! Unbelievable art collections to discover!Don't forget to see the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sun245
50,"Getty Museum: Amazing collection/views of LA, fabulous architecture, all in one & it's free.","We wanted to spend just few hours, but we stayed all day! This great museum is one of the most visited in the USA. It is a considerable distance from LA, but you can get there by bus. Upon arrival a tram picks you up in the parking area and brings you to the top of the hill through a beautiful wooded area. The arrival plaza offers a first taste of the scale and beauty of the 7 pavilions' architecture, with the piano shaped main entrance building...and outdoor sculptures like Boy with Frog by Charles Ray or That Profile by Martin Puryear. The buildings were designed with beautiful beige textured Italian travertin mixed with concrete and steel by the architect Richard Meier.This museum has paintings (Impressionism), photographs, sculptures, furniture, French prints, Medieval books, and a truly amazing central garden. It's location commands great views of LA which are a photographer's delight.Tips: go prepared for the full day, bring sunglasses, hats, but if you forget, pick a loaner umbrella offered by the museum, benefit from one of the several guided tours (really good and short), parking ($15) is free for the military. Few of the really great things in life are free...this is one of them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azen11
40,Getty Center,I enjoyed both the Getty Villa and Getty center. Try to avoid the rush and go early or late in the day. Mid day visits tend to be more crowded. Harder to park as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orderdessert1st
50,Recent exhibition of Greek bronzes is a life time experience,"25% of all known original Greek sculptures are presented here. It is a privilege to be able to see them all at one time. I have been visiting museums around the world for many years and never had an opportunity like this. They are absolutely beautiful, whether or not you are interested in this subject. A must for all art or history lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmyz1015
50,Great place for a date.,We love the architecture and variety of high quality art on display. This a great place to spend an afternoon/evening. They offer beer and wine and some snack foods. Pictures are not allowed in some displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3273SOdavids
50,"Once you've exhausted the superlatives, what can you say?","Sitting atop a hill with a view of LA, the museum can be reached by bus. The museum itself is free, but there's a $15 charge if you drive and park.The museum covers painting, photography, sculpture. It has an excellent collection and there is always an intriguing traveling exhibition. The Getty would be a must-see for its architecture alone.There is a cafeteria and coffee stands, none of which are any great shakes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsS4151FO
50,A MUST visit on your trip to Los Angeles!,"This is an absolute must visit during your L.A. stay. The Getty is located just off the I-405, north of the Wilshire Blvd. exit. Park below, and take the bus or escalator up to the museum. Aside from the fantastic works of art from all ages and countries, don't miss the ""Decorative Arts"" section, showing rooms of decorative paneling, wall hangings, doors (Louis XV) desks, etc. Something very unusual, not typically seen in museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasKen1
50,A must do!,"A great way to spend the day! We got here at 10am thinking we would be done in a few hours- we were so immersed by the amazing collection from the Getty, before we knew it it was closing time! Expect some iconic paintings by Van Gogh's, Cezanne's and some INCREDIBLE and beautiful tapestry's!Parkin was really easy and the location is accessable by carThe views of Los Angeles and California from the garden and observation deck are just breathtaking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celiajanec
50,Not to be missed,Outstanding selection of important paintings and sculptures. Spectacular views of the panorama of Los Angeles from downtown to the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShlomoB_12
50,Phenomenal visit,I have never been to nice museum like this. I like the old books they display. They also explain how people in the past made books from animal skins. Fascinasting! Hopefully I will get a house like this in this future. Nice architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelwozniak
50,A visual delight,"This place is incredible. It'd be worth it for the view alone, the gardens alone, the architecture alone or the galleries alone ... and is made all the more enjoyable because you can range freely (quite literally) through each. The juxtaposition of 17th c. paintings with modern building design is charming. The Getty is a gift to L.A. and its visitors. Well worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MegaBethNE
50,Something for Everyone,"The museum itself is beautiful perched high on a hill with panoramic views. The gardens are extraordinary. Besides the art, I could see it being a fun place just to hang out and relax. A must-see in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106jl
50,Lots and lots of interesting paintings and other artefacts that make us wonder about the world,"A must see site to travelers in LA. Wonderfull paintings from over the world with explanations with free headphones and very good guides to help. Access limited to people that could drive and find out ways to get there. Parking $15.00 for those ariving early (<16:00 hres). Food available on site. Not great cuisine but enough for a quick lunch ""sur le pouce"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alain19531207
50,Stunning!,"This is honestly one of my favourite places to visit in LA. The architecture for a start, it's amazing. The location and views on a clear day blow my mind. The gardens are so lush, they make me want to sit amongst it all day and watch the world drift. The galleries are a plenty and the relaxed vibe makes me want to spend loads more time than I have available. I will go back to the Getty, because there was so much I didn't get a chance to see. The fact that the admission is free is amazing, and $15 for parking is fair considering the free admission, plus the parking also gets you into the Getty Villa in Malibu. Brilliant. Put the Getty Center on your list... you won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPK89
40,Even the kids enjoyed it,"When I suggested visiting an arts center, my husband and my kids were reluctant. But they ended up enjoying the day more than I did. There was a beautiful garden and a nice view of Los Angeles.The sculptures and paintings themselves were ok. But if you have admired the masterpieces in Europe... you know what I mean. But there was no entry fee. What more could you ask for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waijgjy
40,Oasis in Los Angeles,"It was like an oasis in Los Angeles, a breath of fresh air away from the hustle and bustle of the city with breathtaking views, beautiful gardens and famous paintings, just wished we had more time to relax there. The cafe was pretty standard but then you get what you pay for, I would definitely try out the restaurant instead if I were to return one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolamP5942RG
50,Absolute must see - incredible,"What an amazing place. Certainly the most beautiful museum in the US. Regardless of whether you are into Art, the facility itself and the location require a visit. The design and architecture of this place is unbelievable. On top, it has a great art and sculpture collection- not as large as other major museums, but exceptional.great gardens with panoramic views of the valley. Don't miss this",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/53CourtneyB
50,Getty Center,One of the best in the world which is saying a lot. You need at least half a day to do it justice. The grounds are worth the visit. The collection is extraordinary in every way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26franklins

50,Art and nature for total beauty all the way around,"Truly an amazing museum that has great permanent and visiting exhibits. The best part is that this place is FREE! No excuses not to take advantage of the lovely art here. You can park for $15 a car or you can park below and take a shuttle. There's a cafe in between the exhibit buildings so if you get hungry, there's nice areas to enjoy a quick snack. In the back of the buidling, there is a lovely garden with art pieces along with a view of the city. I like going in the evenings when you can see the sun set as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
50,The number one must see in LA,"The Getty is a must see - even if you are not into art, then you will love the building and the view over LA. If you like art, it is amazing - so many pieces. It is free but you pay $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wombatdavid
50,Beautiful setting for an incredible museum,"Pluses:-Free admission!!!!! But parking is $15/car, so not quite free- bring a large group in a car and it will seem free.-Free tours and iPod headsets give concise art history vignettes for many of the permanent pieces.-Nice collection of primarily European Art from many periods.-Changing exhibitions make this museum worth going to many times, currently ""Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World"". Many exquisite pieces!-The outdoor gardens and architecture of the museum alone are worth the trip.-Food in the cafe was reasonable and tasty!Minuses:-Collection highlight tour we participated in was led by a low energy older woman- consider using the FREE headsets instead, though in fairness, there were other tour leaders we overheard who seemed much more energetic. Bring your own earbuds for a more comfortable fit however.-Travertine tile is used exclusively for the walkways which was an issue the rainy day we went- very slippery and the staff were unprepared for this. We all know that it almost never rains in LA though, so should rarely be an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wayneslc
50,One of the top places in Los Angeles,"To many times I have been in Los Angeles without going to this place!! The view, breathtaking; the garden, a resting place for the eyes and the soul; the architecture: an example and inspiration for good and human architecture; the museums: diverse and nicely exhibited (except for the light which is not in every place optimal - there is often a shine on the pictures and it needs some time the find a good spot). You can easily spend a few hours at this place and it is worth every minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passepartout58
50,Marvelous museum,"No need to really review this place as it is rated the numero uno attraction in Los Angeles. Best deal in the city since admission is free although parking is $15.00 for the day. There are free guided mini-tours for the collections, the architecture, and the gardens. I would recommend these although the adequacy of the tours depends on the biases of the docents involved. We did the first two. Van Gogh's Irises is a highlight but other wonderful artwork as well. Too much to see in one day. There is a lot of walking and we spent much of the day here but it is definitely worth it. We also ate in the restaurant which is pricey but what a view although the L.A. haze was substantial on the day we visited. Will review separately. The view of the city is fantastic. Richard Meier's site plan for the museum and accompanying buildings amazing. Wow, wow, wow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David116116
50,Fantastic - a must visit when in LA,"Hard to say anything other than an astonishingly great place to visit.

Great place to bring food & wine and enjoy the garden and view.Admission: FREEParking: Parking structure (FEE),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Great gardens at Getty.,I loved that they honored the drought conditions by not watering several areas. The natural beauty of the grounds shone through. This was my second time there and my first almost exclusively outside. Next time I will know to bring a picnic and a book and to plan to linger on the lawn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soooge
50,"Definately a place to visit, both for a native and for a tourist.","Enjoyed both grounds and the collections. If you are looking for antiquities and sculpture, try Getty Villa in Malibu on Pacific Coast Highway, near Sunset Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E150OQgregb
50,Can't miss attraction world renound museum,Wow you have to see this place to believe it no pictures can do it justice. Miracle on the hill for sure above Westwood off the 405 freeway is a can't miss attraction. The gardens alone outside are worth the trip the landscaping breathless & endless. Now to see the art inside is so beautiful & all in one museum a true testament to the Getty's to have the resources to put this World Class Museum together an amazing family adventure for all. You can spend all day inside & be continually be amazed around each corner you go there is something for all ages so overwhelming the beauty of the art & gardens perfect place to spend the day alone with friends & family just speechless go see for yourself can't possible be disappointed a sure treasure of not only Los Angeles but to the world!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deller701

30,Interesting & Fun,"It's nice. It's free but there's parking charges. Could spend an entire day if you have the time. There are short tours, which could get tedious, so we slipped out and did our own. We had weighing ourselves on different planets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGeeKay
50,A great all around experience.,"This is a one of kind place. The grounds and buildings are a treat to the eye. The views of the city are one-of-a-kind. I found the quantity and variety of art amazing for a private museum. It has one of the most intriguing displays of Illuminated Books I’ve ever seen. I loved the layout of the wings with gorgeous view of the grounds and city in between each. The current 1st Century bronze exhibition is amazing. There is an intimacy to the bronze displays that is hard to explain. In a strange way you feel very close to the people who first looked at these items 2,000 years ago. I strongly recommend you take all the free guided tours you can. They are short but very well done. I stayed for an evening lecture, which was a wonderful way to add some depth to my understanding of the art. There is a good variety of food choices and the entire museum is free with only a $15 parking fee. I will definitely come here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalcolmandSirius
50,Go,What a great way to spend the day above LA. The collection is superb but the architecture and surroundings and restaurant are all worth the trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougiedd
50,Worth visiting for art lovers,"I had to make a trip to LA out of whim and I didn't prepare my list of places to visit. I visited the Getty Center and spent a good 3 hours here but ended up seeing only 25% of the entire place. It's HUGE and wonderful for art lovers.They had a Photography exhibition going on, on the day I went there and it was brilliant for me since I am a photographer myself. The food at the restaurant is exorbitantly expensive but the cafe is moderate for this place up in the hills. The tram journey to the hill top is pleasant and the entire place is very nicely maintained.if you plan on visiting, plan at least half a day to a day to be spent here in case you like art and museum displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dheer_c

50,"An amazing oasis, a testament to generosity in the arts","During our week in LA, we visited the Getty four times, so enthralled were we by its amazing collections of treasures, its stunning architecture and amazing location. And there are no entry fees! Numerous volunteers are particularly helpful, there are free excellent audioguide headsets, and the cafes are reasonably priced and provide a relaxed opportunity to restore oneself. The exhibits are beautifully presented, in logical layout and lighting. The onsite research centre enriches the quality of the background information, and there are some imaginative and thought-provoking comments. Not to be missed, and worth the trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2307NAandrewg

50,Turner Exhibition,"This exhibit was truly remarkable. A collection of the later work of J. M. W. Turner included sixty oil paintings and water colors from the Tate Britain Museum. The paintings were from the latter part of Turner's life, considered to be his best period.Mid-19th century, the work preceded Impressionism, yet predicts that style.

50,A Must See Sight in LA,"An absolute must see sight in LA. The Getty Center has to be one of the most amazing architectural spaces I have ever been in. I have never been in a museum like this. Lots of open space, you move from pavilion to pavilion. The collection is fine enough as is, but in truth the space is even more impressive. The setting is magnificent- set high on a bluff overlooking the city. Aside from the buildings, the landscaped spaces are also fantastic. Topping it off, the museum is free, a rarity in most parts of the world. Go even if you don't like art museums. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2814RPmarkb
50,Amazing attraction!,"The Getty Center was one of the coolest places we visited.Not only is there an abundance of extremely impressive art, furniture, books, etc. the building itself is amazing!The architecture was impressive and was designed to make specific shadow figures and was just really beautiful to look at!You only have to pay for parking and it is free to wander around at your leisure.I would definitely recommend visiting here even if you don't like art! There are spectacular views of the city and the ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshB3904
50,Just be here.,"If I only had a day in L.A., I would go here. It's perched above the city, light bounces off the white buildings, water flows and you are transported to art zen. The exhibits usually aren't the best part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSfromMaine
50,Beautiful,Beautiful place! Had a wonderful day. Well worth it and highly recommend it to anyone in the area. Would go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bolliveb123
50,A Must Do in Los Angeles,"You'll love spending time at the Getty Centre. Leaving to one side the fabulous art and antiquities, the location and architectural splendour of the buildings and gardens is breathtaking. From the easy and well signed access from the freeway, to the well designed parking garage and convenient tram to take you up to the Centre, your visit will be relaxed and stress free. Numerous guides and helpers are on hand to point you in the right direction. The Hellenistic Bronze exhibition was a highlight - make sure to join a guided tour to gain an appreciation of the art. When we were ready to leave, the tram had broken down, so weapon an easy, pleasant stroll downhill to the parking garage (shuttle buses were available). A must do in LA - and to round it off, there is no entry charge ($15 for parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748roberty
40,Stunning,"One of the most magnificent art facilities anywhere. This museum was free but so amazing.The center alone, not the collection, cost a billion dollars to build. It is light and airy. You can get up close. The center includes some wonderful art pieces and its collection is continually growing. Including the grounds and the museum there is more to take in than possible. You could spend the entire day. We loved the maze and the flowers. The views from the Getty rival the art in the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,Wonderful Day Visit,"The Getty Center is a wonderful free place to visit for the day. My kids love the shuttle ride to the top of the mountain and they enjoy roaming around all the exhibits. There's always something new to see. But I especially love the exhibit that has the old handmade books. The gold leaf laden pages are exquisite! The Family Center is limited to like 20 people, so we were not able to enter until people left the room. So instead of waiting we left to explore another exhibit.Also if you get hungry, there's a cafeteria towards the front where you can purchase hot food, cold sandwiches and salads, small snacks, and drinks. You can also bring your own food to eat at their big clean eating area. There's also a lot of lovely quiet shaded places outside the museum where you can relax and eat as well.There's free WiFi but the signal can be a bit weak at some spots. Parking is free. But if you go when it's super busy, the parking attendants tell you to leave and come back in 30 minutes. They regulate the parking strictly. But I don't complain because it's FREE! The Getty Villa parking is $10. So that's a plus at least if you're patient.Quick tip...make sure to pay close attention to signs in front of exhibits. Some have photography and video taping restrictions. So if you don't want to get embarrassed by having a museum guard person scold you for taking a picture, take heed the warning signs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pulido1011
50,Visually Entertaining,Every room never cease to amaze me because there is more beautiful and interesting things to see and it's free! Prepare your walking shoes because there will be a lot of roaming around to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meagainpauline
50,Beautiful,Beautiful grounds many flowers. Great views of LA. Good spot for pictures. Nice place to have lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GriselleMM
50,"Incredible architecture, landscape, and collection!","You could spend hours or a full day here, depending on your level of interest in art. For non-museum goers, just the grounds, architecture, and views are stunning and worth a few hours of exploration.The collection is extensive and has excellent pieces representative of everything from Renaissance and classical sculpture to decorative arts and illustrated manuscripts to Impressionism and drawings.Highlights include:*The ecstatic Angel of the Citadel, which greets you at the top of the stairs*the gardens*the views of Bel-Air*Titian's Venus & Adonis*one of Canaletto's photo-perfect depictions of the Grand Canal*Van Gogh's Irises*one of Monet's Rouen Cathedral facades*Rembrandt's Old Man in Military Costume*Richard Meier's modern architecture itselfIt's free, but parking is $15 (or $10 after 5pm).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31DC31
50,Excellent Support for the Handicapped,"The Getty collection, the architecture, and the location are all impressive and it was great to visit the museum once again. However, this time I was with someone who is handicapped and needed a wheel chair to get around.I have never visited a facility that made it so easy for the handicapped. Starting with easy parking near an elevator, to free wheel chairs near the elevators, to wide paths, and most importantly elevators within the buildings for easy access to the exhibitions.There excellent design made it pleasurable for all members of our group to visit the Getty and enjoy their fabulous museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinK343
50,Extraordinary Experience,"This is a beautiful facility. The outdoor space is incredible in layout, design and beauty. The garden area is exquisite. We experienced watching the sunset over the mountains. So serene and peaceful. We had very limited time and didn't get to view much of the interior, but will definitely come back to do so. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshinePatty
50,Fabulous and the views!!!,"a must see for all age groups, fascinating exhibits and lovely grounds...The train will take you to the centre, so no need to walk!Recommend this place highly,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdinburghWeesa
40,A perfect experiment,"The pieces are exposed in a didactic way and the place is amazing, including the gardens. Take some time to watch the sculptures at the beginning of the tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbino
50,how this has grown,"i remember when the getty was a dream. it has grown so stupendously into a remarkable venue and safe haven for significant visiting art. i took one girlfriend, whose grt grt grt grandma was also a widow who married the Duke of Kent, (an employer of my grt grt grandpa, his main steward) and she was mother to Queen Victoria.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyh620
50,Lose yourself in the architecture,"Outside as terrifically beautiful as the exhibits inside! Be sure to bring a camera for photos outdoors - so many beautiful views. Check ahead , plan your time wisely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363celestep
50,"Impressive, worth the watch!","Wow....I was really impressed by the size of the center, the view on the outside and the impressive collections on the inside.I'm not an art fanatic, but the amount and variety of paintings, statues and objects displayed here was enormous!Free entrance, just 10 bucks for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mennov783
50,Amazing collection,"The architecture is a prize in itself, let alone the treasures found inside. Having seen The Met in New York, The Louvre in Paris I have modest expectations for most museums. Not that those are the only places to see art, but their collections are fantastic. The Getty Center exceeded my expectations and now that we're living in LA we try and make regular visits. Parking and taking the tram is easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamGK13
50,Excellent Experience,"I love visiting the Getty. The grounds and gardens are beautiful, and the architecture is stunning. On a clear day, the view of Los Angeles is lovely. I enjoy the exhibits, as well. One of my favorite things for my husband and I to do is to bring a picnic and eat on the lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyRM
50,The Getty is amazing and so much more than just the art...,"Greek and Roman art, medievel works and Renaissance paintings and sculpture abound here, and follow J. Paul Getty's vision of collecting the finest ""European masterpieces"" to show to his southern California neighbors. And I'm sure it's a fine collection, although I know so little about that art that it's hard for me to say. I can say that the buildings and landscape that house the collections are breathtaking at every turn and offer surprises and gifts with every step. Take the complimentary architectural tour and marvel at the attention to detail. Truly, a place not to miss when visiting Los Angeles - whether you give two hoots about Hellenic bronzes or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frqyx
50,Looking Down on La La Land!,"I am not normally an art museum person, but this place is simply magnificent. A unique, extensive collection of pre 20th century art, sculpture, manuscripts, drawings and photos. All set in the 'heavens' above Beentwood, Westwood and my UCLA alma mater. Open Tuesday through Friday, and Sunday 10 am to 5 pm, and Saturday 10 am to 9 pm. Architecture and Garden tours available (check their website). 1200 N. Sepulveda. Admission is free, but there is a parking fee of $15. There is a first-class restaurant on site for fine dining, two cafes (my favourite is the Garden Terrace), and a self service cafeteria as well. Gift shop too. Aside from the art, even the architecture of the Center is stupendous. But what surprised me most was going up on an early Spring day a couple of days after a rainstorm (LA translation - a clear day) and taking in the views, absolutely breathtaking. I-405 to exit 59, Take N Sepulveda south to Getty Center Drive, under the freeway and the parking structure. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
50,"Amazing Building, Garden and Exhibitions","We were amazed with the Getty Centre. The building itself is a statement and a work of art, in fact the art works pale in comparison. The gardens are also spectacular and help to make a visit well worth while. We also enjoyed our trip up to the centre in what is essentially a diagonal elevator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outandabout1208
50,THE gallery to beat,"We visited in 2014 on a very wet day so we couldn't really appreciate and enjoy the magnificent buildings and location.Very helpful staff and highlights info.Do as many free guided tours as you can schedule because you're likely to learn something new even if you're a regular art gallery enthusiast.Good food, but a bit pricey, but you're there for the day, I hope!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodisforeating
50,I been to The Getty Center and Musem,If you want to see beautiful Paintings and a beautiful Garden to it a nice place to visit with your family. When I went it was a family place there are so many painting and Figurines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeg382
50,Get to The Getty and be amazed.,As a free attraction ($15 parking) this is a must be seen to be believed place. Architecturally it is work of outstanding beauty. Step inside any of the pavilions and you are just awe struck by their design and form. With astounding views of L.A. And beyond you must not miss The Getty. The gardens are well laid out and the specimens hers rival anything in California. The tram ride is terrific too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6003AQjohnm
50,Wow what a place!,"Wow. What a place. Beautiful grounds and exhibits. I could have spent all day here. If I could, I would come on the weekend when they are open till 9pm. The views of LA turning from day to night would be fantastic. The vantage point is from Santa Monica all the way over to downtown LA and more. The artwork stupendous. The gardens are beautiful. For just the price of a $15 parking fee, you cannot beat it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loched
50,Hellenistic bronzes exhibition is a must see!,"Admission is free, but there is a $15 fee for parking - a small price to pay for the experience of viewing some great art. Ride a tram from the parking garage to the top of the hill where the museum sits. Excellent views of the city. We had already been at Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades for most of the day, so we only saw the Andrea de Sarto and Hellenistic Bronzes exhibitions. Go see the Seated Boxer (bronze) before the exhibition closes November 1st. You won't be sorry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacieNicole
30,"Like Los Angeles, the Getty Center Sprawls, but the Art Collection Recedes","The Getty Center is one of Los Angeles' most impressive properties: striking buildings, lavish gardens and plazas, not to mention stunning views westward to the Pacific coast and city-scapes to the east. Perched on an unencumbered hillside in West LA, it offers a relaxed freedom that eludes the busy, vibrant city below. The art collection is spread out among several individual buildings, which makes viewing the art seem less taxing than meandering through the endless halls of the great city museums build and relentlessly expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries.The Getty Center offers sit-down restaurants as well as an interesting variety of carts on the main plaza, from which visitors may purchase lighter fare and sit at the many outdoor tables clustered around the large central patio. So this is a place to spend time and enjoy a meal with family or friends.While the art collection is vast, most of it is not first tier. There are works by famous painters and sculptors, but they are usually not their best examples. Having grown up viewing the Renoirs in the Art Institute of Chicago, the Getty's few Renoirs seemed modest and staid. Getty's offerings by Canaletto struck me as small and somber, as opposed to the celebrated Venetian's typically vast, vibrant canvases.Visiting the Getty is a course in understanding the lesser artists whose works surrounded the art that defined each period of art history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279kenh
50,Give yourself some time to enjoy it.,"The Getty reminds me of a mini Metropolitan in that it goes on endlessly and has an incredible range of antiquities. When you arrive it seems like it's going to be a crowded day but the place is SO expansive that that issue goes away... except in the Impressionist gallery, but that's always the case wherever you go. It's unlikely, like the Met, that you'll see everything so it is definitely worth it to identify what you like and make a plan on the map. Wonderful outdoor plazas and spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backpackluxury
50,Loved the Getty!,"Amazing gardens, paintings exhibitions made this a great day. Didn't have a car though which is needed as taxi was about 30USD from West Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaseUK1
50,Awesome view of LA,"One of my friends advised me to visit Getty Center and I thought of it as just another arts museum with paintings and like. I was completely wrong. This place is awesome. The architecture of the buildings is something to be experienced. When I reached there, there was a long line of cars to enter the parking. It took a while to get in there but I was able to find parking. There is a shuttle from the parking garage to the main campus but I walked. It is a nice walk. Once on main campus, there are a lot of painting and sculptures. They have been organized very well. Oh, and they lend you free iPods so that you can type in the number of the exhibit and hear about it. I spent about five hours and enjoyed it for the most part. They have done a great job from every aspect.There is no fee but you have to pay for parking your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodman1
50,Return again and again.,"For some reason this collection and the way they have it put together throughout keeps me coming back again and again. First of all the grounds and facilities are beautiful, so the setting puts you in a great frame of mind. The art and exhibits are easily understood and always ""flow"" well, for the lack of a better word. At least for someone like me, who enjoys but doesn't always understand. You'll be happy this was on your list of things to do on your LA trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SayGoWeGo
40,Peak experience for LA Art,"This spectacular hilltop museum is a must see for LA. Special exhibits are often very good, but collection is a bit weak. Currently showing Hellenistic Bronzes... a revelation! Gardens are special and views are monumental. Restaurant is worth a splurge and cafes are far above what you might expect from museum fare. Museum is free, but parking is $15 except after 5. Make a night of it by arriving after 5 and dining at the restaurant. Museum is open until 10 weekends, restaurant to 9.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebmans
50,Just Wonderful!,"This a great place to spend a day or two or three even. Tons of wonderful things too see. Furniture, paintings, sculpture, etc. Photos allowed of most things. The architecture of the buildings is also very interesting and imressive Brings lots of water to drink because there is lots to see outside and you will get thirsty. The garden is a must just stroll then sit and enjoy. I know I did. Drinks are expensive at the center. Also you may want to bring an umbrella if your sensitive to the sun. They rent them there but again very expensive. If your driving parking is 15 dollars but museum is free so its still a deal. I highly recommemd .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zipdip1212
50,Must Return,"We left our trip to the Getty Center until our final day of our trip, thinking it would be handy for our return to the airport, which, indeed it was. However, we soon wished we had gone earlier in our trip as we could easily have spent a whole day there.For $15 you can park your car in the massive underground car park and this covers your entry to the museum too. Leave yourself plenty of time to get in as we were stuck in a queue of like-minded visitors for around an hour in an effort to get into the place. A tram then takes you to the top of the hill where the views of LA are fabulous. It is also possible to make a 15 minute walk uphill to enter the center if you have no vehicle.The artwork, architecture and landscaped gardens are all well worth seeing and for spectacular LA city views, this place is a must.We had a late lunch in the garden terrace cafe, which was very pleasant. Again, queues were long, but it's easy to see why this place is so popular. Two additional eateries are also available on site or you could prepare your own picnic and use the beautiful grounds to eat in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Susie00
50,Great place to tour,"First time we have been there and we really enjoyed it. The place had some great exhibits Beautiful and very educational place. The small negative was the water issue in California, which they reduced their water usage and you could tell by the empty ponds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDBDMEX
50,Make sure you stay for sunset :),This place is just amazing! I guarantee you will have a good day checking out everything they have on display. I also very much enjoy the outside garden area and ADORE the sunset view (It is a MUST) with a glass of wine :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beverlyp715
40,Day @ the Getty,"I came with my Husband during the week since he had a day off. We avoided some of the Weekend Crowd but it was still Pretty busy,So I can Imagine how busy it might be on the Weekends. So the Getty is so Big, that i think u need more than a Day to be able to see all of the art & exhibitions, we only did some of them, as i was looking forward to walk thru the Gardens, it's Gorgeous so Picturesque !! I think next time we are gonna Pack a Picnic as well. They have a restaurant there but if u want to Save some money mind as well bring a Sandwich so you don't go Hungry and Have more time to walk around & sightsee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Playita_Cindy
30,Go if you're looking for something to do. Nothing too spectacular though.,"It was ok... The view was probably the best part of it, along with the trolley ride and building itself. The medieval French furniture was pretty neat. I'm sure the exhibits are always changing though. It's worth a trip once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779nicolew
50,Perfect way to spend the day!,"L-O-V-E The Getty. It is worth the parking and tram hassle. Pack a picnic for the lawn...or...buy your food there. Delicious fancy restaurants and high quality fast food-not an oxymoron here!!! Fabulous exhibits, stunning architecture, breathtaking views of the city. Best in late afternoon to evening. Good for families, romance, friends, art lovers and concert goers. You will not want to leave!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabZ7681ZJ
50,Wonderful day to enjoy cultural enrichment!,"I have only been to the Getty Center a few times, but it is a wonderful experience every time I go. They have excellent art work from all corners of the world that inspire and awe you. In addition to the art works that include sculptures and photographs the view from the terrace is just plain stunning. It is one of the best views of L.A. albeit more of a 180degree+ compared to someplace like the Griffith Observatory. Admission is free but there is a parking fee. If you are showing guests from out of town, this is one place you should not miss. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alvnmri
50,Loved it !!!,Visited the Getty museum and restaurant with my wife.Great price..... FreeWonderful collection of art in a well maintained surrounding.The restaurant was excellent ! Who would have thought museum food would be good ? Well were we surprised.Cobb salad - excellentBouillabaisse- excellentWine - excellentService - excellent.Note that there is a restaurant and a cafe.The views from the museum and restaurant were magnificent. The staff were friendly and helpful.Loved our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennis_M99_MTL
50,Wonderful for Art Lovers,"The Getty is simply beautiful. Prom browsing the art to picnicking on the lawns and walking the gardens, this location is a must see in Southern California. Look on the website for more information about fees and access, I also recommend bringing your food if you can, since food prices are higher than average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellzep
50,Hellenistic Bronzes Special Exhibit - Not to be Missed!,"The exhibit brings about 25% of the known surviving bronzes from ancient Greece to a special exhibit created by The Getty Center. It will be in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. only. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to be able to view these masterpieces from antiquity particularly when today we are witnessing the destruction of ancient UNESCO sites in the Middle East. It makes any exhibit of world cultural masterpieces all the more meaningful and important to share with our children. There are special guided tours. Check before going. Headsets and audio tour guide is free and so is the entrance fee. No better deal anywhere in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJT645
50,Outstanding in All Ways,"The art, architecture, and view combine to make this the gem of LA. We visit here often and always find a new adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205PaulT
50,Truly Remarkable,"I have lived in Los Angeles for years and only recently went to The Getty Center for a Sunday afternoon brunch and walkabout with friends. I have heard the raves, but somehow never made it there. Everything about it was breathtaking. The brunch was fabulous with 5-star food and breathtaking views of the museum and city below. The exhibits are wonderful, as well. We saw an extremely unique photography exhibit that I am still thinking about. But the real draw, the thing everyone goes crazy for, is the building itself which is slabs and slabs of white granite extending this way and that, climbing up into the sky with platforms that seem to lead nowhere except to views of the city from every angle. Anyway, it is like no other museum on the planet and definitely worth going out of your way to see! Plan on spending the better part of a day there. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobominkin
50,Love is in the air at the Getty Center,"The Getty Center is a wonderful place to visit for any occasion. Buy yourself, with family and friends. But it has got to be one of the most romantic places to visit in LA. I think it is a PERFECT date. The art, the gardens, the structures themselves put love in the air.If you haven't been.. Don't put it off any longer. Take someone you want to hold hands with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516perryg
50,Forgot how amazing this place is - what a gem!,Wow - had not been here in a few years. Worth the traffic headache of the 405. The views are stunning! Took a few kids along and turned it into a wonderful day and adventure (stop at main desk for maps and info on activities for the kids). Lunch was tasty (portions enormous) and parking was a breeze. Go early and start before the crowds come. Wonderful opportunity for a tourist or a local.What a gem!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Novemberpeanut
50,A must see - so you can SEE all of LA,"I only had two hours and that was well worth - I probably could have spent 4-6 hours there, including touring the place (all buildings) and the gardens. I would have liked to have brought a blanket and a book and sat on the lawn/garden area for a while. Beautiful buildings and views. Not to mention the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allic2015
50,Culture-Vultures come here 1st! - A Must for any Art-lover or Anyone with any interest in Architecture...,"Unabashedly, I luv the Getty Centre; sorry! I know it's big, vulgar in its ostentatious opulence & grandeur (let's say, in a post-Baroque post-post-Modern way?), cost way too many millions and took far too many years to build, has too many too-polite personnel and a too-small (tho' fab!) Cafe (whereas the Restaurant is so underscaled, appointments AHEAD of a visit are pretty much mandatory!) and the landscaper evidently did a righteous finger-up to the architect (who wanted a pure white cathedral of a centre and presumably with no or as few toilets as possible, judging by the out-of-the-way inconvenience of their locations!) BUT from the moment I stood on the poured concrete platform shaded by the glass and aluminium canopy watching the sleek 'tram' (more like 21st style monorail) slide in, they had me @ the pre-recorded Welcome to the Getty Centre greeting. And then there's the world-class Art collection which though meticulously over-restored (according to my former husband who happens to be an art restorer - and frankly, having seen some of the world's greats housed in various European art galleries, I agree!) is jaw-droppingly awesome (Van Gogh's ORIGINAL Sunflowers & Starry Night, for example, and Muench's original Scream…it's a bit like looking at the contents of a coffee-table book mounted on the wall, which costs considerably more!). When my mother finally came to Los Angeles for a miserable (she hates the place, period) 3 days, my devious solution was to drop her off here in the morning and she was the very last person picked up after they closed. Apparently, the rail personnel kept her in conversation until my car pulled up; oh and BTW, all this is FREE…in Los Angeles?! Go figure: Best Deal Ever! So GO!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EH517
50,Amazing Museum,"This place is majestic. You pay $15 for parking but the whole museum is free. Its architecture is stunning and if you're lucky enough to be there during spring you'll see the beautiful garden in bloom. It's gorgeous. Also, there is a little art room where you can sketch your own masterpiece. One of my favorite places to take friends when they visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASE5585

50,Absolutely loved this place,"Fantastic place to visit. This was one of the greatest highlights of our trip to LA. So many great exhibits, I wish we had more time to spend there. If you love art and architecture plan a full day. Thank you to the Getty's for sharing this with us.Finding a parking spot was difficult, but it was a busy weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991berniem
50,"If you like museums and modern architecture, it's great","I am not a generally a lover of museums... especially in LA. I have been to many amazing museums in Europe, and so I am a little jaded when it comes to museums and the art that you find there. But if you are generally someone who enjoys museums, this is a GREAT place to visit in LA. Highly recommend. The building, the grounds, the ascension up from parking to the actual museum, the art, etc. - all top notch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelovescoffeemore
50,Don't miss,"I have been there a number of times, often taking visitors. It has, of course, an incredible art collection, but the building itself is art. The setting, views and gardens would be worth the visit themselves. How many chances do you have to see a really great art collection in a beautiful setting? And, yes, the tram ride is fun with great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525jimr
50,Fabulous,"Absolutely fantastic here. The outside grounds ,the building and the exhibits are just amazing. You can get really close up to exhibits , which are beautifully placed. You can get here easily by bus but took 2 hours from Marina Del Ray",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annj684
50,Another must-see in Los Angeles,"Not only is their fairly eclectic fine and decorative arts collection world-class, but the buildings and grounds are a work of art unto themselves. And the view is THE BEST in Los Angeles - on a clear day you can see from downtown Los Angeles all the way to the ocean. The Getty Center is the number one attraction on my list of places to take out-of-town guests. Best to either make a reservation (for parking) or to figure out how to take the bus. The Getty Center is definitely one of Los Angeles' premier attractions. For adults and geeky teens. Children? Not really.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3815CYdanielc
50,The Incomparable Getty,"A magnificent collection in an architectural gem with special exhibits, such as the current Hellenic bronzes, together with spectacular views of Los Angeles and its environs make this an unforgettable experience well worth the $15 parking fee but free admittance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesB234
30,Art For Art's Sake,"A spectacular building in a spectacular location - worth the parking fee for the tram ride and the views alone. The almost limitless funding has allowed for a palatial home for art which surely must be one of the most wonderful museums in the world.Pity then that in such an isolated setting high above LA with a captive audience that the catering facilities have such limited stock and opening times. The restaurant closes at 14.30, the cafe at 15.00, the coffee carts had limited stock, most items were sold out, the 100% cake assortment remaining was useless for diabetics.

50,Unbelievably Magnificent Building and Art collection,"On a very hot sunny day we decided to go the Getty Centre, well the art, was amazing, especially Irises by Van Gogh OMG it was worth it just for that, but the rest was outstanding.The gardens are beautiful and the tram ride from the car park was exciting too. Well recommended to any visitor to LA.We would suggest an early start as it gets really busy during the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WD23TRAVELLER
50,A highlight of our trip,"Amazing locale, buildings and gardens, this museum is the perfect setting for a fabulous exhibit on ancient bronzes - Power & Pathos. A significant number of bronze works of art over 2000 years old, assembled in one location. You can visibly see the transition from classical Greek sculpture which idealized the human form to bronze, which enabled artists to begin to represent the human condition in their works. If you are in the area while this show runs, not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HapkidoNinja
50,"Stunning architecture, world-class art and a tram ride!","The Getty's collections and temporary exhibitions are worth a visit in themselves but combine these with an architectural masterpiece, terrific experiential landscapes AND a tram ride and you have an intellectually charged and enjoyable day for all ages (maybe not toddlers.) And it's all for the cost of parking your vehicle ($15)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740sr
50,Loved the Bronze,"This was our second visit to the Getty. We went this time for the Bronze Exposition. Even though it was Labor Day and the place was very busy we really enjoyed the amazing displays. Hurry, the display ends 1 November. Love this place as well as the Getty Villa in Malibu. Both are must see in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgehG8999VY
40,Beautiful place to visit,"I have been to the Getty Center several times. I enjoy the architecture and gardens, along with the art. My biggest complaint is the security guards. Each time I visit I have observed their hypocritical behavior. For example, the scold visitors from leaning on the wall, then they return to their post to lean on the wall. Last visit I watched one grooming his hair in a mirror; the ""mirror"" was a piece of art. Aside from the unfriendly ""security guards"" the other staff are fairly helpful. When I go, I try to not need help which makes the visit more pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992cherim
50,Can't do it all in one day,"This museum was free but so amazing. Including the grounds and the museum there is more to take in than possible. You could spend the entire day. We loved the maze and the flowers. The views from the Getty rival the art in the galleries. The architecture of the museum is also worth the trip. Nice open courtyard to relax and enjoy the view. Pace yourself, there's almost too much to take in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smctucson
50,Ascetic Oasis,"Like the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, but in a completely different way, the Getty Center is as much of an (architectural) masterpiece as any of the artwork that it displays. The collection spans three millennium but is most impressive in the areas that it's founder and namestake enjoyed, namely, Ancient Greek pieces and 18th century French objects. It also houses some remarkable art from the 19th century, incliding impressionist and symbolist works.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fred_shahrooz

50,Outstanding Art Collection in a Magnificent Facility,"The Getty Center located in Los Angeles is perhaps one of the most magnificent art facilities anywhere. The center alone, not the collection, cost a billion dollars to build. It is light and airy. You can get up close. The center includes some wonderful art pieces and its collection is continually growing. There are places to eat, the grounds are landscaped, outdoor statues adorn the grounds - and oh, and it is free! You only pay a modest parking fee! Take the collection highlight tour.

50,A wonderful visit to an incredibly interesting museum/garden complex.,"We were visiting from the east coast and spent a glorious morning visiting the Getty Center. Museum is free and you only pay for parking in the garage. A well designed, creative electric train takes you up the mountain to the museum. Everything about this place was surprisingly interesting and very well managed. Even the cafeteria offered a wide range of eating choices which were tasty. Burgers, to salads to other hot plates in a beautiful setting. The gardens were outstanding and well managed as well. A must see for visitors to Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maadiman
50,Not to be missed,"On our last day in LA we decided to visit the Ghetty Centre. It was simply awesome and should not be missed especially if you are into Design, Art, Architecture or Landscape Design. The buildings and the spaces that surround them are just wonderful and around every corner is yet another 'special space', texture, artwork, or view framed by the most amazing structure I have ever been fortunate to experience.

50,"the 405 is terrible, but this is worth it","It's a big art museum, it's a good one, and it's free (except for parking). You can either take the tram or walk up to the museum from the garage (the walk is 5-10 minutes and quite pretty). The museum itself is a lovely, sprawling complex organized by period and style with a plaza in the middle. There is one rotating exhibition hall, and it has never bored me. There's also a fine dining restaurant on site, and if you can swing the cost of a nice meal it's a good way to punctuate the visit and give your eyes and mind a rest before diving into more art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dietcoupon

50,Love Art? Don't miss this!,"Let me put it this way; if you're a lover of the fine arts, particularly painting and sculpture, the Getty Center is Nirvana. Right now they have a display of bronze Hellenistic sculpture that is unrivalled anywhere; the Seated Boxer is worth the trip by itself. Must be at least 50 bronze pieces from Greece, some recovered from sunken ships. Also showing is an Andrea Del Sarto collection of sketches and paintings that reveal his skill at chalk sketching and incorporation of sketch materials into finished paintings; fascinating! Their permanent collection of European masterworks is fabulous, from the Renaissance through the late 19th century. And the views from the Center over LA and the ocean are magnificent! Plan a full day there, and you won't be disappointed. And it's free! Just pay $15 for parking, and you're in! You're gonna love this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,Bronzes for the ages,"When we were there,on a Friday in summer, the line for the shuttle tram to take you up to the main grounds went quickly.

50,Absolute LA - highlight,Spending a day at the Getty Center is the most wonderful gift you can give yourself. Everything is extremely well organized - starting from the parking lot with a train and being received in the central hall by volunteers.

We spent an entire day in the Getty Center and hugely enjoyed also the spectacular gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanderlaanrenate
30,"Lovely gardens, but not a great deal more","The museum felt a little sparse, and with it being the top attraction on TripAdvisor I expected more.

50,"lovely place to see art, enjoy the gardens, and eat","This is one of my favorite places in West LA. Entrance is free, except they charge $15 for parking. The Getty Center is built on a hill top, which you go up with a tram. It is located just west of Westwood and the 405 in LA. It is a small campus of 5-6 buildings, each of them having two to three floors. At any given time there can be exhibitions of paintings, sculpting, photographs etc. The galleries are extensive and comprehensive; you could easily spend a few days just walking the exhibits on display. However, The Getty Center also has beautiful and well-maintained grounds. There is a really nicely groomed garden with a variety of plants (cactii, roses, shrubs, trees etc.). The views are spectacular. You can see the all around LA. The haze and smog limit your visibility, but on a good day you can see the Ocean and Santa Monica. Finally, the food here is pretty good. The cafeteria has reasonable selections, ranging from salads to sandwiches to burgers. I particularly like their garlic fries, though this time I felt the garlic was a bit scarce. In the evening I saw some couples enjoying a wine and cheese plate, so, they have good snack foods too. The sunset from The Getty Center is also beautiful. When we visited there was an evening concert as part of the ""Saturdays off the 405"" series. We didn't stay for the concert, but a decent crowd was starting to gather for this evening event. All in all, The Getty Center is a place to come again and again, as it will take at least 4-5 visits to go through everything. I love the scenery, and the gardens, as well as the food, and will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEtravel2
50,"Excellent, relaxing afternoon! Amazing Sunsets!","This is a beautiful, architecturally modern museum with lovely exhibits and gardens. Even with the draught, the Getty manages to keep it's outside gardens lovely and interesting. If you can, make reservations in the restaurant - the food is very good, albeit pricey, but it has a great view of the surrounding area and is perfect at the end of the day. The sunsets here are great, with views from the highest level of the property. Lots of areas are in shade, so it is good for both warm and cool days. The tram ride up from the parking area is nice. Good for families and couples alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Montagirl

You have to take a tram from the garage to the top where Getty Center is situated.The place reminds me a little like the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC and Legion of Honors in SF.

Mr. Getty and his trust obviously had/have a lot of money, as his collection of art is sophisticated, eclectic, and extensive. The gallery view above the garden is a fabulous place to view Los Angeles to the south. Further, the garden is a great place to teach kids geometry --there are spirals, triangles, squares, etc. found in the flora arrangements of the garden. If one is an antiquities buff, the Getty Center and the sister museum, the Getty Villa, are absolute must-sees!

50,The best part of LA,"Los Angeles gets a lot of bad rep.I am firmly convinced those people have never been to the Getty Center. This museum is hands down the best one I've ever been to. Granted, I haven't been to any of the European ones, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.It offers a great view of the city and the docents (volunteer guides) were all well trained and knowledgeable of their subject areas. The architecture of the place frames the city perfectly. The rule of thumb here is that if you ever see a square formed by the buildings, there's a view worth seeing.One of the arches there was even said to frame the sunset perfectly (i.e. the sun is smack in the center of it, which would make for a great photo similar to the Stone Henge). Unfortunately, I was unable to see it.My biggest regret is that I didn't spend an entire day here. If I had a choice, I would have arrived early in the morning and stayed until it closed.Unlike other museums, there's also a beautiful outdoor part to it where visitors can recharge after an exhibit.A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HNGK

50,Power and Pathos is a rare treat!,"We took a trip out to Los Angeles just to see this incredible exhibit at the Getty. The museum itself and its dramatically perched location, with views to Catalina, make any trip there worthwhile. But the rare opportunity to see fifty of the few remaining Greek bronzes in one exhibit, makes a visit a cultural necessity. You must go! The artistry, workmanship, and emotion captured in these works of art are both moving and astonishing. It's truly difficult to fathom that most of the works on display were created nearly two thousand years ago, let alone in modern times. The Pugilist bronze captures gut-wrenching emotion and has such a presence, one's skin begins to crawl in anticipation of him bursting to life. The museum itself is a beauty and the views are exquisite, especially on a clear day. The museum is free, but there is a charge for parking at the base of the hill. A tram takes you up to the museum. This place is one of Los Angeles' true gems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mingfatsai

50,Do not miss this gem,Visiting this museum is a must whenever you visit LA. The only fee is $15 car parking charge but there is no entry fee. The museum is accessed by a tram from the car park to main building on a hill. The paintings and other collections are extraordinary. There is a restaurant and lots of sitting opportunities to recoup after long walks. The staff are very helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andynaija
50,Getty Center is beautiful!,The Getty Center is absolutely beautiful. Very easy to find parking. The tram ride was very pleasant. It was not crowded. Lots of beautiful art in the Getty Center. Before I left I got a coupon voucher to park free at the Getty Villa. I was also given a free admission voucher!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling888
50,This is a must see attraction,This is an absolute must when visiting LA. This is one of the very best museums we have ever visited and we have done them all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipe266
50,Go with a car full of people!,It's a good place to go for the paintings and scenery of LA. It's quite big so plan accordingly. Parking is $15 so fill your car with people to make the trip worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KS448
50,Beautiful!,"The Getty Center is a beautiful museum located high above Los Angeles. The views are breath taking. On a clear day, you can see the Pacific. My family and I had the joy of seeing Irises by van Gogh. What an amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Di0nnaP
50,Must see,"This museum is a must-see on a trip to LA even if you are not all that into art museums. The architecture, grounds and view are all worth the price of admission. The art is breathtaking as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lolalemon
50,Beautiful site,"Beautiful gardens, architecture, and art. One of the highlights of our LA trip, came here directly from the airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hkrsk
50,1ST STOP OF TRIP,The Getty Center is on top of a hill that you can only access by tram after parking at the bottom of the hill. Art center was pretty cool to walk through. We had lunch inside the center( okay) recommended for anyone to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJB7775
50,"A very pleasant and beautiful - and free! - place with great art (Rembrandts, Van Gogh Irises, Degas, etc.)","Great museum (European Art medieval to 1900) and gardens - free, except for $15 parking fee! A fun tram ride takes you from parking garage to the top of the hill. A couple of sculpture gardens have modern sculpture, but the heart of the collection is in four pavilions, paintings on the top floor and decorative arts (including fabulous French period rooms) at the plaza level. Special exhibit on Hellenistic bronzes, from museums all over the world, is wonderful. There is a restaurant and a cafe, but if you spend much time eating you won't be able to see everything in one day. The labels and signage are excellent. You can get a free audio guide, but just reading the signs is very helpful. The gardens are beautifully planned, with a wooden ramp winding down to the amazing central garden. The waterfall here is still operating, while other water features at the Getty Center have been turned off because of the water shortage. Any similar museum would cost $25, but thanks to the generosity of J. Paul Getty, this is free for all to enjoy. He and his successors spent loads money not just on the art but the gorgeous and functional architecture that houses and supports it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelNut12309
50,Don't miss this museum,A world class museum that is designed to educate and entertain everyone. It is well designed and completely accessible. And you can't beat the price - free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOCDQ
50,The Getty - A Los Angeles Gem,"The Getty is one those true LA icons. It is an amazing place to visit, but make sure you set aside a good portion of your day for it; remember it's a museum and there is a lot to see.First, the only thing you need to pay for is parking. It's $15 per car. However, if you're going with several people(as we did)and split the bill, it works our great. It's subterranean, so your car isn't percolating in the sun. There is no entrance fee for The Getty. You will need to pay for food and souveniers.Catch the convenient tram to the top, and you're there.If it feels overwhelming, no worries!! There is always someone there that can guide. Or just head over to the visitors desk in the main lobby and the friendly staff will help you with anything you need. There is also a coat check, if warranted.Roam and oggle at one the most extensive art collections in California. Oh! And! Don't forget your picnic lunch. You can either buy your lunch at The Getty or you can bring your own. It's complete up to you. Go down to the pavillion for seating or you can hang out on the grass.When you're done, just pick up and head right back in or you can stay outdoors and discover the unique architecture that is The Getty and the garden.Bring friends, family, or out of towners! It's simply a Gem in the middle of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
50,WOW,"What can I say - it was fabulous. You'll need at least 5 hours - we were there for 6, including lunch (which was good and reasonably priced, considering they had a 'lock' on where you could dine), and we didn't really see it all. Definitely want to go back. Beautiful art, sculptures, furniture, tapestries - just a wonder to behold in the buildings themselves. and the only cost (besides food) was the $15 parking fee! The exhibits are laid out really well, and signs are self explanatory. It's too much to take in in just one visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlondieOriginal2014
50,A must when in LA,The Getty center is a must if you are in town. Impressive complex with great architecture and the view of the city is amazing. Parking is easy and a small train will bring you up to the museum complex.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JH1052
50,fantastic museum,Fantastic location with great view beautiful architecture and very good collection. the exhibition of Greek bronzes was absolutely fabulous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koshka1606
50,Well worth a visit and great views,We had been recommended to start our tour of LA here. You start by getting the train from the car park to the top. Great views over the hills on the way up to the Centre. There is a charge for the car park but it was minimal and the ticket can also be used on the same day at the Getty Villa. Lovely museum with lots to see and do and amazing views in every direction at the top. It was a very hot day when we visited so didn't quite do the museum justice. We got to see lots of major pieces of works and took in the views so glad we visited. Satellite Navigation takes you past the entrance so as you get near look or the signs indicating the parking. Otherwise you end up back on the freeway!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/338sharone
50,Amazing,"It's a really sublime for those who love art.Council to provide for a full day to spend at the Getty, is huge and full of galleries not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R547NXmartinc
50,Fantastic for art lovers!,"Be prepared to spend a good number of hrs admiring all the painting, artifacts, view of Los Angeles and the garden. Parking is not free but the museum is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vsg670120
50,Amazing!,"The Getty is like the Disney of museums, so much to see and do! I would recommend dedicating 2-4 hours for your visit if you want to see everything. If you can, take a tour! I took an architectural tour and then a walking tour of the gardens and learned so much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221cristinau
50,Excelent view of LA and more...,We went late (an hour before closing) but still managed to enjoy part of the museum and the excellent views and surroundings. Totally worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cesar_mtm
50,Wowed by the collection,"I loved (and still do) the old Getty. The new Getty center does not have the charm of the old, but what an exquisite collection! Although different in scale, the collections are comparable to theMet, Louvre, Vatican. I was amazed by the number and quality if the work on display, old Masters and older sculptures. Their collection of Greek and Roman sculpture is rivsaled by few, butthe surprise for me was how extensive the colection of Impressionist painting was. If you are interested in art, museums (and not just seeing it as a local tourist highlight) set a day aside. You will need that much time (at least),",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eswope
50,Undoubtedly #1 visitor's choice in LA,"I have always loved Getty, since its opening. This year I have had more out of town visitors than any previous years, so I have been there more often. This is the place I take them, if there is no time for anywhere else! The beautiful gardens, with refreshing Ocean breeze that cools down any unbearably hot summer days. The one of kind temporary exhibits and amazing permanent collection. One person or 6 or more same price ticket for parking fee. I am so glad for the new menu in the restaurant, love the food and price and the view!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbiscuitt
50,Enjoyable!,There is something for everybody here - even if you are not an art enthusiast! For me it was finally being able to view a Van Gogh and Monet.....amazing! The best part is that there are so many different styles that one can spend time seeing. You can even visit the place all by yourself....and land up spending half a day happily!! The downside - it is always crowded so be prepared!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sacagawea79
50,This place is a masterpiece filled with masterpieces,The Getty is cool from beginning to end. You parked in a remote parking and take a tram to the area. This makes it feel so exclusive. It is spacious and well laid out. The art is displayed with loving care. It is a place where you can actually meditate on the art as well as learn a few things along the way. The view of the city is terrific as well… this has become a centerpoint of the art world and it is well deserved!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveholden
50,Simply exquisite!,"The Getty Center is an exquisite work of art. It is an architectural masterpiece that encompasses both a collection of museums and an outdoor garden. Set on a hill in the outskirts of LA and Santa Monica, not only does the Getty provide an escape from the hectic city but also a great view of the urban skyline. Whether you stay here for a couple hours or bring a good book just to read in the grass all day, there's no need to rush cause this spot is definitely rejuvenating for the soul. Just remember to bring comfortable shoes because you'll be doing tons of exploring!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colecee
50,Perfect for some Me Time,"Go early in the morning, beat the crowds, take the Architecture Tour, teke in the Getty white, the T-shirt white, and the stingy splashes of color; the arches, the proportions, the views... All in silence Sip espresso and water for sustenance.... Get the audio guide -- in a language you know more-or-less, but are still learning. Stay all day. Or come back for the evening concert. Return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoWoTad
20,Overrated,"I basically came here because it was rated the top place to visit in LA on this site and I was so disappointed.First off, don't come here if it's a hot day. It's up in the mountains so will be extremely hot here...scorching.Second, if you like art museums, which is what this is, the LA county one is way better.I feel the drive and scramble for parking, not to mention the extremely hot oven conditions in the underground parking lot, and long wait for train to the museum is just not worth the trouble.Better bet is to go to Venice Beach and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxD87
50,"A wonderful place for architecture, art and culture. Lovely gardens. Nice view on L.A.","This place inspires peace and love for the culture. Inviting people to relax. Better take one day for this lovely place. Drive to its parking. Take the shuttles. Walking around the different pavillons for different exhibitions, admiring the architecture of this place or having a rest at the Central Garden. Panoramic view looking south L.A. Do not miss the succulent plant & cactus garden!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiiiGo
50,A Must See,An amazing experience! The architectural tour was enlightening. Such a beautiful and thought-through place. really enjoyed the 6hours!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808JoAnnM

50,Most beautiful museum in US,This is the most beautiful museum I have visited in the US. I have visited plenty. I am talking strictly on the architecture... The collection is very good but architecturally is AMAZING!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z671NCjosem
50,A fantastic villa,"We visited with a very uninterested 13 year old. Would have loved to have spent more time here. Loads to see, read and learn. Takes a lot longer to go around than you think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209claret
50,The Getty Center with an additional plus - The Getty Villa - a must see while in LA,"You can never go wrong by visiting the Getty Center. In all aspects it is a Cultural and Foodie Hub where you can enjoy an Rembrandt with a good glass of wine followed by a visit to the Gardens and a lovely e-rail back to the parking level. There is no hassle here, just a superb collection with a beautiful history and if you have some additional time be sure to book the Getty Villa in Malibu. This is a lovely destination in a beautiful city. Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1_Traveler_from_LA
50,Don't miss the Getty Center,"If you are in LA and at all interested in art and architecture don't miss The Getty Center. The art collections are wonderful but it is much more than yet another art museum. The architecture is stunning as is the location in the hills, the outside spaces and the gardens. The whole experience is food for the soul. Take your time to soak it all in. I would not try to do both Getty museums in one day unless you are short of time. The tours are well worthwhile. We found the architecture tour gave us a good understanding of what the architect wanted to achieve with the building which included creating several outside spaces where you can take a break, have a coffee and recharge before moving on to the next exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennyjoy5
40,Make the trip to Getty Center,"Not only is it worth the trip to view the art inside the museum, but the building and grounds, views of LA, and gardens all are part of the draw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calajohn

50,A World Class Museum,"We had 2 nights in Santa Monica week of 20 August 15. Following a recommendation from friends who had visited the Getty Centre previously we visited this world class facility.We travelled to Getty centre via public bus from Santa Monica. The bus service is great with helpful information from hotel staff re bus numbers and well as bus drivers.This has to be one of the most amazing museums I have ever visited around the world. Watch the video on the way in as it provides very interesting information.The architecture is stunning, very friendly helpful staff, exhibits are world class. I had no idea that this was so amazing. It's very tranquil, with lovely sculptures and garden. The view over Los Angeles is breath taking as its set high on the hills that overlook the city.The Getty foundation continues the work of its founder, promoting conservation, research and adding to the collection.This museum is a must see for all ages and entry is FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/656wendyt
50,A must see in LA... please don'rt rush !,"I simply loved this whole centre. The architecture, the collection of Arts, the view of the City below, the garden and the whole space is just too good. It has so much to offer. It is away from the hustle bustle of the city. So please try to spend some time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. The buildings are so beautiful and so photogenic. It has a great courtyard to sit and have lunch. You will have to leave your car at the bottom ( parking is $15) and then will have to take the ram to go up to the Getty Centre. It is totally free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chatsuparna
50,A Must Visit Place in Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is AMAZING! Even if you are not an avid art fan you can appreciate this place for the breadth of exhibits, and the architecture of the buildings themselves. And no entrance fee, which is a definite plus if you are going with your family.We hired head sets and embarked on a self-guided tour.I say ""embarked"" because the Centre is so big, that you really need a whole day to enjoy it all. But a whole day might be a bit long for children and teenagers.We tried one of the cafes for lunch. Prices weren't too bad and the food was fine.The day we went they were setting up for an evening concert outside. According to the info at the Center it was to be an evening of poetry and music.Unfortunately, we couldn't hang around for it, but I'm sure it would have been a great evening. Definitely can recommend a day at the Getty Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishyt2015
50,Getty Museum,"The Getty is ""tops"" in LA: top in culture, top in location and view of the city, top in bringing world class art at no cost to anyone interested in the arts! It reminds one of European art museums. You can wander galleries and gardens until your senses experience overload!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/583tomek
50,Best part is the gardens - don't miss it,"OK once you get over the $15 parking fee - and the 20 min wait for the tram (or you can also walk up the hill for 20 mins) - you won't regret the experience. Great art, interesting exhibitions, great food at the Restaurant (don't miss the bouillabaise), fabulous gardens with a maze, cacti garden and mini supertrees of bougainvillas plus of course the unbeatable views of Los Angeles and the infamous 405.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/owhatfun
50,A real treasure for tourists and Angelinos....never gets old!,"I am a NY transplant, living in LA for 4 years. Not only is the Getty a must see for our out of town visitors, but I enjoy going with friends at least once per season (and yes, we do have seasons in LA....and the Central Garden is different each season). I always do the tours.....architecture tour, garden tour are always informative and different....I learn new things every time. The highlights tour gives an in depth discussion of a few select pieces and is definitely worth the time. Honestly, the dolcents are amazing....knowledgable and entertaining. The views are spectacular...sometimes I never go inside! The cafe has the best museum food I have ever had....a huge selection, reasonable prices, and the outside seating is divine. No matter how many people are at the museum, it never feels crowded.....and the tram line moves rapidly even in the busiest times. You will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loisv980
50,"GO TO BOTH GETTY MUSEUMS, ""THE GETTY CENTER"" AND THE GETTY VILLA FOR 4 HOURS EACH ON THE SAME DAY.....","""Can you see everything in 4 hours""...a question was asked. That reminded me that there are TWO ""Getty Museums"".....the big white one on the hill which is the NEWEST one and is very ""grand"" in many ways........cost 1 BIllon USD to build...and the other is called ""The Getty Villa"" which is in Malibu. And, since parking is $15 for EACH ONE...there is a SPECIAL PARKING DEAL that if you go to BOTH on the same day you only pay the $15 ONCE. BUT....to go to the Getty VILLA YOU NEED TO GO ONLINE A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR THE VILLA....because parking is limited at The Villa. The ""Getty Center"" Museum on the hill, no reservations are needed. Thus ""the best"" way is to see BOTH museums on the SAME day....make the reservations for the Getty Villa....for say the morning...then go to the ""Getty Center"" on the Hill in the afternoon. Yes, about 4 hours for each one is enough to see most of the stuff in BOTH of them. Enjoy...very worth the effort to go to BOTH Getty Museums!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824johnb
50,Spend the day,"There is no place quite like tge Getty. The exhibits are top notch. The grounds are works of art in tgeir own right. You could spend hours enjoying the views. The restaurant is excellent. Slow down, learn, appreciate, give all your senses a treat. You'll leave feeling replenished. A spa day for the mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWolf1
50,Amazing,"The array of artwork is amazing and even the architecture of the building stands as artwork. My favorite exhibits were the period furniture, not often you see so many rooms with furniture. Make sure to take some time with the exhibit that breaks down the three pieces and how to determine the era of furniture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyrbeatty
50,A quiet place in LA,One of the best deals for culture in LA. Good for the soul. A quiet yet fun day to be had seeing the art and the gardens. I do miss the original center's mediterranean ambiance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426artd
50,No 1,Gretty center always the no one attraction place for visit. The gretty centre is absolutely stunning. What a beautiful garden and it maintained very well. I have have enjoyed the trams with my kids. There no cost for enter the center even tram also free of cost. A bit problem of parking cause huge public are present always there. Over all I have no wards to recommended. You must must must must must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/admsn
40,Stunning-but a Warning about the weather!,"As most others have said its a beautiful building perched atop the hills in LA. Best to get there via car and be warned parking in their underground garage takes time on the weekend. I love museums and this is an outstanding structure with some beautiful pieces. HOWEVER, we visited in August 2015 and it was an extremely warm day..in the 90's. Having to wait in the (covered) area for the shuttles was extremely uncomfortable and and slow. Yes its a covered area which is better than being exposed to the sun directly but not for anyone with issues with extreme heat. Perhaps some misters like those found in Vegas would be nice. Once arriving up the hill you are totally exposed walking from one building to another (and the parasols available to shade yourselves were all taken). Going inside each building was a relief from the heat. Frankly it was hard to enjoy the works after having got so overheated. If like me you hate extreme heat, check the weather before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9429YLmelissam

There's a tram that takes you from the parking area to the museum. If you go the same day to the Getty Villa as well, you can get a free parking voucher from the Getty museum for the Getty Villa. Must prebook the free tickets to the Getty Villa in advance though. The gardens at the Getty Museum are beautiful. The art pieces in the museum itself are fabulous.

50,A unique museum in a beautiful setting,"The way to the getty is itself part of the experience, and the architecture and gardens fit in to and highlight the LA view. While the collection is not as extensive as other world class museums, it includes several masterpieces, each alone which is worth the visit. Titian's penitent magdalen was the highlight of my trip. The temporary exhibition of de Sarto drawings was incredible.The space itself was pleasant to be in. I was able to meet my usually museum-phobic husband afterwards for a walk in the garden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batnadivh

50,Amazing setting great collection,Even if you don't like museum you owe it to yourself to visit this one. One thing Americans excel at is crowd management and from the beginning where you are led to tram to take you uphill you are met by friendly staff to lead the way. A short and swift ride takes you up to the museum complex. The grounds in and of themselves are wonderful with expansive view of the city and sea. The collection is equally impressive . The variety of masters on display is remarkable. Pleasantly surprised at the no lack admission fee!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EPWB
50,"Interesting place, worth a visit","Worth a visit even if it is just for the views of LA. Really interesting stuff if you are into history. A bit randomly put together but nice all the same. Lovely train ride up to the center. No where really to eat, could do with a nice restaurant. Would recommend a visit but wont take a whole day so make sure you have something else planned. Also Sat Nav takes you to the wrong place so a map is handy with this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephie_88
40,Impressive but should not be compared with other museums around Europe,"The museum is grand and impressive. No wonder it is rated very highly among greater LA attractions. It was a bit crowded at the train (that takes you up the hill), so we preferred to walk up which was nice even with 95 degrees under the sun. The collection is heavily biased towards medieval times, still it is enjoyable to go around and learn about the history. For someone who has been to museums in Europe (Louvre in Paris, for example), Getty might be a bit of less impressive or even disappointment (for the high rank it is currently given). Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours or even more at the center, though the food is expensive and not so great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zartashuzmi
50,''Study'' well the tranportation,"It's an adventure to go by bus but you can go.It's far from the center but it's well organised, free admission and it's worthy.

50,"Dazzling, Dancing Bronzes","The Getty Museum has organized a stunning show of Hellenistic bronzes. In ""Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenisic World"" they have brought together 1/4 of the known bronzes. The labels are informative without being overwhelming, the placement of statues invites comparisons, and the one map gives context. Although I usually avoid bronzes, these alive pieces begged me to dance with them. If only I could. My only regret is that the time is short for another visit between now and the exhibit's closing in early November, 2015.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13

50,Outstanding art immersion,"Absolutely overwhelmed with the range of art and the generous scope of the campus at this site. Beautiful architecture housing 5 pavilions of art, and research. You need at least 3 days to fully appreciate all there is to see, and because it is free, it is crowded on weekends, so go during the week, early. Views of LA from its various plazas are photogenic, and the gardens are also worthy of their own visit.I loved it and will be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraLlawenyth

40,Must-see,This museum is a must-see in Los Angeles. The building and grounds are a sight in and of themselves. It is a great spot for beautiful photography. The art collections were not exactly my favorite as there was very little post-19th century but it didn't stop me from enjoying the day. Go early as it gets crowded waiting for a tram later in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emegee5
50,Worth it for the views alone.,"It took a little finagling to get my partner to agree to spend some time at the Getty Center on our vacation, as they are not a big art lover; but with so many positive reviews, I knew it was not a place we could afford to miss.In the end, we were both incredibly happy that we made the trip and spent about half the day marveling both art and the architecture that make this place incredibly beautiful and unique to visit. We had such a great time seeing the art, and exploring the gardens. The tram ride was fun and it was not to crowded. It is a bit out of the way from the city, but the views that you are awarded with in making the trip are absolutely worth it. We only wish we could have stayed late to watch the sun set and the lights turn on across the landscape.For a museum that has the largest private endowment in the world, it certainly did not disappoint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpaupau

50,"Amazing, Inspirational Gallery!",This is one of the most impressive Museum buildings I have visited. I have been to quite a few places in Europe but this is really unique. The modern architecture set against the blue California sky with the view of LA and the coast in the distance is awesome. It's so inspiring. It's a shame we didn't have longer to look around the galleries. The parking lot was busy when we arrived and we finally found a space in the underground bunker. Then it was an easy and scenic tram ride up to the Getty Centre. We had a very nice lunch in the café.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3788QBkatem
50,My Happy Place,"The view and the architecture of this stunning place alone is enough to justify the trip. I come here when I need to space out and forget about whatever stresses I have going on at any given time. It's peacegul and beautiful, no matter what they have going on. The gardens are incredible and the library is an amazing resource. I am local to LA and this is a must see for out of town guests and a must revisit for me as often as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCLALALA
50,Remarkable!,"Do not miss the gardens! So much to see, be sure to allow for a full day. Eating here is expensive, but since admission is just the $15.00 for your car it all evens out.

50,Magnificent Melange of Art & Architecture,"The Getty is one of the most impressive museums that I have ever seen. The architecture alone would be worth a visit, and the art is exceptional. The entire campus feels like a perfectly designed outdoor living area where they happened to place all kinds of great art. The views are breathtaking and you will want to re-design your garden and your house after your visit. Best of all, the size is very manageable.TIP: Sit down for a bite to eat. The Garden Cafe is very nice, and you can also go the larger cafe and restaurant near the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTravelerRadio

40,Love those Romans,"This is the repository of J. Paul Getty's collection of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. The villa was built in the 1970s, modeled after a precursor in Herculaneum, destroyed by Vesuvius. It's amazing what throwing a ton of money at competent architects and landscape designers can do. Though a tribute to ego as much as to art history, it's hard to resist the beauty of this place.One of the interesting things is that it's not easy to get to unless you have a car. Traveling solo and auto-less, I took a series of city buses to get there and back, which actually added to the experience. Waiting for the return bus on a semi-deserted stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, with the ocean waves rolling in a few meters below, created a pretty mellow vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJPaway
50,Must see when in Los Angeles,"I'm not into museums at all and struggled with visiting the Getty. I'm glad I did - the views are breathtaking, the buildings are beautiful and the sketching room is a wonderful way to get non-artsy people involved. There are plenty of food options as well. It's definitely a must see when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657despinac

Arrive early to enjoy the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinsaround
50,Spectacular building,"We first went to the Getty in 1998 soon after it opened and we have long wanted to return. The building itself is unique and this time we took the architecture tour (free, 45 minutes) and learned more about the specific things the designer did to make it such a memorable set of structures. Due to the drought the water features were off which was admirable but disappointing. The collections are very good and the special exhibitions are exceptionally well done; we became fascinated by one that showed how medieval illuminated manuscripts were made.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymat44
50,"Interesting architecture, beautifully landscaped gardens and magnificent views of LA","If you're in two minds whether to go, or not, then go. Make sure you set your GPS to enter via 1200 N. Sepulveda Blvd. You park near the entrance in the vast undercover car park and catch a train up the hill to the Getty Centre. Entry is free but the parking cost $15 which was pretty reasonable we thought. Best time to go is late afternoon so you can admire the gardens (take a picnic), the views and also have time to walk around the different buildings to see some the exhibits. As the sun sets go outside to one of the balconies overlooking LA and watch the neon spectacle. We really loved the our afternoon and evening visit there and would thoroughly recommend the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Al6783
50,Beautiful art and architecture for $15.00,"We have visited this place for several years now and can't get enough of it. Beautiful architecture, garden and art makes it worth the visit.

50,Beautifully designed art museum,"The museum facility is beautifully designed of stone and glass with an excellent view of Los Angeles. We spent several enjoyable hours here. There were a number of school groups at that time; it was nice to see them there. It was even fun taking the tram up to the museum from the parking deck. The exhibits were enjoyable, especially the Impressionists. We particularly were happy to see Van Gogh's Irises on display. The gardens were lovely as well and definitely worth spending some time in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LissaJ41
50,"'Power and Pathos',Eye opening Bronze Sculpture of Hellenistic World","The life-size, rare weary bearded boxer, seated after a fight was breath taking and my favorite. This artful blend of art and history is a once in a lifetime opportunity of 51 pieces in this exhibit that is gone November first. I was not familiar with 320 year BC- 400 BC & exceptional introduction. Nothing like this will come around again for a very long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camopmom

50,"The view, the architecture, the gardens!","The Getty Center is truly a must see in Los Angeles. Richard Meier's travertine and precision construction are breathtaking upon first encounter. The art collection is continually improving and the photo collection, in particular, is worth finding your way to the bottom floor of a building number that escapes me.The gardens have, over the years, been whimsical and instructive with surprising water features. Best of all is the panoramic view — downtown LA to Manhatten Beach to Santa Monica and the Pacific itself. Memory-making sunsets.Be sure to check the website for hours, parking info, etc. and be sure to check traffic on the 405 Freeway to avoid congestion. The tram ride to the top of the hill and museums can take awhile, both queuing for the cars and the ride. If you are in hiking shape, ask about walking up the hill!If you have the opportunity, watch the DVD Concert of Wills: Making the Getty Center. Fascinating and you may enjoy the Center all the more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0nference_g0er
50,Most Beautiful Place on Earth,"I absolutely love visiting the Getty Center. Forget, for a second, about the billions of dollars of incredible art housed in these buildings. The buildings themselves and the location of the Getty high in the hill of Brentwood make this place one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.The art is spectacular....the collection of impressionist paintings are amazing but really the entire collection is incredible...I really ejoy looking at all the old hand painted and written books.There are also some incredible restaurants in the Getty so plan on spending a whole day there. I love the place so much that I proposed to my wife there!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fryguy89

50,The Getty,This is one of cheapest and best attractions in Los Angeles as you only have to pay for parking and if you coordinate your itinerary with the Getty villa in Malibu. It becomes two attractions for the price of one parking.The Getty center is one of my getaway if I missed the attractions and paintings of Europe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirgilR_13
50,Love the Getty,"I have been at the Getty three times, twice to see the art and once for a meeting. I love it all, but the travel on the freeway is a pain. If you go during the high traffic hours, be prepared to park on the freeway. It took one hour to travel ten miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenamX8474OS

40,Unparalleled art & history in one place,"LOVED the variety of art at the Getty...and it's different than when I came 6 years ago.

So venture out and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greta4149
50,Modern twist on classic art leaves us wanting more,"The location alone is enough to make a person happy all day. We got there early before the crowds and the heat, and spent the day in the modern wing. The spaces are wonderful, roomy and lending themselves to contemplation. Plenty of room to sit and the guards are not pompous. Then when you go outside? Wow! I highly recommend the Getty Museum its well worth the price of parking (which is the only cost). We ate at the fine dining restaurant and the food was amazing. Nothing better than champagne on the Getty Terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Gal71
50,A microscope into the past,"This March I had some relatives visiting from Europe. The last time I visited was about 30 years ago, so visiting the renovated Museum was way overdue.

50,Get to the Getty,"For the classic art lover, a trip to one of the two Gettys is really a must. The center, the more recent addition in Westwood, is really a marvelous museum housing a variety of Classical collections. It is an expansive lay out including an architecturally designed garden where you could picnic if you wish. The collections are both extensive and exceptional as Getty is mandated to expand its collections yearly. Baroque, Romantic, Neoclassical, pottery, even a full wing replicating the living quarters of a King of France - you name it the center has it, as well as nicely integrated learning kiosks to engage visitors. Plan for the full day so you can linger and enjoy the space which takes in the mist from the ocean. The only real cost is parking for $15, and what catches your eye in the gift shop. From the free umbrellas to the tram ride up to the museum, it's all state of the art ( no pun intended) and well worth the visit. Visit the other Getty too if you have time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinel227
50,Great place for all ages,"This past week I took my 9 year old grand daughter to the Getty for her first visit. We both had a great time. It was great to get her reaction to different styles of painting . She really liked a lot of older furniture on display , was very intergeted with the wood in-lay and kept saying furniture today was to simple. She got to sketch for a while in an area where staff had set up several paintings and statues. The Getty provided benches with supports for sketch pad and provided paper , pencils and pastels. A Getty stamp was placed on finished work of art. There is no cost to enter the Getty except for cost of parking , $8.00. In past have there at night for free concerts. The gardens alone along with the view are worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jglinco

Highly recommended, you will love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazmikc
50,Stunning setting,"A truly worthwhile site to visit. The buildings and gardens are fantastic and on a clear day, the view all the way to the ocean and downtown is wonderful. Parking is easy, you pay for parking, the museum otherwise is free. Lovely restaurant as well as a cafe to have a nice lunch during your visit. Lots of kids touring in groups when we were there but they did not bother us, the place is huge. I highly recommend the gardens as a special place, especially for photographers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adnill
50,"Beautiful location, lovely vistas, incredible artwork","Wonderful way to spend the day. Take advantage of the many tours available. There are also several dining choices, so you don't need to lug up food for a picnic. Rather, eat inside or outside and view the lovely surroundings in elegant or purely casual cafes. Take a tour of the gardens. Also, if you begin here, you can spend the afternoon at the Getty Villa with no additional parking charge. Enjoy the Villa (tours available also) in the late afternoon hours, then go down to the beach at Malibu for the sunset over the ocean. Magnificent day to be had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dance4fun2
50,The Getty Center,"The Getty Center looms above Los Angeles from its hillside perch requiring visitors to embark upon an art pilgrimage to discover the center's offerings. As J. Paul Getty revered Ancient Greek art, the modern visitor to this temple of art must follow a present day version of the ancient's ascent to temple for worship.The Center is located in the hills, on Sepulveda Blvd., just to the side of the 405 freeway. It's a hike up from Sunset Blvd, and in a mostly residential area, so there is not much else in the vicinity, excluding the UCLA campus, but that too is quite a hike. There is one bus that does stop outside the Getty, and if you are not on that, you are coming by car. Parking is $15, $10 if you arrive after 5pm on Wednesday or Saturday, the two days they are open past their regular 5:30pm closing till 9:00pm.Once you've made your way into the hills and parked your car, you make your way to the Center""s train depot. Museum personnel will guide you into a train that will then transport you to the top. Passengers disembark onto the open plaza with killer views that stretch out over the ocean, before mounting the last few steps up to the center.Phew! You made it! Accessible this is not. It's a planned destination, especially considering the infamously horrendous traffic on the 405.But those who make the effort will be rewarded with artwork including Van Gogh""s Irises, contemporary and classical pieces and photography. The center also has programs for children, beautiful gardens (be on the lookout for bees), two restaurants, one pricey, the other less so. There is a gift shop, of course, and one of the best locations and backdrops for your vacation ""we were in L.A."" happy snaps.Once you've paid for parking, that's it. There is no charge for admission, so pile 'em in the car and get on up there. You will not be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKinLA_101

50,Gorgeous views and art collection,"This was great because it was free (parking $15) so if you have a full car its pretty nice. The art collection is very interesting and robust. I think the views are my favorite part along with the cactus garden. On Saturday evenings, they have concerts. If the tram line is long when leaving - walking down the hill can be faster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vball13
50,Awesome Gem in the heart of LA,"Having seen it many times from the freeway, I made it a point to visit on my last trip. Sooo glad I did! There were tons of people there that 4th of July weekend, but the system they have moved us all efficiently, smoothly, quickly. A lot of thought went into the architecture. The pavilion where we waited to board the team from the parking structure up to the Center provided shade from the sun as cooling breezes swirled about. The landscaping was just beautiful - a lot to take in and enjoy while waiting. When you arrive up the mountain the beauty and space just takes your breath away. It was absolutely beautiful! The air was clear; the views of downtown and surrounding homes were great. The entire afternoon flashed by. Best of all, there's only the $15 per vehicle parking charge!Don't miss it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251sheilap
30,The museum and the views - but not the exhibitions,"This place is definitely worth a visit, but mostly because of the views over LA from the top of the mountain.

The permanent exhibitions however are nothing special on an international level in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therealjens
50,"Enjoyed an early morning, 3 hour visit - worth the trip to see some incredible art and architecture","An enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a nice sunny LA day.

50,Gorgeous location,"This is a beautiful museum, but the grounds are spectacular with gardens, streams and wonderful views of Los Angeles. This is a lovely way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201heleneh
50,Great opportunity to meet the best art exibition in California,"I can just confirm what was said before. Excellent architecture, buildings and gardens together with great masterpieces from all over the world. Do not miss when in L.A.!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lubomird839
50,Getty Center - Just Awesome,Great place to visit. Amazing garden and spectacular architecture. Exhibits in the galleries are definitely worth seeing as well. The train trip from the lower car park to the center was very good. The views of LA were outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickTop
50,Amazing Architectural Buildings with Fine Art to Match,"The current exhibit of drawings from Louis XIV court is amazing. What a time in history and the exhibit is so well done. This alone is work the visit.I love the idea you pay for parking and then are not having to wait for an admission ticket. Very clever. Bring a picnic basket and enjoy the amazing grounds of just wear great walking shoes and stroll through the various pathways around the museum and outdoor art.The core exhibits are nice as well but it is really the surroundings, the open air and the music performances that made this so special. It is worth the trip if you are in LA for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaM235
50,Must do!,"You simply can not leave LA without having spend a day at The Getty Center. Yes, no kidding it takes you a day and it pays off! Start with a tour on the buildings architecture and then continue to explore the center yourselves. Don't miss the gardens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxHubner
50,A Must See Destination,The Getty Center is a must see in L.A. Incredible that it is free (except for the $15 parking fee). Trams take you to the museum grounds and from there you are free to enjoy the campus buildings that houses paintings and sculptures. The gardens are beautiful as are the views of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesC986
50,"Art, panoramic views, architecture, gardens","We arrived at around noon so we took a bit of time to find parking, but we were amazed that it was the only thing we really had to pay for. The center itself was open to the public with no admission fee. Probably best to arrive early, there's a lot to see, takes at least >4 hours. Took a lot of pictures, walked everywhere, explored the grounds and the gardens. Great panoramic views of the city. Beautiful art and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CampfireRose
30,Mixed bag,"We arrived on to Sepulveda road at about 15:00 hrs. which is not lunch time. There were average number of cars(30+ in one direction and 50+ in the opposite) waiting in both directions to get into the parking garage. Our excitement was dampened by other drivers trying to merge ahead of us crossing over into our turn lane only with inches away from our car, so that they don't have to wait like us and many others. Once, you park and go up the hill in the tram, you will see quite a few welcoming views of the city of angels. The garden could be smelling better, but may it's time of the year. They did seem to have pleasant collections of art. Definitely a good outing if not for the other drivers and the smells. One suggestion for the museum is to collaborate with police at least on the weekends to avoid illegal and dangerous mergers into turn lanes. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/varmag2015
50,Exceeded expectations,"Initially visited for the location and view, but was also impressed by the exhibits. The train ride up the hill is quick, and fun, and as you wander around the buildings in awe, your experience is only enhanced by the views of LA and the gardens. The only disappointment was the fountains not filled due to drought conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/culturaldiva
50,Thank you Mr. Getty,We were not here long enough but it was great. We rushed over to the Villa since it closes at 5 pm. Both are awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love-to-wander-Mom
50,A real must do in LA!,"One of the most beautiful museums I've ever set foot in, if not THE most beautiful. But it was my husband who probably had the best time, as he's been a long time admirer of the architect Richard Meier.Stunning setting amongst the LA hills, even the tram to transport you there was an experience in itself.Exceptional works of art there, but I must admit the building itself was the star attraction, as well as the gardens!I was also very surprised at the quality and value of the cafe food - just a great way to spend as much time as you can possible manage there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loobeloo
50,Inspiring museum,"I am not one to visit a museum but was told it would be worth the visit. It was certainly well worth the visit and the price was only the cost to park. The exhibits were spectacular. The grounds and facility were pretty amazing. The grounds featured beautiful gardens with a large variety of flowers and plants. While there are places to buy food and drink, you are allowed to bring your own and sit and enjoy the garden and views of Los Angeles. Thanks to the Getty Foundation for providing this museum and exhibits which do change through the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bg12142
30,A Museum lovers dream,"The center itself was beautiful and something to be seen. Although I an appreciate the beauty and the work that is featured there I had my 4 teens with me that were not so enthused. I would recommend it for people that enjoy going to art museums. My kids are pretty low maintenance and they found most of work there over their heads or not as interesting as some of the other places we went. I myself am very into photography and had thought there would be a lot of the ""Getty Images"" you see in magazines but that was not the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrealI9788QU
50,A Gem in LA,"Definitely LA's, and quite possibly even America's, best museum. The museum and grounds are so huge that even a full day would not do justice. We came here on a Saturday and to our surprise there was fun music and dance in the evening. There are spectacular panoramic views of LA, so bring a nice camera! Currently, the museum has Van Gogh's Irises, which is a popular attraction, but not terribly crowded. The gardens are so beautiful and lovely to walk through. The cafe on the garden level is great, with ambiance and a nice selection of food.Keep in mind that admission to the museum is free but parking costs $15. There is also a 20 minute line for the tram which takes you to the museum. The staff will try to convince you to walk, saying that it is short and easy. However, the walk will be difficult for those with bad knees as it is a trek up to the museum. So waiting for the tram is definitely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/535mahak
40,"Best free museum in LA, outdoor vistas of LA are amazing","Parking you might pay, but everything else is free, monorail to the top, incredible vistas of the 405 on one side and the pacific seaside on the other. Beautiful museum with mostly western art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noreservationec
50,A museum with amazing city views!,"Excellent FREE museum with equally excellent views of the city. Getting there by bus from Westwood Village/UCLA is easy enough takes 15 minutes. Parking is $15. Short tram ride up to the top gives a really nice touch like you are going somewhere special. The gardens are well manicured. The art is mostly focused on European/American works of art. The buildings are on mostly 2-3 levels all connected with access to outdoor terraces to admire the views from many sides. It is light, white and airy inside and out. There are food options inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseWasHere
40,Nice,Great museum. Our son wanted to see the Van Gough which was easy enough to find. We walked through the gardens which were quite nice. No admission fee except for $10 for parking which is a great deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momandkp
50,Beautiful!,"Beautiful place to explore. You can get lost here for hours. Come with plenty of time, the last thing you want to do is rush. Beautiful views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VMV1
40,"Well worth a visit, not necessarily for the art","Interesting museum - more for the grounds and architecture than for the art collection. The grounds and architecture are beautiful (despite the drought) as is the setting above the city.The art collection is impressive, but not as extensive as major art museums.Logistics are extremely well organized - the parking and tram system work well and the flow of visitors is such that it does not feel crowded. We had lunch at the cafe reasonable food and cost. When we left - there was a line to enter the cafe and a long line to get on the tram, It seemed like the parking lot was closed (2 pm), so clearly arriving early is a good strategy - we arrived at 10 am..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codish
50,Getty Center/Noah Arc,I really recommend Getty to all the visitors specially Noah's Arc. Really amazing job is done for making animals. Very educational for children ages 2 to 13.Highly recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253simas
20,Quality of service and workers competed with experience of art,"For an institution with so much many it would seem they would focus on the overall quality of the visit rather than on just the art itself. It takes so much energy and time to get to this place, then you are rewarded with RUDE greeters!! Really??? That is there job....to be friendly and they were not. Pay the workers enough so that they can feel like being nice to visitors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blancheelizabeth
50,LA Museum,"Great for adults. Teens might or might not be into it. I'd think twice about lugging over small kids. In LA, everything is difficult to get to, but this is probably the best museum I've ever been to. Admission is free, can't remember if parking charged a fee. You can pack in a lunch or purchase from one of the cafes. In the summer, bring water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonMBowen
40,Beautiful views with great architecture,"We were staying in Westwood so the Getty Center is just short trip. We arrived around 2 in the afternoon and found parking is $15 in a very crowded garage. TIP: Just go down to the lowest level near the elevator and you will save time hunting. We were quickly taken up the hill in an automated train that must have been the inspiration for the tram in Jurassic World. The views from the museum are spectacular and worth the visit alone. The art is a large collection of mostly painting from the 1200s to the early 20th century. Lots of famous European artists to be seen.There is a nice outdoor cafe but the prices are very high. We most enjoyed walking the grounds. The trip back can be a long wait late in the afternoon as more people are ready to back down. TIP: Don't visit after 3:30 as the $15 parking will only give you a short time to visit before it closes at 5.Overall, a fun experience for couples and maybe older children. Not for the young ones unless you just want see the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brent-RN
50,Spectacular Museum,"This is a must visit place for the location and view of the city as much as the art works housed here. It is a bit of a challenge to get to but you will be well rewarded. You need plenty of time factored in for the journey and the visit itself; you need about 4 hours at the Center to really cover it. You could do it for less and the Center produces a guide of highlights if you are pushed for time, but try and avoid rushing by carefully selecting what you want to see.To get here by public transport as we did, best to take the number 2 bus heading west on Sunset, a route that goes past the Strip and through Beverley Hills. When you get to Sunset and Hilgard, you change buses to the red limited stop 734. Get off the 2 outside the entrance to UCLA, and cross the road to get the 734. This leg of the journey is a bit shorter and you know to get off the bus when it starts to run parallel to the San Diego Freeway and you spy the Center on the hill to your left. You alight here, cross the road and follow the signs, it's a couple of minutes from the stop. When you reach the entrance there is a line but it moves fast and you are taken up to the Center in a tram.In the Center, I'd advise you to select what you want to see. Everything is in 5 main buildings. At the moment, the manuscript exhibition, the Flemish paintings, 19th/20th century paintings are excellent, and the Photography Center is a must-see, which requires some time. However, try to give yourself time to enjoy the spectacular views, best from the cactus garden, and the gardens near the west pavilion. Best of all, it is free - all it cost us was the metro pass we used for the week, if you drive there is a parking fee. Finally, the design of the buildings and the grounds are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2823RUchrisa
40,A nice stop on a visit to LA,"Beautiful environment to enjoy scenic views of LA and beautiful,outdoor gardens that were art pieces themselves. Inside the museum the exhibits were lovely. The ride up from the parking area was also wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nursekagan

50,Gem Atop A Hill,"The Getty Center: stunningly beautiful inside and outside. According to one of the guides a typical museum visit is 2 - 3 hours long...but NOT the Getty Center. I suggest to you bring the family kids and all a picnic blanket yes a blanket and spend the whole day. The accommodating ""outdoor living rooms"", the gardens, the architecture, the vistas, the exhibits: stunning! We took the 'Garden Tour' which gave us insight to the architecture as well. The Getty Center is a well thought out absolutely beautiful place. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2MrsRay

50,So beautiful!,"On a nice day you can easily spend a majority of your time outside just taking in the beauty of the city. The architecture and garden tours are informative but try to stay close to the guides, it can be a bit hard to hear at times. There is also a room where they supply you with sketching material and artwork displayed for inspiration, so if you or a member of your group is interested in that type of experience it can be a nice break from walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAPungot

They have Edgar Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne & many other artwork from famous painters. Was really surprised. It is quite large so plan to stay there for a few hours. The location itself is great, on a hill with beautiful views all around, great for pictures. Tram takes you from the parking lot up to the museum.

50,thank you Mr Getty.,"The Getty Center is a vast travertine museum complex,sitting high above an elegant part of west los Angeles. You reach it by a white funicular railway and step out to a wide city panorama ( if you can see thru the gathering smog,which had gone but is returning. Try to go on a windy day or a day after a rare rain. The gardens are full of rare trees and plants and inside the travertine encased buildings the air is cool and noise is kept at a minimum. This is a good collection gathered by an a apparently bottomless fund of money set up by Mr Getty for the gathering of historic treasures for the ordinary man to share. Van Gough's:""irises"" is on display here,purchased for fifty+millions USD maybe a around a -decade ago. Wouldn't, Vincent have loved a bit of that price tag! There is much to see here .Be careful of your foot wear. A comfortable pair of sneakers is best. You can eat up here in the Valhalla of art (or bring your own picnic),take your time. Take several bottles of water,and drink,drink drink. Leave some energy for the GIFT SHOP which is jam packed with art publications and decorative items for your friends and home. . Take the funicular down at the end of the day,and the local bus to San Vicente Blvd,where you can find a treasure trove of excellent eateries to suit all tastes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk

50,Fantastic spot to enjoy the art and take in the views of Los Angeles,"The Getty Center is one of those places where you don't exactly know what to expect, but it knocks you over with what it delivers. The art collections are amazing, and the buildings that make up the compound are artworks in themselves. I was blown away by the views of Los Angeles. And other than the parking, it's all free.The day we visited, the sky was completely clear, so you could see all the way from the mountains on the east to the ocean on the west. The museum was busy, but we never felt crowded or rushed as we enjoyed the exhibits. We had planned to spend 1-2 hours at the Getty, and ended up staying for 4 hours, and still didn't see everything.The parking set up is also very convenient. Easy in, and easy out.This is a definite stop to put on your to do list when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DnGDXB
50,"Stunning building, breathtaking collection, superb views","The Getty was a highlight of our recent trip to Los Angeles. Situated on a hilltop accessible by its own robot tram system, the museum is surrounded by beautiful gardens where live music serenaded us on the evening we were there. The building is architecturally stunning inside and out, with a geometric white exterior and soaring, sunlit galleries. The art collection on a par with what might see at the Louvre, but more accessible due to smaller crowds: rooms full of Degas, Titian and Rembrandt, to name a few. The Getty stands as a retort to those who suggest the wealthy never give back. Parking is $10, but admission to the museum and grounds are free. Spectacular views of LA from the garden surrounding the building. A must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selmer
50,Getty for a day 😁,"Going to a museum is always good! You never know what you will learn or what you might find interesting. The Getty was a lot of fun. It has a lot of different exhibit's, so there's a little something for everyone. Interactive things to do for the kids. It's a nice place to just get away for the day. The gardens are beautiful! Oh and to get in is free! Yup free! You pay for parking but the museum is free so it's a win!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortneyk957
40,Amazing architecture!,"We are a family of 4 (parents and 2 teens). The Getty Centre was my choice - I wanted to see the amazing architecture, Van Gogh's ""Irises"" and the gardens. All were well worth seeing, as was the current photography exhibit. The views were also terrific. The rest of the family however were largely underwhelmed, with the most positive comment from my 17 year old son who ""didn't mind it"" - so I guess enjoyment depends on whether it is ""your thing"" or not. On the practical side, we had a nightmare finding the entrance road - despite sat nav. We also had to queue for a slot to enter the cafe - it was peak time - but the food was good when we got in. We headed along the coast to Malibu (the Pier and Surf Rider/ Lagoon beach afterwards), which is a relatively short drive when you're out that way already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeb454
50,Great experience,"I loved the Getty! From the beginning to end it was a perfect experience. The art and architecture are great, it is well organized and well worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363karnal
50,Extraordinary Place,"Everything about the Getty is superb. It begins with a tram ride up to the complex which is la great way to arrive. The architecture and gardens are breathtaking - be sure to take the architecture and garden tours as they will help you understand the incredible degree of detail that went into the design and construction of the museum. The exhibits, like in any museum, may or may not be to your taste, but that should NOT deter you from a visit - this is a must see museum. Be prepared to spend a lot of time; I was there for around four hours and didn't see everything. The staff was extremely helpful down to the smallest detail - for example, there is a place to re-charge cell phone and camera batteries - and the terrace restaurant was lovely, as was the service and the menu - I give the food an 8 out of 10, but would avoid the crab cakes, which were dry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MFJ1313
50,See both The Getty Center and The Getty Villa,"The Getty Center and the Getty Villa are in different locations. When we went, I thought they were at the same place or very close to each other but no.The Getty Villa which is the older one is located in Malibu.Admission is free for both but you need to book a ticket online. Parking is 15 dollars for each but you if you go to both locations on the same day, you pay only once.Spend half of the day at the Getty Center and the other half at the Getty Villa. There's so much to see and learn. The amazing collections are housed in these 2 amazing structures. The views and the surrounding gardens make the experience even more outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lourdesf920
50,A modern day Luxor,"George S. Kaufman famously said of Richard Rodgers' estate, ""This is what God would have done if he had the money."" This could just as well be said about this palatial complex on top of the ridge separating Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley. Stunning in scope, flawless in execution. We suppose some people come for the art. We came for the buildings, the gardens, the harmony with the landscape. Breathtaking and ""Wow"" compelling, people have been talking to us about the Getty for years, but somehow we never got to it until now. You pay for parking. The rest is free, including the great tram that runs serpentine up the hill to the Masada like complex. This is a home run on all counts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelK218
50,Worth a visit if you have time,"My husband took our 4 teens to Magic Mountain and I headed to the Getty Center for one of our vacation days in LA. I loved my choice. It is beautiful, easy to get to, parking was easy, the transport up the mountain was easy. I wandered through amazing art, I admired the amazing view and beautiful garden... I had a great, relaxing day until the gang called me to come and pick them up from Magic Mountain ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaraTraveler

50,Day at the Getty Villa,"What a beautiful California morning and afternoon to spend here. We took 2 guided tours; garden and architecture. Our guide Shirley was so knowledgeable and engaging. She took us back to Roman times as learned about the herbs, trees, olive and grapevines. She talked about the history of the purpose of why the villa was structured so; from atrium, the women and children's garden to the dining room that lasted hours of food and wine.We had lunch in the Cafe. Fresh garden salads, soups and a moist lemon brined chicken. The views are breathtaking from the drive along the PCH to the 2nd floor balconies.J. Paul Getty left a trust and legacy for everyone to enjoy a piece of Roman history. You only pay $15 for parking. Will be back again, even with 6 hours there, so hard to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myelder

50,"Great Place, Great Views","The setting of this fabulous museum complex is truly lovely, offering great views of LA. The grounds are immaculate and there are nice food/drink options. The structures themselves are worth the visit. The art collection is impressive, too, but not much of it suits my taste. Admission is free, but there is a $15 parking fee, so it's still a good value. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ned41

50,"Gorgeous, even for a non museum enthusiast","An absolutely gorgeous museum. The grounds and architecture is stunning and the art inside is fascinating. We are not huge museum goers, especially on vacation, but this is a site to see. We had a 7 and 5 year old with us, so we didn't get to see a lot inside the museum as they got tired running around outside on the beautiful lawn. We packed a picnic lunch. Although the museum entry is free, parking is $15/car. I would love to come back next time I come to visit L.A., but without the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JYCtraveler
50,Spectacular view from an Architechural Wonder!,"The Getty Center is easy to access from the 405 freeway and there is a large parking garage that connects to the short tram ride to the center. The cost is only $15 which you pay before you go back to your car at stations at the center or garage. There isn't any admission fee to the Center and there are special exhibits of interest, as well as tours throughout the center. The cafes and restaurants are excellent as well as the gift shops. Favorites such as Van Gogh's ""Irises"" and Goya's ""Bullfight, Suerta de Varas"" are always fun to see. The Center for Photographs is a favorite of mine.

50,Not Just Another Dull Museum,"I had not heard of the Getty Centre as it is not usually promoted as a ""must see"" for LA. Was I in for a big surprise when I paid a visit! For $15 entry free, (that pays for the parking) this is a real bargain. The exhibits and guides are exceptional. LA can be extremely hot during summer so schedule your visit during the afternoon when you want a little relaxation and a/c. Good views of LA although can be hazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennyf661

Will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennyM234
50,"A ""Must See"" in Los Angeles","The building is an architectural beauty. The art is something else. I really loved viewing the Rembrandt paintings the most. This is a wonderful gift from J. Paul Getty to the World. Art from all over the world is displayed here and the whole experience is free. We joined the ""Garden Tour"". Don't miss it. The female guide who had been at the Getty Centre from Day 1 described how the garden, waterfalls and pathway and pond were carefully designed. We learnt why the whole complex is in white stone and where the stone came from and how long it took to deliver. So interesting. It was school holidays and the Centre had art classes. There are very good views of Los Angeles from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayh162

There are truly stunning works here -- from Van Gogh's Iris's to Ensor's Christ's Entry into Brussels, Northern Renaissance beauties, fantastic photography and great small shows with wonderful videos to illuminate the exhibition.And the decorative arts and sculptures also impress. And if you do the Getty Center and Getty Villa on the same day, one parking ticket/fee is good for both.

40,Worth a visit,"Getty center is a beautiful complex located in a very picturesque area. It is something worth seeing, even for people who don't like art.

40,Getty Here ASAP!,"Brilliant few hours. Take the funicular to the Getty Centre and marvel at the great Art on display! The place had nearly been burnt by bushfire when we went, it is in a spectacular setting overlooking Los Angeles - The City of Angels! This is a great way to spend a few hours.

50,Awesome All Around!,"This is an amazing museum. There is no admission. You pay only $15 to park. The art collection is better than many public art museums we've visited in large cities. We loved the way it combined the art with architecture and the outdoors, views, plants, ocean, etc. The gift shop is also nice. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659janetr
40,Culture at its best,"A visit to the Getty Centre is well worth it if you are in L.A., far more impressive than many of the other tourist attractions (aka money grabs). It's free, other than the $15 for parking, and the tram up to the museum. There's so much to see in a single visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seat11A
50,"Beautiful, can't believe it's free","The tram ride to the parking lot was an experience by itself. Then the beautiful buildings, and the gardens are spectacular. I am not an artsie person so the art galleries are not for me, but next time will check out the photography section. The only cost is the parking $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17suzan17
50,"Amazing museum, and its free!!",What a great visit and a real gem in LA. I come from NYC and I never expected to find a museum in LA with the world class art I saw. The architecture and the views are equally stunning. Do not leave LA without visiting the Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7743SQmichaelg

30,Mwah,"Expected a lot after all the reviews. Since a lot said it's even worth the visit, just for the gardens, I did. The organisation is very well, and everything is clean and spacious. But to visit just for the gardens, I wouldn't do it if it meant, having to cut something else. If you like art, it is worth a visit (but I don't haha). It's not bad, but just not a wow, the way they had everything organised made up a lot for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SentinaS
50,Absolute highlight of our LA trip,"Between the architecture of these beautiful buildings and the garden tour, I was in heaven. Our tour guide was engaging and the tour enriched my experience immensely. I did peek at the art collection but spent most of my time outside. The food in the cafe was tasty and fresh. The only negative was the crabby door monitor in the children's room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27JeanG

Had an outstanding day. The architecture and location set the tone. The diversity and presentation of the art is outstanding. They have one of the best audio guides (free). Get one. We took the gardens tour and the architecture tours. Both worth the time to really get a sense of what you are seeing. We had lunch in the Restaurant (bit expensive), but very good in a great setting. Make time to see this place and it art. You will not be disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveB749
50,Old world art in an ultra modern setting with fantastic views of LA,"We visited the center in the early evening. While it was a little challenging finding a place to park in the garage, it was relatively simple to go up to the tram and take it up to the center. The center is a superbly designed series of buildings in a modern but corporate style - almost sterile - that does create a nice contrast to the old master works within. From afar, the center appears to be a palace or castle/stronghold in southern Europe. Be sure to go out on the balconies and external viewing areas for views of the city. The art is amazing - things you have seen before in books but are even more incredible when you're in person. The staff is friendly and unobtrusive. Be sure to allocate your time to see the exhibits in the various buildings and floors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulm1873

Takes 10 min to wait in line and ride 5 min up to summit. Parking $15. Recommend having Uber or Lyft drop you off. Museum admission free. Great food on site. Unique place to take family and friend photos with stunning mountain and ocean views. Gardens are works of art. Excellent maps by dozens of volunteers working throughout property. West Coast version of the Louvre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FourTickets
50,Beautiful Day at the Getty!,"The Getty commands a wonderful vantage point of the L.A. Basin. On a clear day, you can easily see the Pacific Ocean all the way to Downtown L.A. and South to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The architecture & landscaping alone are worth a visit. And there are always interesting exhibits to catch. Take a picnic lunch or buy something from their concessions and sit on a grassy hill or bench with a great view and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbnyla
50,Architectural masterpiece,I personally find this to be the very best thing about all of Los Angeles and really what makes it so special to me is the architecture. It's a masterpiece and more impressive than the actual collection. Go and spend an afternoon there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unterwegsbrooklyn
50,World class museum in beautiful location,"This is a great place to visit for both the artwork and the architecture/gardens. Something for everyone. Some members of our family usually linger in the galleries while others stroll the grounds. I especially love the photography exhibits at the Getty, they are often amazing new artists or wonderful collections you can otherwise only see in books. The restaurant here reminds me more of a European museum, with actual choices that are tasty and healthy, in addition to the usual American fare. I personally love the train that takes you from the parking garage to the museum, it adds to the feeling of getting away from it all. But a hard place to visit if you dont have at least several hours to devote to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonymousDragon
50,Getty Awesomeness,"Beautiful architecture delight. Incredible vistas of entire Los Angeles Basin to the ocean on a clear day. Art arranged by time period over multiple buildingS. Have visited twice and still have not seen everything the Getty has to offer. Guess that means visit 3 will be on my next Southland visit, Must see if you love art and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vicobel
40,Beautiful buildings with great views of LA,"Spent a lovely 2 hours at the Getty Centre, just walking around the gardens and buildings from the outside. It was such a beautiful day we didn't bother going into any of the galleries. Great views all over LA, and directly opposite Bel Air.You park at the bottom in a large multi story carpark, the catch the free train up to the top. If you stay less than 1hr, its free parking, otherwise its $15. Definitely worth a visit for the views, beautiful buildings and great gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expressive-one
50,Great way to spend an afternoon,"I truly enjoyed my entire visit to the Getty Center. The grounds and buildings alone are extremely impressive. The exhibits rotate, while some are longer term. You need to block out at least three or more hours to tour the center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeH971
50,excellent,We spent almost the whole day here. We didn't get bored because the Getty can be appreciated in different ways. First of all it's a really beautiful building. The location high above LA means there a great views in all directions. There are 5 galleries which include different kinds of art and changing exhibitions. We enjoyed one about medieval book making and manuscripts. The collection includes some very famous works of art such as Van Gogh's 'Irises'. The restaurant here is fabulous. On top of all this there are gardens to wander around outside when you brain needs a break.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneT
50,Must see in LA!,You can spend a full day at The Getty - and should! Be sure to take advantage of the architecture and garden tours. Beautiful art and grounds. Fun for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sami678
30,"Good museum, terrible amenities",Most of the restaurants were closed or out of food on a weekend day in July. Tons of people in line were disappointed when there was no food to be had at lunch time. No announcement of this is made so you wait in line for 30 minutes and then find out there is no food.Parking is $15. Often a long line for the tram to the actual museum grounds.Admission is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSD47630
50,Must see in L.A,"Worth it for the architecture (breathtaking, with white predominant combined with details in travertine), you get a little train that takes you from the parking lot to the Getty Center.We took a guided tour.Place on the hill, there is also a fantastic view of Los Angeles. In a sunny day is the maximum.I advise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexfM9479UL
50,Great multi-faceted experience,"What I like about the Getty Center is the multiple entertainment aspects the venue offers. Firstly, the venue is free and parking is abundant (reasonably priced but not free). The tram ride up to the venue is well organized, even when there is a line, and visually interesting. The architecture and gardens of the Getty Center are a museum unto themselves. The art is significant, and although lacking in modern art, which seems strange given the venue, the galleries are separated by building and so you can view just one building per visit, if desired. The views over L.A. are worth the non-price of admission. The coffee and snack kiosks are well-situated for taking in the views and architecture. The restaurant is a great place to stop for lunch, with an interesting menu, professional wait staff, and reasonable prices given the venue. Overall a wonderful experience if you are visiting L.A. or hosting out of town guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendasH3791FB
40,An artistic contrast to the frenzy LA lifestyle,"Getty Center is a remarkable collection of art pieces and sculpture. This is definitely a pilgrim for any art connoisseur but worthwhile place to visit for even an amateur admirer like us. The museums are located at a distance from the city on top of a hill giving a magnificent view of the city. Buildings are a piece of art in themselves and the ever changing art collections are very fascinating. We not only got to see some brilliant masterpieces of art but also learn the mindset of renaissance artists while they were drawing these. Audio tours and sign boards are definitely helpful. And more over, save the parking charges, its all free! Please do visit if you want a different taste of LA apart from the Hollywood and the rich and famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sonik18
50,Best Museum to go to in LA!,"Lots of square footage area and lots to see. Whether you are into architecture, landscape, arts, or history, this beautiful scenic place has something for everybody. Lots of thoughtful design gone into this expensive project. I would highly recommend one of their free daily tours throughout the day.We only spent 3 hours there, but one can spend a whole day here.Free admission, thanks to the generous Getty Family. However, need to pay for $15 parking for entire day at the Getty. Afterwards, we carried on our daily parking privilege (talk to staff) and drove to Getty Villa, where $15 parking fee was waived.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ponger424
40,"Beautiful location, getting a bit dated","Visited on a Friday night with our Tweens. The galleries were great spaces. We had come to see a photography show, which was very good. The site is amazing, with gorgeous views of LA all around. We stumbled on their Friday night concert series - a lot of fun with DJ, live band, special food and drinks. We last visited 15 years ago and it seems now a bit tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsFromHK
50,"Gorgeous white marble architecture, superlative gardens, incredible exhibits","This is John Paul Getty's (and the Getty Trust's) gift to every one of us who takes the time to visit. His fabulous collection of sculpture, paintings and works of art from around the world are displayed in a number of buildings that will blow you away. You have to arrange ahead of time for a free ticket to limit the number of guests. The site is so expansive that one never feels crowded. Pay $15 for parking (the first hour is free) and the rest of the day is at no charge. Park in the garage and take a tram up to the site. Elevators and wheelchair access. Four eating facilities or, a better choice in my opinion, take a picnic lunch and enjoy the gardens and beautiful water accents. Because of the current drought in S California in July 2015, some water conservation is in effect. Dress for moderate temperatures and for extensive walking. In one day, we experienced less than half of exhibits, buildings and gardens. I look forward to my next occasion. Pictures (without flash) are encouraged in most areas. The view from the hilltop into the valley is stunning. I suggest looking it up on-line. Enough from me - I have exhausted my quota of superlatives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberttX8449UJ

50,Amazing Museum & Views,"Do not take a pass on this gem which allows you free access. There is a charge for parking if you drive here. And public transportation seems easy as well. This is just a beautiful museum, the architecture, landscape and city views in every direction are priceless. The art displayed is equally impressive. I counted at least four cafes and had a very nice lunch at the restaurant. Take your time and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredOH69
50,World Class,"From world class collections to a breathtaking location to architecture that is a masterpiece in its own right, the Getty never disappoints. I am a native Angeleno, who now splits most of his time between NYC, LA, and Paris, and I am always impressive by the Getty even when compared to the wonderful museum experiences of my other 2 homes. The Getty is set apart because it is more than an experience of collections of art and history, but a journey in itself that will change what you consider to be ""art"" and give you a chance to take a deep breath in a city that regular takes your breath away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAFRLV
50,Beautiful Art Museum,This is probably one of the best art museums I've ever been to. The museum is set on top of a hill so when you're at the top the view of the city is very nice (on a not-smoggy-day) You park at the bottom and a little shuttle take you up the hill to the museum- very cool. I've been here about 3 times and I'm always pleased with the amount of beautiful art here. The gardens are another pretty site to visit while there. Everything there is just pretty. If you're hungry you can go to their cafeteria which is nicely kept. The gift shop is pretty nice and the staff is very respectful and helpful. I once left my cellphone in one of the bathroom stalls and I had to go back up to the museum to look for it. Luckily someone took it to the lost and found and I got my phone back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blaugrana10
50,A don't miss when going to LA,"Great art and beautiful grounds. A don't miss when going to LA. Visiting art work and photographs made the trip to the museum well worth it. The gardens are beautiful with many,many types of flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144kathyh
50,One of the Must-do's for any visit to LA,"Perched atop a hill in West LA, the Getty is a great place to spend an entire day (or just a couple of hours visiting the latest exhibit). Parking is ample and fairly cheap (it's free if you're in and out in less than two hours).The buildings themselves are a work of art, and the grounds would be worth exploring on their own merits. It's easy to spend hours wandering the halls full of a wide, eclectic, and impressive assortment of art. There's something for everyone in the art, and the tram-ride up is a great experience in its own right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dustruck
40,Views and Exhibits are Unmatched!,"We visit the LA area a couple times a year and were able to visit the Getty Villa last trip and had noticed the striking buildings that make up the Getty Center perched on the hills as we passed on the freeway, so it was wonderful to actually get there! We got there pretty early and were able to park easily ($15 I think) and we waited at the bottom of the hill for a tram. Once it came, we piled on and went up the hill to the incredible complex at the top of the hill. We were fortunate that it was a clear day and the views were just incredible! One of the special exhibits when we were there was Turner, I believe - lots of great paintings of his. The gift shop is quite good - lots of beautiful and unusual and fun items. Go for the views and the architecture and you'll enjoy the exhibits also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418jeanl
50,Wow-worth a visit even if you don't like art!,"Had no idea this place existed! Unbelievable location -- the views, the layout, the facilities, this is a world-class museum with an impressive collection of art, especially from 1400's on through 1900's. Plan to spend a lot of time there and bring your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puppypatrol
50,Summer Night - Great,"On Saturday, the Getty Museum is open until 9:00 p.m. Costs $10 to park and the Museum is free. Outdoor concert on the patio and nice refreshments available. We wandered through beautiful art, strolled the amazing garden and watched the sunset. Add in the spectacular views of the Valley and Ocean and you have the making of an amazing night! I need to go back and spend more time. This is an awesome museum. Don't miss!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman
50,Fantastic and free!,"Not much to say here, it's one of the best museums we've been to; it's a beautiful building with a great view to match. And did i mention it's free? FREE lol. ($15 for parking though) Make this one or your stops in LA and prepare to spend around 2 hours at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyguyC
50,Getty Center-Must see in LA!,"This place is gorgeous. Filled with fascinating works of art and perched atop LA with views of the city and beyond. My husband is not really into art but enjoyed all the Getty has to offer. Parking was a bit tough, try to get there early. After our visit, we drove down Rodeo Drive and then over to Pinks. Fun day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenScha
50,It's a must in your LA Trip,"Awesome place to go as a tourist, simply put: if your going to LA you need to go to The Getty. You can't beat the view, the gorgeous buildings and the exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/495danr
50,great architecture,"hard place to get to in a car but well worth the trouble. the art work and the sculpture , was secondary to just walking around this magnificent building and grounds. and it costs nothing to get in . allow 3-4 hrs there is a good restaurant there to eat very reasonable prices. and you must take a camera as photos are allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nfhunter48

50,The Best Museum in Los Angeles...,"If you are visiting LA, then you must put The Getty Center (Museum) on your list of places to see... The art collections, the grounds and the immaculate (exotic) gardens are truly remarkable… Finally, a world-class museum, right here in the City of Angels… The architecture is also something out of this world… You’ll find this place totally familiar even if you’re seeing it for the first time… Give yourself about four hours (at least) to walk through the exhibition halls as well as the surrounding gardens…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787kevink
40,Impressive,"We visited The Getty and enjoyed it. The gardens are beautiful and they have an interesting art collection. Walking around and navigating the different buildings was a bit confusing. The food was good, but way overpriced, so possibly plan to eat before you come. Great views of the city. It's $15.00 to park, but the museum and grounds are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twylatate
50,"Great Art, Great Views!","Our recent trip to the Getty was wonderful! Not only is it free (you do have to pay for parking), but the exhibits and the view of Los Angeles were amazing. I have been to the Getty a number of times, and if you go the day after it rains, the views of the city tend to be even better, because the rain tends to push the smog out.Due to the number of times I have visited the Getty, I sometimes forget how amazing it really is. However, during a recent trip to the Louvre in Paris, when we told one of the Louvre employees we had just come from Los Angeles, she expressed slight irritation about how the Getty had outbid them for a particular exhibit, and now that exhibit was at the Getty, instead of at the Louvre!During a previous trip to the Getty, I had a marble worker tell me how the Getty Trust bought an entire marble mine in Italy because, due to the quantity of marble the Getty needed, it was cheaper to buy a mine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/783garyz
50,Best Freebie,"The Getty is a great place to spend a few hours and it's free to get in. The gardens are spectacularly beautiful, the photos and exhibits are wonderful and the tram to get up to the museum is kind of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/819jennt
40,Love the Getty,Love the Getty Center just wish it was easier to get to. Sitting on top of the hill the grounds are beautiful the displays spectacular. If it is your first visit - get a tour from a docent. You can spend hours or days roaming thru this wonderful museum. Well worth the money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDM52
50,Lovely architecture and gardens,"The architecture of the Getty is really quite unique and amazing. I love that in between galleries you can step outside to take in the view of LA. The gardens are also a lovely. They've shut off the fountains, I'm guessing, because of the drought going on in LA now. I don't know too much about art, but there's a lot of them in here, from the classics to the contemporary.Food in the canteen was tasty too.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pingpong212
50,Great views -- indoors and out!,The Getty is worth going to for the art inside the buildings as well as the architecture and gardens outside. And the cafe has many options for all tastes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epjr
50,Amazing Inside and Out,"Even an art pleb like me was impressed with this amazing collection of art works. The building is brilliant, entry is free and the gardens ar a knock out. You can spend an hour here, or the entire day. Expertly presented",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanGeelong1
50,A wonderful few hours,"There's little I can add to the other reviews with regards this museum. It is as wonderful as everyone says. The fact it is no entry fee is just amazing. The gardens and buildings themselves are impressive and then the art is just sublime - and such a mixture of ages and styles.Some have mentioned it's hard to get there by public transport. I booked an airport shuttle (it's well within their boundary limits) and went straight from my flight to the Museum for $20. Please do note that there is just the one public entrance - you need to go up the 405 and onto N. Sepulveda Blvd. When looking on google maps, it seems like you might be able to get in from the bottom left side of the Museum - you can't, don't do it!I was able to store my suitcase for free in coat check. I arrived a little earlier than the Museum's 10am opening time, but there were some little coffee/snack carts open at that time and of course the gardens are accessible then too.Be aware that on rainy days, not all the restaurants open so there were big queues to get into the remaining places to eat at lunchtime. I gave up and got a burrito from one of the coffee carts.To get back from the Getty into town, I found Uber worked well - even though I didn't have a local sim card, there is free wifi at the museum so I was able to utilise that. Just be sure to specify the address as N.Sepulveda Blvd or The Getty Tram Centre. It was $20 to get to Santa Monica, even with 1.5x surge pricing.I spent 5 hours here - it would have been more if it had been a warmer/sunnier day but the rain and cold wind made it hard to appreciate the gardens and terraces as much as I would have liked to!I specifically stayed in LA for a couple of nights, rather than fly straight through - especially so I could go to the Getty - I was not at all disappointed - go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilfordNewtown
50,Do Not Miss This Wonderful Gem,"The Getty is a beautiful place on its own and once yoou get up th the top of the mountain where it is located the views are spectacular. You didn't come to a museum for a spectacular view, right?? The view is simply an added bonus to the artwork that is located inside the buildings!!! A must see for any art lover, even a just curious about this place filled with art person will find many things to be in awe over. Plan for several hours to take it all in. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetogoCalabasas
50,A must-visit,"If you're in LA, you must visit the Getty Center.First of all, it's FREE.Secondly, it's a gorgeous site with a cool tram ride, great views and interesting art work.Thirdly, it's FREE ( except for $15 for parking ).Fourthly, the garden tour is very interesting and highly recommended. You'll learn about the design principles, rub your hands on the pepper tree, explore the zig-zag path from the museum to the maze.If you don't know what any of this means, you're missing out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmathew22
50,World famous campus,"Very rich art collection. Many European art pieces are collected in this world famous museum. They are separated in 4 pavilions. Renaissance furniture is amazing. The campus is vast and very well maintained.The architecture of the campus is impressive and sophisticated. The individual design of the buildings is neat and stylish. Natural light is used cleverly.The walls covered nicely and in a smart way with travertine. Very good match with environment. They look amazing.Breathtaking scenery of Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Century City, Pacific Ocean and surrounding area can be seen from terraces.The gardens, open spaces, stairs, connectors are designed in simplicity and beautifully.Just be aware of that it is a full day attraction if planning to visit each section of the museum, research institutes and open spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelguru-su

50,A Must See Museum,"The Getty Center is made up of multiple buildings that are crammed with art. One room had ten Rembrandt oils. There are also multiple meal offerings, so that you can easily make this a destination for a whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825philipm
40,Beauty not only on the inside,"We were on a tight schedule and, following recommendations by other reviewers, visited The Getty Center especially for its grounds and architecture. We were not disappointed.We went in the morning and planned our entire visit within the hour. In doing so we could benefit from the one hour free parking and saved $15. There weren't many visitors and we were able to take beautiful pictures, not only from the Center and its surroundings but also from the views of California. An hour well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funkyfiorella
50,Center for impressive contemporary art,"The Getty Center has a good modern art collection, but also has a very good selection of changing exhibitions, from ancient to modern. There are some amazing Impressionists in this museum, even a rare toulouise-Latrec.It is well worth visiting as party of an ""Arty LA tour."" If you go there, ask for a ticket to the Getty Villa. Those arriving early enough can then drive to the Getty Villa and get free parking, seeing it without a very annoying 'timed' ticket. Great gardens too, if you like gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tortuga_gente
50,"A little tough to get to, but worth it.",We spent the better part of a day at the Getty and could have easily spent more time there. The Impressionists room is not to be missed. The views from the facility are awesome as well. We relied on public transit while in LA and it was a journey to get to the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky55110

Located on a hill in midst of concrete jungle that is LA., it puts anyone who encounters it, in touch with beauty, history, life, love and humanity It is free (except for parking, which is $15.00). The Getty is not to be missed if you are traveling to LA. Plan a full day (you will need a full day to navigate the traffic, coming and going). I can not say enough about it! Visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/totheedge
50,An art lovers must see,"Some of the most beautiful works of art I've ever seen in a setting that is equally beautiful. A tram takes you upward for a stunning view of Los Angeles from every direction. From the lovely gardens to the architecture of the buildings, the getty museum was my favorite attraction in LA.Even the cafeteria served a good variety of ethnic foods. I would return for another visit next trip to southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rltoller
50,Great museum. Museum is free but you have to pay for parking.,The museum is in a beautiful setting of the 405 freeway. I enjoy the gardens as well. A free tram will take you to the museum or you can walk up the hill. The musuem hold the Getty collecction and also new aquisitions.There is a cafteria style restaurant which is moderately priced.There is a good orientation film.There is a place for kids to dress up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orange552015
50,Nice place,This is a nice place to visit if you are in the area. There is a bit of walking involved so wear comfortable shoes. There can be a breeze so bring a light sweater to cover-up with. At night it's really nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bijou38
40,Great place for a relaxing day,"Lots of great art and family friendly. Free entry, you only pay for parking. After parking you take a short tram ride to the top of the hill and the gets center. They have family weekends with great free activities for kids. Great views of the city as they are on top of a large hill/small mountain. A large grassy area and gardens where you can hang out if you like, also with great views. Only drawback, as with most attractions, is the cafe on location is expensive. However don't let that stop you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813iamk

50,World Class Museum,"The Getty Center is a must for anyone who loves beautiful views, art, paintings, history and a relaxing garden. On top of that, its FREE.

The garden is well kept, very relaxing. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
50,Wonderful way to explore both incredible art & views,"I've watched, from our backyard, the construction of the New Getty and now rate it a favorite venue to take houseguests - and ourselves when we have a couple hours free. And the price is right: you only pay for parking. One of my favorite visits was with friends who only wanted to visit the manuscripts: they didn't want to see everything! The art collection is literally world class, but watch too for special exhibits. So very user friendly with places to sit and snack on very good food. A top place to go in L.A.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentwoodHousewife
30,Only if you like exhibitions and gardens,"I personally found a bit dull, but then again, I'm not big on art exhibitions through several floors. The garden is nice but nothing spectacular. My 80-y old mother loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141anniev
40,Best garden in LA,"i love the Getty more for their outdoor spaces and garden than the indoor art space. They do have a fairly decent collection of art but it's the architecture and surrounding gardens that should be the main attraction. I believe you need to call and reserve a time just for parking and crowd control purposes, otherwise the museum is free to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodie_traveler305
50,Always good,"I love the Getty, have been back many times. Sunset is the best for observing the great location of the site in general, but the exhibits are always worth your time and the architecture is first rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamm548
50,A major star in the constellation of LA,"The Getty Center is my ""make a memory"" go to place. All my out of town guests will be taken here at least once. The views in the garden, the art in the museum, the city vistas, the dining opportunities, the lectures and live entertainment venues - what can go wrong. I am very proud of the Getty center and grateful that Los Angeles citizens and visitors are allowed to enjoy every aspect of the museum. You can go for an hour or four. It is like a box of chocolates - revel in as much as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susana499

Lunch at the cafe was well priced and gourmet selections offered. Nice excursion for all!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calitravlerone
50,Great Place for a Rainy Day,The Getty is a beautiful free museum with so much artwork it's hard to take it all in. Their family room is amazing and perfect for a break for families with small children to play and hang out. The food in the cafeteria is good and there are a lot of options. Spend some time sketching in the drawing room if you want to take a break it's nice and quiet and there are places to sit. This place is big so you will want to carve out at least 3 hours to get through the whole thing. My only complaint is that the maps they give out are hard to read. The gift shop is not very child friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MlovesO
50,Amazing a must do,"We were going to Universal Studio's but went to the Getty centre instead, even our 10 year old son agreed it was an amazing place, we took the free guided tour & learnt so much. It is a place u can spend all day & we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22karene
50,A must visit attraction,"Took the family to The Getty Center during our one week California trip, and was very impressed with the museum. There were extensive collection of paintings, sculptures and exhibitions in different buildings. From the portrait of Louis XIV that dates back to the 17th century, to various blue and white porcelains and ceramics of the Ming dynasty from the 14th century. Overall, it was an enjoyable visit and I would highly recommend The Getty Center to tourists who are planning a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164jc
50,Tasty meal,The restaurant is a bit pricy but very tasty. The service is excellent and the view is very nice. We enjoyed the meal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346bc
40,"Great view, pretty buildings","Outstanding location, easy parking. Impressive architecture. The art collection was a bit disappointing, perhaps because Getty's ""classic"" Greek and Roman art are at the Malibu location. My wife liked the garden. We're glad we went but would not likely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evilledrwho
50,Best Art Museum in America ?,Fantastic art collection with a little bit of everything. This place is free (except 15USD to park) and you get a little train up the hill to an art museum that rivals those in european capital cities and free to view. Amazing and must see and I expect nothing else like this outside of NY.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerrryCornelius
50,Best Museum ever!,"This is a Museum experience with a difference. You park at the bottom and take the monorail up the hill while seeing amazing views of the Hollywood Hills. The price of parking includes the train and entry is free. It is unbelievably beautiful with spectacular vistas all around. The gardens and landscaping add to the whole experience and the exhibits are incredible. There are tiled courtyards where you can relax in the shade with a refreshing drink and admire the views of LA. If you combine your visit to the Getty Villa at Malibu on the same day, you just show your parking ticket and don't pay for parking again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionah741

Large parking structure is located outside of the actual park, and a tram is used for transport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tute66
50,Excellent and Free,"The Getty is a ""do not miss"" trip while in the LA area. Except for the $15 parking fee, there are no other entry fees. The architecture and views alone are worth the trip, but there is artwork to see that will interest just about any taste. The lunch options are varied, so everyone in your party will find something to their liking. Access is so easy now that the 405 roadwork is completed in the area around the Getty...and the directional signage makes getting to the parking area a snap. For locals, there are always changing exhibits, so it is a wonderful place to stop in and visit frequently. The place has many steps, but has been designed to be completely ADA compliant, with elevators conveniently located throughout the buildings. A visit here will be good for the young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southpass_TN

Parking is great. One flat rate for the car. Get as many people in as you can!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PianoJulie107
50,We could see all of California from here! (almost!),"Can't say enough good things about the Getty Center. As a museum -- well, any museum that has a Cezanne in it automatically becomes one of my favorite museums! The Center itself is a work of art made with tons and tons of travertine. Gorgeous. The vistas -- well you can see all the way to the Pacific Ocean so I'd say they are breathtaking. Do not miss the Getty Center. If you only have one day in LA -- this is a great choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraq684
40,A must see in LA,"Very efficient, park the car and take the little train up to the center at the top of the hill. The buildings are striking, the gardens are lovely and the views, allowing for the LA smog are great. The art, well, personally I found the rooms rather austere and the recreation of period rooms in such a modern setting was rather odd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidofWatford

50,Free and Fabulous!,"I can't believe this museum is free. We all owe J. Paul Getty a boatload of gratitude for making this incredible place free for the public. Ok, you pay for parking, but who cares. The views from the museum and quality of art are just spectacular and stunning. I love they have Van Gogh's ""Irises."" The gardens are immaculate and gorgeous. The building itself, designed by renowned architect Richard Meier, is just worthy of seeing itself. I give this place a 10 and recommend to all friends and family. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingjamie
50,"Must see, but not great with kids under 15","It's magnificent, the views are gorgeous and if you don't like museums of this sort, is a beautiful place for lunch and a visit. I find children of all ages can easily lose interest looking at furniture. The outdoor facility is magnificent so if you have a sitter with you, there is plenty of space to keep a youngster busy externally from the buildings while you enjoy your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AwesomeIma

50,Must see,Beautiful architectural treasure with wonderful views of the city. The café is great too. Is a perfect day out on a good day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraveliteNewDelhi
50,What a great experience,"Architecture, artwork, gardens, views of both the city and the ocean, and a relaxing venue to get away from the LA bustle. Came away with the zen feeling that mr. Gutty would be proud of installing in each person that enters his oasis. A great spot for young and old. Our kids, 12 and 8 enjoyed the gardens and family bent of the museum. Staying on the second floor and capturing a variety of views breaks up each buildings artwork inside with outside artwork be it sculptures, gardens or views. Well worth the $15 parking fee. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimS674
40,Beautiful,The architecture and grounds are amazing. There is a tremendous amount of interesting art to see as well. Be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle to the top...this museum has a totally different feel than the Getty Villa....the restaurant is a lovely place to have dinner reservations with a time around sunset!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
50,beautiful,beautiful views from the balcony. lots of art to marvel at. it was a tourist attraction for international vistors. lots of foreign travelers. different types of artwork on display. something for everyone to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydney477
50,Beautiful garden & gallery,Love coming to the Getty center right above the 405. It has a beautiful garden that changes colors depending on the season red or green. It has a complete different gallery from Getty villa. The scenery is beautiful from the train that takes you up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
50,Extraordinary opulence,"This place stunned me with the extraordinary quality of everything I saw from parking, to walking to free shuttle, shuttling up to top, the richness of the stone walkways and hillside stays, the eye catching architecture of the buildings, and of course the quality of the art inside. A first class experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9378FXjohng
50,Fun Museum!,I have been trying to go back for the past month but havent had luck with my schedule. I will be going tho pretty soon I hope!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354jeannettev
50,Nice Place to Relax,A very beautiful place to visit in California. The view of the city and the ocean from this location is spectaculor. You can walk thru the gardens and view the architecture of the building as well.The best part is that it's free for everyone and is a great place to send time with family and friends.Definetly a place worth visiting in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279suziel
30,Average,"It was a nice place, but I prefer another museums in Europe. Getty Center has some paintings drawn by famous painters, but does not have famous paintings. Arrangement of this place is very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimize940314
40,Worth ro see,"The center itslef worth to visit, you will see many amazing things but the restaurants was closed, one of them closed permanently and the other one was closed from 2 pm to 5 pm!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mohajerani
30,"Cool experience, but overzealous staff detracts from the ambience","Initially, we were very impressed by this place. Frequent visitors to LA, normally the only culture we consume is the star-gazing/trendy restaurant/popular shopping variety. But after hearing friends rave about The Getty, this trip we decided to check it out. The Getty Center sits high on a hill on the west side of Los Angeles. The initial setup seems thoughtful and well-executed: park in a covered pay lot at the bottom of the hill, and take a tram up. And even if you don't have any knowledge about architecture, you can't help but appreciate Richard Meier's design. The campus is breathtaking, with spectacular views of the city and the amazing central garden. It would have been great if the water features were running, but conserving water during the drought is more important, so we understand why they were turned off. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere. A plus: buckets of umbrellas visitors could borrow to shield themselves from the sun. That's such a nice touch. I'm not sure what I was expecting from the art collection, but what we saw of it really wasn't anything special -- and that's where our visit to the Getty took a downturn. Yep, there sure was some old German glassware, and we enjoyed seeing the collection of Renaissance manuscripts (amazing the work that went into producing a book in those days!), but the staff really needs to tone it down a notch. Not sure if they have ever experienced a museum outside of Los Angeles, but among the places I have visited: the Vatican Museums in Rome, the Natural History Museum in London, Buckingham Palace (a living museum!), the Picasso Museum in Barcelona, etc, etc... In these places filled with very important pieces of art, and with millions of people filing through ever year, not once have I seen a docent yell at a visitor that they're too close to a painting. I experienced that for the first time at the Getty. Twice. The Animalia which was on during our visit, was small and poorly lit. But we witnessed a staff member not walking quickly, but running around the space, determined to loudly admonish anyone he deemed to close to the photographs. It truly was one of the most ridiculous scenes I had ever experienced -- staff members RUNNING through a small exhibit? -- and it just left a bad taste in our mouths. I would have brushed it off as a one-off, but a surly woman manning another wing was loudly barking at visitors, ""You're too close!"" Leads me to believe this type of behaviour is a common occurrence at the Getty. We didn't see the Renaissance paintings and the Picassos that are apparently there because we were appalled by the overbearing demeanour of the staff. I would recommend that these people get on a plane to other museums and see how it's really done, because the Getty Center's art (yeah, it's old) felt like no big deal to my untrained eye. Go and see this place once, and then you can say you've been there and you don't have to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forewarn_forearm
40,The Getty Centre,An amazing building up on the hill in the suburbs of Los Angeles. The tram ride gives you an insight into the views from the top.The wonderful volunteers are very informative. The garden is a must to wander around. The artwork is well displayed and a great collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanthorpe50
50,Beautiful Art and Location,"Good place to spend a relaxing day. Well done displays. Wonderful gardens, elegant dinning, nice casual dining and lovely gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2830DQfrankp
50,Came for the art - fell in love with the architecture,"A no-brainer ... don't come to LA without going to the Getty. And you don't have to drive - there is great people-watching fun to be had on the local Metro buses. Others will say it better but the Getty has more Art (the capital is a hint) than you could shake multitudinous sticks at. And the range is vast - being fans of the Impressionists and later European painters we had a whole gallery to visit ... but it is only one of five. And don't miss the free tours - either of the Getty Centre itself or of the gardens, which are artful in themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucienOSS
50,Amazing place!,"Amazing place! A must go for anyone visiting California. The views from the centre are fantastic, overlooking the city and the ocean. The attraction itself is interesting with some amazing artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676matthewa
50,Fun time for all,"This is a great experience for anyone to enjoy. The 405 is the only nightmare to endure, but it's worth it to see the Center and the art. I've gone with just my wife and I've also taken my kids. The whole family loves this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeS372
50,MUST GO,"Don't miss it!! Absolutely amazing! Must go! It's worth going to see the architecture, gardens, and surroundings, let alone the exhibits! Admission is free. Parking is $15. It was a great date day! Be sure to catch one of the free walking tours - they'll give you a schedule for that day when you arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodandtravelfaves
40,Gargantuan Getty,"Everything was BIG! The car park. The hill up to museum. The grounds. The museum itself. Would be easy to get overwhelmed. But, it was very well planned and laid out.Each pavilion is dedicated to a specific era. Plus there are special installations and specific exhibitions. We just enjoyed wandering from pavilion to pavilion and enjoying whatever we came across.Am a Francophile so particularly enjoyed anything French - paintings, sculptures, furniture. Loved the beds and chandeliers.The Sketching Gallery is a fabulous idea. Budding artists can sketch from original paintings. Haven't ever seen that opportunity before.Very hot day when we visited. Make sure you wear sunscreen and drink lots of water. Not a lot of shade. Disappointed not to see working fountains but understand that conservation of water is important in the drought. The gardens were gorgeous as were the views.The architecture and design is outstanding but the juxtaposition between the modernity of the building and the age of the items on display was jarring. No ambience - unlike Musee d'Orsay or Versailles. However, didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of my day.* Tram ride was great but gets very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nle69
50,Fantastic art gallery,"disliked? The food was not great although I didn't go the restaurant this time. I saw the Louis XIV (permanent) exhibition and the temporary Andrea del Sarto exhibit. It is a wonderful and huge complex. I usually only manage 3-4 hours per gallery, including a stop for coffee and a sandwich. I did the Architecture Tour, which was okay, not brilliant. The guide, who was just charming and enthusiastic, perhaps could benefit from reading some of the material about the building that is readily available in the museum's shops. But as for the Getty Centre, just go. there are amazing galleries in the world and I have been privileged to see a few of them. This is right up there. It is so easy to get around, so easy to stop and rest your feet and feed your tummy, after you have feasted your soul, wonderful staff and just a beautiful, modern building. go, go, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91theresen
40,Getty High!,"We visited the Turner exhibit--fabulous! Not to be missed. Park and then take the shuttle to this glorious spot. The one down side is that the cafeteria was closed, and we had to purchase lunch from the small cart located outside the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gina20
50,Please...don't miss the Getty!,"The Getty Center is one of the most satisfying art museum experiences I've ever had. The anticipatory climb by tram up the hillside to one of the most spectacularly designed art museums anywhere in the world is enough. The views will blow your mind and you'll almost forget why you're there. But what the Getty houses are masterpieces of great art beautifully displayed. I can't even begin. You'll just have to experience it yourself. Not overwhelming like New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art but enough that I came back the next day because I didn't want to miss anything and...I just wanted to be there again. It's that beautiful!Plenty of food venues and good ones but the fine dining restaurant is the topper to a truly magical outing. Lovely restaurant, top notch service, fine fare and not outrageous. I can't afford outrageous no matter how fine. Lunch on my first visit was so good I made a dinner reservation for my second. A fantastic finish to the day as the sun went down coloring the Santa Monica Mountains and you'll feel a rare sensation of being completely sated both culturally and gastronomically and it doesn't get any better than that. HIGHLY recommended!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvagabond9
50,Getty centre.,No 1 place I've been to in LA. You can walk up instead of taking tram for lovely viewsThe free tours are worthwhile too. I attended a fifteen minute talk in The Irises. And wander through the sculpture gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireinaust
50,A cultural gem!,Make a reservation online if you want to be able to park your car in their lot. Take the tram to the museum and then get lost! You can't find a bad spot at this amazing collection of historical and artistic artifacts lovingly collected by Getty over the years! A true gem!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrvDS
50,Get to the Getty,A phenomenal collection of the best of the best. Beautifully designed facility. Easy to maneuver. Outdoor beauty as well as indoor galleries. Nice eating facilities as well to sit and enjoy the views and plan your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suitcasehandy
50,A Wonderful Day Out,"The Getty is an absolutely magnificent place to spend a few hours while visitng LA. I lived in LA for many years, and visited a number of times. It sits up on a hill and has beautiful panoramic views. The gardens and outside area is amazing.I've heard criticisms of the museum itself - perhaps that it's too small or doesn't have many world class exhibits. That's rubbish, in my opinion. It's still really interesting (and I believe it has some Monets).I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoryAmsterdam
40,"Nice architecture, beautiful exibits","Really a nice place to visit, the view over the city is great, the buildings are nice to walk through, the displays and gardens are lovely. Amazed that entrance is free, you just pay for parking. Lunch restaurant has a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartyC620
50,A great way to spend your oil fortune,"The Getty collection is, simply, extraordinary. And the complex of buildings that houses it is no less extraordinary.A definite 'must visit'.BUT, don't try and do it on public transport! Or if you do, spend more time researching it than I did. I tried to catch a bus back...and it's complicated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9634GDdavidg

50,Getty,"Beautiful, multi level center with many antiques, artwork, religious artifacts. If you have a small window of time, I would go on a cloudy day so you can enjoy the sunshine on other days. You can spend the whole day. If you a a smaller rendition, I would recommend the Getty Villa off the PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fergie1969
50,A Day at the Getty,A friend took me their for the first time a few years back. It is the most wonderful place. Its up in the hill and the exhibits are great. I went back for the Herb Ritts exhibit on my birthday two years ago. If you have not been you must go at least once. My next visit will be to the Getty Villa which I am looking forward to going to soon I hope,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dqueen1
40,Late afternoon trip to the Getty,"There aren't a ton of recognized places that are easy to get in and easy to leave like the Getty. Amazing art - spend two days back to back if you want to see the Villa too! Both are free -- parking is not.Be careful -- signage is not their main quality. A visit doesn't go by that I don't hear ""how do I get in?"" In the parking garage. It's the same with the art - plan on seeing it all because it's a pain to figure out a specific building --- even if it appears clearly marked..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720katyp

50,King Louis XIV exhibition,"My husband I went to the King Louis XIV exhibition on June 19th. Besides having great weather, the musicians were very good. I thought it was music being piped through a speaker. I was also pleasantly surprised by the food as well.My only disappointment was that there were no clothes for that time period. Once we saw the exhibition, we went into the South Hall and saw some of the other time period pieces.Overall, it was a great ""date"" with my husband!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvetter788
50,Beauty in the Clouds,"Whether your are tourist or a Socal native, take time to visit the Getty Center for stunning views, awesome art and some spectacular architecture. If you can, drop by the restaurant for a great meal with views of the Santa Monica Mountains (this is great date place!). I highly recommend that you tour the art with the free multimedia player provided at the Museum Entrance Hall - give yourself at least 3 hours to park, ride the tram up and down the mountain and enjoy the facility and the art. Admission is FREE, but there is a $15 parking charge per vehicle ($10 after 5 PM - only worth doing this on Saturdays and some Fridays during the summer when the Getty is open late). If you don't like crowds, arrive early and try to avoid weekends. Note: there is free Wi-Fi available at some public seating areas. Also note, the Getty is CLOSED on Mondays, opens on all other days at 10AM and closes at 5:30 PM on T-F and Sunday (but stays open through 9 PM on Saturdays and on some Fridays during the Summer - consult with their web site).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariek2014
50,Great visit! Go to the Getty Center and Villa on the same day!,"The views and architecture were worth the $15 parking fee for sure. The art collection is good, not great but it's worth visiting. I recommend going to the getty center and the getty villa on the same day, as you only have to pay once for parking if you go to both in one day - if you go the getty center first, stop by the information desk and they'll help you with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9773QCrachels
40,Nice combo of indoor and outdoor sights,"Ignore the address on Sepulveda that the Getty Center website tells you to plug into your GPS, it will take you to the neighborhood across the street. The correct address is on Getty Center Drive, which will take you right to the parking garage. Parking is $15/car and entrance is free, which seems like a steal! Trams run up and down the hill on a regular basis, so you won't have to wait long, even during busy season/time. We went on a Saturday afternoon in June and only waited 5 minutes to ride up. My favorite sights were the outdoor ones - the architecture, gardens, and amazing city views. Galleries with a variety of art, sculpture, and furniture are great for museum buffs. Food is expensive, so bring your own and have a picnic in the beautiful center garden!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kallanchen
40,Afternoon relaxation,"Went with friends to take in the views. They always have a few interesting exhibits that are featured. The permanent collection has fewer well-known artists than other museums, but the variety is impressive. Beautiful grounds and architecture. Great for a date! No entrance fee, but parking does cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherG672
50,WOW - THE GETTY,"The Getty isn't just a museum. It is a park, a retreat, a place of beauty, relaxation and of joy! 6 of us went from ages 16-66 and everyone enjoyed the day. An amazing gem in the middle of a crazy city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missybgolfer
50,Great art and fantastic views,I went to see the Turner exhibit and it was wonderful. The Getty is breathtaking. I only had 3 hours there but could have easily spent twice as many. Give yourself time and take a lunch to enjoy in the garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wronda
50,Lose yourself at the Getty Center,"The Getty Center is an ALL day experience. See incredible one of a kind art painted by great artists through the centuries; however the entire visit from start to finish is art... the architecture, the stone in the walk ways, buildings, terrace, the plants along the way, the design of the grass areas and garden, the water features and the incredible tactile, walking garden along with the amazing view out over Santa Monica, LA and the Pacific Ocean makes for a absolutely beautiful one of a kind experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettyb351

50,free of charge for 5* place,"You only need to pay for parking, 15usd i think so go in groups and carpool. The train up to the Getty centre is free. Start with the orientation at the theatre where they show a video so you would know roughly what you wanna do here. There are 4 art galleries here. Im not a painting/photos art person so I went very fast through all the 4 galleries. But a person who loves art can spend the whole day there. There is also a beautiful garden to relax or for photos. I can hang there longer if it was spring but since it is summer it's kinda hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeewean
30,"Gardens are Great, Museum is Average","I loved the gardens at the Getty Center and they were a nice surprise especially since entrance is free (though parking is $15). They even supplied free umbrellas which everyone used to block the sun. There is grass where people can lounge which was pretty neat.I was disappointed however with the remainder of the Getty Center. It's so spread out in different buildings and levels that it's not user friendly at all.We found it difficult to find anything even with the map. And the museum itself was nothing special. Getting there is like going to Disney. You have to wait to park in a lot then take an elevator up, then take a tram. It's packed in the summer so be prepared. I was expecting more from this attraction since it's number one on the list of things to do but other than the gardens, I would not rate this five stars nor number one on the list of things to do in the greater LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BloatedBelly
50,Visual arts at its best,"We have been wanting to visit this place, and my it was worth it. It is one those few free museums...and you only need to pay $15 for parking. I brought the kids and they think the place and experience is so cool, you feel like you are in a theme park! The Tram ride brings you to the arrival plaza. Inside the museum entrance hall you will find the maps and multimedia players that will guide you as you go around the exhibits. We were able to pretty much explore most of the place for about 2 hours. Half a day would be best if you want to check out all the paintings and exhibits. We loved the view from above the structures and also the central garden. A Cafe and a restaurant and even coffee carts are located throughout the gardens. We will surely comeback. Next in line - Getty Villa :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia

50,Beautiful. What a bargain!,"$15 for a carload of people. A tram ride up the hill offers views of the surrounding area. The Getty Center is beautiful; the gardens, the architecture, the galleries. Three hours was not enough to see everything we wanted to see. The docents are nice and knowledgeable. This is an amazing collection. The cafe itself only offered pre-prepared sandwiches and salads with bagged chips. We did not eat there. There's also a coffee stand and a restaurant that we did not try. There are plenty of places to sit if you choose to bring a picnic. Amazing views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200ml

Great with a family too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieB5
50,Definitely worth a tram ride.,"I've been to the Getty Center several times. Every time I go I tell myself I need to go here more often. It is such a beautiful peaceful place. The gardens are spectacular, the views are breathtaking, the art is a world class collection. The gift store has wonderful books and cards and all kinds of fun things for kids of all ages and it's open a little while after the museum closes so you can go there after you check out the art. There are places to sit and have a picnic and places to grab a coffee or some lunch if you didn't bring your picnic basket. You can park on the grounds but the parking is limited and gets crowded. You can either walk up the hill to the museum or take the tram. It's a nice walk and a nice ride. I recommend wearing comfortable walking shoes. It's a big spread out place so there's a lot of walking involved. It's free to go, you just have to pay for the parking so it's a great place for a cheap date. Bring your selfie stick if you're into that sort of thing. There's lots of great places for photo ops. It's good if you give yourself at least a few hours up there. There's a ton of stuff to explore between all the art, architecture, the gardens and the incredible views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mackie0

I love that you have to ride up a tram to get there! Parking was a bit difficult though, as the garage was full when we got there, so my husband had to drop me off and go try to find something somewhere else, which is basically impossible. I would recommend getting there first thing in the morning so you don't have to wait to park.I thoroughly enjoyed all the art exhibits. They were well organized and had some lovely pieces. My favorite was the impressionist room. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the photography collection. I know the Getty has a HUGE collection of photography, but hardly any of it was on display when we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rperkinsphotography
50,World Class!,"The Getty is world famous, and for good reason. The gardens alone are worth the visit; the art is wonderful. Bring your sketchpad and visit the room reserved for artists; there are pieces from the collection to inspire you. Get there early to enjoy the grounds and collections with minimal crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
50,Amazingly beautiful,We visited Getty center last May 2014. The place is awesome with beautiful gardens and art works. Beautiful view and one can do lot of photography to capture the beauty of the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adeetik
50,A place to visit if you are an art buff.,"We visited the Getty Center based on recommendations from friends when we were in L.A. We were not disappointed. We got there at about noon and there was no problem getting parking. The museum is free, but parking is $15 which is reasonable. You take a train from the parking garage to the center. Once we got to the Getty Center, our first impression of the place was on how immaculately maintained the building and grounds were. There did not seem to be any expenses spared in the construction of the impressive Travertine Marble building. We got an audio tour (free ipod based) that explained the details about the artist and significance of the painting you were looking at. Lots of content for art lovers. Lots of food variety, but be prepared to pay premium prices if you plan on eating at the center. Excellent views of L.A and the surrounding countryside. There are no signs posted, but flash photography is not permitted in the galleries, while the photographic galleries do not permit any photographs. There are lots of security personnel around to enforce these rules :) My kids enjoyed viewing the various art pieces too. Time well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNextDimension
30,"Lovely building and gardens, average art",We were disappointed by the art collection. It was as though the museum had to have one painting by notable artists whether it was any good or not. I guess living within easy reach of the European capitals we are spoiled and have overly high expectations. The gardens and the buildings are lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L523ZGKevinM
50,Beautiful museum,"We live right down the street from there, and we should visit more. The only thing is you have to pay $15 parking. Yes, I guess you can take the bus there so you don't have to pay parking, but with 2 young toddlers, call me lazy, it will take an hour to go 4 miles from our house. Beautiful grounds, big and spacious. The garden is amazing, the kids love running through the grass and looking through the river. The exhibit is always changing, but it's always good to see the permanent collection as a review. Great way to spend the afternoon. The food service was just ok though, and a bit over price for cold sandwiches.They have a sit-down restaurants, but it's pricey for a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janet0728
50,The best museum ever visited,"The museum is free of charge, with galleries filled with rare collections of paintings, sculptures, decorative objects, pictures, etc. The garden is extremely neat and beautiful and allows a panoramic view of LA . We had the best time there during our stay in LA and will definitely visit again. Extremely well managed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13alirezan
50,AMAZING!,"Absolutely fantastic! - a highlight of the trip! Wonderful FREE art museum and beautiful grounds. The collection is massive, covering so many eras and with so many incredible works!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling_Trio111
40,Must see,It's an amazingly well maintained place. The museum is worth going but the beautiful lawns. The amazing views were the highlights for us. A must visit place.!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charru
50,"Amazing, even after 1 visit in 1999",The Getty Center is an experience unlike other fine museums around the world. The arts. architectures and the gardens are all part of the total experience. I was the only one of 6 people who visited the Center. It was interesting hearing their comments. They loved it. We got there around 10:30 on a Thursday and had no problem entering the garage. It costs $15. There were no other costs. The free tours are well worth it. Take advantage of all tours. Impossible to take it all in one day. The Restaurant at Getty is a must if you are a foodie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisnv
50,beautiful afternoon of culture,"this place is a marvel. if you are an art and culture buff, you probably need two days here. my family of five got the litle headphone tour guide thingees and spent three hours. We saw wonderful examples of Monet, Manet, Rembrandt, etc etc. We saw books adn manuscripts from the early 1200s. The facility has some of the most spectacular sweeping view of Los Angeles, and the garden is spectacular. It was simply too hot for us to hang out in the gardens for as long as we would have liked to, but all around this place is great. And its free. $15 for parking. When you're done, you can drive around the UCLA campus, which is right around the corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubberbubby
50,Astonishing,"Our favorite ""must-not-miss"" attraction in LA. Amazing collections. Marvelous facility with incredible views across LA and the ocean. Terrific special shows. And, the grounds are worth a visit all by themselves. In a half-a-day you can hit the highlights, but a full day is even better. Arrive early to avoid the line getting into the parking garage and to guarantee yourself a parking place (and a shorter line to the tram going up to the grounds). Also, if you plan to eat at the restaurant, make reservations when you first arrive. They often book up. Very, very highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoDoc
40,Something for Everyone,"The Getty Center offers something for everyone to enjoy. Whether its the art, garden walk or city views (on clear days), the Center is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon with a loved one. Beware though, parking could a hassle on busy days or holidays. Plan your time wisely to have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armandom562
50,Absolutely fascinating collection - stunning views,"I would never pass up an opportunity to visit the Getty Center and have enjoyed this breathtaking institution many times. Currently there is an extensive photography exhibition,however there is just so much to see here you couldn't possibly see it in one day. Kids enjoy the beautiful garden and lawns with views for miles...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damstel
50,Art for All,"I try to visit a major museum every time I go to a new city. I was in L.A. for my first time and although my trip was brief I wanted to make sure I got to the Getty. It did not disappoint. Actually, it exceeded my expectations. It was so much more than I imagined from reading about it and seeing it on TV, etc. It is massive and beautiful itself, you almost forget your there to see paintings and sculpture when you arrive because the architecture and the grounds are so beautiful. We spent most of the day here, saw everything we wanted to see and had a lovely lunch at the (very) crowded café. I will definitely return to visit on future trips to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BQfromNY
50,"A Great Day in LA, Even if You're Not into Art","The Westwood Getty Museum (there's also a Getty location in Malibu, whose emphasis is the antiquities) is a truly delightful LA experience. Plan on spending a full day there--roam the galleries that include a wide range of exhibits, from illuminated manuscriptsto photographic shows to 18th century furnishings to engaging temporary exhibits--with stops at their coffee shop, the well-stocked gift shops, and a stroll through the massive gardens designed by artist Robert Irwin. Bring a Kindle or a book as you take a relaxation break to enjoy LA's marvelous weather while sitting in one of the many outdoor areas. The Getty has so much to offer, including guided tours, lectures, etc., but it's also a little vacation atop a hill with panoramic views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabQ1168UP
30,Go for the view,"It feels like an industrial office complex. You have to park in the garage and take a small train to the center, so if you don't have lots of time, this is definitely not a place for a quick visit.There was art but I don't remember any of it. Most of the buildings are for administrators and students, I think.I do remember the expansive views of LA and the garden, which everyone walks around because there's not much else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindkandy
50,Beautiful and amazing Views of the City,The best deal in L.A Free all you have to pay for is parking. The Getty Center has something for everyone. If you love art this is a must see. The Getting also has a number of gardens and many look out points with views of downtown L.A. The center has a number of free tours don’t miss out can check in at the visitors information center to find out what tours are going on that day. Give yourself at least half a day to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P922KTpaulr
50,Perfect weekend afternoon,Great place to hang out on a weekend afternoon to enjoy the views and of course some good art! The garden is beautiful for laying around and relaxing. Not sure you can picnic there but there is a food court with blah food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968cristinag
50,Wonderful place to hang out on a sunny day,The museum was nice but what I really loved was the gardens and lawn outside. Perfect for chilling out and having a picnic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/underock
40,nice day trip,"beautiful gardens and a great place for art lovers. Many things to see and enjoy the day but stay indoors when the weather gets hot, better visit early in the morning which also is less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mbown01
50,Beautiful exhibits,"At the time I went there were beautiful exhibits on, featuring photography, a Degas exhibit and tons of other things. Also awesome architecture and views on the outside. And FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2154IQpeter
50,Fantastic building with a great view,"The building is fantastic. We live in The Hague and the same architect built our town hall. For us, the spoiled Duchmen, the art is nice, but not exceptional. We have so much of that in our museums. The exhibition of J.W.M. Turner was fabtastic. The Getty Center is a place I would visit again, when I'm in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verstratenmarinus
50,Great museum,"This is definitely a place to go when visiting Los Angeles.First, entering the museum is fun using a monorail from parking. Then after reaching the top, one has a fantastic view of the city. On top, there are gardens and a lot of grassy areas to enjoy the outdoors. Placed to eat inside or out, or bring your own food.Then, you have five different museums with exhibits of various themes. There is something for everyone. And you can stay as long or as short as you want.I have been here three times and could go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733DennisD
50,Outstanding art collection that is accessible to all,I had my second visit to the Getty today and it was absolutely outstanding. The collection is wonderful and the free self-guided tour on iPod helped me enjoy the artwork like never before. My favorite section was European paintings. The photography exhibit was disappointing but the rest of the museum and grounds are overwhelmingly inspiring and wonderful! All of the staff I interacted with were very pleasant and helpful. I wish I lived closer to the Getty so I could visit more often!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMLove226
50,Grounds and views as great as the art,"Really a fantastic spot. We spent as much time wandering the grounds a viewing the art. Small but excellent impressionist section. The galleries are relatively small compared with other major art museums in New York, Boston, Paris, Amsterdam, etc... but the pieces are great and there is only so much most people can handle in one day anyway. This is an easy half day and well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaLiga16
40,Gorgeous!,"From the flooring to the scenic views, this place is really gorgeous. I have been several times and each time is a new experience.I took the garden tour last time and was pleasantly surprised. The grounds are stunning and it is very interesting to hear about the lush foliage.My favorite part of coming here is the building, grounds and scenery more than the artwork inside.I sometimes come here just to experience tranquility and beauty by sitting on an outdoor bench and soaking it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyndarella18
50,What a great place. Only $15 too,"I think my only down side to The Getty Center was that we didn't have more time to see everything. What an amazing place. My girlfriend and I try to always go see something historical or educational when we travel and this was out pick for our L.A. trip. Let me tell you we hit the jackpot. So much art and history.. Heck we even loved the 10 minute intro video you can watch when you first get there. I can't think of anywhere else in Los Angeles you are going to get a better value for your money. For basically the price of a beer at dodger stadium you get Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, The Wiener Dog Calendar guy, Degas and so much more. Plus some of the best views I saw of the area in some amazing buildings. A must see...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mess417
50,vacation getaway,"The current impressionist painters using pastels exhibit, central gardens, and the tram. Be aware - lot of walking - wear comfy shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnbC9297KR
50,Third Timer for Mr Turner,"The Getty never ceases to please. The architecture (Thankyou Mr Meier), the structure, the Site and the curatorial finesse of the Exhibitions I've seen here always inspires me with awe.This trip was fundamentally for 'Mr Turner' and his extraordinary capture of light and colour.. if you haven't already, see the eponymous Movie with Timothy Spall in the title role, which indeed uses/features some of his original artwork which was on display.A wonderfully clear LA day added to the delight of our visit, as further reward after driving from Santa Barbara (previous stop from a West Coast trip coming down from Napa). The smooth operation of the parking & the utility of the mono rail along with the well manged and presented food & beverage service, is a winner and is a pleasant ease into the relaxing time to be had at & in this inspiring atmosphere. Congratulations to all involved & Again to Mr TurnerRemember your camera can only really be used outdoor/away from exhibits..& ...please dont forget to make a donation however small :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyDryden
50,Not to miss while in LA,Thank you for reading my review. A visit to the Getty is a must while seeing LA. The views from the museum are completely fantastic. They have one night per week where they are open until nine. I recommend going as there were not many people there and the sunset was fantastic. The architecture of the museum was worth the trip alone. It is ten dollars to park after 5 and 15 beforehand. The museum itself is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexG616
50,One of the best in the World,"Flying from Australia to Vancouver via LA. We had a one day stop over and looked for something special. We certainly found it by having the full day at the Getty Centre. We actually booked a VIP tour as it was difficult to get there from our LAX hotel. Arrived just on opening hours, and despite the hordes of school children, and left just on 5pm. The bus trip home took nearly two hours as the traffic was terrible. The taxi fares would have been huge!, as with the other reviews the whole experience was a must do. This has to be one of the top art centres in the world. Big statement, but well deserved. GO see for your self",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iacollo13
50,One of the Best Situated Museums in America,"The Getty is THE place to go on the WEST Coast the same way that MOMA is a must in Manhattan. High on a Hilltop the views outside are as visually impressive as any of the art inside. If you peruse museums, you gotta go to the Getty...at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaljoHal
50,Don't miss it!,One of the nicest museums ever. The building is a masterpiece itself. The garden is beautiful. The views are terrific. It is easy to spend the entire day there and not get bored of the site. Of course the collections are great too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UgeA_12
30,Staycation,The building & gardens beautiful. Disappointed in docents--excellent knowledge BUT no microphone to hear her in the large group! Another two docents had no knowledge of how the theater with the welcome film worked. Kept waiting for a green light to open the door--was never suppose to be green .. Wasted 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorisq188
50,The Getty on Memorial Day weekend,"I cant say what I do not like about the Getty, other than I can never see it all or ever get enough of it. It is free. The only thing that costs is parking and it is almost nothing. The views are spectacular, the architecture itself is simply worth seeing without viewing any art. The gardens are my favorite and then there is the art. Without the great art to see and the concerts, dining and exhibits Los Angeles would be lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dshintz
50,looks like something out of the future,"wow-building is beautiful, art collection is fabulous and surrounding gardens are spectacular.Can spend hours just wandering around.after visiting the museum you need to head to Malibu and see the Getty Mansion, totally different vibe but just as spectacular!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobpnola
50,Peaceful,"The Getty Center takes your breath away. The architecture is spectacular and the gardens have many, many unusual and interesting plants and flowers. And the art museum is great - I wish we had more time there. Park in the garage at the base for $15 and take the tram up - no other admission charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirleeee
50,Plan to Spend the Entire Day & Another!,"By far, my favorite museum in LA. And then, there is the Getty Villa! One day is not enough for me...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
40,Wonderful~,"Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 small kids) visited the Getty Center a couple of days ago while visitng my parents in L.A. It was very good that we got to actually get in this time, since we were not able to do so last year when we were there (due to the fact that the parking lot was full). The Getty Center has plenty of paintings and sculptures, as well as a beautiful garden, that everyone can enjoy. Unfortunately, on the day of our visit, however, the sky was rather cloudy with fog and light drizzle from time to time (very unlike L.A. around this time if the year). As such, being outside was a bit chilly (very surprising for L.A.). Nevertheless, we enjoyed the Getty Center very much. The kids also liked it. The tour of the collections that we participated in was good also. The good thing about the Getty Center is that there is no entrance fee. There is only the parking fee of US$15. The only drawback was that the line for the cafe around lunch time was too long for us (with small kids) to wait. We left the Getty Center to get lunch elsewhere. All in all, I highly recommend the Getty Center to those visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saesolbyeol
50,Stunning view at every turn!,This is one of the great museums of the world. The breath of the European and American collection is just incredible. The decorative arts are literally from floor to ceiling and everywhere between. The quality is equal to any of the very best and beyond almost all. Worth every penny and every second of time if you enjoy this type of venue and the views from the heights above LA are some of the best in town. And they have Van Gogh! Parking is $15 and the tram is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706josephm
50,The fabulous art is only the beginning.,"This amazing art institute cannot be missed. Yes, it features a priceless collection. But beyond that, the structure itself-- built from massive blocks of Carrera marble-- is simply awesome. Then there's the setting. On a clear day you can see downtown Los Angeles on one side and the Pacific Ocean/Santa Monica on the other. OK, then there's the gardens! Just lovely. Go early and park in the underground parking from which you'll take the tram up the scenic mountainside. When you get off the tram, walk over to the restaurant and make your lunch reservation. You'll be all set for an unforgettable morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/211barbaraj
50,The architecture is as good as the exhibits,"Fantastic museum. Loved the whole thing. From the tram ride up, to the beautiful entrance, the gardens and the enthusiasm of the staff. Much has been written on Trip Advisor about the exhibits so I'll just add that I love the way that you can get so close to things.Would have given anything to get into the building that does the conserving/restoring, however could not get past the first door and there was no one there to beg to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889andrewa
50,Utterly spectacular! It is a must visit!!,"The Getty Centre is truly a large scale beautiful work of art. We could only stop in for a couple of hours which was unfortunate because I could have spent an entire day at the Centre. From its amazing art collection, to the exceptional gardens to the breathtaking view, attention to detail is at the forefront of the Getty Centre. Upon arrival, you can park at the bottom of the mountain (parking fee of $15) and then ride the tram to the Getty Centre taking in the views as they slowly unravel on the tram ride. During my visit I was quite lucky as there was no fog that day meaning the views were phenomenal! We were handed a sheet which outlined the day's events which was useful especially given that we were tight on time. Lunch in the cafe was surprisingly inexpensive, the food was good (definitely better than most museum cafes!) and the sit down area offered further great views. This is an absolute must visit for anyone in LA - I know I will definitely be going back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3N0
50,Plan to Be There from Opening to Closing,"You'll want to be there all day from 10 am until 5:30 pm, & you'll still only manage to see a fraction of the place. The docents hand out a white ""cheat sheet"" for the day w/ highlights of things to see & do. Use it! Also make a reservation at the restaurant for a fancier sit-down meal, or plan on an early lunch at one of the cafés on the grounds.Don't miss the Sketching Area, & be aware that, although there is no entrance fee, parking for the day is $15.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929kelly1969
50,Do not leave Los Angeles without this,"Ok so maybe you have never been a huge art museum fan but this is a must. Set high on the hills overlooking Los Angeles the museum is architecturally stunning. J Paul Getty had this museum built to house his collection of European and American art and artifacts. You park at the bottom of the mountain for $15.00 and ride the tram up the mountainside to the museum. Entrance is free. The views are breathtaking and on clear days you can see the ocean and surrounding cities. It was foggy today and the mists rolling in over the mountain made it feel magical. Take one of the collection tours, walk the grounds, have lunch on the terrace. You could spend the day or come back on multiple days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janee799
50,Definitely a place to go,"We were browsing attractions and decided to go here. And boy, we did not regret it. There is art. Yes. And there is most of the European classics in art. But there is also the garden, architecture, history and the view of the city. So everything you could possibly want to see here. There is no fee, but you have to pay for the parking. But $15 is not a lot to see this place. We were staying in Santa Monica and this was relatively close. But it is worth while to visit from further away, too.We could have stayed for a longer time. The cafe is not a high quality restaurant, but it is better than most cafes in these kind of attractions. Decent amount of options, too. And not too overly prized either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingal10
40,Can't get bored there...,"We tool a group of students there for a whole afternoon and everyone absolutely enjoyed their time there. There's si much to see and to do there from just walking outside in the beautiful gardens to spending a few hours in the very nice museum. This place has a bit if everything and is perfect for the whole family, we had a blast and will definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,"Top Of The ""Must See"" List When In LA!","The Getty Center defies description as the scale of the site, buildings and contents are amazing. Even though the underground carpark had hundreds of cars parked there, we were never in a queue or felt like there were a lot of people around. The rooms, paintings, sculptures and furnishings are a wonderful surprise. Who would have thought all this could be viewed in Los Angeles. The architecture, gardens and grand scale of The Getty Center are unbelievable - the views looking back to LA from the Getty's Hillside location are a photographer's dream. No photographs inside however - as you would expect. Just go park, catch the train up and explore - if you get hungry they have a great cafe & dining area where you can sit and look out over the gardens. We just loved this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabmeow
50,A Great Half Day Out,"We decided to visit this place after a search on Trip Advisor as to the number 1 attraction in LA. We had half a day to our selves and so decided on The Getty Centre. It was great. The car parking was easy- it costs $15 but then admission to the centre is free. The great thing about the parking is that it is underground so when you return to your vehicle, it is nice and cool still. I loved the gardens and the wander through the plantings and sculpture. I did opt to use the free headphone/Ipod service to obtain info on the different paintings but the commentary was a bit long and drawn out and I just wanted to read and move on- much better way of doing it unless you like all the history and detail of every painting etc. You can get great views up at the centre also if it wasn't for the smog- on a clear day it would be great. The centre is huge and cool which means you are not being jostled at all and there are no queues- a nice change compared to some other LA attractions. One piece of advice for the centre- you have a line patrons are not to cross so as not to get too close to the paintings etc. I saw so many people being told to move behind the line- what line? It is sort of a line marked by the change in the wooden floor pattern? Maybe make it a little more obvious to the patrons to save having to constantly tell people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
50,Free and Fabulous,"The Getty is a must for anyone who loves beautiful views, beautiful art, history, and relaxing gardens, all for free! It can get pretty crowded on the weekends, but totally worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bri9az
50,Amazing museum with a focus on paintings,"We visited the Getty Center (which is FREE) based on the recommendation from Josh Gates over at the Travel Channel. Everything about the Getty Center was amazing - from the architecture of the large buildings to the beautiful gardens outside to the awe-inspiring art on the inside.You have to see this place at least once, and it'd take a good 3-4 hours to walk through everything. There are plenty of peaceful and almost private resting areas in the corridors connecting each pavilion overlooking Los Angeles. The views are breathtaking!They do not have as many sculptures as the Getty Villa but they have plenty of gorgeous oil paintings from throughout the past centuries. Photos are allowed in some areas and each room is guarded by one or two employees. There are engaging workshops there, like a sketch room, but in general little kids may get bored fast here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dh375
50,Lots to do,"The museum was much bigger than I expected, you’ll easily need all day to get round it all. The gardens are lovely and very well kept and even though it was very busy the gardens still managed to seem peaceful and relaxing. The have special exhibitions which change every few months and are usually very interesting. It’s all free of charge except for parking. There’s a big restaurant which had plenty of choice for hot meals but not as much choice if you just wanted a quick snack, I'm not sure if there were other cafes available.Try not to go on the weekends as it gets very, very busy. I spent 45 minutes just getting in to the car park on a Sunday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cle182
50,Amazing,"I visited the Getty in June of 2015. It is a stunning piece of architecture, and a beautiful museum. It is well worth a stop, but I'd say it is less suited to small children, but good for families with older tweens/teens.To start, you park in a garage, then take a short Tram line up the hill to the center. The museum is free, but you have to pay $15 for parking, which is nothing for what you get.The building is reminiscent of a castle, made of white stone. The galleries are separated by courtyards and gardens, most offering a breathtaking view of Los Angeles. The exhibits are well thought out, and feature beautiful pieces. There are a lot of stairs, so if you have problems getting around, you need to look for the elevators.There are some unique pieces. I am not expert in art, but it seemed that The Getty features slighly less known artists than, say the Smithsonian. One thing I appreciated was a small write up next to each piece that explained the background and technique of the piece. Useful for a philistine such as myself.This stop is well worth your time if you are looking to a half day activity while up in the Hollywood area. It only took 25 minutes to drive here from downtown Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fishman92
50,World Class Museum,"I have visited the Getty Center at least 10 times. The art collection, the architecture, and the grounds are outstanding. I spend most of my time in the West and South Pavilions. The oil paintings are the main focus but there are also sculptures, rare furniture, tapestries and photographs. Include some time to view the outside areas also. The architecture and the grounds of the Getty Center are just as impressive as the art work.As you would expect, the restaurant is very expensive. There are cafes also but the selection is limited. I recommend brining you own food to enjoy on the one of the outside terraces. There is no charge for admission but parking is $15. Also, the line for parking can take 30 minutes or longer during peak weekend hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11JerryB
30,Gaurded with security guard.,I expected it to be sounded with alarms and special parking. I think it has great treasures. I saw on television the contents of the Getty that I did not enter into.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenhD4247VT
50,A must,"It is absolutely essential that any visitor yo LA at least tries to get here (easier with own transport). An absolute temple to one man's vision - remarkable and impressive. Sure, JPG seemed to have interesting taste, but the sheer size of his collections, and the space in which they're housed, will take your breath away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dr_iggy
50,A Must See When Visiting L.A.,"Truly amazing place from the architecture, gardens and to the art. I recommend taking the docent led tours. I did everyone they offered and you learn so much. The view is stunning. Had lunch in the cafe and it was very good. Plan on spending the whole day there. Best thing about it - it is free! They do charge for parking but if you stay Hotel Angeleno, they take you and pick you up. Worth a trip to L.A. just to visit this amazing place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boisenb
50,Half-day trip to the Getty Center,"I only had a few days in the LA area and decided to spend half a day at the Getty Center. I wasn't extremely interested in the paintings but the architecture and views from the top are absolutely incredible. Well worth the trip, even if you only have a half day. You could easily spend days walking through all the galleries. The paintings and French artifacts were pretty fascinating after all and I could have spent longer looking around. I would definitely recommend taking the walk to the top (instead of the tram)...I did...the views are incredible on the way up and walking gives you more time to take pictures and look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Den665
50,A morning at The Getty Centre,My Brother in law said this was a must even if just to see the Architecture!He was right! We thoroughly enjoyed exploring all the different exhibits from statues to Great works of Art by Famous Artists. The exhibits are so well displayed. Not overwhelming. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and very clean.Lots of small school groups who were so well behaved.Definitely a must visit!Wheelchair and Stroller friendly.Gardens would be an amazing spot for a picnic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosebuds63
50,Awesome art collection,"This is the most well endow art museum in the world. As of 2011 it had over $6 Billion in endowments. The collections are fabulous and the organization established to operate the property and collections are ""Top Draw"". The array of art is to vast to recap here. Check out the site on line (Gettycenter.edu). The food service is great and should be taken advantage of. The various tours/lectures and classes provided should be considered. Prior to planning a visit, reservations need to be made for these activities. We will surely sign up on our next visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVK084
50,Former Getty Docent Loves the Getty,"Going to the Getty Center is like taking a mini-vacation from the chaos that is often Los Angeles. A fun thing to do is walk up the winding road instead of taking the tram. Stop and look at the modern sculpture before meandering up the slope and look for deer or coyotes on the hillside. When you get to the top, take a minute to look at the outdoor sculpture on the tram level and the beautiful Monterrey pines. The water features have been turned off during the drought, but listening to the fountains on the way up the stairs is refreshing on a hot summer day. Before you enter the rotundra, look to the right across the plaza and note the framing the architect designed that enhances the views of Brentwood and beyond.Be sure to take the Garden or Architectural tour if you have time. Each docent has a slightly different presentation and I have taken the tours multiple times always learning something new.Here are some fun things that many tourists miss at the Getty Center.In the rotundra facing outside, look to the right, behind the place where the audio sets are given out. There is a stairway (also an elevator) leading down into a great hall that features a wonderful painting of the Durer stag beetle. Kids love it! Also there are restrooms down there that aren't often crowded!Just outside this hall on the lower level is an exit to the top of the garden path and also the beginning of the running stream. A very narrow stairway leads back up to the main level of the museum here and I love to walk up it. It reminds me of the narrow streets and walkways in old European towns.Don't skip the wonderful photo exhibits on the lower level of the West Pavillion.Another great place to take a view of the city is the upper level of the South Pavillion. A couple of sculptures are outdoors here too. You can see the crowded 405, UCLA, Brentwood, Bel Air, sometimes the Griffith Observatory, and to the southwest, the Pacific Ocean.If you like the outdoor sculpture, cross over the Getty Research Institute gardens from the lower garden level.The Getty Center has the very best scones ever! My favorites are the cheddar and pecan.Speaking of food, a great place with lots of choices for the whole family is the cafeteria. It is beneath the high end restaurant near the entrance of the museum. Pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups, etc. There is a lovely outdoor patio there as well.Sometimes, just escape to the Getty Center and get away from the noise and mayhem on the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegaspali
50,Best views of LA,"This place is amazing on many levels. Literally and figuratively! There are incredible views of downtown, the mountains, and the ocean. It is simply a gorgeous place. And that is just the outside- there are many and various exhibits going on all the time. This is a perfect place to just unwind, relax, and see the city. You also can take in great art installations. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robib_13
50,Do Not Miss,"An architectural beauty on the top of a mountain. This is a campus environment with multiple buildings and garden areas. Some buildings are research buildings for the Getty Foundation and some are public museum buildings. Admission is free although there is a charge for parking. We took a cab from our hotel and had no trouble getting one back at the end of the day. The parking lot attendants will call a cab for you, if one is not readily available. The food in the cafe was good, but a line formed at noon, so try to go a little early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKKelley3368

50,There are two Getty Art Centers,"The Getty Museum and Getty Villa are both excellent venues to visit. The new Museum is as interesting on the outside as what is inside. North of Santa Monica a few miles this is a top tier visit, with an interesting restaurant, some jazz music in the courtyard occassionally. Free Museum, you will pay for parking about 10 dollars. I studied the Classics and prefer the Getty Villa which has the Ancient Greek and Roman works of art set in a classical Greek Villa configuration. This was the original Getty, go see both !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276kevinp
50,Worth a visit!,"Gorgeous views, great exhibits, restaurants have good, fresh food, lovely garden. A must visit when in Los Angeles. Parking $15 and the rest is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swallowfield2015
40,Everybody recommended it; after I visited it I can totally understand that,"We went there in the morning to beat the crowds. Of course there were already a lot of people but as the Getty Centre is quite big it didn't feel crowded at all. Very nice exhibitions, but we didn't have time to see them all. What I missed a bit was a better directory without having the paper map. The Garden was amazing and also the views. The Getty Centre has no entrance fee. Parking costs are at $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jen05112015

40,"Fabulous, not to be missed","I have been here twice. Still much to see. Can not wait to return. FREE. But it costs to park so fill your car with friends and family. Was $15 when I was there. So worth it. Great tram drive from parking garage to museum complex. Bring a picnic...lots of pleasant areas to sit and relax. There are guided tours or roam on your own in the museum and several gardens. You can see 360 degrees when you are there, from the hills to the skyline of LA to the Pacific Ocean. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milliemarie46
50,Beautiful place,"What an amazing museum. The grounds alone is a palace but all the artwork and sculptures, wow! I would come back everyday if I could.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coachjo1
50,It Never Grows Old,"My wife and I have visited the Getty on our own many times. We regularly take out of town visitors, partly to enjoy it once again ourselves, but mainly to thoroughly enjoy their delight as they experience it for the first time. My grandchildren love it. I loved watching them draw in the Sketching Gallery. Monet, Dali, Renoir and Degas are all safe, but their drawings hang proudly in my private gallery. With the changing exhibits and the permanent masterpieces, the Getty never gets old. Every time is a new treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972gwynh
50,"With hilltop city views, fine art, and an always changing garden, this is a 'must' for travelers as well as locals!","Architect Richard Meier's masterpiece situated high on a hill overlooking the city. A tram takes you to the top of the mountain where the museum hosts special exhibits as well as a permanent collection of art.Don't leave without taking a stroll in the garden.

Take the free tour of the outside architecture and you will be mesmerized with all the thinking and planning that was done to created this amazing museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therealtrue
50,"Beautiful Museum, Beautiful View","The Getty Center is worth visiting just for the site location and the view across the western part of Los Angeles, but there's a lot more to see.The architecture and gardens are lovely. Free docent-led tours leave from the information desk. The cafe food is excellent. And, yes, the art, too... 😊Being a relatively young museum, it's permanent collection doesn't have the breadth and depth of the majors, but their budget has allowed them to acquire some fine works.And they've hosted some remarkable shows, such as the brilliant Turner show recently concluded.Try to visit on a weekday, when there are smaller crowds. Admission is free, parking is not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garrym42

50,Something for everyone,I'm a local so I've been to the Getty many times but this trip was special becase I shared it with my dtr in law and new grandbaby. Parking is $15 but entrance is free. Access is easy if you have mobility issues or limited ability for distance walking.There are plenty of handicapped parking spaces if you get there early and they are close to elevators. Direction signs are well marked. Maps available at information table. Elevators blend in so you have to look for them or ask. There is something for everyone . Even my 3 mo old grandbaby attentively observed people and ambiance in the galleries. The cafeteria is overpriced but the food was ok. The patio seating has breathtaking views of LA. Because of the drought they no longer turn on the fountains and I noticed more drought tolerant plants and less colors in the outside gardens. Architecture tour is awsome..it's a great way to spend a day with family or friend...and especially grandbabies of any age,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520marthag
50,Splendid!,"THIS is how to run a museum! So easy to escape the hustle & bustle and concentrate on what this museum has to offer. From exhibits, to films, to collections, you will have a restful experience at the Getty. And the FOOD is awesome. A bit pricey, but worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egtact
50,What an awe-inspiring place,"I brought family from Texas here, and they were just enthralled. Be aware that the stairs are killer and if you want to see everything, have your knees and cameras ready. The art was them most exquisite I had ever seen in my life...from as early as the 1300s to as late as the 1800s and there is great variety. Plus, the outside garden has a view of all of downtown Los angeles from the terrace and you can see the smog cloud hanging over the buildings in a light brown haze. It's still beautiful regardless. The cafe seemed interesting, but I didn't go because of the line/prices. However, just pay parking and bring as many people as you want. You'll all have a blast ! Amazing religious art including cultures/busts too and French Rococo !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholash965

50,Los Angeles must see,"I try to come here regularly. I live over an hour away but I try to go twice a year, first to see my favorites, like the pastel of the little girl in the blue coat and her dog, or the French furniture, or the life sized wooden statue of the priest by a female sculpter of the 1700s. Even the cafeteria is a must see. I always come around lunch time. Get a brochure. Get food. Sit and plan what I want to see and in what order. There's something for everyone. You cannot possibly see it all in one day. So you have to, like me, come back to see and share your favorites and check out something new. I take all my out of town visitors here first, if possible. And introduce locals to it as much as I can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly1558

50,Beautiful Sights Inside and Out,"The Getty is a beautiful museum to visit. You start off on the uphill trolley which immediately takes you away from the usual experience. The collections are housed in several buildings, so you get to travel outdoors in our great CA weather. The gardens and grassy areas are perfect for relaxing and having a picnic lunch (there are actually picnic tables in location). Best of all you get a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean. Everyone should experience this at least once. Parking is $15, but admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMT504

50,Awesome way to spend a day!,"Parking is at the bottom of the hill in a parking structure. You ride a tram to the top. Even with lots of people, the tram operates quickly and there is not a lot of time lost on waiting. The building are grounds are beautiful. The view is spectacular. The regular exhibits are very nice.....Picasso, Renoir, Monet, Mannet, Cezanne, Degas and more! They have a whole building for guest exhibits which they sometimes keep open later than the regular exhibits. There is a café on the grounds with a nice terrace to sit and eat. Be prepared, at closing, they IMMEDIATELY usher you out to the tram. And it is FREE! ...a minimal charge for parking. Can't beat the price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rabbolding
50,Better for architecture then art,"The Getty has great art by lesser artists, and lesser pieces by greater artists. Their special exhibits are often excellent. But the thing here is the architecture, which is world class. There are open spaces, beautiful gardens, and grass area you can picnic on. Great with kids as lots of room to run, or roll on the grass. With its panoramic views it gives a good perspective on the LA sprawl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kidb
50,If you only have one day in LA-this is the place to go,"I live here in LA, and try to go a few times a year, and ALWAYS bring guests, esp if they have only a few days in LA. There are great views of Los Angeles, the hills, the ocean etc, a garden where guests can wow at our botanical bounty.The cafe is more than decent, and not to mention the art and collections. Esp, I try to see what is in the smaller exhibition spaces, and the photography shows are always very interesting. It is a 1/2 day trip, to a full day. There is also a fancy restaurant for dining-if you want to go all out. And the setting at night is spectacular. Expect to spend 4-6 hours here, and you will have a world class cultural experience. Check out their website for current shows etc.Even the tram ride up the hill is terrific!!Parking is $18-but no fee for the museum center, which means its also economical for couples and families. The place can be bright in the summer sun, so bring hats etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coloursmith
50,Beautiful Day Trip for the Family,We've visited the Getty a few times with the kids and it makes a pleasurable day trip in the LA area. The art is wonderful to view and look at as is the grounds and the architecture. The view itself is amazing. I would suggest packing a lunch and eating at the Getty in between your walk around the grounds.The Getty itself is free for admission but there is a cost for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmyla

Entry is free but you pay for your car park. Worth every cent, and then some!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzurisana
50,An eye and soul contact with art and history.,"It was a very long awaited trip. A day that will be etched in our memory for ever. I would even say one trip is not enough to comprehend everything. Where do I begin? Oh, yes it is FREE. Just pay the parking fee of $15 and the train will commute you to the top of the hill and back to where you were parked. A very easy access to a very big world of art and history. We spent the whole day there with a lunch brake at Getty restaurant which is another piece of art (gastronomical though). There is a cafeteria with a lower price menu also available on the grounds. We had a very pleasant day submersed in an extreme antiquity - a real escape from daily routine and TV commercials.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hadrout
50,Amazing sights inside and out!,"The Getty offers many activities for youth and adults. Check the website for the day's activities for the day you are visiting.

Enjoy the various inside art exhibits and then head out to the Gardens and extraordinary views. Admission is free - Parking is not. For travelers on a budget, the museum can be reached through public transit. A short tram ride from the parking garage up to the center brings you to the first of the breathtaking views.

50,The Crown Jewel of Los Angeles,"This is in the top 5 of must see sites of LA.

The buildings themselves are works of art, the views are spectacular, the feeling of space and light, the gardens and outdoor kinetic sculptures are fabulous....and then there are the wonders within! Each pavilion held treasures worthy of hours of time, the staff were all really helpful and obviously loved the space they were working in.

50,What a beautiful location!,I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. It hangs off the edge odiferous a cliff clad in white marble imported from Italy!!! Beautiful! Lots and lots of art. You need a good 3 days to go through all levels. We stayed with the Renaissance masters and loved every second of it. We were only there for. 3 hours and we hadn't even covered an eighth of the museum. If you go to LA you must go. You only pay for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonar531
50,National Treasure,"With so much to see inside and out….this is not to be missed. The art exhibits were wonderful, and I especially enjoyed the ""Light, Paper and Process"" exhibit.

Spend the afternoon here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharyln2014
50,Magnificent place,"This was our second visit to the Getty Center, it was wonderful! We visited Memorial Day weekend and it was very busy. Get there in the morning if you want to avoid parking lines. The architecture, gardens, views, and of course the art are so fantastic, but the place retains the feel of a community gathering space. Relax and wander to your heart's content. Have lunch in the Cafe or bring your picnic. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sasa323
50,Beautiful and peaceful! The Best Art Museum in LA!,"The Getty Center is one of the most beautiful art museums in LA. While it is out of way and not particularly easy to get to without a car, this aspect is what sets itself a part. The building and concourse are amazing, with great architecture and striking ivory colored walls. Once you step foot out into the garden and take a stroll, you’ll be blown away by the detail and scale. There are some great views of Los Angeles from the balconies as well.Inside the museum, there are some of the best laid out collection of art in the city. Room recreations are interesting and demonstrate the majesty of 17th and 18th century European culture. Not to be missed are Van Gogh’s Irises and James Ensor’s huge Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889 painting. The Getty contains works from all of the acclaimed modern painters from Cezanne to Van Gogh, and also has an impressive collection of pre-Renaissance art. If you can only visit one museum in all of LA, make it the Getty, which has the rare distinction of containing beautiful art within its walls and wondrous landscapes outside of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadou5
50,Wholesome fun for the family,"Both Gettys are worth seeing over and over even kids found its an interesting place, too much to see. Always plan a long day to maximize all the great thing Getty has to offer. I can't wait to come in the summer to listen to the outdoor music. Lots of walking, comfy shoes doesn't hurt. I can't believe you only need to pay for the parking, thank you, it's well maintain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange

50,Excellent Art Center with great city views.,"The Getty Center is free so he price is right. Parking was $15 when I last went in Jan. 2013.

I am not an artistic person but whenever tourists come to visit me I put this on our lis of places to go and ry to expand my knowledge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8976FYpaulb
30,A free trip to the museum,"The Getty has free admission which is a great draw for a group or a family. Parking is $15, but again, free admission! The center itself was fine. The gardens were fine. It's not that the Getty doesn't hold some amazing pieces, it's just not a particularly impressive museum. The building and layout are beautiful as are the vistas. If you're looking for something on a long layover or to get out of the car for a few hours, this could be a great side trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8414WOsarahm

50,Get to the Getty!!,"If you have at least 2 hours to spare if you're on your way to Disneyland, for instance, stop and see what this impressive museum has to offer. You will see works of art only previously seen in books or on the Internet. Van Gogh's Irises or Degas Dancer Taking a Bow are right there within your reach...BUT DON'T-I was scolded more than once for getting too close! Also they allow photographs as long as there's NO FLASH (I'd been taking photos all day and of course the flash went off accidentally and again I was sternly scolded) The building itself, perched on a cliff on a Los Angeles hillside, is spectacular. From one vantage point, can see the entire LA basin. I truly enjoyed my visit and hope someday to see it again, probably on my way to Disneyland 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angela3950
40,Artmazing!,"If you are an art fan, this Getty Center is one place you should not miss when visiting Los Angeles. A place so BIG with the long queue of the shuttle train that is worth the wait.

50,The Turners were Incredible!,"We went again - this time to see the special Turner Exhibit which ended May 24. I had only seen a few of his paintings in Europe, so what a treat to see so many of his pieces in one place. Although we've visited The Getty several times, we wandered around again, looking at the permanent collection. One can never see a beautiful painting too many times, can one? There are three Rembrandts that floor me every single time. Besides the paintings there are beautiful decorative arts to enjoy. On the day we visited, the views were stunning in all directions. There's a lot of parking, but they advise you to arrive early as some days the spaces actually fill. We got there on a Friday at 10 am when they open. The tram ride up the hill is fast and so easy it makes you wish every museum had one. Pick up a map of the galleries at the Information Desk when you enter (free entry). Several places to eat, kiosks with faster fare and drinks, pretty gardens, and the buildings themselves are a wonder to look at. Parking is $15 per car. Can't wait to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
50,A must see in Los Angeles area,"I simply ran out of superlatives to describe this attraction. The quality of the displays, the architecture, the garden and most of all the location. I have been to a number of the top museums in Paris, Versailles and Rome and I don't feel the contents of the Getty Center were any less. Few museums could provide the commanding panoramic view of Los Angeles like the Getty Center. And the entrance fee is right...zero...free. don't miss the guided tours either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenH853
50,Excellent stop in los angeles,A must for any visit to Los Angeles not only for the art but for the terrific views you can see the entire city on a clear day.

50,Beautiful,"Everything about this place is beautiful, the art exhibitions, the grounds, the views, the places to eat. There's plenty of places to sit relax and watch the people and views. The information tours are very informative. I've been here many many times and will always go back. The museum is free but there is a $15 charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
50,The landscaping alone is worth the trip!,"We were delighted to find that you had to park then take a tram to the Getty, high up on a hill, overlooking Los Angeles. We loved the gardens, the beautiful old stone, imported from Italy that held artifacts from the sea. We ate overlooking the big world outside. You can see all hte way to the ocean and up to Palos Verdes. We enjoyed the artwork as well. A very relaxing and peaceful way to see L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraDee_22
50,"Wonderful ambience, location and exhibits","Came here on a vacation, initially alarmed by enormous underground parking facility ($15) but tram ride to the centre (free) slick and scenic. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful, and the centre itself - several distinct buildings, plus gardens - was beautifully designed and maintained, worth seeing just for the atmosphere alone. We didn't have time for much museum/exhibit viewing though this was partly because we enjoyed lingering in the imaginatively laid out gardens, and sitting snacking! Would definitely return if in the LA area again, and particularly if interested in a specific exhibit (we just missed a recent Turner exhibition - pity). A lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcG3299UQ
50,Best $15.00 you'll spend!,"The whole experience here is very uplifting. The people who work there, including the volunteers, couldn't be nicer. The art work is fabulous, and the gardens are beautiful. The architecture is stunning. What a way to spend a day in L.A. If you miss this, you are missing out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franceso217
50,Breath taking art,"Loved everything I saw, didn't have enough time to see it all in one day trip. Masterpieces in painting, sculpture, antiquities, and even historical pieces. Outside walking from building to building when weather was good also pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terried529
40,Art for All,"Take a tour on arrival to get oriented and see a few of the works up close. It is possible to get very close to the art, and galleries were not crowded.The quality of the collection is overwhelming and we were ready for the cafeteria an a light lunch to talk about what we had seen. A stroll through gardens reset our brains and we were ready for further exhibits- the flow of the buildings is also beautiful, with natural light even in the galleries, and views from the halls between exhibits. One day was just an introduction!Parking is easy and the only cost is the parking fee- $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BentleyBA
50,Great museum of the world!,Beautiful architecture and art! Free to get in the the museum. Must pay $15.00 to park however. Crowded on this beautiful Saturday so you could walk to the museum from the parking level and enjoy a hike. Some people were taking picnics which I think would be a great idea!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940catherinem
50,"Amazing, huge!","We went here on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and, as you might imagine, it was a pretty busy place! We arrived about 11:30am and waited about 15 minutes to park. (And based on the VERY long line of cars stretching off into the distance when we left about 5:30pm, I would highly recommend coming early to avoid that wait!) Parking is $15 per car, but then admission is free (which is amazing for something as large and classy as The Getty Center. And it being so close to Los Angeles!)The restaurant and café options were not cheap, but the food quality was good (in the café at least.) If you can time your meal to not be at peak meal times, you'll likely find the wait times to be less. The restaurant does accept reservations, so if that's your preference, that would likely be a good way to limit your waiting.The architecture was amazing. The views were breath-taking. The art was lovely. The gardens were beautiful.This is a huge place! I wouldn't plan for less than 4-5 hours if you want a reasonable overview. We didn't see everything and we were there 5 hours!They have a family room area that seemed quite popular. They have a sketch the art area that was also quite busy.For such a big place, it is well-maintained and clean. They provide umbrellas near the entrances/exits of the buildings to give portable shade from the sun.My tips:Wear good walking shoes, wear sunscreen and bring sunglasses for when you'll be outside (the travertine is bright and reflects light up/from the side). Tuck a bottle of water into a bag you carry - there are a few drinking fountains, but otherwise it was a dehydrating day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLPlovesPE42
50,A Deserving Home for Some of the World's Most Famous Paintings. Well Done America!,"I flew from Australia to L.A. to visit the Getty. Then flew on to the East Coast. But on the way home, had to stop off at L.A. again for another look at American Grandeur.With spectacular, spacious grounds, a wonderful sight of the 'planes landing at LAX and a close-up view of the Super crowded Freeway! Never, ever take a cab to the Gallery, you WILL get caught in traffic and it will cost you a fortune.!The 'thing' I love about American Art Galleries is that most of them build the building for the paintings and sculptures. Mostly, French and English end up hinging their masterpieces on the walls of an old palace, castle, or Train Station. (Been to the D'Orsay lately.)Needless to say I was totally impressed with the Getty - from the train from the car park to the way the people in the canteen cleared their own tables for the staff on the way out. I have never seen this done elsewhere before. Great!Brian, from Perth. W.Australia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8045FNbriand
50,Sunset Paradise,We spent our last few hours in LA here and it was fabulous. The gardens and architecture and majestic and so beautiful. The atmosphere is relaxing. The sound of water can be heard in most places. The views are amazing. Then there is the art - breathtaking and so much to see. The boys loved the electric train from the carpark. Definitely would come here again. Amazingly this place is free for everyone to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624karenr
50,Stunning Representaion of Humanity's Achievements,"In our era, petroleum drives our civilization. For better and worse. The Getty oil money has led to this particular Better. The museum on the hill is indeed spectacular, and the mounting journey in the tram sets off the space with awe. The exhibitions are presented with great intelligence and accessibility (including free iPod tour commentaries). As beautiful as the place is in daylight (and the hunt for fossils in the marble helps hold one in chronological scale), it is even more lovely at night for its views of Los Angeles and its ocean edge--but even more the lighting on the buildings and in the trees makes it all both monumental and breathtakingly vibrant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmbrod
40,Noah's Ark at the Getty,"Noah's Ark at the Getty is fun for young children. As you can imagine, there are realistic animals of all sizes everywhere, and even a rainstorm to see, as well as plenty of places to climb. It's completely indoors, and very well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanfordkuninrubin
50,Fabulous Art in a Beautiful Setting,Luckily I caught the final day of the J M W Turner exhibit. Went early to avoid the holiday weekend crowds. Spent time viewing the Turner and another special photography exhibit. Did a few other galleries and the beautiful gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptyduke
50,Super place to visit,Our third visit to the Getty but this time at sundown. A magical place at any time. A Turner exhibition was our reason to visit this time. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philpix
30,Of but not amazing,"It's way too imposing. The whole setup cries out ""look at me"", thus it feels like it's trying to take over from the art. There are walkways, ramps, steps everywhere and more ""do not"" signs than artworks. Views are better from the Observatory and it's more relaxing there. Go here if there's an exhibition you need to see, but otherwise there are better things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerdSchenkel
40,Nice Experience in a Great Setting,"The view from the upper terrace is spectacular, all the way to the Santa Monica wharf. The Turner exhibit from the Tate in London was very complete and well done. Personally, I enjoyed the photography exhibit even more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfkat
50,A nice place to spend the day,"This is a really nice time out from the hustle of LA . You can take the monorail or walk to the top of the art gallery. The views and gardens are beautiful and they allow picnics. The parking fee is $15 and that includes admission for all persons. Plan to spend more time than you think, the guide mentioned 1- 2 hours however there is a lot to look at I would say 3 - 4 hours is more likely. Overall a great place to spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Supertier
50,Very nice and peaceful place,"This place is a full day tour for art lovers. Nice, clean and peaceful place. Have a visit and for sure you will come again n again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363rakeshb
10,Waited 2 hours trying to get in to park,"Having visited the Getty Villa, we chose to go to the Getty Center. Unfortunately, the wait was 2 hours just to enter the lot to the garage. We chose to finally leave without seeing the center. My advice is get here very early, or run through the Getty Villa and then head over immediately to avoid being stranded in traffic and going nowhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dermgoddess
50,Great architecture and views of LA,"In order to get to the Getty you have to take a tram. The tram takes about 5 minutes, it's very clean and offers great views. It goes at a nice calm speed so it doesn't make you feel sick. The architecture is amazing but be prepared to walk a lot and to go up and down many many stairs. There are elevators but they are slow. It is free to get in and is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101garyn
30,Crowded and somewhat interesting,"It held marginal interest for the kids and a little more than marginal interest for adults. It was a super crowded day so perhaps that explains the overall sense of ""meh, it was ok.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benk851
50,Amazing!,"Superb architecture set on top of a hill amidst beautiful gardens. Great collections of paintings, furniture sculpture etc, with guided tours available - and all free of charge apart from $15 car parking. Staff friendly and helpful, excellent café. A great day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2365IVpeterw
50,Spectacular facility and art collection.,"It could take several days to enjoy all the Getty has to offer, but even if you only have a couple of hours, it is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arewethereyet844
50,A must for museum lovers,"If nothing else, come to see the architecture. The site on the hill tiop is stunning, made more so by the harmonious architecture of the buildings. The collection cannot match the Met or the National Gallery but is very interesting. An excellent place to spend half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanChg
50,"Art, architecture, views","Vincent's Sunflowers has its home here. The architecture and views are remarkable and it is lovely change out of a warm city and being welcomed into a cool breeze on a little hill. Art is outstanding. The statues are lovely. I was worried by all the people in the train fro. The base to the entrance, thinking it would be overly crowded but surprisingly not as there is ample room in the well designed lay out. Our taxi driver was pretty stoned o. The way there, but our return driver was. AOK. It gave us something to talk about! We loved the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferMay2015
50,A must-visit place in Los Angeles,"I visit this place several times a year (I went three times to the Turner exhibit alone) and it never disappoints. The permanent collection features world-famous gems and the the temporary exhibits are top notch, especially in photography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yseut
50,Very impressive,The Getty Center has both and impressive set of art works and well as being an impressive set of buildings. Not only can you marvel at the sights inside but outside you have a great view of the mountains and of L.A.. This is a great place to go to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and relax and enjoy the sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuy64
20,Closed on Mondays,After making the effort to visit the Getty centre it is Closed on Mondays . We decided to put it off until the next day and go to the Getty villa as well as I read if you pay for the parking at the Getty villa it double up for the Getty centre also. However security told us that the villa was Closed on Tuesda. I wish I knew this before hand. I could have planned my day better and avoid the L.A trafficYea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593DerekM
50,A pleasant spot to decompress,"Not too far up a mountain, overlooking Los Angeles. Lots of beautiful art, sculpture, paintings and photos. Lovely grounds. I appreciate their respect for the current drought in California by not having their water features in operation and only offering water in the restaurant by request. Restaurant is wonderful. Definitely an ""adult"" restaurant. Lovely atmosphere and great food. Only a couple vegetarian options though. Bring a jacket. It may be warm outside, but the art buildings are a bit more climate controlled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857colleeno
40,Awesome Center,"It was great. Tip: you can take pictures of the paintings, etc. in the Getty Center as long as you don't use your flash. Thought that was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhinestoneLady
50,A great free attraction,"It was surprising to find such a beautiful site for the cost of parking $15. Everything else was free, including the iPod guides. Great views, beautiful gardens and great art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HinghamJohn
30,Really? The #1 attraction in L.A.?,"Not to offend anyone, but if this is the best thing to see in L.A., you should probably save your time and money. In fairness, I live in a place where spectacular natural beauty surrounds me every day of my life, so please forgive me if I'm not overwhelmed looking down on distant skyscrapers and congested freeways shrouded in smog. (You could almost see the ocean of the day we were there!)And while I am college educated, my tastes don't particularly lean towards the arts, so what I guess I'm trying to say is that unless you really enjoy art, architecture, artificially engineered gardens and blurred vistas, you might not find this place as interesting as many of the reviewers did. I went with my two adult daughters, and am sorry to say that after about an hour, we had seen all we wanted to see, and left; back out into that sea of traffic we had watched from above while fighting to get back to Venice (which doesn't awe me either). You might conclude from this that I'm not a big fan of L.A., and you would be correct, though I did enjoy seeing the Pepperdine campus on the PCH. To each his own, I guess",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinwcollier
40,Excellent for a weekend visit,"Like views, architecture, special exhibits, . Do not like food. Permanent collection could be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Padbsk
50,Just beautiful,"This museum is great. The place, the views, the gardens, the architecture... everything is amazing. Great place to take lots of pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMartha89
40,Not the Louvre,"Okay, it isn't the Louvre, but it also isn't as crowded. The architecture of the Getty is modern, well coordinated with the landscape architect and pleasing sight lines and coordinated colour with its use of marble from Italy. The art is good, the furniture from various periods exceptional, and the panoramic views of Los Angeles, from the Pacific Ocean, to (on a really clear day) downtown Los Angeles, dramatic.A trip to Los Angeles without spending time at the Getty, is an incomplete trip. You will not learn much about Los Angeles, but your appreciation of Los Angeles as a cultural center will be rewarded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERINLAW
50,Great Place to Visit,"Great place to visit, no charge for admission however $15.00 parking. The views , paintings and gardens are beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViajerosCasados
50,A great place to spend the day,"The Getty Center has a lot to recommend it: Stunning views of LA, a fabulous campus, restaurants, a garden to relax in, a unique bus/train with views of the freeway...and art too! Whenever friends visit LA I always send them to the Getty and they're never disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nigelnet
40,Architecture wins over art collection!,"I have been to the Getty Museum and can only speak highly of the fantastic gardens and the buildings architecture. The art outside is so much more impressive than the art inside. Inside you have gaudy Rococo gold and many religious paintings..on the outside you have natural splendor in the gardens, awesome building materials and a fantastic view.Lunch in the restaurant is way overpriced and the service is surly. Go for the surroundings and leave for your meals.Reservations for parking are a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniewp1882
50,Eighth Wonder of the World,"While the art collection is small by some museum standards, it is choice, with signature pieces by the greats. It's photography collection is second to none, and there is always part of it on display. It's research building always has an interesting small exhibit of some sort - this time it was graphics in published media about World War I. But the star of the show is the building itself, an architectural and landscaped wonder - each block of stone cut and numbered before being shipped from the Mediterranean, and pieced together to perfection. The Turner show that just ended was glorious. Thought free for admission, the parking is pricey, so consider taking a bus. Seniors ride the LA Metro for $0.35.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940mitchp
40,Beautiful,"well thought, beautiful construction, variety of places to visit, nice spaces and view of the city. Loved the gift shop also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465luzf
50,Awesome and Amazing - views and works of art,"Visited today on recommendation from a friend .. Not being what I'd call an avid art lover, I was a little aprensive. I can't find enough words to express the amazing experience. So many volunteers, all so helpful and willing to spend the time to answer any questions - that was everyone from tram personnel, security, shop staff, restaurant & coffee cart staff & generally anyone associated with the centre. The Turner exhibition was awesome and to have the audio along with the self guided information was great - and apart from food/drinks it was all free. The gardens are just beautiful and immaculately kept. To quote from the Orientation Theatre opening .. .. ""It's not what you look at that matters - it's what you see"" .. A highly recommended ""must"" when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gelli2005
50,"Even if you don't like art, this is great architecture, beautiful gardens and one of the best views of L.A.","This is an amazing place, even if just to wander around and look at the view. It's free, although you have to pay to park. If it's a clear day, it's one of the best views of L.A. there is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimWhiteLA
50,A Must See!,"There is so much to see at this amazing place that here are a few hints:Take advantage of the free tours. e.g. The Architecture Tour, The Collection Highlights Tour, The Garden Tour, etc. You get an excellent overview and can go back on your own and explore in more detail. Food in the restaurants can be a bit pricey, so consider bringing along snacks, fruit, etc. Beverages and food are available for purchase. Do not forget your camera for outdoor pictures. On a clear day, albeit rare in Los Angeles, the views are absolutely amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2TravelersMn

50,Inspiring day For Everyone!,The Getty Center is centrally located in the Greater LA Area and is a wonderful outing for all ages. Young children will appreciate the Family Room and Discover the Gallery card game that is conveniently located in the entrance pavilion. Be surety check out the daily schedule for wonderful guided tours conveniently scheduled throughout the day. Do NOT miss the welcome movie that is also located in the entrance pavilion. It has a wonderful overview of the history of the Getty Center as well as all it's hidden treasures. If you like architecture than the Architecture tour is NOT to be missed. Are you a gardener? Then be sure to take the Garden Tour- the docents are incredibly knowledgeable and really take their time explaining everything there is to know about the Getty Center. Don't forget to make a reservation for the wonderful restaurant. The view is incredible AND... here's a little tip... IF you arrive and the wait for the train ride is painfully long be sure to speak with the guide at the entrance to the train- they will allow you to skip the entire line IF you have a lunch/dinner reservation... This is a wonderful time saver!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleym
50,First World Class State of the Art Museum. A must see!,"As a J.Paul Getty Center Museum Volunteer for seven years I am qualified to rate and recommend this outstanding, First Class Museum. The architecture, the Getty Gardens are stunning. The Museum is located in an area of Bel Air Los Angeles, high in the Santa Monica Mountains overlooking, in open court, the entire 405 Freeway to Los Angeles westside area, built with incredible sound and safety engineering, accessible by a Swiss electrical automated Tram. The entire museum was built with raw and polished Traventine Italian marble, where one can still appreciate the petrified fossils inside the grooves of the Traventine. The entire museum is laid out in five separate buildings, each with permanent and new Exhibitions, changing monthly. The Getty Gardens are a delight and an example of incredible, outstanding landscaping architecture, providing for accessible area to wlk through, including for the Disabled. The museum has two main Cafeterias, offering great delicious organic lunches and snacks, including wine beverages, plus also a fine 4 star Restaurant, accepting reservations for lunch and dinner. The Exhibits contain Classic Art pieces, as well as some XX Century Art and Impressionist Art. There are paintings (oils, pastels, inks, etc.),drawings, sketches, gouaches, sculptures, etc., all magnificently displayed, all under maximum security. The museum offers audio guides in more than five simultaneous translations in more than five languages, also interactive computerized guidance, tour, and assistance as one walks through each Room Exhibit. There is also a Children Creative Art Room and appropriate review and exploration. Underground garage parking available, plus Public Transportation, up right up to the gate of the Museum. Highly recommended and a must see destination while planning a visit to Los Angeles, California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278isaacd
40,PRICE TO PAY FOR GORGEOUS GETTY,"I went at 11 am on a Tuesday when school was in session. There were so many people that it took me 25 minutes to park; 20 minutes to wait in a crowded line for a tram. Once there, yelling school children were everywhere. It was impossible to experience the tranquility and beauty of the Getty. I was completely stressed the whole time. And two children under the age of three were allowed into the Turner exhibit and they were running and screaming. Nightmare",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
50,Lots to see and experience!,"When your trek begins with a tram ride up the hill to get to the site, its peaks interest in the place! The gardens are beautiful and well maintained, the sculpture garden is an interesting stop to try to figure out what exactly the artist was trying to depict but the maze garden is a must see. Looking down from above you can figure out a path. Parking is expensive at $15 but the museum itself is free for the most part. The inside offers many levels of different forms of artwork so plan on comfortable shoes and a few hours of walking, its worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdnasca
50,Family Reunion day trip,"This is a great place to go, beautiful gardens, a wonderful view of the ocean and a view of the city.

However, if you are tight in time, visit their website for the highlighted sections that are a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManyPlacesToGo
50,Visit LA's Acropolis,"The Getty Center is Los Angeles' very own Acropolis. While the collections themselves are okay, it's the Richard Meier architecture that is the show-stopper. Go on a sunny, clear(ish) day. Hang out in the gardens and the courtyards.With respect the collections themselves, the photography exhibits are usually superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmO1218UW
50,Culture and Sightseeing in one.,"Since I live in Brentwood where the museum is located I have been on numerous occasions. The gardens have matured since it first opened and there are always new exhibits to see. If you can go the day after it rains in Los Angeles (yes, it does rain here) the view is very clear all the way to the Long Beach harbor. The food in the restaurant is very good as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trojan90
50,The art and gardens,"I am a local to Los Angeles and have watched this museum built from day one to completion. It is one of the best museums in Los Angeles with amazing art, Greek and Roman artifacts, sculptures, photographs, and so much more. The views are spectacular from the gardens - from the pacific ocean to downtown Los Angeles. Parking is $15.00 and $10.00 after 5:00 pm. From the indoor parking lot - enjoy a tram ride up the mountain to the Center. The food is also good - not excellent - and somewhat expensive. They have a cafe and a sit down restaurant. It's just as fun to bring a picnic and enjoy a great lunch on the expansive lawns. However, we have been to the restaurant at night and enjoyed a 1st class meal. This is different then the Getty Villa - which is on Pacific Coast Highway and requires a reservation. The Getty Center does not require a reservation. It is always on our ""to do"" list when visitors from out of town come to visit. If art is not your thing - it's worth it for the views.... Be sure to go on a clear day. Enjoy and make this a must see if your visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buckrodger
40,A spectacular piece of architecture in an equally spectacular location,"Drier than it was originally (thanks to the California drought), it is still an impressive attraction. Turning off the flowing waters has muted the impact and beauty of the gardens and the fountains, but the Getty should still be on a visitor's (or even a local's!) must-see list. The museum's permanent collection may not be to everyone's taste, but there is almost always a temporary exhibit (or two) of great value. And frankly, the art is almost upstaged by its surroundings.There are a few drawbacks, though, to note. There can be a long wait for the train ride to take you to the museum (or you can take a 15-minute walk), and galleries can get quite crowded. Disappointingly, there are few - if any - gallery guides to inform about specific exhibits (short of buying a book in the store). And, while there is no entrance fee, there is a healthy charge to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Envy780

50,The Getty Center review,"Living in Southern California, we don't have the luxury to visit museum quality such as those in the DC area. However, each time my family visit the Getty Center I truly appreciate the collection and quality of the items at the museum. The museum is free. Just have to reserve parking for minimal cost and having a great day at the museum. Can't say enough how nice the time I went there (twice w/in 2014).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linhtt2016

50,"Los Angeles gazes at itself in a mirror, and finds no flaws","A superb site, inspired architecture and landscaping, and excellent amenities (such as comfortable dining opportunities and a dazzling monorail ride from the parking garage to the museum steps) make for a besotting experience, if a vaguely sterile one. If you are an out-of-town visitor you won't have a choice, but if you live within driving distance, I recommend waiting for an exhibition that you have a particular interest in viewing, to make it a more personal and engaging visit. The Getty can numb and overwhelm you with its imposed serenity and relentless perfection, and leave you wondering if the whole experience was a dream once you're back home, it can be so other-worldly.Free of charge, except for parking. If you're staying nearby, consider ride-sharing services or have friends or family drop you off for your ""appointment"" to avoid the $15 parking fee. Half a day should suffice, but be sure to spend time walking the grounds, which you may cherish more than the art indoors, as nature can never be tamed as much as the artificial spaces inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabyBayard

50,The MET West,If you have visited the Metroplitan Museum of Art in New York then you will find this venue just as appealing. The views alone are worth the price of admission. The collections are beautiful be sure to visit the Italian collection...opulent works abound there. The serenity along with a great place to have lunch and getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city below are wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawk0258

50,One of the top sites on the top site in all of LA,While not a truly comprehensive museum it is a gem of a place. It is like visiting a castle or chateau at the top of a mountain to see a persons private collection of art. There are many wonderful pieces in the collection of all media. Add to this some of the best temporary exhibits in California and staggering views of the whole city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snuffpele123
50,20 Watts Youth Loved The Getty,"Sure, my visit was a little unusual, in and of itself, but other than turning a few heads all my students were totally in awe. There were an overwhelming amount of exhibits and things but my students, all disadvantaged youth from Watts and Venice, California, particularly enjoyed the labyrinth garden. You would think it would be unusual to see a group of teen 'gangstas' at the Getty but we actually ran into another group and sure, there was a little posturing and attitude but it quickly evaporated in the calm atmosphere of the Getty. The two groups actually started hanging out together to look at all the cool ""bling"". The snack bar was good and the museum store is the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bSirius
50,"A World-Class Art Museum, Awesome Architecture, and Fabulous Gardens!","I only have nice things to say about the Getty Center, as it is one of the best art museums in our country, if not the world.First, the architecture: The buildings are beautiful, modern and fit perfectly into the surrounding landscape. The interiors are perfectly lit to preserve and enhance the artwork (mainly using natural light and an impressive selection of solar shades). The various walkways and fountains just add to the experience. (Note: In 2015, the fountains are off due to the drought).Secondly, the gardens: There was some controversy when the Getty chose an artist, not a landscape designer, to design the gardens. But he and his team did a fabulous job. The native California plants are beautiful and abundant, and are arranged in really interesting ways amongst the various rocks and pathways that lead down into the spiral maze at the bottom. A must-see!And finally, the art! There is truly something for everyone here - a world-class assortment of pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and 19th- and 20th-century American and European photographs. My favorite area is the gallery filled with French furnishings and recreated rooms - so interesting! And as a photographer, I am consistently impressed with their photography exhibits.The Getty is perfect for anybody of any age - all the way from families with young children (even our babies enjoyed going there!), to senior citizens. The bathrooms are clean, and if you need a snack, the food is excellent if a little pricey.Considering that this museum is FREE (you only pay $15 for parking), I can't think of a better thing to do in expensive Los Angeles than to spend a day here. And if you get a chance, check out the other Getty Museum in Malibu. It's equally impressive, in a different way!One hint - on a cool day, bring a sweater or jacket - the wind kicks up between the buildings, and you will be spending a lot of your time outside. Also, a sun hat - the sun can really beat down on you here. Have a great time, if you go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fooemery
50,Getty Center,Great place to take visitors to LA. Great views and art. No fee to visit but there is a $15 parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347steves
50,The grounds and views are worth the trip,"Although LACMA has probably better and more varied art, the grounds are magnificent. The architecture outstanding and the 360 degree views some of the best in Los Angeles.The food is pedestrian, but healthy.Parking is usually not a problem, but we have been turned away a couple of times when the multi storied underground garage was filled. If possible the city bus stops right at the museum entrance on Sepulveda. There is no entrance fee but it is $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leor864
40,One of the jewels of Los Angeles,"There are a handful of places in Los Angeles that make it unique and special and The Getty Center is one of them. In addition to being architecturally beautiful and housing estimable art collections, it has gorgeous views out over the city and the west side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683stevenb
50,Beautiful Architecture and Sculpture Garden,"We did a quick visit to the Getty center to just enjoy the architecture and sculpture gardens. Although you can turn the visit into a full day and also view the art within the galleries. With the free price, you can make this a quick visit if we are trying to fit this in with other attractions. The Getty Center is absolutely beautiful just to walk around and soak in the architecture, the gardens and the view. Highly recommend visiting this as part of a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PKS_Bos2n

50,A lush experience,The lush grounds and views are plenty of a reason to visit. The ever expanding exhibits just added to this special point of interest in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZZMimi
50,On top of the world,"Wonderful rotating exhibits with such solid hits that I still haven't seen all the permanent deep and broad collection even once. The recent Turner exhibit was comprehensive and each object was well explained for context and substance. Photography exhibits in particular rotate often and are varied from near scientific realism to abstract light painting. The setting on top of a hill overlooking West LA, the ocean and Bel Air is spectacular. The architecture makes the plaza and garden spaces grand and the buildings and grounds are well maintained. Parking is costly at $15 but admission is free. There is a shuttle from a cheaper lot somewhere. The light rail up from the parking structure in the canyon to the museum on the hill is fun and builds the anticipation. We usually plan our visit around lunch at the fancy restaurant. There are less expensive food options as well. Finally, there are live offerings including lectures, performances, and demonstrations. Get on their email list. Please don't confuse this with the fabulous Getty Villa in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acj76
40,Love the gardens,"They do have some very interesting art and exhibits, though I have to admit that's not the main draw for me. I go for the gardens, which are beautiful and inspiring. The view is incredible and it's always nice just to stop and sit a while on the lawn or at one of the many seating areas to just enjoy the surroundings. Their cafeteria is pretty impressive too, with meals that you wouldn't expect to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294jons
50,"The Landscape, Exterior and Views are Just as Impressive as the Artwork","The Getty was on my to do list from the moment I booked my trip to L.A. I had heard much about it, and it is so worthwhile to visit. But best if you go on a nice day, because you will want to spend as much time outside walking the grounds, relaxing and taking in the gardens and the views as you will inside gazing at the works of art. Bring your camera (you are allowed to take pictures of many of the artworks, but not all), and perhaps also a picnic lunch and a blanket to sit on the lawn. Or, if you prefer, purchase snacks or sandwiches on site and sit at any of the numerous tables and sitting areas around the property. The cost at the food kiosks is not outrageous and there is a decent variety. There is also a sit-down cafe and full service restaurant (more on the restaurant below).We went on a Saturday afternoon, when it is probably most crowded. We did have to wait 20-30 minutes for the tram to take us up the hill from the parking lot, but once we are on the grounds, we really did not feel the presence of a large crowd (there were exceptions, for instance the travelling exhibit on display was a top attraction).Much to my great and pleasant surprise, after paying just $15 for underground garage parking, there are no other admission charges! Outstanding. The price of the food at the various vendors is not outrageous for such a beautiful attraction, but if you really want to save, then bring your own.Our only disappointment was our meal at the fancy restaurant - you are paying for the view and the location, but certainly not for the food or service. We made advance reservations several days earlier for a window seat. When we arrived, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant, not far from the windows, but not where we had reserved. They had some excuse about not guaranteeing the spot, but they were holding other window tables for patrons who had also reserved them but who had not yet arrived. Go figure. We also paid a fortune for small portions of over cooked and dry food served by a snooty waiter who kept disappearing. Skip it, and find a nice place to eat off site.All said, the dinner did not impact our impression of the place and we would certainly visit again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Remdawg30
50,Must-see in Los Angeles,"Beyond the interesting exhibits, the Getty Center is a work of art in itself, matched by its breathtaking location and city views. Absolutely worth the time. Just avoid rush hour -- the traffic on the 405 can be daunting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrJerryLosAngeles_CA
50,"Impressively architected, excellent art collection, great view of Los Angeles",Liked the impressionists exhibition the most.This is an island of beauty and serenity in an ocean of high traffic and chaos (L.A.)Great views of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sananes
50,Multi-million dollar views for $15,"The Getty Center is one of the most amazing places in Los Angeles. If you've never been there, then put this on your to do list for visiting the region. Towering high above the city, there are 360 degree views of Los Angeles including, the Pacific Ocean, West Los Angeles, the hillside and downtown. There's also a beautiful garden with a serene waterfall and a few strategically placed benches to sit down and enjoy the peacefulness of the setting.If you get hungry, there a few carts with wine, snacks, beer and other drinks. There's also a restaurant and a moderately priced cafe. Our lunch at the Cafe for three people was $37.50. The food we had was filling and tasted good. Even though, we had to wait a few minutes to get into the cafe, the line moved quickly once we got inside. I also saw someone with a picnic basket, so it seems as if you are permitted to bring your own food for a picnic. There are several tables and chairs outside if you choose this option.There's ample parking and the cost at this time is $15. That might seem like a lot depending on where you live, but considering the fact that you get to see priceless works of art and a multi-million dollar view, the cost is worth it. The admission to the museum is free.We spend several hours at the Getty on a Sunday, initially with the intent of allowing my daughter to fulfill a photography assignment, but it turned out to be a wonderful family outing and we intend on going back soon and visiting the Getty Villa. I highly recommend this attraction for families, couples, friends, and a place for quiet solitary meditation in off peak hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debras223
50,"Not my thing, but it is extremely well organized","I have to say, I wasn't as enthusiastic with the current exhibition, but that was just a question of compatibility with the collection. The infrastructure, the efficiency and organization is just amazing. It's a must see and it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GManners
40,Good Collection,"The Getty centre has a very large collection of paintings and artifacts and is definitely worth a visit. As you enter (entry is free), there is a electric tram takes you, up an incline, to the main entrance. The place is divided into several wings - each sporting a certain speciality. There are various tours starting at designated hours and you can join these tours easily. There is no need to pre-book.

You catch a Tram to the Museum from the Parking Structure. There are several buildings hosting different exhibits. There is a restaurant on the premise with healthy choices & cart vendors with snacks. The view is amazing from The Getty. There are tours for all the major exhibits and an hourly tour of the garden. The central garden is why many come to The Getty Center. It can be very busy on the mornings & bring whatever you need as it is an all day event. It is a must see in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651CathyA

Honestly, even if the art doesn't suit you (or you have children with you who are not interested in the art) this venue is an exciting place to visit no matter what.

The tours are more a gathering that anything organised, so it's also kosher to just slide up to one mid-tour. Otherwise you can always do the self guided tour with the ipod touches there.We took the bus up but otherwise be mindful that parking is $15/vehicle (which covers you for both the Centre and the Museum).

40,"breathtaking views of LA, 'free' to visit, very nice building","I am unsure if you can take public transport here, (or anywhere in LA really), so i guess the only fee is the parking which was moderately expensive. However entry to grounds, and building is free so overall it is a very cheap place to visit.The views are great and the building and grounds amazing. We primarily went to see the view so didn't look at much of the art on display.My only note of caution is that it can be difficult to navigate around with limited signage and multiple levels getting somewhat confusing. If you want an entire day to explore the wonderful building and its art this would be great, as you stumble through discovering each room, if you are in a rush it would be very frustrating as you follow one balcony to another staircase and can't see how to get to the next vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772StephenW
50,Not to be missed in LA,Wonderful setting atop a hill overlooking all of LA. The Getty features fantastic architecture (Richard Meier) and a world class collection of art.

First of all, Admission is free, you only pay for parking. After you are done with the Center, go to the information center and ask for the Villa passes. Then, take your parking stub and go to the parking center at the Getty Center and get a free parking pass to the villa. The Villa is not too far from the center and you can drive along the Malibu Beach. It's really wonderful. The Herb Garden is hard to find but don't forget to look for it.

50,"Great art, peaceful gardens, L.A. basin view on a clear day","Going to see great art is always therapeudic and I wanted to see the J.M.W. Turner exhibit so I took the bus up to The Getty Center. I can always count on a European calligraphy exhibit there and I really enjoy seeing the combination of script and art done by hand in the first pavillion I come to. The Turner exhibit was in a separate pavillion from their other exhibits and featured many unfinished works and some very interesting insights into Turner's working methods and about his studio.The usual U.S. and European paintings from various eras were there including Rembrandts and Dutch Masters, as well as one of my favorites in the collection, ""Jeanne Kéfer"" by Belgium painter Fernand Khnopff of a friend's young daughter: it shows her against a door and that, from a child's perspective the adult-size world is a big place. I find that the paintings, scuptures, furniture, photos, and even decorative art are a glimpse into another time and each help to tell a story of its subject.The view from outside the pavillions were breath-taking on what turned out to be a clear day and one could see all over the L.A. basin from the mountains to the oceans and beaches, and there are some wonderfully landscaped gardens to explore. Parking is steep at $15, or $10 after 5:00 p.m. but admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaufu

It is all of them and the architecture is amazing... You can have the best view of LA. It all very neat and well organized that you do not want to leave. Moreover it is free (even the special exhibitions with limited period of time). As far as I know the owner is one of the most rich people on earth and this like his show room.

50,Beautiful Spot,"The Getty Center was a wonderful destination that I was happy to have gotten to on my first trip to LA. I should have given myself more time there! The art was great, but the views were breathtaking. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town - with only a $15 parking fee, its one of the best values I came across.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerMama2010
50,"Amazing art, architecture, and garden","We went to the Getty this weekend to see the JMW Turner exhibit before it leaves. I loved seeing this ... and of course, once at the Getty, I wanted to enjoy seeing everything else, too.I highly recommend spending at least a whole day here, both inside and out in the garden.The large garden is a living sculpture. Be sure to notice the sound of the water in the stream as it changes from the top of the garden, where large boulders are in the water, going downhill as the rocks in the water get smaller and smaller. The garden changes at different times of the year. It is always fascinating. In May, what a riot of flowers blooming!If you have children, they will love rolling downhill on the wide expanses of lawn, by the garden. I don't have children, but if I did, I would certainly allow time for lawn rolling. :-) There is also a family room with special children's activities. Plus, for artists, a sketching room.I am so glad we took the architecture tour. The beautiful white rocks that the buildings are made of all have their own stories, as does the unusual and interesting design.The art - where to start? What a lovely collection, not only of paintings, but also of decorative arts of the ages.The Getty opens at 10 a.m., and has long summer hours (closed Mondays). Visiting the museum is free; parking costs $15 per vehicle, and then you go up the hill in a clean tram that runs every few minutes.A restaurant is here, and a terrace cafeteria with an amazing view. There are also some carts for coffee and snacks. Food here is pricey; if you're on a budget, you might want to bring a picnic.What a lovely cultural day, well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTrails12345
30,"Nice place, but very unfriendly staff","The garden in beautiful. The cafe is good enough. But the staff not so friendly, especially in Turner Exhibition. I had a travel size stroller with a sleepy baby in it, and they told me to be careful not to hit paintings. What does that even mean?! I would have given 5 star otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nabel2013
50,Great value - well worth the trip,"Visited here on our way to Santa Monica. $20 dollars to park the car with free entrance. well worth it. The Turner exhibition was on during our visit which was well worth seeing. Overall a great museum, good value and very well organised. Outdoor spaces are lovely - well landscaped gardens with good views of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyK268
50,Make Time to Visit the Getty,"We spent a delightful afternoon at the Getty, high atop a hill in LA. Admission to the Center is free and is a treasure. Parking ($15 was fair and cheap by LA standards). A tram took us to the Center and we found ourselves in a lovely garden upon arrival. The art was moving (stand in the presence of Van Gogh's IRISES or a Monet and try NOT to be exceptionally moved)...the layout was easy to navigate and there was something for everyone. Since it was free, we didn't feel pressured to go see everything at once. We took our time in three of the 7 or 8 buildings that comprise the center and look forward to another visit to finish when our feet aren't so tired. The outside architecture is as much a work of art as the inside masters. The place is exceptionally clean and well taken care of. Thank you to generous Mr. J.P. Getty and his sharing of all thing beautiful (and historic). The ride to and from the Getty on the provided (free) tram was as much a part of the experience as our visit to the buildings. The tram was clean and ran every few minutes. We had a snack (a little pricey) in the onsite cafeteria, but considering our day cost less than $5 per person, we didn't mind ""splurging"" on designer coffees and treats. I could have lingered longer and look forward to returning again some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy10of10
50,Worth the visit,"The Getty Center is a friendly and easy going museum (if this phrase is applicable to a museum in English). I liked very much the European paintings, I saw some of my favorite painters pieces, like from Goya, Lautrec, Van Gogh... Even the restaurant is a nice spot, to loose less time and take advantage of all the complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viajerotj
50,A Treat for All Who Visit,"So often, a 5 star rating on a destination leaves me wondering if the place is as awesome as so many say. After all, most activities usually have a 'terrible' rating or 'poor.' In this case, the people who gave The Getty Center a terrible or poor rating must be crazy.If I could offer any advice to you, it's to ignore the claim that this place can be done in 2-3 hours. Let me dispel that right now. You will need the whole day to soak in every aspect of the Getty Center. My family and I only had about 2 hours because we followed the advice of someone in this community and it's absolutely wrong. We barely scratched the surface.My family and I plan to return to the Getty Center very soon and spend the day exploring each room and enjoying the endless views of LA and the Pacific Ocean. We will eat at the cafe and also make the short trek to the Getty mansion.I cannot recommend The Getty Museum high enough. It's a destination not to be missed when traveling to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fashionating
50,Go Here.,"Go here. Art, location, view, garden. It’s all fabulous. Arrived at the parking lot at 9:15am and the first tram headed up at 9:30; we could walk around the grounds before the museum opened at 10:00. Because of an appointment, we could only spend a couple of hours here, but could easily have spent all day and then some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boodleheimer
40,Very good collection of paintings,"While the Getty Center is probably best known for their paintings from the middle ages, I was surprised to see how many very nice impressionist paintings they had. Among others, I liked Monet's Still Life with Flowers and Fruit very much. The museum is free, but parking is $15. They do have places to eat and drink after exhausting yourself trying to see everything. It definitely takes more than one day to see everything at the center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidfromLaPalma
50,A treat for all ages...,The Getty Museum is an art lover's corner. Plenty of parking and going up the monorail was exciting because the excitement builds as you get closer to the center. I truly enjoyed the surrounding views of the LA area. So many to see and to discover. Plenty of place to just sit and enjoy the beautiful SOCAL weather. The restaurant had a variety of choices and was priced affordable. A camera is a must for this trip.. Parking fee...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/layastayo15
50,Not to miss especially on a clear day!,"It may be out of the way and not on Museum Row on Wilshire, but you can't ask for a better way to spend an afternoon. The Getty on the Hill is a spectacular place for visitors and locals, too. The tram ride to the top of the hill is fun. The galleries are filled with wonderful art and the setting is spectacular. During the summer they have music and happy hour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaFoodTravelGuru
50,School Term Break Holiday in the States,"Although this was about 26 km away from the hotel, it was really worth the travel. The paintings and sculptures are awesome to behold and yet it has free admission. You can avail of an ipod that describe the image in front of you by punching in the code next to it. There are so much to see that a day here is not enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandol182
50,EXCELLENT,"Since there is a water shortage, some of the outdoor displays do not have the water running. There is no place like the Getty! A must do for any LA trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nycbkmom
50,Visit to Getty Villa,"On April 29 my neice and I visited the Getty Villa. It was an awesome experience. The villa is a re-creation of a first century country house, the Villa dei Papiri. I had no idea how large it was and to what extent the design and number of antiquities represented Roman and Greek history. The guide for the 4 gardens had a sense of humor when giving information about the numerous trees, herbs and plants. The history about many of the items on display reminded me of so many films about Roman times and Greek mythology. For example, the steps outside the villa reminded me of the Coliseum in Rome. J. Paul Getty invested considerable money and time on creating this villa and he didn't get to live in it. You can take your time strolling thru the villa and gardens and just imagining what it would be like to have lived during that era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/one4theroad26
50,It's worth it for the architecture alone,"I happened to be here for the Turner exhibit, but the real excitement is in the Getty's own collections. Those beautiful Irises are always stunning.The building itself is quite beautiful and the restaurant is lovely, with great food. The views and the gardens are just delightfu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noosadoer
50,Wonderful,Architecture was amazing. The guide lady we had was very interesting. All the exhibit were so beautiful. Loved everything about it. That was the hi light of the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NathalieM624
50,AMAZING,"It has 7 floor parking garage underground, with a tram that goes up to the center the parking was 15.00. Beautiful outdoor gardens a lot of walking around the garden it was so pleasant. Must do lunch they had everything you would want cafeteria style but the food was like eating at a 3 star restaurant. All the museums are free they have several buildings with art, furnishings and pottery starting at 1600 which is amazing how real and perfect the oil paintings were. None of the buildings are marked outside so that makes it more walking to find things. It is so large you could spend all day at the center. The center sits on top of a mountain you can see all LA wonderful for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
50,One of the Nation's Finest Museums,"The Getty Center in Los Angeles is a world-class institution high on a hill with breathtaking views stretching from the downtown skyline to the Pacific Ocean. The architecture and gardens are works of art all by themselves, and no visit to the museum is complete without a walk down to the end of the garden, where you can gaze back at the whole complex in all its glory.All this incredible art and beauty comes at no cost to you. That's right: NO COST. Admission to the Getty Center is FREE. There is a$15 parking fee, but that's it. $15 for as many people as can fit in your car. This combined with the outstanding collection makes the Getty the greatest value in all of Los Angeles, California, and most probably, the nation. Only the Smithsonians offer so much for so little.If you're only here for a short amount of time, head straight to West 204. This room is home to Van Gogh's ""Irises"" as well as a few Monet Haystacks and some other amazing Impressionist work. There was a visiting Picasso on display during my visit as well.The rotating exhibits are always fantastic, be sure to seek them out.Overall: When in LA, this is the place to go. Do not miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171dantem
40,museum with a little of everything plus great views of LA,"Visited here mid-week. Cost is only $15 to park, no other entry/ticket charge. Museum has very beautiful grounds and buildings, and the views of LA area are outstanding. There is a large parking garage, then an automated tram takes you up the mountainside to the museum. Very nice museum store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonT540
50,By far one of the top museums of the American West,"The collection is staggeringly thorough through the 19th century, with notable, major strengths in the early to late Renaissance (!) and Impressionists. The view over LA is awesome. The noble free admission, a rarity in a California which increasingly has few affordable or free cultural options, serves as challenge to other family collections throughout the USA. The Getty family were and, to this day, are better than the rest for the way they structured their foundation. Parking is 10 bucks but if you don't like it, take public transit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BebopCowboyForever

50,One of the Top Two Museums in our Country,"We are so fortunate to have this magnificent world class art museum in the Los Angeles area. I only wish it was in Costa Mesa, Orange County. It is still worth the 50 mile drive one way.It has many top Impressionist art, Dutch and Spanish paintings, a photography,and furniture exhibitions. It has great Special Exhibitions. Currently till May 24th is the Turner exhibit from the Tate musuem. And much more. It has a cafe, coffee stand and a fine restaurant, as well as wonderful views of Los Angeles.

40,"Family visit, almost excellent","Family visit with tween and teen, AM Friday. Oh my the school groups. Recommend an afternoon visit - though the Getty is large enough to accommodate many. Excellent layout, great variety of art and artists with an emphasis on 1500 to 1800 painters, furniture and decorative art. There is a nod to modern with the photography exhibit. Visit the gardens - especially the floating gardens and surrounding grounds, which could be much bigger. Excellent cafe (busy!) with great variety. Underwhelming museum store emphasizing hardcover books and kid's trinkets, and the tram ride - with long wait and lines (try the walk up the hill), detracted from an otherwise stellar museum and family visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CollectingRocks
50,Class that only Oil can buy,"To start off, its FREE.Parking is underground and costs only about $15............ and safe, and no choice.Large selection of Medieval, Classic European Art.......... some very good selections of Impressionist.Well worth visit, excellent views of the whole bay area, Beverly Hills, mesmerizing.Gardens are like a kings palace, well cactus variety. Very relaxing to view.My bro/law said he would have gone just for the architecture, and he was right, the buildings are ART, and you just go to the side to look at them.There is a LOT of walking so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeekADeal

50,Amazing Art Collection & Gardens,"This was a quick decision of a place to visit in the LA area and the Getty Center did not disappoint. The weekend that I went, they had a collection of Greek art and I happen to be a big fan of Greek mythology. I was impressed by the collection as well as the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlanta2ny
50,A most delightful place. A wonder.,"I travel to Los Angles often and somehow had pushed a visit to the Getty Center to way back in my priorities. What a foolish error on my part!!A gorgeous place, gorgeous buildings, gorgeous architecture, gorgeous collection and helpful staff. Even the guards were knowledgeable about the depth of the collection.The date of the visit was December 2013.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547ephraimd
50,A beautiful place to visit if you love architecture and art,I went with my boyfriend and he had been there before. It is an amazing place because of the beautiful architecture. The garden (that was designed by someone else) is very nice to walk through and I really liked browsing through the galleries. Some nice collections of all sorts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571CherylS
50,A WONDERFUL PLACE,This is a legitimate art museum with plentiful works of the masters. It's location on top of a mountain with its panoramic views of L.A. is mesmerizing. There is plenty to do here for everyone. It's easy to get too and is some quiet in the otherwise crazy place we call L.A. You will ne so glad you made the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonphil
30,It's alright,"The actual ghetty is free but they charge you a pretty price for parking. Also, they don't allow camera tripods in the facility so you can't take photos of your party without one person always missing. Overall lots of great art pieces, but I probably won't visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347summerw
50,WOW,"Outstanding and wonderful place to visit and spend a day looking at great art etc. The garden and grounds are gorgeous and a great place to walk around and see the fauna and outside exhibits. A great tram ride to the museum which sits atop of a hill with gorgeous views of the city. A must see place to visit when in Los Angeles, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lou4247
50,A Day at the Getty,The Getty Center is by far one of the best museum experiences one can have in Los Angeles. The Getty Center is nestled in the hills of Brentwood just off the 405 Freeway and Sunset Blvd. It is an up-scale venue so one must budget accordingly. I've had lunch in each of the eateries and enjoyed sumptuous meals every time. I also had a great experience viewing the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PastorVJ
50,Fantastic!,I was in LA for a conference and booked a couple days after to explore the area. The Getty Center is a must see. So much talent and the architecture of the building itself its quite extraordinary! Go see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeyTrish
50,One of the few proof's LA really does have CULTURE,"The Getty Center is a wonderful facility and museum and located anywhere else would deservedly have world attention. In Los Angeles, often seen as a cultural wasteland in the art and literary sets this is unbelievable gem!Diverse types of art and artists are showcased with exhibits changing frequently, making this a great venue for repeat visits. While not geared for little ones, kids from 8 up will find plenty to captivate their interests and the garden spaces throughout are themselves art.Easy to get to with great parking. Walking is needed and can be fairly extensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tweston
50,Fantastic Way to Spend a Sunny Day,"The Getty is a great one-day getaway. You can make it a half day, but out of town visitors may want to plan a full day to visit all of the exhibits and halls. Parking used to be free, but now they charge for it. Admission is still free for everyone. The cafeteria has some good food, too.Don't miss the rose garden, especially on a nice, sunny day. Take a stroll through the garden, around the fountain, and then take a break on the grassy hillside above. There is lots to see, and the exhibitions are always worth a trip. For those who want to see both the Getty Center and Getty Villa (in Malibu) on the same day, do a bit of planning and you can make it happen. Your parking fee covers both sites if you visit the same day; you just have to get it stamped at the information desk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800MartinG
40,"Great museum building, pretty good contents","Amazingly beautiful location, buildings, and view. Nice place to dine, too.Actual museum content is pretty good, but no Louvre. Yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetDesigner
50,A Retreat in the Clouds,"I have driven past the exit for the Getty Center many times and finally made the time to visit. We parked the car in the garage and proceded to a color-coded elevator (remember the color to find you car later.) Next step, pay for your parking ($15-which allows you to also visit the Getty Villa at no extra charge.) The museum itself is free, as is the VIlla and it is well worth the time!. We took a pristine monorail up to the top where friendly guides direct you to galleries, restaurants, family activities, free materials for sketching and special events. The view of LA and its desert landscape is spectacular! A heavenly place! We saw the Turner Exhibit which was outstanding. They even provide umbrellas to protect against sun or rain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230kathleenr
50,An absolute must see -,"As a 35 year CA resident, I can't believe I've never visited the Getty before. So told my family we were going ""daytripping"" in SoCal and we took the 2 hour drive from San Diego to the Getty. Yes LA traffic can be daunting but we left around 7:30 on a Saturday morning and had little to no delay, arriving about 9:30 - the museum doesn't even open until 10:00.We pulled in to the garage and waited about 15 minutes for the trams to begin the trip up the hill to the museum. We enjoyed wandering about the sculpture garden adjacent to the tram base and kept busy as we waited for the day to start. I went with my family and instead of waiting I decided to attempt the walk up to the museum. It was a very easy leisurely walk that took less that 15 minutes. The morning walk was completely shaded and I enjoyed it while my wife and son rode the tram. With some of the talk on the forum about the crowded trams I see no reason why any reasonably fit person couldn't make the walk - particularly down hill on the departure.The grounds and the galleries are absolutely stunning in all their modern splendor. The guide maps are crystal clear and I'd encourage everyone to get the headphones and walking tours for the most information on the art on display. The primarily galleries are very well designed, multiple building adjoining, and it was very easy for us to walk from one period to the next. All the docents/guards were amiable and welcoming. The art on display was from the 1500's to today and the impressionist gallery was surely our personal favorite.Following our gallery visits we spent another hour touring the gardens and sculpture exhibits. Every turn presented something new and awe inspiring. We spent but 4 hours touring, but surely could have spent an entire day as we passed on the two ""rotating"" exhibits (one was ""Pictures of War from WW1 - not our cup of tea). Our early arrival allowed us some peace and quiet but as the day wore on the crowds grew, including large groups of high school aged children. Not a huge negative to us, and great to see them taking in some culture, but they are a bit noisier than a discerning museum crowd.No fee for the museum although their is a $15 parking garage fee that cannot be avoided.Overall a great visit and one we will repeat in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkP165
50,Fabulous art with a fabulous LA view,"I loved the helpful people who assisted us in making a relatively short visit extremely productive. My favorite was the top floor of the west gallery, loaded with great European paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JS859
50,A Wonderful Museum Experience,"The Getty Center was an exceptional experience during a recent trip to Los Angeles. We were impressed by the overall cleanliness of the area and the design and layout of the physical plant.On a majestic mountain top the slightly off-white enameled tiles and travertine marble created a wonderful and the layout which moved visitors inside, outside, up and down to see the various collections and exhibits.While wonderful to just explore we learned a great deal by taking the Architectural Tour and can now appreciate that experience even more.The variety of artistic modes and periods is quite wide and the quality and number of pieces is awe inspiring.If you are going set aside a good period of time, this is like a fine wine that needs to be savored. What a wonderful gift Mr. Getty has made available for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshubert
50,A Must See,This was our first visit to the Getty Center and it did not disappoint. There was a significant Turner exhibition on when we visited which was a bonus. The setting and architecture are stunning and the gardens beautiful. The exhibits are what you would expect from a prestigious museum and all the staff and volunteers were helpful and pleasant.It is a little difficult to get to without a car - we had to use a taxi both ways - but once you are there it is a great experience. And it is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blenheim72
50,The best place in LA,"Stunning location, stunning architecture, beautiful throughout. The photography exhibitions are always excellent. The main galleries are not my area of interest in terms of art, but I go for the location and photography alone, and am never disappointed. Even the basic food is nice quality, the docents are all informative and pleasant. A 'must visit' every time I am in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJTSmith
50,Wide variety of exhibits in a beautiful setting!,"I especially loved the stained glass! The WW2 exhibit was interesting, gave a new perspective. Nice view of downtown Los Angeles. I didn't see everything in just one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khu870
50,Must do when in LA.,"We visited the amazing complex that is the Getty Centre. The architecture, the exhibitions, the gardens, and the short tours offered all made for an excellent day out. We arrived with no expectations and easily spent five to six hours there.It would warrant a return visit in the early evening to watch the sunset and the lights of LA come on, we will return for that experience.A useful tip at the end of the day, skip the queue waiting for the train ride back to the parking, a fifteen minute walk downhill, wins hands down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fvm54
50,"spectacular views, impressive art collection","Liked monorail ride to center, plenty of outside seating to enjoy weather, well organized and helpful staff. beautiful gardens, spectacular views, incredible art collection.

50,Great art in an interesting buildings and gardens,"We went here in the afternoon after spending the morning at the Villa. The Villa has ancient Etruscan and Roman art and the center has some of everything, including modern American Art. Really great views of LA and ocean from both. The Center has some scary places for those of us who don't like heights, but the views! Pay once and go to both. We got our parking ticket added to at the Villa to continue to the Center. Just ask.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingartist_8
50,"With the Getty Villa, a wonderful contrast to Hearst Castle","Two ultra-rich magnates, Hearst and Getty, now deceased, have left their marks on California with attraction that are rated top in virtually all the guides. What a difference ! True, Getty had the benefit of learning from William Randolph Hearst's earlier attempt at creating a place where art from the Old World could be enjoyed (one also designed as a playground for Hollywood glitterati), but there is no question which magnate spent his fortune more wisely.The Getty Centre and its associated attraction, the Getty Villa (several miles apart) are simply stunning in their scale, scope and good taste. MUSTS for anyone visitng LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T3656CZpeterb
50,Most wonderful place in midst of chsos,"Museum is very good. But the chief attraction is the wonderful buildings, location and gardens.At the relatively low cost (for LA) of parking, you access to all of this.Driving underground down and down to park, then taking the monorail up to the top of the hill and emerging into such a pristine and wonderful place, you feel like you are in something like a Bond movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Icare1815
50,To see it all requires multiple visits,"Worth a visit every time you are in L.A. Every building has 2-3 floors and it is easy to get turned around in this place. They do provide a good map and there is stafff everywhere to help you find what you are looking for.Beautiful outdoor gardens as well. There is so much to see including art, furnishings and pottery. We saw the J.W. Turner exhibit which was beautiful. The museum does not charge a fee for entry, however parking is $15. The parking garage is enormous, I believe 7 underground floors. A tram takes you up the hill to the museum, or you can take a path and walk up the hill.You can use the parking pass for the day for both the Getty and the Getty Villa, but believe me unless you are just race walking through the exhibits you will never do both of them in a day. For that matter the Getty is impossible to do in a day and see it all.. Unless seeing it simply means walking by everything without stopping. The Villa can be done in a day, but it will require the full day..So give yourself some time to enjoy the Getty, do multiple trips. It certainly is worth the time. The view of LA from the outside patio's are amazing in themselves.Even if the parking lot is packed and you park on the 6/7th floor, the museum is so big you never feel you are around that many people, so don't worry about the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifero55
50,Beautiful art in a beautiful place,"When I saw the movie ""Mr. Turner"" I never thought that I'd see the real thing in a museum. Wasn't all this in England somewhere? But, on a trip to LA, my hosts suggested a day at The Getty to see Turner art! Yes! On Easter Sunday, high on a hill, with clear blue skies in sunny California I saw a great art show, and enjoyed a lovely afternoon at the Getty. Thank you Mr. Getty for bringing Mr. Turned to life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamilleNYCDiva
40,It really is a WOW museum but,we were a little disappointed not to see more rotation -- given the amount of art the place owns. We love the outdoor spaces!We were VERY surprised to be turned away at first because there was not enough parking. John Paul would be very upset!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887bruced
50,Can't get enough...,"Every time we're in LA, Getty is always on our to do list (and we're always in luck as we get to view exhibits with each visit). We happened upon the Turner exhibit this time and it was a wonderful set up; lots of pieces to understand his work. In general, we have such an appreciation for art, music, etc (we jealous of LA for having this gem); we don't have this type of caliber in Seattle (though a 2hr drive recently to Vancouver BC recently was fun; they had a great impressionist collection). Anyhow, we love to visit Getty, always a lovely experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ready2Travl2
50,Beautiful,"We were only able to spend a few hours here, but it was spectacular. A must-see of the Los Angeles area, the Getty must be commended for its amazing architecture and excellent art collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280zacharyw
30,Interesting if you like art,I have one daughter who likes art and loves it ! I went just to see it.. Parking is $15 but that's the only fee . Nice to see the whole city from high. We walked the grounds and that was just ok. The best was the ride in the tram to get there . We had lunch there also and that was just ok. Nothing great .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hambel60
50,A mind blowing experience.,I spent 3 hours there. It was not enough. If I ever have a chance of getting there again I would set aside 2 full days. Get there early so thst you can get a multimedia player which greatly adds to the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660nevilles
50,Lots to see in a beautiful setting,"The various art galleries displaying different period and art mediums were very interesting and enjoyable to peruse. The views from the Getty are also very nice. There is a tram to get up to the Getty but it is also a very nice walk if you don't want to wait in line. We were not there at sunset, but my son had been there previously and he said the view of the LA lights is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenA894
50,A Must See In LA,"A great deal! For a $15 fee for parking, an entire carload can experience what the Getty Center has to offer. The art exhibits, views of LA and the restaurant has good tasting food to boot. I wish we could have spent more time here. I also like the openness of the center as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike4TraveI
50,Great museum,This is the Number 1 ranked sightseeing spot in Los Angeles for a reason. We loved it. Beautiful setting on top of world class museum. A Los Angeles must do,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolcO7559JO
40,"Lovely place to visit, odd collections","The facility was lovely, the view, the gardens, the buildings. But the collection was really just so odd! A little of this and a little of that. Some medieval enamel work from Limoges here, photos of World War I there, mid 19th Century art over there. I just couldn't get a handle on what was supposed to be going on. And the fighting over parking (I'm sorry but a Denali is not a compact car people, even in LA you *must* know this!) was really atrocious. While there is no fee for this place, you do pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wombat1223
50,Fun place to spend an afternoon,"The best part about the Getty is its free and never crowded. They have great exhibits, some of the best views in LA, friendly staff. The only negative is the amount of wait time to get a shuttle back to the parking lot. But definitely worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaM08
40,Beautiful facility,this is a free museum/art gallery/sculpture gardens. You pay $15 to park and the entire exhibit is free. Beautiful views of LA. Van Gogh's Irises is there plus many other wonderful painting. You can spend as much time as you want or as little as you need. Food is pricey so pack a lunch and make a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hula_monkey2004
40,A Place to visit and to live (!),Money may not buy happiness but sure buys great art. This is a must see. A recreation of an ancient Naples Villa smack in Malibu....the art is priceless and the museum is free. Worth an afternoon. J. Paul Getty has done the world a great deed by allowing everyone to see some of the most beautiful objects ever created.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesM370
40,Not quite what I expected....,"It was a very hot day when we visited and extremely busy, but we managed to park ok ($15 includes everything - good value in my book). The area around the tram/monorail was absolute bedlam, however, and we thought we'd be waiting there forever! Luckily it quickly dawned on us that you can walk up the hill to the museum, so that's what we did - not such a hard walk, even in the heat, and much better than waiting for the teeny tiny little monorail which was woefully inadequate for the crowds on the day we visited.Once there - everything is much as you'd expect - spectacular buildings and views of LA. What I didn't expect (probably my fault, I hadn't researched it) at an art museum and gardens was there were children everywhere, and lots of rather loud children's entertainers - kind of ruined the ambience a little for me, but I'm sure you feel differently if you have a family with you! Another point to note is that all fountains/water features are off at the moment due to the California drought.Overall an enjoyable experience - seems like there is something for everyone and it's all very well done/maintained. The only thing they could improve on is the frequency of the monorail, which was still too busy at the end of our visit, so we had to walk down again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PooksNorthCarolina
50,Truly amazing,I only wish we had more time to see it all. The Getty was a gem in our LA trip. The art and architecture are a must see. The museum is free...after a day at Universal Studios this was very welcomed by our family of 4!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yoginimia
10,Get there EARLY!,"I can't review this museum, since we didn't get in! Got to the parking ramp at 11:15 a.m. on a Wednesday and spent the next hour slowly following a string of traffic lower and lower into the parking structure. Arrived at the bottom only to have the parking attendant tell us ""I don't know why they let you in, it's completely full. You will have to turn around and go back up."" Spent the next half hour circling our way back to the top. Tried to ask for parking advice from the attendant at the top who simply replied ""we're full"" and waved us out. Very frustrating and disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyMom25
30,Beautiful architecture but dull inside with kids!,"This is a beautiful building and fun parking and getting the monorail up to the Gallery. If you like older art you will also enjoy the contents but we had little interest so didn't spend long inside. The gardens are also very pretty. If you have children this might not be the place for you, unless they are interested in art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotties00
50,Stunning views and great exhibitions,"Its simply stunning, from the arrival to the exhibitions. The Turner exhibition currently on is a must go, excellent. And try the WWI exhibition too, very interesting, especially if you are not from the USA, you get some perspective. Go early, the parking is busy busy busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtraveler30
40,Some of the best views of downtown LA,"The Getty Center has some exquisite architecture, and some amazing exhibits; however, the biggest reason to come here is for the views of Santa Monica and downtown LA. Be advised that admission is free, but parking is not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsanders44
50,Great day @ Getty,"We went to the Getty Center on a whim and I didn't know what to expect but it has ended up becoming one of my favorite places in LA. There are very cool exhibits but what I liked the most was the space itself- open staircases and walkways, gardens and views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FattyMadison
50,Beautiful place to visit - best panoramic view of Los Angeles.,"Many visits to this wonderful venue to see the Turner exhibit. Always love visiting this magnificent site for its views, exhibitions and chance to explore the outdoor space that invites all. Free entrance but $15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450juditha
50,Best learning center for apriciassion of the arts,"First it was the Getty Villa then they Getty center, now and still 30 years from my arrival to Los Angeles where you can visit a place where their apriciate for accent and moder arts it's present in every inch of these colosal collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoskke
50,Fantastic,My daughter and I spent the day here. It is just an amazing space and museum. It is was the highlight of our trip to LA. Next time I will make reservations to eat at the restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMWIS
40,"Artsy fun and great architecture, as expected","You'll have a good time if you like art, architecture and great views. Crowds weren't bad at all at the time we visited, and it met our expectations. Buildings are big but not too the point where you feel you're lost or seeing the same place twice. There are activities and lots of info about each piece. Also, a few places outside the main buildings offer great panoramic views of the surrounding area. Be sure to check them out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681javiv
50,Highlight of My Visit to the Los Angeles Area,"I had such a lovely day at the Getty! The architecture, gardens, sculpture and views are just spectacular! Every component is so well thought out and executed - just magnificent!! I enjoyed the guided tours (free), the recorded tours (free and offered in several languages) and the special exhibits (currently a World War I propaganda exhibit and a Turner painting exhibit - both wonderful and free). The only fee you pay is to park your car ($15) - get there early as the lot does fill up. Entering the 1200 Getty Center Dr. address in my GPS sent me to a lovely residential area (oops, wrong way!) - follow the signs on the street. I spent the entire day here by myself, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The staff and volunteers were all very nice and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290kristinae
50,"Not just a museum, a destination!","The Getty Center sits atop a hill on the west side of Interstate 405. It has panoramic views of the ocean, surrounding hills and much of Los Angeles. The museum has varied traveling exhibits, so always check ahead. It can easily be reached by bus or car ($15 for parking) and admission is free. A short train ride takes you up the hill to the museum proper, where friendly guides are almost everywhere to answer any questions. The gardens alone are worth a visit, and there are many places to eat, drink, hang out, and enjoy the views. Getty's own art collection is mediocre (all classical pieces are at the nearby Getty Villa), but gets better all the time because of the apparently unlimited budget. The best of the home exhibits are the photography shows. And, there are some Impressionists for those who love them. Check for hours, but a winter sunset at the Getty can be spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cos39
50,Amazing gardens !!!,"Amazing Gardens avoide tourist season ! free fun pack a lunch and snaek some vino in ;-) excelent views and exibits for the kids ! not to spead out as it may seem still manages to be grand and quant and have little hidden quiet spots , bring sunscreen as there is a lot to do outside !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erineliza221982
50,Excellent Place For A Day Out,"I always visit the Getty Art Museum when in LA, it's a wonderful building with great views across the City and coast. It's a peaceful oasis full of amazing art with beautiful gardens and good food. It's also free but charges $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jherek
50,"Great Views, Beautiful Gardens, plus an art museum!","The Getty Center is such a special place and I recommend it to anyone visiting LA. It can be a bit of a drive (and don't get me started on the 405), but I would definitely consider it a ""Must Visit.""While the museum is free, parking is a bit pricey, so don't take multiple cars if you can avoid it. The views are, truly, spectacular -- but don't change your plans if the weather doesn't cooperate; I've been here on clear days, rainy days, and overcast days and always had a great time. The gardens are great for picnics, and you can grab food on-site as well (the cafeteria is my favorite of the options). From photography to illuminated manuscripts, the rotating exhibitions are always a treat.Also a plus: there is so much to take in outside that this place is normally a hit with the folks who wouldn't typically go to a museum. Locals often bring family here when they visit from out of town (totally a place to bring the parents). If you check out the Getty's calendar, there's everything from guided garden tours, to live jazz, to kid-friendly events. Something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reller221
40,Peaceful and Serene,A peaceful place to visit if you like art and to take in the sites of the city from their outdoor area. If you aren't into art you might get bored. The best part was the tram ride up from the parking lot. But still a cool place go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thriftytravelerbug
50,Impressive,This is an amazing place not for the obvious reasons. It does have impressive pieces of art and sculptures but it also has an incredible view of Los Angeles and is set in gorgeous gardens that make the trip worth it on its own. The only complaint I may have is that to eat you are going to wait in long lines. It reminded me of a cafeteria. I think it's probably best to bring a picnic and avoid eating there. I can't tell you what the food is like because I didn't bother waiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantin2015
40,"amazing view, but the parking was an issue","The Getty Center is up the hill and by car you have to follow the one way towards the underground parking lot. We went on Tuesday after Easter, around noon and it was bumper to bumper. You pay 15 $ for parking, but the Museum, the gardens and surrounding are free of charge. You take the elevator up to a level where you have to get in the line for the tramp train or you walk up the hill. We did, took us 10 Minutes and it was nice. There are many places to relax, all over sitting areas and you can bring your lunch or buy something at the kiosk. The architecture and the landscaping was amazing, we enjoyed the exhibitions, the view and the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zabl2015
50,Inside and Out the Getty is Great!,"Great works of art! Amazing architecture and sublime landscape. Don't need to say more! Just go.Visitor tip: The Getty is closed on Mondays! The museum is free, but there is a parking charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnsie60
40,What a way to spend the day!!,"If you have an entire day to kill (or maybe even two) this is the place to go. I admit I did not even know of this place and on our last visit to Los Angeles to see our son my husband was looking up things to do and came upon it.Our son had only been there once and it was for a concert so he also wanted to go back. Parking is $15 per car but there is no admission to the center.If you love museums, art, photography, gardens, etc. This is the place to go. Overlooking Los Angeles from high atop a cliff this sprawling center has somethingIt took an entire day and we still did not see everything.Our actual visit was with our son who is 25, but none of the choices reflect that so I picked Family (teens).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CruisingChick
50,awsome !,an amazing place for art lovers or creative people in general ! I had only an hour or so to roam around and it was so short ! i wanted to just sit in front of each work of art and take notes in my little sketchbook for hours ! oh and theres not a lot of food options there ... since we were starving and the food restaurants closed early ... and we had to make do from a vendor selling crips and snacks ... but yea i would recommend atleast 2-3 hours minimum ... provided you like art ... else an hour and a half should give u a brief overview.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831priyankas
50,Gorgeous!,"So much to see, lovely to wonder the grounds, admire the view and take in as much of the art work as you feel like. If you are up for a moderate uphill hike, don't bother waiting for the tram on busy days",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbara0510
10,A trip spent in the car park!!,"We arrived at the Getty Centre late morning on a weekday in March and to cut a long story short we spent well over half an hour stuck inside the one way system of the underground multi-story car park which then hit a dead end right at the bottom where they had ran out of spaces so everyone had to complete a 5 point turn and make their way all the way up and out. A very frustrating and claustrophobic experience.This is the only car park available (it also costs $15 to park), therefore we didn't even get the chance to see the Centre itself, luckily the money for parking was refunded to us on the way out of the car park. Wasted a good hour & a half of our day including the travelling.If you really want to see it then my advise would be to go very early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamL85
50,A Feast for the Eyes!,"The Getty Centre is an experience not to be missed when visiting California. Set high in the foothills, you have the option to go by tram or to walk. The walk is only 10 minutes and beautifully set. The architecture and outdoor gardens are stunning and the displays are so varied there really is something for all interests. I was fortunate enough to see the Turner exhibit (worth the visit just for this!) and an exhibit of Joseph Koudelka's photography. My husband enjoyed the ""World War 1: War of images, images of war"" exhibit. There are also knowledgable docents available to tour throughout. Be sure to make this one of your stops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theresa072014
50,Among the finest museums worldwide,"Be prepared to spend all day. I could not do this and the Villa in the same day. The special exhibitions (at this point, photography and World War I were well worth seeing. The painting collection is only surpassed by the decorative arts.Food in the dining room is good but expensive. With apologies to Sweeney Todd, try the meat pie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HardGrader
30,Underwhelmed,"I had high hopes, given the money available and the fame of the place. However, it was so disappointing. The sheer scale of the buildings completely dwarfed (given its resources and acquisitions) the contents of its limited galleries. It was all about the Centre, not the contents. Style over substance comes to mind. The ""sculptures"" scattered around the garden area are quite laughable, and with little merit. I guess the tone of the place is set by a recorded message on the tram from the car parking, thanking us for coming, saying what to expect etc....a typically bland message which should be by an anonymous voice. But no, the man himself told us he was the man at the top. Who cares? Self regard oozes through the place, and this just epitomises it. Save your money and go to LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarksdale
50,The views alone are worth it!,Came here for a business meeting on a warm clear day. The views were absolutely amazing. We wandered through the gardens before it became too warm! Go early before it gets too crowded! We wandered through a couple of galleries before our first meeting and leaving for our second. Definitely a great place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianrU4388XZ
50,Spectacular views and wonderful works of art,Visited for my second time and enjoyed even more than my first visit. The parking is easy and then you are shuttled to the top of the hill. The museum is so spacious that it never seems crowded and you don't feel rushed. The gardens are spectacular and we even got to see a young artist at work. Food choices range from hot dog/sandwich cart to a gourmet restaurant. The exhibits are put together so well. We really enjoyed the WWII exhibit. I will take any of my visitors again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711BetsyG
30,Mos rebiew,You will do a lot of walking at this place. When I was there it was raining so not a lot going on. There is a nice cafeteria.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629maureend
50,Amazing!,"This place was absolutely wonderful. Took my breath away. First, you park in a garage and then you take this monorail type of transport along the side of the cliff for a cool view! Then you walk up this impressive set of stairs to the open courtyard of the museum campus. The museum itself is a feat of architecture, made up of so much travertine. It's beautiful! It has a very cool water feature as well. Anywhere you go around the edges gives you an amazing view and you can see some of the gardens (which are amazing!) The art collection is great as well! I was visiting during a Renaissance themed day and they had a music stage as well as some craft stations throughout the courtyard area. I ate at the outside cafe and all I remember was that I was starving from walking around in an amazed stupor all afternoon. I would suggest researching what collections they have and picking 3 or 4 to look at in particular because you will need to split your time between looking at art and exploring the Getty itself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurena789
50,Your spirits will soar....,as soon as you step off the tram. THe architecture and setting are the stars of this museum. THe gardens are unique and the views from ocean to downtown are some of the most memorable in the world. A relaxing yet stimulating experience. GO!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valtraveler10
50,Outstanding art and architecture,"The Getty Centre is a jewel in LA. Richard Meier's architecture is outstanding, there are some masterpieces (by Rembrandt and Van Gogh among others) in the collection. Absolutely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes99
50,This should be your first stop,"The museum campus itself is like a work of art. Though this museum lacks some of the well-known pieces of other urban art museums, it has more than enough to make this a great experience for the refined and casual art lover. The viewing rooms are excellent as is the staff. However, what really struck our party was the campus itself. Perched high on a hillside with extraordinary vistas in every direction and fantastic gardens, we had an otherworldly experience in our time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55steve55
40,Fantastic Art work with views to match,We booked this through a tour company that picked us up quite early - 8:00am - from our Hollywood hotel and then drove us for about 45 minutes to their office base - out near the airport - where we sat for another 30 minutes or so - before being driven another 30 minutes back in the direction we came to get us to the Getty. Whew!Once there though the Getty was amazing! The building was architecturally stunning and the views from most outlooks within the grounds were breathtaking - even on a hazy day. Their artwork collection was superb and if we had more time we could have seen a lot more.Thankfully our drive back to our hotel was shorter than the one there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65vickih
30,"Great museum and views, but they could use some Disney organization.","Waited in line for about a half hour to get in the parking deck. Moved a few yards. Gave up and drove to UCLA. Went back a few hours later and made it right into the deck. Then I had to wait, repeatedly, while the people in front of me insisted on blocking the lanes to wait for other people to pull their cars out. Why is there no direction to head to the lower decks were there are ample spaces? Finally made it up to the museum, and saw the WWI exhibit, which was great. Would have liked to have grabbed a bite to eat, but the cafeteria closes at 6, leaving only the fancy sit-down restaurant and the coffee kiosk options. Another downside was that they drained all the fountains, I guess as a water saving method. Does running a fountain really use that much water? It's amazing how loud other people's screaming brats are without that sound of running water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
50,superb place,Visited The Getty centre today.Parking no problem cost 15$ which includes parking and entry.We were 6 adults so very good value.My advise to anyone visiting not used to the heat in LA and depending on your age break your visit up there is alot of walking. Plenty of places to rest and have something to eat or drink not overly expensive.You need to have the day to get through it. all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thehacker2511

40,Worth the hylw,It's worth seeing this attraction as they have the most amazing architect. Their garden is impeccable. The only things that I didn't like is you have to take a tram up and down from the parking garage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randos2015
40,my favorite attraction in LA except for the beach!,"Pay for parking. The entrance is free. The restaurant is very good but you can pack in snacks (which we did this time to save more money). There are endless areas for picnicking and taking in the view and sunshine. Bring your camera to take advantage of the interesting photography opportunities thanks to the architecture, gardens, iconic art and sculpture. And correcting a previous post...Van Gogh's Irises along with paintings by Monet, Manet, and Degas are highlights to be sure. My all time favorite is ""Spring"" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, its in the West pavilion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonreneen
40,Went after 5 pm for cheaper parking & delicious cafe',"We left S. Monica after 4 pm and tried to maneuver around the construction/ traffic. Arrived at 5:09 for $5 off parking. Loved the tram and went straight to the cafe' for a great meal and great prices! Delicious peppery tuna sand. Family loved the burger and the fries were especially fresh and good. Turkey dog kids meal good and reasonably priced. Restrooms clean and nice. Saw sunset at 7 pm and it got cold. We loved the awesome architecture, and the blood moon view.Would recommend it highly for Turner section and the famous paintings on top floor (Van Gogh, Degas, etc.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
40,Great setting,This museum is a great stop for any visit to Los Angeles. Just its place on the hills overlooking Los Angeles makes it worth a visit. I went with my girlfriend to enjoy the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198ericy
40,Worth the effort,"Took is a while to find it in the hire car but worth the journey. Great exhibits, buildings and views. Worth meansering through the gardens as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DemonsStead
50,Always a fun experience,"I haven't been in awhile, but I always am happy that I went, especially to see the beautiful views of Los Angeles, and their gardens. The art ain't bad either... The Turner exhibit was one of the largest collection of work I've seen together in a long time, and it was done so well. Wandering through the other galleries, I saw my favorite Impressionists paintings, and a newly acquired piece. I quickly ran through the WWI exhibit, but I intend to go back soon, especially on a nice and sunny afternoon. Now, you have to pay using their automated service, but still for $15 a car, this attraction is worth every penny! Note - get there early, as sometimes the parking fills up quickly. Really lovely and fun experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
50,The architecture is the real star,"Pay for parking, but the entrance is free. You can view hundreds of works of art, like Monet's irises! The building, though, is the true beauty of the place. Situated on a hill top, overlooking the LA area, you can get a great vista at every turn. A must see in so cal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaK2
50,Awesomeness plus,"We are AUstralian tourists who visited yesterday. .it was awesome even if you do not like art. The buildings are gorgeous, the gardens are gorgeous, the view of LA gorgeous and it is all free. It is very big so plan to spend the day there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy22102
40,Lovely.,"The buildings and grounds themselves are worth the visit alone. Oh, and the view of L.A. We visited during the Turner exhibit. That was well done with a great deal of the artist's work present. Staff in the gift shop were helpful and courteous. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lotusbabe
40,Beautiful grounds but only go if your into art,I went here as part of a trip to Burbank for a live taping. The grounds and the building are quite nice. The price is good as you only pay for parking. There is pretty much just a ton of art though. I have my tastes in art and unfortunately this didn't match up with what I like. It would be nice to see more diversity in what is there and maybe some more well known artists. As it was i hadn't heard of anyone they were currently exhibiting. SO if you like the architecture or the views of downtown LA with a little bit of art then go just don't expect much more beyond that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodokast1616
30,Great Place on a hot L.A day !!!,This museum has a little bit of everything.............great family place !! Great views from the hills over looking Los Angeles area. Look into what special programs will be at museum when you plan to make your visit.......they have a great outdoor area with plenty of seating to rest or have a snack.......walking trails where you can take pictures and enjoy the garden and just sit and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarisaDenver
40,Has a little bit of something for every age,"Our stepdad is a retired architect so we took him and our mother to see the museum. We did not join any tours but the handouts and the volunteers were very helpful. Although we spent at least half a day there, there was not enough time explore the beautiful gardens and the entire museum. The museum is not in close proximity of area restaurants so we had to eat at the café. Pricey at approx. $10 for a sandwich, burger or pizza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424carriey
50,A Beautiful Day at the Getty Center,"This wasn't my first time coming up here at the Getty Center. I've been up here alone and with friends during my high school days and college days. But it was my first time being here accompany by my wife at the Getty Center :) I don't think you can get much more stunning than this location. The Getty Center is the crown jewel of LA's museums, tourist attractions and for good reason. It's simply breathtaking. Pulling into the parking lot off of Sepulveda Blvd, and follow the crowds over to the tram plaza, and prepare to whisked up the mountainside to a gorgeous oasis of art, gardens, and spectacular views. [Don't worry if the mobs of people look imposing. The Getty Center has crowd control down to the science area and you'll never wait more than a few minutes for a tram.] You can spend your time most of the day exploring the grounds. The various buildings are architectural marvels, and each one houses artwork from a different period. Everything from Middle Ages religious iconography to the 21st century digital photography is represented here. But, most of the visitors not all are at the Getty Center not to view art, but rather to create their **own** art, in the form of snapping iPhone selfies, amidst the hedge mazes, fountains, and walls of flowers of all colors, and posting the results to Instagram or Facebook. I also strongly recommend an occasional snapshot of the LA valley below, since it's one of the best views you can find anywhere. On a clear day [which is most days, since LA smog is mostly a thing of the past] you can see beyond downtown LA to the east and well beyond the Pacific coast to the west.Did I mention that admission to the Getty Center experience is free? The only thing that costs money is parking, which is $15/car, so I recommended carpooling to keep costs down. Or Better yet, ride your bike, take the bus, or just Uber over. Just go already. I don't think you've truly experienced LA until you've checked the Getty Center off your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izzy_sparks321
30,Love the architecture and layout. Art isn't bad either,From a design perspective this is a 4 but for art its a three. Thee are some really excellently preserved items but it all seems a bit muddled with artifacts bundled together with no history to speak of. Cafe is very expensive but then it does have a captive audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevejnb
40,Awesome view,Good exhibitions with beautiful view and a huge outdoor garden. The place is hot and it would be better if there are more sheltered places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eleawong14
50,"Brilliant location, design and presentation","WOW! Now that I have gotten that out, I can continue. This is a must see; a model of how museums of art can entice, inform and entertain. I will let you experience it yourself; that discovery is part of its charm. I will note that the magnificently manicured grounds, the free entry, the user friendly and complimentary IPhone audio visual self guide, the helpful docents and the well appointed gift shop ( I bought the hand crafted Escher inspired clock) all are only a part of its commanding attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbaron_99
50,Free guided tours,"What a wonderful piece of architecture this building is and the works it displays are amazing.Like all visitors there is never enough time to take it all in, in a day so we joined 2 guided tours. One gave us an interesting insight to the Turner exhibition on display courtesy of the Tate Gallery and the other took us through outstanding furniture, paintings etc. We also wandered outside to view the gardens and sculptures and enjoyed seeing many people also captivated by the building and it's contents.The fact that it is free - from the monorail ride up from the car park and no entrance fee - is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525robint
40,A Very pleasant afternoon at The Getty Center,"The Center is well kept, and managed very well. We had two young boys (ages 5 and 2) with us, and they enjoyed the picnic spot the best. Plenty of grassy areas for them to run around, in between seeing the paintings!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhun2010
40,This is one of two Getty Museums,"Yes this place is awesome BUT...If you have some extra time, do try to check out the original Getty museum / home in Malibu. They are both fantastic exhibitions of art. L.A. has some of the best you can find. It all depends on how much time you have. I am fortunate to have lived here for 60+ years and STILL have not seen it all.Google ""Getty Villa Malibu"" for more info. If you love art you will not be disappointed visiting either site.My personal favorite is the Malibu Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
50,Very educational,"Before you go check their website for schedule of current exhibits. The volunteers are very helpful. They always have fun stuff for kids. The store is a must visit, they offer items from the current and sometimes past exhibit. Parking is friendly and spacious. Beautiful building and lots to see and learn and most of all enjoy.Tip: look at the map of the premises and the current exhibits so you can plan your day ahead of time.Tip: they are certain days when they have discounts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bea4Trips
50,Fabulous Gardens and Art,"Loved our visit to the Getty Center. We didn't allow enough time to see everything. Next time I am going to allow at least 1/2 day to see the entire museum and spending more time in the beautiful gardens. A great place for a family outing and spending the day enjoying all the natural beauty of the place. There were lots of activities to keep the kids busy. It was a Saturday and the weather was great, so it was busy. Despite the crowds there was enough space for everyone. There was a bit of a wait for the tram, but it wasn't a big deal. Umbrellas are provided to stay cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AASeattleFlyer
40,Wow!,Went with my 19 year old daughter in January. The only thing I did wrong was not leave myself enough time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megsidara
50,Amazing Views and Pieces of Art,"Van Gough, Picasso, Monet, and David. There is so much art and what an amazing view of the city. Great place for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubble_Toes75
50,Large museum with amazing Art and views,"You will want to leave yourself 25-20 minutes to get from the parking lot to the museum or vice versa... I walked off the monorail and up to the museum to hear a women leaving say ""Oh, more stairs"" and she was right, there are a lot of stairs here, and elevators for those who can not use the stairs. The museum reminded me a bit of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, but on steroids. The rooms and wings keep going and much as I find myself at most museums after a few hours, I had to hit just the highlights and move on. This would be a great place to spend a day, or go for a first date. At times, the views, architecture and gardens become the center piece making you forget about the priceless art inside on the walls. One of the best things I have seen or experienced in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TryppAdams
50,Breathtaking,"Absolutely worth the visit. With all the visitors here on our day, we felt like we were the only ones here. Only cost is the parking. Museum had a fantastic selection of things to see and do. Gardens were spectacular, as were the views of LA. Visited with children 4,6,9,11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neetskee
50,"Great art, architecture and view!","You realize how popular the museum is as you look for a space in the enormous underground parking garage. You are then whisked away in a smooth, futuristic looking tram from the parking garage up the hill to the museum. You already get a good view of parts of LA from the tram ride. At the top of the hill the trams open and we could see the ropes for lines when there must be 100s more guests (we were there on a Friday afternoon in June, no crowds or lines), reminiscent of Disneyworld style people moving. The steps up to the main museum building allow you to appreciate the buildings architecture. The museum has almost a continuous indoor outdoor feel as the inner courtyard has cafe seating, sculpture and fountain and you can enter the different indoor galleries by walking between either indoors or outdoors. Throughout the museum you are also treated to many indoor and outdoor opportunities to appreciate the amazing vistas onto LA and the ocean. The art collection is as amazing as the setting. However, this museum has such an amazing setting, that I imagine locals come just to eat at the restaurant for the views. We enjoyed our visit very much and would enjoy returning. The gift shop had some nice souveniors.The only caveat is that we had difficulty getting to the current entrance using our GPS which took us to several back (restricted) entrances through some Gucchi neighborhoods on the west side of the museum. Make sure you look at the current maps ahead of time (or check and see if your car/phone GPS is up-to-date. We wasted at least 30 minutes driving around the mountain trying to figure out how to get in. We finally figured out we had to go up a road just to the east (opposite side from the museum) of the interstate past (north of) the museum. When it looked like we got to far, there was a tunnel to go under the interstate which led into the drive to the parking garage.Due to getting lost, we only had an hour or so at the museum, but we could have easily stayed for 2 hours (or more) if we'd had the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaturePark_ArchSites
50,Fantastic Art on Top of the Hill,"I found so many surprising and wonderful things, and the special exhibitions -- i saw the Turner and the World War I exhibitions -- are full of fantastic things and very well curated. Also there are lovely views of the LA basin. It's very convenient to bus travel, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongo2015
50,The best museum I have ever visited,"This place is wonderful not only because of the very rich collectios but also for the nice architecture and location. Do not miss the restaurant for lunch , cause the food and view are amazing. Besides that it is a free visit except the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALEXRASSI
50,WOW!!!,The Getty Center is fantastic!!! The best views of LA from the most architecturally striking building I have ever seen! The art collection is world class and well presented! Staff was very friendly and helpful in getting us to different locations. This is a MUST SEE in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70gregs
50,Treasures & Pleasures,"Always mind-expanding with breath-taking, acclaimed art enclosed by open, travertine architecture enabling 180-views of LA, ocean. Gardens are a feast with expansive lawns for picnics and viewing events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbm_laca
50,Getty Luncheon Superb,"The Getty Center restaurant has outstanding cuisine amid the extraordinary art & culture offered by the Museum. The surroundings are contemporary, with custom art all along one wall and floor to ceiling overlook windows opposite. Very sophisticated menu which was well executed and served professionally. May a reservation for a table next to the windows and drink in the art and cuisine. You will wowed by BOTH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTortella
50,Breathtaking gardens perfect for a picnic,"My best friend took me here while I was visiting her for the week. We packed a lunch and ate it on the grass while people watching, and then went into the gardens to walk around and take photos of the beautiful flowers. After that, we went into the museum to see the art. Many beautiful pieces inside, but my favorite part was the gardens and beautiful views outside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashley72988
50,Amazing Art Museum,"This is a fabulous museum. The buildings are well designed and the art on display is stunning. As visitors from England we could only stay for about 3 hours, which is not nearly long enough. The commentary on the headphones is excellent and the organisation from the carpark onwards is very impressive. This was a memorable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0l88
50,Amazing place,"Beautifully designed buildings housing wonderful works of art. The property is meticulously maintained, the shuttles run like clockwork from the parking area and the staff are well trained. Altogether a fascinating experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristinaE_12
50,incredible,No matter what really catches your attention you will find something here for everyone. The property itself is absolutely beautiful and inspiring. I enjoy the gardens here. They are so colorful and a joy just to relax and people watch. They have a couple cafes and a restaurant when you get hungry. Access to the museum is free but you have to pay $15 for parking. All in all ut is well worth it. Fantastic experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syntax73
50,Best view of LA,"This is a must see. The views are amazing. The cost is only for parking. The art collection is outstanding. The landscaping is perfection. The exhibits are educational. The panoramic views are incredible. Don't visit LA without viewing the Getty Center, (not the Getty Villa)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMAC50
40,Well rounded art,"You can see a bit of most genres of art at the Getty Center. Each gallery is its own building with outdoor walkways in between. My husband and I thought the museum was very nice, but not unlike other world-class art museums in terms of the art displayed. The setting and architecture are what set the Getty apart. The galleries are nicely laid out and fairly easy to navigate with a map. We enjoyed the Getty Villa more than the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeGirl
50,Excellent Turner exhibition,What an impressive collection of paintings and aquarels. Turner life is shown in this Getty's show.Also the Garden tour is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452eduardop
50,A perfect trip for multigenerational families,"The Getty Center is one of the most spectacular museums in the world, for both its masterpieces of artwork and its architecture. The J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center in Los Angeles houses European paintings, drawings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, decorative arts, and photography from its beginnings to the present, gathered internationally.I visited the Getty on a warm, sunny, spring day (such days are the norm, rather than the exception). Since the Museum and Gardens cover so much outdoor space, the Museum provides umbrellas for the guests for those rare, rainy days. It was such a joy walking through the manicured gardens that included sculptures, a myriad of flowering trees and bushes, and water fountains. On such a day, it was hard to decide how best to spend my time. On past trips, I spent a couple of hours just wandering on the walkways and down outdoor stairs to discover beauty offset by white marble walls and floors surrounding the gardens.Inside the museum buildings, each area is organized by mode of artwork, era, and style. There was an exhibit dedicated to photography, and a visiting exhibit dedicated to the artist, J.M.W. Turner – an artist who became famous BEFORE his death and is currently celebrated with a critically acclaimed biographical film.The Getty Center for Families:I attended with a group of adults ages 79 to 85. As active seniors, they had no problem with the hundreds of steps throughout the facility. However, I know of several art-minded individuals who were deterred from taking the trip due to the size and scope of the property. My best advice is if you are currently using a walker, it is worthwhile to borrow a scooter or electronic wheelchair so that you can enjoy the immense property.While we were there, we saw hundreds of children – from babies learning to navigate the stairs to high school seniors on a school trip. The Getty caters to all ages. The bathrooms are equipped with clean changing stations, much to a tired mother’s delight. There is a Family Room with hands-on exhibits for children when they start to get antsy with artwork-overload. They also offer games such as art scavenger hunts for kids so that they are engaged throughout the facility.The Getty Center offers many different food choices at all price ranges. For people who have a couple of hours to spare and who have booked reservations, the Restaurant has a delicious continental menu and full wine list to complement the exquisitely prepared dishes. You will be out of luck if you expect to drop in for a bite though, since the restaurant books well in advance.There is also a café, under the restaurant that offers cafeteria style options – both hot and cold. I prefer this option with a family since everyone can choose their favorite foods and there is very little time between arriving and eating – perfect after a 2 hour commute to the Getty from Santa Barbara.The Museum is free to attend, but it costs $15 for parking, and you will not find street parking, so plan accordingly. The museum gift shop offers a wide variety of books, jewelry, scarves, coffee cups, and more – all at reasonable prices.If you plan a trip, it is worthwhile to plan for a full day or even two days. Think if it this way. It is like visiting several countries in one day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquelittlejohn
50,Absolute Must,"The tram, the views, the landscaping! What a treat to navigate exhibits by walking outdoors and into another beautiful building. The contrast of the collection with the modern architecture makes for fascination every minute of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdub89
50,Mother's Day Brunch,"We do brunch at the Restaurant at The Getty 2 or 3 times a year for the past 8 years. The staff has cycled through, but the quality and customer service has never diminished with the changes. The Cobb salad is a must. Request a table by the window with a view of the ocean ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynJ22
50,Must-visit,"No entrance fees, we paid only for the acceptable parking fee. The villa is a must-visit because it is just beautiful. It is not only educational as it is a museum, it is also very well-maintained and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homary
50,Not to be missed.,"There was nothing I didn't like. The setting, with lovely views of the area, the architecture of the museum was so impressive as were the beautful gardens. The artwork of course was breathtaking and I loved that I could get up close to all the paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tupencetravels
50,J. M. W. Turner is still there! Go NOW!,"Great place with beautiful gardens and a remarkable art collection. As a bonus, there is a delightful view of LA.Getty center is a place of peace. Really inspiring.The exhibitions are free of charge but parking costs $15. great value .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaKadobayashi
50,Superb,"Thoroughly recommended! Best attraction of Las Vegas. It is easy to get too by bus, the tram is great, the collections fantastic. The Turner exhibition (on loan) was great. The gardens are superb and the views a delight! Best of all, it is free! Please go there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatEdinburgh
50,A Must See in LA,"We spent about 4 hours at the Getty Center this weekend, what a wonderful museum. The train ride from the parking structure to the Campus was worth the trip by itself with great views of LA and the surrounding hills. We were able to tour 3 special exhibits that were all very well done - we will definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDBPittsburgh
50,Wow.,"I've lived here for six months but had never been to the Getty. Finally visited last week and it lived up to all the hype. The views are absolutely spectacular and the facilities are a piece of art in themselves. Where else can you get these views *plus* galleries featuring Picasso, Van Gogh, Matisse, and many more greats? It's a totally unique experience and worth every cent of parking your car in the $15 lot. I recommend watching the 10-minute film as you go inside for a little more context on the space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegtravel4
50,WOW WHAT A GEM,"I remember my dad talking about this place as a kid when it was near the beach, i remember seeing it being built, and now i can say i remember taking my family there. For the price of parking you get to see some of the worlds best art, views, and items that people in other parts of the US and world can only dream of seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigboytrolley
50,Well worth the day visit,"I am not a huge fan of museums, but I admit this was a great day at the Getty Center.The exhibits and the free audio tour were very well done.I learned a lot and I enjoyed the mixture of the indoor and outdoor space.The Center seems very well run and I would plan a future trip to see changes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pine129
50,"Great views, great culture","The ride up to the center is air conditioned- which was great. Not many food selections when there, so eat first. The views of the city are superb! Think of this as a photo opportunity- everything for architecture to landscape to cityscape to selfies! Makes any LA must-do list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tayrah
10,Over Rated,"We took a spring break trip to LA. We had a great visit, however this was one of our disappointments. It was listed as a must see, always on the top of places to go in LA and i have no idea why. Now do not get me wrong, I have nothing against art museums, I have seen my share across the US and Europe. But this one has some of the weakest collections I have seen. You have to park in a garage that is over filled and end up going 6 to 7 stories under ground. Stand in line to ride a tram up to the center. The views are great but that is all, the art itself is dull and weak. Its mostly a place for snobs and hipsters to go and have lunch and the post online how cultured they are. Yawn. Go anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Txaggievet
50,Just beautiful,"This is a must see if you are in the area. The buildings and the way they are set on the mountain are just spectacular. There is no bad view from anywhere. We took a free architectural tour and it was great. The tour guide pointed out lots of things we wouldn't have otherwise realized. The gardens are amazing, as are the outdoor sculptures. Wish we had had more time to spend there. It's simply magnificent! Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730LovedItaly
50,Bring your sunglasses,"We have toured art museums in 18 countries and we rank The Getty is near the top of our list. It is important to bring sunglasses with you as the campus is on top of a hill with a light stone design that makes the sun very bright.The buildings offer a range of art that will satisfy any art lover. Obtain a map when you arrive, so that you will know where the galleries that most interest you are located. We found several free gallery tours. Don't forget to visit the gardens.There are several places to eat and a few outdoor snack counters to grab a quick beverage and sit on one of the patios. The lower level cafe is less expensive than the restaurant and it offers a variety of food stations.Parking is $15. From there, a free-of-charge (as is the museum) tram will take you to the campus.You can easily spend a full day there and not see everything. Be sure to attend the orientation film before starting our tour of the campus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newengland50
40,"Awesome, but is it a must-see?","I've really struggled to write this review, particularly since we've waited years to get to LA and the Getty. Of course, it is an architectual wonder in an amazing setting. And the overall scope and presentation of art is also exceptional. The permanent collection is noteworthy but here's where I was disappointed: there's a sort of ""we've got one of each"" nature to the collection. As such, I didn't feel this was a absolute must-see......for example, had we sacrificed our visit to the Norton-Simon to ""do the Getty"", or the Getty Villa as well, we would have have been disappointed. Of course, if we lived in the LA we would have an annual membership and just hop the tram for a special exhibit and a picnic lunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcyork
50,Don't Miss,"The Getty is fabulous. The museum has made it family friendly, comfortable, trains make it is easy to get from parking to the museum. If visiting LA, this is something you will remember for a lifetime. The are a lot of ""WOW"" moments here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whitakerh
50,"Well deserved raves, but one caution","I can't add anything to all the rave reviews, which I completely agree with. But here's a tip: don't try to do the Villa and Center on the same day. The temptation is there: pay for parking at one and you get free parking at the other. That's what we did, but we shortchanged ourselves. Seeing one, then driving to the other and seeing that, well, it's just too rushed to take it all in on the same day. The Center especially deserves time to walk around and enjoy.And be sure to pose by Irises - probably the world's most expensive painting (that can actually be priced).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
50,Spend an entire day here!,This is one of LA's treasures! We spent more than 2 hours just enjoying the architecture and gardens. There are also amazing views from every corner. The free tours are highly recommended to give you a greater appreciation of this amazing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cafedavid

50,Beautiful,"Oh my gosh is all I need to say. A must visit for anyone coming to LA! The art, view, and history there was amazing. Must see in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forevercruzeby
40,Nice visit!,Finally got around to visiting here. Not as impressive as other museums & galleries we've visited but had an enjoyable afternoon. Contemporary architecture including the lovely garden & the wide open view of LA were very nice. Felt fortunate to catch the Josef Koudelka exhibition before it ends soon. Visit with your family or friends for just $15 parking fee (free admission) and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathysO2496LP
50,It could convince me to move to LA!,"This was my third (?) visit and I swear I could go once month, every month, till the end of time. It's fantastic. Even if you don't go into any of the galleries and see the exhibits/collections, the landscape/buildings are a treasure to walk around and look at the views. The center garden is amazing and you could sit in there and investigate the flora/fauna for the whole afternoon. I'm a photographer and The Getty always has an emphasis on at least one photography show. This time it was Joseph Koudelka and it blew me away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/829kellyp
50,Stunning Gem in the middle of LA,"Absolutely stunning Gem in the middle of LA - this review is for the Getty Villa - not the museum - an oasis of tranquility, history, art, all in one - free entrance but you pay for parking - great for families",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tribesman5398

50,Fantastic - Something for Everyone!,"You have to see it to believe it! Who could imagine such a place? The museum is welcoming and visitor-friendly in spite of its large size. Don't be intimidated, and enjoy the incredible works of art. The gardens and grounds are beautiful too, and the views from inside the galleries (expecially from the walkways) are breathtaking. The security guards were wonderful and know all the best views! Take your time here and enjoy all there is to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBFranks
50,The Getty - Don't miss it,"The Getty is a venue much more than art although one could argue all of it is art in the purest form. views spectacular, architecturally amazing, gardens beautiful, art exhibits incredible, dining great....and except for dining and parking it's all free thanks to the GettyTrust ..what a deal. don't miss it and the visit the Getty Villa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488jimd
50,Enjoy A Day At The Getty!!,"The Getty Center is a wonderful place to enjoy art and the gardens by yourself, with a date or a loved one. It only costs $15 for parking. Then a monorail sweeps you up the hill to the Getty. The views are stunning and so is the granite architecture. Enter the buildings and see magnificent art and sculptures. Outside are a variety of plants and trees with walkways so you can see each and everyone of them. Some people sit on the lawn and eat food that they have brought while overlooking the view of the ocean (weather permitting). I cannot wait to go back and eat in one of their restaurants and enjoy more of what the Getty Center has to offer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980pamc
50,A must visit destination,"The building has aged well. The Gardens and the views are wonderful. And, the plaza is a great place to hangout with the sun and free wi-fi. They have revised parking to make it more efficient, but it still costs $15. (The museum is free). The current Turner exhibition is sublime. The Martin Puryear sculpture at the entrance is underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDA49
50,Beautiful,I loved it...beautiful setting....great food...little pricey but hey...its the Getty center....enjoy it its gorgeous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore803771
50,A must see!,The Getty Center has become an LA landmark. It is a beautiful high quality museum featuring incredible works of art housed in stunning architectural design. The building alone is worth visiting even if you don't see a single exhibit. The views of the city are amazing and the gardens very beautiful. There are also great food options including a very good restaurant. Don't miss the Getty Center if you're coming to visit LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chauxg
50,Beautiful site!,"There are some lovely pieces at the museum, the illuminations are exceptional and if you are into photography there are always some new exhibits there to see. For me the best is the building itself. It is exceptional and the views and grounds are stunning. Great programs for children to participate in and their summer concert programs are great! Be sure to make reservations as parking is limited. Have been there a number of times and there is always something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepI9693UV

30,Amazing place in terms of size - not so amazing in terms of actual art,My Dad being an artist by trade I've been to many art museums. This place is beautiful. Amazing. But it lacks enough art - don't ask me why because it absolutely deserves it. Dining here is a pleasure. Everything about it is a pleasure except and I won't hammer it. I would come again. Parking costs but really do you care when you can see priceless art?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJAhearn

50,Best Thing To Do In LA!,"It came as a surprise to me that one of the best and most diverse museums in the country is in LA. You just cannot beat The Getty- the location on the side of a mountain affords amazing views in every direction. The architecture itself is beautiful, and a feast for the eyes. The gardens are so beautiful and interesting- the sculptural ""trees"" are just breathtaking! We spent hours in the photography exhibits alone. We sat and had an iced chai latte that was delicious at an outdoor spot that had lovely shade, and a gorgeous view. The other amazing thing is that it only cost $15 for parking, and no admission fee. This was the highlight of my trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellzaboppin
50,Beautiful building & view of LA,"This is a MUST visit for visitors to Los Angeles. THe Getty Center is a really beautiful building and garden and a stellar view of Los Angeles on a par with the view from Griffith Park. If you want to see the art, that's an extra, but you don't need to be an art lover to enjoy a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK_13
50,Museum,Gorgeous museum and extensive grounds. This is one of the nicer and better museums that I have ever been too. Go and you won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xspecht
50,On A Clear Day You Can See Forever...,Its strengths lie in its temporary exhibitions and photography collection. After all doesn't Getty Images have some connection? Their permanent collection is not great but there are plenty of places to sit and have coffee and the cafe is excellent with lots of choice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazkira
20,They Don't Like Kids,"I came with a friend and her children with my two boys, 9 and 5. We tried to get there early in the day, so as to be the least amount of bother. I am extremely sensitive to not disturbing adults in an atmosphere such as this one, but even when I kept my children outside, I was literally followed around the area by a security guard who kept telling me to move my kids ""off this and off that"" when the places were CLEARLY for climbing and small children. We were not welcome on walking tours, and told so loudly, and I was embarassed. I left after 90 minutes, in tears. I will never go to this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tangomom_50
50,Great Art and Great Food,"There are some wonderful exhibits here that are held here: Klimt and Koudelka in the past couple of years, for example. Make sure that you check out the different mini-museums, so to speak, or separate exhibition halls that make up the space of the museum. The place is very spread out and so it is easy to miss something. The museum cafe is really fantastic. And very practical. You can have a leisurely gourmet meal or you can have something quick--they have a variety of choices. Don't mistake this--""new"" Getty for the ""old"" Getty, i.e. the Getty in Malibu. This ""new"" location will put you in reach of a lot of things to see in Los Angeles. You are right near Westwood here. You are also right near Santa Monica. Conveniently located right off the 405 Freeway, you could plan a visit here either on or out of your way out of town. Just be sure to give yourself a lot of time. The place can be crowded sometimes. And what is more important is that there is plenty to see here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinemm147
50,Amazing Place,We visited the Getty Center the beginning of March. It is absolutely spectacular. The grounds and gardens alone are worth the visit. The exhibits are well organized and easy to view. You could easily spend an entire day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlavendier
50,Koudelka exhibit is breathtaking!!,"The views, the art, the gardens. I don't know how you couldn't like this...rough up here in quality with DC museums. Felt like being at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3rkin

50,Top Quality Museum and Grounds,"If you are into art, then this is a must visit in LA. I enjoyed the grounds and architecture tour almost as much of as the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsum73
50,Superb J.W Turner show,"I enjoyed my visit to the Getty very much, on top of the incredible J.W. Turner show I went to every room, Gauguin, Cezanne , Picasso, the magnificent James Ensor "" The Entrance of Christ in Brussels "" lost for Belgium because of the stupidity of the Director of the Antwerp Museum......Of course all the magnificent French XVIII century furniture, The Getty is definitely one of the greatest Museum in the world. My last visit was soon after the opening. Each time it is a wonderful experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lahulpe80
50,Love the garden,"This is one of my favorite spots in Los Angeles when I visit my son. The gardens are so beautiful, you take a train up to the museum and relax watching art, the scenery and the amazing garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F471MDmariar
50,"Gardens, views and art!",It is the gardens and the architecture of this art gallery which so brilliantly offsets the character of whats inside. Poised on a hill with views down to the somewhat hazy California coastline the gardens are formal and the gallery partaking several different arms. The exterior is even more fabulous than the interior but its an attraction which is nonetheless one of the premier cultural attractions of this city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533lucindap
50,Must see Museum when in LA,"Large beautiful museum inside and out. The gardens, buildings and views are almost as impressive as the interesting mix of art inside. The manuscripts are always a must when they are on display. Temporary exhibits are often interesting as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
50,You must see if you are in LA,"The architecture, paintings, planting, and restaurant are all excellent. The parking and taking the tram is easy and moved along quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519lindal
50,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,"Free entrance, immaculate surroundings and gardens, incredible art on display, views too die for, and a really nice museum shop, you would be foolish not to visit this place. All you pay is parking at 15$ per day, that's so cheap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
30,it is ok...,"The outdoor space is more interesting, to be honest after seeing all these grrreeat gallery and museum, then you don't find this that special...sorry",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisewswong
50,Great Art and Great Atmosphere,The Getty a must see gallery in LA. Perched high on a cliff above the city the views and gardens are spectacular. No admission charge just a parking fee. Excellent restaurant for lunch. Guided tours (never the same) daily. All that an all the works of art that you can absorb in a day. They usually have special exhibitions - this time it was Tuner's works. They also have a photography collection that allows new exhibits to appear regularly. Don't miss this art museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haggart1530
50,A must see in the Los Angeles area,"The museum is amazing. There are so many paintings from all periods. There is a photography section. There are sculptures and gardens. The grounds are beautiful. There are special exhibits. There are two restaurants on the grounds. One is self serve and more casual ad the other is more formal, both with wonderful views. We ate at the more formal one for lunch. We had Cobb salads which were very good. The atmosphere was lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanK815
50,Beautiful,"With flying into LAX last night at midnight, our tram ride was a exciting introduction to the hills of Los Angeles. The Getty facility is stunning. We were very happy with the diversity of the collection. The $15 parking fee and free admission made this feel like such a gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makingtheleap
50,A must in LA,"One of the best things to do in Los Angeles. You can see the gorgeous mansions of Bel Air, Brentwood from the terraces of Getty Museum. Bring a jacket with you so as not to get to cold. You can see Van Gogh's Irises painting, Cezanne's still life paintings. I loved Getty's gift shop a lot. There was so much to take a look at. I bought some cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NazliDemet
50,Nothing Like It Anywhere,"Oh sure, there are better museum collections elsewhere, and there are grander buildings elsewhere, and there are better gardens elsewhere, but when you place this aggregation of buildings and gardens and art together on top of a hill with great vistas of LA all the way to the Pacific Ocean and even Santa Catalina, there is nothing else like it. So don't miss it. And take the architecture tour or the gardens tour to round out your art experience. A final note -- we really liked the current exhibition of JMW Turner from the Tate in London.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPBurdell67
50,A Serene Get-Away,"This is a stunningly beautiful place to enjoy art exhibits and a lovely place to just hang out on a sunny afternoon. The city vistas from its hill-top location and landscape architecture of the grounds are truly stunning. The restaurant is also one of the best kept secrets in LA. It's not anything like some other average and over-priced museum restaurants. This restaurant is really great, especially for brunch.Heads-up! The museum is free but parking is $20! After all, even though you may feel transported into another beautiful universe while visiting here, The Getty Center IS still in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheckInPlease
40,"Fun place to hang out, or take in the collection","I spent an afternoon at the Getty with my wife, my sister-in-law and her partner.The grounds are incredible, but as we had visited during a massive drought, most of the water features were non-existent except for the main garden. We actually brought a picnic lunch and spent most of the wonderful October afternoon laying on the grass in the garden area reading books and snacking. Eventually we wandered through some of the collection on our way out of the center at the end of the day.Overall I would definitely recommend that you check out the Getty, the grounds, the buildings, and the collection are all something you should experience. They even have a childrens section for your small ones to play with some interactive items.Check out the Getty, it's worth the price for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhU4916TC
50,"Purely amazing, a must see if visiting Los Angeles ;-)","We loved every part of it from the food, to the views, the building, and the art inside. It was all 5 star ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737travish

50,Beautiful setting,"the museum is breathtaking from inside and out. While the collections were outstanding, the architecture and the gardens left an even greater impression .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smdubowsky
50,World Class Art and Architecture,"This is a must see on a trip to Los Angeles. We were impressed with the buildings and with the art in the different galleries. It is difficult to see much of the collection on one visit. If you really enjoy art, you might want to schedule two different visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5nn
40,Top of the world?,Great place to visit to see the Hollywood sign on the side of a very baron hill and if the day is clear a fantastic view of the city. My biggest disappointment was that we didnt allow more time to visit The Getty Center longer as it has so many interesting things to see and learn about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jnamie
50,To to Getty,"Wonderful location, architecture, facilities, food, and fantastic variety of art. They have it all there. I was surprised to see the room set-ups for the French furniture. It made if more real to see the scene instead of a line-up of articles out of context.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vickilynjohns
50,Art and Architecture Lovers Heaven,"The museum is free but the parking costs you $15. You have lots of choices for tours and they also have audio guides which give you lots of valuable information about the art. There us plenty to do for several trips plus you always have special exhibits. After viewing the Turner special exhibit there through May, we wandered throughout the buildings, terraces and gardens to enjoy the art, views and beautiful landscaping. We enjoyed lunch at the cafe and tea in the afternoon. Visit if you can - I'm glad I finally got here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsy99
50,Spectacular,From the gardens and views to the beautiful architecture to the phenomenal art collections to the tasty restaurant the Getty is a winner all the way around. A must visit for your out-of-town visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanietravelsalot
50,Fantastic views,"A challenge to get to by public transport [2 quite long bus rides, nearly an hour to reach from Hollywood] but fantastic views of the city. The art work was interesting: we saw the Turner exhibition and one linked with World War 1. Modern facilities. Reasonably priced food. Entry to museum and art work is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeraldA
40,Worth a trip.,"The collection is a little lackluster, think 2nd to 3rd tier, but the museum is built from the ground up as a museum, so the technology and design is truly fantastic. And it's nice to walk around the gardens and enjoy a beautiful view of LA as well. Lunch in the cafeteria is more than adequate and not too expensive, although expect long lines. I found the architecture tour a fine way to spend 40-50 minutes getting an introduction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pocmonster
50,Wonderful Experience,"We took advantage of a two day layover in LA to visit The Getty Center and are so happy we did. It is perched on a hillside with gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains, the city and the ocean. This free museum is amazing. Who needs Disneyland? The artwork displayed are all masterpieces. The traveling exhibits were unique. The research facility had historical works. The gardens were considered a sculpture in themselves. A beautiful day added to our experience. There were several eating venues to choose from, but we chose the main restaurant and had wonderful food and service, as well as frat window views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moira49
30,"nice place but no ""must see""","The Getty Center has really beautiful gardens, good location for a landscape view of the city and art collections. That's all... I didn't understand why it ranked #1 in Los Angeles list... In my opinion Studio tours such Warner, Santa Monica beach and the parks are much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308milenas
50,So Much Art!,"If you love art, you will love this place. I'm not a big art museum person, but this was a great visit. I almost did not visit it, but I changed my plans when something else was not available. I'm glad I did. There was a wealth of various forms including paintings, sculptures, furnishings, and photography. There are multiple eras that were covered. In addition, the campus was covered with beautiful gardens and scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mathstud
50,"Stunning art, gardens, and views","Spend several hours enjoying the architecture, gardens and art on fantastic hillside overlooking LA.Must see first hand to appreciate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bamazed
50,Simply beautiful,"I came here expecting a boring museum, but what greeted me was the complete opposite. First of all, the buildings were beautiful. There were gardens outside too, where you can have snacks or lunch in peace. The flowers were amazing, and they make good pictures!The artworks they displayed there were great, too. I especially love the furniture and architecture section, they're amazing! The paintings were well-chosen too. I recognized a lot of well-known artists' works displayed there.Parking is plenty, so don't worry about that. However, to get from the parking lot to the museum, we have to go on a tram which goes uphill. It gets kind of scary, especially since I am afraid of heights, but I have to admit that the view was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenalim
50,A must-visit center in LA.,"Do not leave LA without visiting the Getty. It's free, just pay $15 for parking(to be paid when you get back to your car).The architecture, the sceneries, the sculptures, paintings, murals & just EVERYTHING is amazing!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
50,"Spend an hour, or a day","There is so much to see and do here, it can take you all day. That said, if you are on a time budget, you can see a lot in an hour. Make sure to visit the gardens, the impressionist galleries to see Van Gogh's Irisis and just be amazed by the building itself. If time allows take a tour, or three. I love everything about this place. Quick tip - try to schedule both the Getty Center and Villa in the same day as you can pay one parking fee that covers both attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWtraveler213
50,How can I possibly add to what's been said? A Global Gem.,"The Getty architecture, gardens and views are itself worth the visit. Then there is the amazing collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mobile809236
50,Beautiful building and views,"The out door gardens are lovely and the views of the city are spectacular. The shape and style of the different buildings is unique. The buildings do have art displayed, but I thought exploring the buildings and the gardens was more interesting than the actual art exhibits inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38lizw
50,Great vistas and gardens in addition to great art!,The physical site in breathtaking and one could spend a day exploring here. There are snacking places and resting places throughout the courtyards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149christineb
40,Architectural Wonder And A Million Dollar View,"We visited this attraction during the last week of February 2015.I highly recommend that you arrive early. We left in time to be there as it was opening so that we could have the time to photograph the gardens without many people in the way. I am so glad that we did arrive early and upon opening, as it gets VERY crowded very fast. The main attendees that we saw were busloads of school children, all ages covered from the tiny tots to high school age.Their attendance is commendable by their schools but I will say that if you want to be able to view the art in silence and contemplation that you have pretty much lost your chance after about 11:00 in the morning. Once the ""children"" arrive there is basically a new level of noise, that I found distracting.Since we visited in late February the gardens were lacking in bloom, and since there has been a water shortage in California not all of the water features were turned on.The views from the outside decks are quite amazing, although it was a fairly smoggy day we were still able to see quite a ways and even with the smog it was impressive.There isn't a charge to enter the museum, only 15$ for parking. The tram ride up the hill is fun.We didn't eat here but there is a café located on premise.The art housed within is remarkable and the modern architecture is fascinating.I highly recommend a visit... early in the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camrachic
50,Getty Centre Art Museum Los Angeles,You will not be disappointed! Wonderful art exhibitions in a beautifully designed building amongst the amazing gardens. You can catch a bus from Westwood LA there. Then take a short light rail journey up the hill to the Getty Centre where you can enjoy the view of LA from various perspectives. Go to the counter for a free hire of a device which provides interesting information about the exhibits. Wander down to the amazing gardens. Plan to spend a few hours there. It was one of my favourite places to visit and I would definitely go back again if ever in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhonny59
50,"Fabulous location, specacular views, but not so fabulous art.","We visited the Getty Center for the Whistler exhibit which was quite good. So was their WW I exhibition which was especially informative.Unfortunately, I can say the same for their permanent collection. It's rather mundane to what you see in the Malibu Getty Villa which has a wonderful display of Greco/Roman art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724JimB724

40,Beautiful architecture,The museum is beautiful with an amazing view over LA. The collection is nice but we have seen better private collections: the Phillips and the Barnes come to mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidBS54
50,World Class in Everything,"The Getty Center is incontrovertibly stunning. The setting is incomparable with vistas of the city, hills and ocean. The architecture and alignment of the buildings matches the superior location. The garden is a living and gorgeous work of art.And that is before you even get to the art itself. It is well displayed in a number of galleries. The priceless collection has pieces that can match any museum in the world. The rotating exhibits are outstanding. The scattered sculptures surprise you at every turn.The personnel and volunteers are friendly, helpful and informative. The introductory movie provides a succinct overview of the history and layout of the Center. The free IPod audio tours were comprehensive and add a special dimension to the visit.If there are any ""must see"" sights in LA, this tops the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Knyte7
50,Lovely Balance,"Loved being able to study art in a gallery, and then step outside to the open areas and gardens to enjoy the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PipperDog
50,Breathtaking,"There is no museum quite like it. The Getty is a destination just on its own. The sheer travertine walls of the buildings soar into the sky. You feel uplifted just stepping off the tram. Go to the higher levels- the ocean views are beautiful. The garden adds to the experience and they have made inviting grassy spots for people to enjoy just being. One young man rolled down the hill. By his report- rolling down hills- yes- does STILL make you dizzy.We had such a short visit that we didn't give the art the attention it deserves, We will be back!Pick a sunny day. Be lazy, take your time, explore and experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irises_and_oceans

50,"Beautiful art, beautiful vistas","Toured this impressive facility on a hill high above Brentwood. Varied art collection displayed in some beautiful buildings. We were lucky enough to see the excellent J.M.W. Turner exhibit. Also, check out the photography gallery. Like all art museums, it is a bit of a labyrinth. And to my mind, the LACMA has a better collection -- but you can't beat the views from the Getty, or the price (you pay only for parking.) Just off the I-405 North.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeFormaggio
50,Impressive,"The architecture is stunning! Almost the best part of it. Set against the view over LA and the ocean it is quite exhilarating. Saw the Turner exhibition which was good - and pale for the most part. A little disappointed with the photography section but liked the Impressionistic exhibition. Much more to see but that was all we had time for.Liked the approach by ""train"" and simple ticketing. The restaurant looked inviting and the gardens, too. Set aside more than 3 hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indgang
40,Well worth a trip!,"As I see it, the architecture is better than the collection. Even on the Turner Exhibits you couldn't find the best of Turner's work and yet, this wouldn't mean to say that coming here is a bad choice on the contrary, the compound, the view are fantastic. Besides the colletion inside, you'd have a pleasant time around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonfung888
50,A Unique Architectural Experience,"On the outset, I must be honest that we spent a day here expecting to explore the exhibits but only visited a couple. The architecture is so stunning, especially if you take your time and experience it from different perspectives and look for the different uses of space. There are some wonderful intimate spaces that are easily over looked, but wonderful. How the views are framed and play with the landscape is stunning. We spent most of our time exploring and experiencing the outside architecture. The couple of exhibits we saw were nice but the real thrill was the architecture -- which totally surprised us. Plan on spending a day and get there early. The parking is great - so no worries. We plan on coming back but will allow for more time so we can actually see more exhibits. It really is iconic and so west coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonL949
50,What a Wonderful Experience!,"We went to the Getty Center for the first time. Easy to get to. Easy to park, and free except for the parking, which is $15.00. Took the tram up to the Museum to start our adventure. We bought a quick lunch, but you could easily bring a bag lunch. We're not art experts, but certainly recognized the prominent artists and the more famous works. It is also easy to appreciate the lesser known representations of period art history. The views over the city and of the pacific are spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
50,Above it all!,The Getty Center has been one of my favorite places to go anywhere. As you ride the tram up the mountain and see the world below you know you are in for a treat. They always have the most interesting exhibits which are beautifully mounted. Their collections are certainly worth the visit. The only charge is $15 for parking. I will be back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
30,Stunning view - average collection,The view from the Getty Center is truly magical and beautiful. The permanent collection is somewhat average. More fun just spending time on the grounds getting away from the hub bub of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DANCEshow
50,One-of-a-Kind Museum.,Worth a visit in West LA just for the incredible architecture. The grounds are big enough so that it never seems crowded. Great exhibitions as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeTheHighRoad
40,"A must to see, both for its architecture, as well as expositions","Not far from town into hills, perhaps busy to wait for electric train...but then 15 min walk uphill brings you there as well. On clear day great views and very good paintings etc. well spread out, so regardsless of the many visitors we found it nowhere crowdy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolasHolland
50,Getty Center,"A trip to Los Angeles should include a visit to the Getty Center. Situated on the hills overlooking the city, the galleries offer such variety that the experience is somewhat like touring the Smithsonian. Lots of room avoided crowding and taking a stroll through the gardens added to the enjoyment. This is definitely one of the finest galleries in the United States.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770randyl
50,Beautiful & Majestic,"Even if you don't like art museums this place is a must do destination for your trip to LA. The views, the gardens, the beautiful architecture, the massive travertine (see their website for a video of how they built the Getty with the huge stones), and all the art! My only complaint was the manager at the main cafe was like the soup nazi - he was rude and forceful at 11:30 when the cafe was just opening. He had no business treating people like he did. I spoke with manager about it and he was very sorry and said he'd talk to this manager about his behavior. There are always a lot of eyes on you while pursuing the museum but everyone was friendly while watching you watch the art! We loved the gardens the most! Bring your walking shoes and just enjoy all the views!!! The actually museums are free to the public- just pay parking. Parking is $15 and if you go Wed-Sun you can get into the Getty Villa in Malibu for 1 price. BEWARE: Getty is close MONDAY!! Villa is closed Tuesday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparky8188
50,Not to be Missed,"What an amazing property, and it's free to get in.Parking was $15 but the museum and views of LA were incredible.The cafe has great food (lots of veges/fresh fish).

50,Wonderful place - even in the rain!,"The boss and I went back to the Getty, to see the Turner Exhibit. It's the first time we've been since the Getty first opened a while back. As a 'site' it's developed beautifully. The architecture, the planting, the exhibit areas and, of course, those fabulous views, have all melded together amazingly well. Top tip: GO EARLY TO AVOID THE TRAFFIC GETTING INTO THE PLACE!! Entry is free, but parking on site is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK

50,Fantastic facility,Grounds and the facility are great. Plan on spending some time out around the outside and looking through the sculpture garden. Restaurant requires reservation and the line at the snack bar was at least 10 minutes long. Take a snack or a picnic lunch instead although the food was good at the cafeteria. Long walk up the hill from the parking lot. I waited for the shuttle which took awhile but I was glad I waited when I saw how long the hike was knowing I would be on my feet most of the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miken655
50,Well worth a visit for gardens and art,"Visiting the Getty Center was one of the highlights of our 5 days in LA. The gardens were lovely, even though the area is experiencing a drought. The architecture isn't too approachable but magnificent all the same. There are plenty of photo op's for those so inclined. The galleries offer something for everyone with even a passing interest in art. The cafe was closed for the season but the restaurant offered excellent value, even though it's a bit pricey. We had about half a day and saw a fraction of what is there. We'd go back for a whole day another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetF42
50,Awesome,"Really enjoyable day, it lived up to the hype and my high expectations.

40,"Very nice, even on a rainy day.","I'm really glad I visited the Getty Center. it is free, but you have to pay to either park there or take a taxi. However, the service is exceptional. The desk staff, docents, and other tour guide are very interested in helping and educating you. Also, check out the web site before visiting. The Getty offers a variety of free tours. We did the artist highlights, garden, and architecture tour. Los Angeles is very fortunate to have this museuem. The architecture and landscape itself are works of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlington7175
50,Fascinating visit to the Getty Museum,"We loved this museum, we did not have enough time to truly explore the gardens and surroundings as we only had a half day, but were blown away by the sheer scale of the buildings, the magnificent architecture, not to mention the phenomenal art collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skincarejen
30,Really...,"I cant believe this place is ranked No.1 of things to do in LA.Spent almost two hours there and all I can say is ""that's two hours of my life I'll never get back""Staff are very formal and stuffy...need to learn how to smile and make patrons feel welcome.They acted more like security guards... learn how to SMILE!I wont be going back again...very disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paullj66
50,Could have stayed here a couple of days,"My family and I visited the Getty on a friends recommendation. Read the reviews on Trip Advisor prior to our visit, but no matter what the reviews say, it doesn't do it justice. Could have spent a couple of days here. Plenty of great works of art to see, amazing buildings, and beautiful gardens. The free audio guide is great tool that helps appreciate the spaces. Have been to other museums/gardens/architectural wonders, but this place has it all and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christian1023
50,World Class Attraction,"We throughly enjoyed our day perusing Monet, Van Gogh, Degas and so many more masters. The facility and its' location are beautiful. Besides looking on our own, we also took an architecture tour (around 50 minutes.) A garden tour was also offered, but we didn't have time. There was a special talk on Impressionists. It was limited to the first 30 people. So if this is something that interests you, check the daily guide for times and arrive at the designated area 15-20 minutes early.The museum and related attractions are free. Parking is $15. There is a tram from the parking lot to the Getty. If the line is long for the tram, you can walk (uphill....about 15 minutes) to the museum.We packed a picnic lunch to enjoy in the gardens. We were able to check our picnic bag at the coat check desk free of charge.Plan on a full day! There is so much to see and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cccruiser
50,A Monument to the Great Getty,Located in a excellent spot...overlooking the greater LA ..limited parking (which needs to be booked...) Well worth a visit the exhibitions & gardens are all very well appointed...& access for walking & wheelchairs excellent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802Lucy13
50,"""I didn't want to die being known as Mr.Moneybags""","My Uber (wish we had Uber in Melbourne) driver, Tony, said this was the first time he had a request to drop someone off at the Getty, which probably tells you a lot about the people who visit it. They are primarily visitors from out of town and probably mostly international. Which is a shame,as the Getty is a true Oasis from the LA traffic.I was in LA on business but had the afternoon off so I thought I would check out TA's #1 attraction and have lunch there. Glad I did!The food in the cafe was excellent and next time I will eat at the restaurant with my wife.I couldn't decide whether I liked the architecture being continually transported between ancient Egypt and the Art Deco period but in the end the fusion seems to work.The Getty is not the Louvre and I liked it that way. I could have stared at the Renoir and Monets they had on display forever. The Rembrandt took my breath away. If you are going in the next week, check out the hand of the tutor. It's like a HD photo and underlines the sheer genius of the Dutch artist.Everything is spotless and tidy and there is a feeling of professionalism in everything.If you are remotely interested in the Arts or have ever wondered what all the fuss is about go visit the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willemf615
50,"Plan for several hours, if not a day or two","What a visual gem! Not just the art, but the architecture and gardens too. Our visit was 3 hours and we were practically running through at the end. Take your time. Make a day of it. You can eat and relax when you are there. The free audio tour iPod they lend you (free) allows you to select from several tours. For example, one is just the highlights. That is what we did because of the limited time we had. I'll certainly be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DallasSeaOtter
50,Life is so easy here,"With children, no better place to experience culture and fun. They lend strollers for free, they have a kids' room, they have scavenger hunts and child friendly audio tours that are all free. Perfect place to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeDaughters
50,Great American institution,I visited the museum when it was in Malibu many many years ago. This one is so different. The display area is designed with the specific artwork in mind. The overall architecture from the color of the paving sandstone to the flow of the buildings to take advantage of the rolling hills are just spectacular. The cafeteria facing the Pacific Ocean with French window at sunset is a priceless experience. You will never feel the same when driving by 405 or even the mere mention of Los Angeles again. Plan to spend half day at least. I bet you'll be intrigued by the name Paul Getty after the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunjoe075
30,Overrated,"John Paul Getty was so cheap that he had a pay phone for guests installed in his London mansion, and that fundamental cheapness is reflected in the rather dreary art contained in many of the pavilions. Loved the gardens however, and what is being purchased now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Neat architecture!,"This was the first time we visited the Getty Center and we were impressed by the architecture of the place. The building structures were ultra modern with steel, concrete, with aluminum and travertine ""skin"".The gardens were also impressive as well! I particularly love the cactus garden but unfortunately one can only view from a ledge but can not go in. The central garden was also beautiful and have beautiful blooms throughout the year.I'm not much into the arts but there were plenty to view and study. The sweeping view of LA was very impressive especially on a clear day. It was smoggy when we were there so we couldn't look very far.Depending on how much you love art, expect to spend anywhere from 2-5 hours at the Getty Center. We spend about four hours there.The center is free to visitors but you'll have to pay $15 for parking in the six-story underground parking structure located next to the I-405 freeway. Go early for the best parking spots. They open at 10 am (closed on Mondays). Weekends are usually the busiest. You'll ride a tram up to the center. They do not allow tripods by the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainbowCowboy
40,got the stick out,"It took me a while to open up to it but the friendliness of the employee, quality of the rides was well worth the trip. I had more fun than my kids in here. the saying you get what you pay for definitely apply here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rommelc808
40,Very good art experience,The Getty Center offers a top-notch collection in art. Their collections on show change all the time and including all centuries and different kinds of art. Take your time to enjoy this great art museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainyTravelJunkie

50,Extraordinary place,"We visited twice as we were so impressed. The collection is to Getty's taste and may not please everyone (pity there was no American art to see) but the building is amazing and we had an excellent garden/architecture tour. Entry, the cloakroom, the tours, the guide ipod, are all free making this excellent value. Getting there is not simple unless you have a car ($15 parking). On our second trip we tried the restaurant which was really excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnottdavies
50,The Getty is beautiful and a very interesting place to visit.,The Getty Center house some of the most globally focused art and beautiful gardens.The cafe had something for everyone in a very relaxing dine in or outside atmosphere.An worthwhile experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynj590
50,Great use of space to show artwork,"I find the spaces are inspiring - allowing breathing room for art to be seen. Airy, beautiful, natural light and lovely garden architecture. It offers a great view when not inside, and the layout is thoughtful. There is a combination of feelings when you take the tram up the mountain, and are put into such beautiful rooms to gaze. I love the Getty. The previous Getty House had lovely historic offerings, but the art was crowded onto the walls. This is a beautiful place - lots of extra offerings from inside and outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artzgal
50,Great place to visit and free!,"Worth the drive off the beaten path. You pay $15 to park but the museum and grounds are free. Stunning views over LA to the ocean, beautiful art, nice lunch. We went Saturday morning when they opened at 10 AM - by the time we left around noon there was a huge line of cars waiting to get in so plan to arrive early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,LA Gem,Not to be missed by anyone visiting or living in LA. The museum itself stands as a work of art with fabulous vistas at every turn. The collection is vast with something for every visitor to enjoy. The docents are well informed. Don't miss the architectural tour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shallowbay
50,For Relaxation,"The grounds are beautiful. Much to see. Great art work. I found it very relaxing. Great place for photography. You have to may for parking ($10), which is a really good deal considering everything else is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJArzola
50,Five stars. Art in an elegant museum for free!,"The Getty doesn't need one more glowing review since it's the number one attraction in LA on trip advisor. But it's such a beautiful campus of buildings housing some extraordinary art that I had to chime in.The outside grounds are so meticulously well kept and the views of the city and the shore are amazing. The art is an eclectic mix of different periods and different art forms that there is something for everyone.One thing that I would strongly recommend is to pick up an ipod as you arrive at the front desk (of course, it's free). You need to leave an ID to borrow the device. There is a very user friendly app on the ipod. You enter the number attached to the piece of art you are interested in and a recorded message from the professional staff of the museum gives a one to two minute talk about the art. It's really well done, balancing just enough context and history of the art to give the viewer a more complete understanding of why and when the artist completed the work. Instead of just breezing through the galleries, stop at an occasional piece of art and learn a bit. It makes the experience at the Getty so much richer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bacchus711
50,Every visitor to LA should see this!,"I had previously been to LA a few times, but never had the time to take in the countless sites throughout the city. This is one of the crown jewels of LA.As I am an architecture buff with a preference toward a modern aesthetic, this was a treasure to explore. While the various exhibitions were amazing, the buildings were mesmerizing. I spent an entire afternoon touring every nook and cranny that wasn't off-limits to me. This is a very relaxing and mellow atmosphere in the midst of a crazy and eclectic city, with classical music playing in the background and people smiling at one another.Admission was free after paying $15 to park, and a quiet electric tram takes you to the top. The view of the city is worth the fee alone. The restaurant and food carts had delicious offerings, and not really as pricey as I expected.It will not be my last visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert802
50,Philanthropy at its best,"Beautiful architecture, wonderful open vistas and exhibits that are neither high nor low brow but informative and helpful. Universally friendly staff (even as they prevented me from taking a photo of one of Kodelka's beautiful gypsy photos). The cafe has wholesome and inexpensive food. This time, the entire space felt like a Zapotec/Mixtec village crowded with kids, men, women pushing strollers. Behind me in, French and Australian couples. I imagine this is precisely what the museum was intended for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaioatey
50,"A ""must see"" in LA","Go early becaue it gets very busy. The museum and gardens are free but you pay $10 for parking (a deal in LA). There are several buildings of amazing art. We wandered the gardens, enjoyed the ocean and city views and dined outside at the casual cafe. We were there on Valentines Day and I saw other people bring their own lunch and picnic on the grounds. This is a beautifyl place to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliesmomTexas

Starting from the train, breathtakingly moving you up the hill, and the fly of steps with the sculptures, and the beautiful garden with the flowers matching the time of year, and the possibility to observe the Mountains, sometimes covered with the snow, and the Ocean, glistering under the sun - dream.I take all my guests from other places to the Center,after visit they all were very impressed. And when I ask my granddaughters, starting from the age of four and now, they are teenagers now, where to spend our so rear free weekend - Getty Center!!!

For the price of parking, you get free access to the museum minus any special exhibits - but check out what exhibit is on because it may be worth the extra.

The view of the Los Angeles valley is amazing. Just relax, let your worries go and enjoy. The exhibits can be taken in slowly or enjoyed at a comfortable pace, stopping at will.

50,A Must See - Beautiful views - and it's Free!,"We went to see the Getty because we had heard amazing things about its views, and much more worth it if we wanted to check out some art in LA. If you want to get some culture, and still want to enjoy being outside and just being in LA in general, this is the place you should visit.We didn't do to the LACMA because we wanted to be outdoors. The Getty is up the mountain and when you arrive you can either walk up 15 minutes, (which was not bad at all) or take a tram up. We arrived early in the morning, around 10 a.m. when it opened so the line for the tram was going to be as long as the walk. We spent a good 3.5 hours just taking our time, taking in the lovely views of LA from the top, seeing all the gardens, appreciating the architecture that was the Getty, and popping in and out of the exhibits to cool off. The art was lovely, the art pieces weren't of any particular note to me. But the point was just to try and see some of its collections while basking in the sun.The museum is totally free, so why not? Tons of lovely picture opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846michellet

20,"Nice museum, bad staff","The museum is full of nice art, large selection of different styles, from Renaissance to Impressionists to World War I exhibits, there's everything, for educational purposes or just to browse. It's free, a nice location, gorgeous views over the city if there isn't any smog, nice outdoor area, decent food but the staff were horrible. They couldn't point us in the right direction, motioned instead of talking to us because they assumed we couldn't speak english, told us to step away even though there were people way closer than us to the works, etc. On top of this, never EVER go to the exhibits during the week. You may think that it'll be empty and all but it's full of young children on class trips. One woman sat her class down in the middle of the hall, which blocked off our view for certain paintings and then when we were looking at a painting and talking about it while her class was screaming, told us to be quiet because she was 'teaching'. She was letting them scream in the museum, and had the nerve to tell us to shut up. Because of these groups, who also blocked the lines for food, I will never go the Getty in the school week. The museum is ok, there's a Van Gogh, a Redon, a few works by Degas and a few pieces by Monet, a Sargent (full sized), but apart from the Impressionists, there really isn't too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophief384

I was a little disappointed that most of the artwork was recreations or scaled down models of the originals. But there were a few original things in there and they were my favorite parts. The staff there is really hardcore on making sure you don't use flash photography. And the food was way overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamvanderwood

50,"Must see, great value!","I have lived in LA for more than 10 years and The Getty is definitely a highlight for our out of town guests. Interesting modern architecture, beautifully landscaped and perched on a ridge with a commanding view of the Westside. Exhibits are often fascinating and change every 3 months or so. One of the best parts is that admission is free, although parking is around $20. Excellent value, especially in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phil_from_LA
50,Great views west to the ocean.,"It is a very grand structure with interesting gardens, the outside of the museum has enough to see for about 2 hours, and there is a café for coffee or snacks. Inside the art is very taste specific so it would be best to check online to see what is on exhibit, (once you've seen one 18th century French arm chair you've seen them all). You might find the Getty Villa, which is actually on the coast in Malibu, more interesting especially if you have children 10+ years old with you (there is a real mummy there). Reservations are a must at both, there is a parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fromaroundhere
50,Love the Getty Center,"The art, the architecture, the garden and the view of Los Angeles. This is one trip well worth it. It is free to get in but you do have to pay for parking $20. They do have a discounted rate if you arrive after 5 PM on Saturday for $5. Still well worth the price of the $20 for parking. One could easily spend all day there. There are places to have lunch, a little on the expensive side. The exhibits change often so if you find something you are interested in, try to make it before it is gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalien5561
40,Go and Hang Out,"The permanent collection is at best so-so (the Getty Villa is much better in that respect) and, from a distance, the architecture is not inspiring. Up close, though, the buildings provide a wonderful frame for the courtyard and plaza spaces. To really enjoy this museum, plan to spend 3 or 4 hours, including lunch or dinner at the restaurant, one or two coffee breaks and a stroll around the grounds. In between, take an hour to browse the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdh44laca

50,"Great day of art, gardens and food!","The peaceful tram ride up the green hillside sets the tone for the rest of your day: prepare to meander among all things beautiful! The architecture of the museum complex is clean and modern, the treetop views of LA are spectacular, the gardens are great for a walk or relaxing on a bench and, of course, the art collections are tremendous! Take a look at the brochure before starting out as there's a LOT to see. Each building has several floors of works of art categorized by century/centuries... it's actually kind of mind boggling how much there is! We took the stairs all day to get in some cardio, but of course there are elevators too. Among other things, one of my favorite Sargent portraits is here, and I found the illuminated manuscripts room fascinating, there's Van Gogh, and Renoir - just fabulous! You'll have worked up an appetite after all that art - there's a sandwich cart and outdoor tables, but we always go to the restaurant. In addition to grab-and-go, they have several stations of cooked-to-order hot foods and it is always delicious. And since the museum is free, it doesn't bother me to pay $15 for parking. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puffdotty

40,visit to Getty (no not Estelle),"Visited twice. it's free but you pay for parking. I went when it first opened and they had a shuttle to bring you from distant parking lots. Art collection typical for Los Angeles (pretty good) but the plus is you have nice views of the LA area, and interesting architecture and gardens as well. The food in the café is decent. 2nd visit went with family to see a special exhibit and the family member found it worth the visit. Again was treated to great views and gardens to appreciate. It's worth it to visit, remember the admission is free, it's the parking you pay for, last I checked it was $5. I guess if you could finagle it, you could hike or take the public bus (I think it's $1:50) so conceivably you could make your entire visit free or very low cost. Plus you also have the gardens and the view and decent food (dunno if they have prohibitions about bringing your own ala picnic style). Be aware that unless you want to do a moderate hike, you'll probably want to take the free(?) monorail tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surprisedtraveler

While not the best collection of art (Norton Simon, Huntington, LACMA, and the soon to be opened Broad are probably better), the architecture, the location and the grounds are not to be missed. And, it's all free! (except a reasonable $15 parking charge). We have been to the Getty countless times; we take every out of town visitor to see it and it has never disappointed. Make sure to walk through the lower gardens; beautiful and amazingly graceful. Also be sure to walk outside on the high terraces where you can see the ocean, downtown and father south than LAX all at once. On a clear day, the view is magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FriedomTrail
50,Getty with a View,The Getty does not only have one of the best pre 20th Century collection of art in the world but the facility has one of the finest views in the world.

30,"Beautiful Building, Limited Collection","We went to the Getty last week to see the special photography exhibit which was beautiful and then saw the later European art which was beautiful but very small. Alas, compared with other major museums, when it comes to late 19th/ early 20th century are, the Getty has a few nice things but cannot compare. The setting and especially the garden was lovely on a totally cler day when we couls see Catalina island. My friends from Michigan were delighted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj

50,Getty Center,The Getty Center is by far the most impressive example of late modern architecture in Los Angeles and on good days has the most impressive view of any museum to which I have ever been. The gardens are a delight and any travelling exhibit is well worth attending. Sadly the permanent collection is somewhat ordinary and is sad that say the Norton Simon and the Getty were not combined collections. For an adult visitor I would still consider this a Disneyland for adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davidh1900

30,Not worth the reputation,"Everyone has undoubtedly heard the Getty reputation as an art museum. I have not yet been to the Malibu location; but have been to the Los Angeles location many times. First this review comes with a caveat: if you are looking for a nice place to view Los Angeles, and a pretty location with nice gardens...this is definitely worth the trip.....plus its free!As to art--they do a nice job in the children's museum; but if you are a true art lover than there are many better places to see the masters. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Chicago Art Institute have far better paintings on display. At the best, the Getty will offer one or two pieces by a given master, although I do not like the way they are displayed. Another caveat: if you are at all interested in illuminated manuscripts and medieval art, then this exhibit is definitely the best I've seen outside of the Metropolitan in New York.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeE606

The bonus is the amazing grounds and gardens, perfect for a picnic, and the even more awesome views (you can see all the way to Santa Monica pier and beyond on a clear day). It is a gem of an escape from the city and great place to spend an afternoon! They have a cafe where you can buy food, but better to take a picnic and sit somewhere on grounds and enjoy.Note: admission is free but parking is $15 ($10 after 5pm) (It keeps going up which is the one negative that I would note)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NyShaw

The views of LA from the museum are incredible. There is so much to see so I would pick a few favorite areas before hand. I also recommend one of the free tours. If you are interested in horticulture the garden tour is nice and the architecture tour is very informative too. I would try to go on at least one. After a day of enjoying the museum I also recommend having dinner at around sunset in the restaurant. It has never disappointed. Food and ambiance wonderful.

50,Not just the art,"The Getty Center is a great day out on many levels. The art is, frankly, only part of the attraction. The architecture is stunning, as are the gardens. The view across much of the LA basin is one of the best to be had in the whole area. I would recommend going only when the weather is clear. In LA that is usually not a problem, but on one of those May or June days when the ""marine layer"" (LA-speak for fog) blankets the west side, you would miss out on a spectacular vista. So wait until it clears, around midday. The Getty Center also has a very fine restaurant, open for lunch and dinner. And, by the way, it has some great art. A visit is free (except for parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNPSHP
50,Has it all and it's central,"Feel the parking charge is well worth the cost of a family visit. There's some art and beautiful grounds - you decide on the ratio.

As they got older we spent more and more time with inside with art.One of our favorite low key activities and close to so many other visitor activities - Santa Monica, the beach, Beverly Hills, HollywoodThe cost of food is relatively expensive at the museum, so if you're on a budget, bring your own or make sure to augment on-site purchases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelwKids4

It is actually a small collection, but it is organized and displayed in such a pleasant and natural way that it invites you to stay and relax. The architecture and gardens add to the experience.

50,"Great art, spectacular view.","When I encourage tourists to drive from Hollywood to the beach via Sunset Boulevard, I will also encourage them to stop at the Getty Center if they have the time. Their collection is impressive and their exhibitions often compelling, but the view trumps everything.

At this point it feels like paying to get into a park because honestly the only thing I'm doing when I get up there is wandering the grounds. So, on a beautiful day, worth the ""price of admission."" On a grey day with limited visibility, not so much.Unfortunately, the art collection leaves something to be desired and I would much rather visit any number of other museums, including the Getty Villa, than trek up to the Getty Center purely for the love of art.

You have to wait in a queue to get up the tram unless you want to walk up the hill and I'm gonna help you out here - YOU DO NOT WANT TO WALK UP THE HILL. There is so much walking once you get there, don't tire yourself at the start.I saw people with blankets laying on the grass and I think I'll try that next time. The weather was perfect.

30,Just okay...,"I have always heard the Getty Center was a must do spot when visiting L.A., but I found the Getty Villa to be more impressive. After battling traffic and having a difficult time locating the place based on my GPS directions, I arrived stressed out. For some reason the GPS doesn’t bring you to the entrance you need to go through. Anyway, the museum is free. However, you will need to pay $15 for parking (basically the only option unless you get dropped off) in the attached garage. Take the elevator up to the main level and hop on a monorail, which takes you to the museum site. The ride there was quick and overlooks LA traffic. Many rave about the architecture and various art work within the museum. However, I found most of it to be a bore. The gardens were nice and the area is good for walking, but beyond that I wasn’t very impressed. The Getty Villa offered so much more in terms of scenic views and unique art. The photography angles were amazing at the Getty Villa. Overall, I just thought it was okay and something I can say I did while visiting L.A., but if I had to choose between the Getty Center or Villa….I would definitely do the Villa! We were done in about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4GTravels

30,Nice place to wander,The place is a sprawling center of art and the architecture is amazing. The art museum imo is very nice but not world class. They do try and there are some amazing pieces here but not many unfortunately. The garden is also a bit overrated as it is quite small. The interesting thing about the garden is the maze-like structure as you wander down to the falls. Unfortunately you need to traverse the maze to get out again. All in all an OK place to spend an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tajkd

50,The Amazing Getty,"I have been to the Getty from the UK 4 times, 3 with my students and once with my family. I have to say it is just a great place to visit with kids. My two loved it, the gardens and the views are simply awesome. The fact you only have to pay for parking (and that's cheep) seems unreal.My only reservation is the tram. You have got to be very quick to all get on together. My two kids (both under ten) bounded on before us, and when we got to the doors they closed and the train took off. This was pretty scary and the staff were not as supportive as one would have hoped. Rather than offering to drive us to meet the train at the bottom, we had to wait for the next one. It was as very tense 15 mins or so. Luckily a family on the tram noticed what had happened and waited with my two children. My tip, all get on together quickly and at seperate doors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773garretf

Check the calendar to take advantage of special exhibits, talks, and programs. Arrive early for the full experience, starting with the wonderful orientation film. Try to fit in a docent tour or two. Great food with lots of choices available in the cafeteria style dining room. The restaurant is quite wonderful -- perfect for celebrating a birthday or anniversary. Fabulous views abound. Make time for a walk through the garden and to just relax and take in the scenery.The Getty Center is perfect for everyone --singles, couples, families. Bring sunglasses and hat on a sunny day. Wear layers in case the wind picks up.No charge to visit the museum but parking is a steep $15 per car. Be sure to take note of where you are parked and the color of that level.

Such a great example of giving back to your community.There are numerous exhibitions ranging from impressionist paintings to modern photography as well as beautiful gardens and great views over the city to the sea (if the smog clears).Another highlight was catching the bus after. I can't remember the bus number but we were catching the bus towards Santa Monica (a connection was required) and the bus takes you around UCLA and Bel Air which was great to see also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngDav99

The parking is $15 and you ride a free shuttle to the museum from the parking garage. The museum itself if totally free. They frequently change their special exhibits so there is always something new to see. We took a Focus Tour which taught us about Impressionist painters and the Architectural Tour which was outside and taught us a lot about the modern white walls and glass. There are many volunteers and they are so eager to answer your questions. We had a lovely lunch at their restaurant, which is very trendy.

Well worth a visit :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atheoretical
40,A Great Location & Stunning Architecture,"This is a beautiful spot with great views, lush gardens and creative architecture. The museum's collections are good but secondary to location. Special exhibitions can be outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathand666
50,"Terrific art, a Rubens exhibit","There are two Getty Museums, one off Sunset Boulevard near the Freeway I-10; the other is in Malibu. Entrance is free, parking is $15.00. Go to both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdE921
50,Lovely Museum and Outdoor Space,"Great place to view whatever type of art you love and enjoy a great view. Love to walk in the gardens around the azalia maze and under the bouganvilla tree pergolas. Fountains, gorgeous building and oh yeah, fab art too! Always worth a trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacqB
50,"A great museum, but also a phenomenal outdoor environment","The best part about the Getty, aside from stunning views over the Los Angeles metro, is the incredible variety of exterior spaces at the facility. Lots of lovely niches, and quiet spots to ponder the view or the art, but also plenty of interesting busy places for kids to play or for a picnic lunch. The architecture is actually secondary to the site, but it's definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pigeonherder
50,A Days Entertainment,"This is a great place if you are on a budget, like museums, art, WWI, outdoor gardens or just like great views. You only pay $15 for parking an everything else is free including the sound devices when you visit the galleries. We did the WWI and the top floor paintings and we spent almost 4 hours. This was only a small part of the center. You could spend a whole day if not more visiting. It was a cloudy day so we could not see the best view, but it is high on the hill so a sunny day would be the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yan81
50,Outstanding collection,Loved everything about this place. It is perched high atop a hill. everything is free for visitors. The tram takes you there and the entrance is free. We took a audio guide and were amazed at the extensive collection of grand masters and other European artists. The architecture of the center is extremely modern with stunning 360 degree view from the top. Visit to this place is highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Priya_T
50,A must see,We enjoyed this experience so much. I easy drive and worth the drive. $15 for parking and the rest is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920annmarieg
50,"Culture, Decadent,VIEWS!","Love this place! Great for picnics, has a 5 star restaurant in my book, VIEWS! VIEWS! & VIEWS! With great showcase of art & culture! A MUST go to in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilg463
50,Fantastic Fun Day,The Getty Center has several different types of museums. The lawn or gardens are beautiful. The views are spectacular and the museums a joy to walk through and see the paintings and sculptures. You take a tram from the parking lot which was a fun start in itself. There is quite a bit of walking so wear comfortable shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debtaylor
50,worth it for the architecture,"Of course the art is a draw. But we spent most of the day outside enjoying the gardens, views and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corgi22
30,a place for the arts-inclined,"the getty centre is located on a hill top with awesome views of LA city and it's surroundings. the exhibit weren't really fascinating for me as I'm more of a nature lover, but my brother who's a teacher found it really enriching. I spent the time rather exploring the views around the centre and it was pretty nice as well. it's free admission to the exhibits. best save half a day if you intend to go through all of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benkoh
50,Don't skip the architectural tour!,"The Getty has fabulous art, interesting special exhibits, an amazing view, and is itself a fascinating story. On our third visit we started with the architectural tour. The docent was knowledgeable and the tour well worth the time. We loved learning about the history of the buildings and the insights to the architect's plan. We left discovering the feathers and leaves in the stones, and the architect's playful use of special stones and variation. We were also moved by the special exhibits of Giving in the Middle Ages and the Images of World War I. The Getty has so much to offer that it is easy to visit it over and over!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beersnobs
50,My favorite,"We come here often and have many favorites but the new exhibits are always amazing. The current exhibit in the photography wing is stunning and so is the War in Art, Art in War.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JV2006
40,Get to The Getty,"The Getty Centre in the Los Angeles area is a great cultural, artworks, museum centre worth the visit. If you are staying in LA you can take a ouple of buses (public transport type) to get there and the trip through Hollywood mansions, etc. and the scenery along the way adds to the day's outing. Greeted by the on sight monorail/train to the entry there is plenty to explore once you are there. There is also a very nice restaurant where we enjoyed a delicious lunch and there are several other 'food' options as well. The views, apart from the exhibitions, are also stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PGK12014
50,Do a Docent Tour!,"Amazing, captivating and all for FREE! Just pay the $15 for parking and your entire party gets in for free. If you want, you can find on-street parking - it will be quite a stroll to get there but it can be done. I used to live in West Hollywood and we would park about 1.5 miles away and enjoy the stroll.I do not mind paying the $15 for parking it goes to a good place with fabulous views, wonderful docent tours of the architecture, garden, etc! Do yourself a favor and do at least one! I have learned so much on them and docents are so wonderful, friendly and have so much to share.The artwork here has some pieces that stay and others that switch out about every 4 or so months so check the schedule.The Getty Villa is separate and you need to make a reservation - that is spectacular as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyK263
50,Amazing place!,"Amazing place if you like art, and if you don't! It has everything: beautiful gardens, beautiful views, beautiful architecture!!! And good food...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lu_Mankel
50,Spectacular,Loved The Getty. Free admission and many free tours depending on your interests. Spectacular view of LA. Would like to visit on a Saturday to see the sunset. We only had an afternoon so decided to rent a car to visit as public transportation there can take a while from LAX. Definetly worth the trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baxtersmom46
50,What an amazing place!,"What an amazing place! Friendly staff, amazing pieces of art to see! They even offer wheelchairs and assistance if needed! We only had a couple of hours to spend there but we will definitely return in the future and hopefully will be able to spend the entire day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieH384
50,Worth a Visit,"The Getty Center is one of the most unique museums in the world. It's worth a visit just to admire and enjoy the airy contemporary architecture of the entire facility and the gardens set on a high hill, along with the panoramic views of the city below and beyond --- all of which are stunning. Exhibits consist of permanent collections drawn from J. Paul Getty's (and his estate's) personal and eclectic treasures. Special exhibits are drawn from other museums and collections, or organized specifically for and by the Getty. All exhibits are exceptional in terms of quality and in the way they are presented and explained. There's a wonderful full-service restaurant (along with less expensive venues) at the Center, that provides a real treat to anyone visiting, especially for guests coming in from out of town. I have visited the Getty Center many times, and am always impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
50,A true gem.,A great outing! Only cost was for parking otherwise it's free! Lovely setting with great views and places to sit and eat either own brought in food or from their restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonmb2014
40,Leisurely stroll around museum,It was very quite when we arrived on a Tuesday afternoon . I expect it is much busier in the mornings . I thought it was lovely and clean and we'll organised . I found a couple of the exhibits a bit odd I didn't understand the photos and there wasn't enough commentary on them. I also found the WW1 exhibit diisappointing. It is worth a visit and as it is free entry apart from 15 dollars to park it is very good value. I liked that you could get so close to the paintings without any barriers .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieB383
30,Don't Touch,"The Getty Center is on a hilltop accessible by a tram. Great view. The children will enjoy the tram ride. I wouldn't call the museum gorgeous or wonderful. The building complex certainly has an attitude. It is boxy and ""heavy"" in feel. In a word ""overwhelming"". The exhibits housed in the many buildings are extensive but as displayed don't excite. The outside garden is interesting but if you have children with you you may have a problem. Other than one so so exhibit that is interactive for children the rest is quite a bore. Don't touch signs abound. On a hot summer day you can certainly find a better venue to keep your children entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul_nancy1
50,An amazing place to visit,"This museum is set in the best location in LA, up the side of a mountain. The views over LA were fantastic. Although it costs $US10 to park, the entry to the centre itself is free and it includes a tram ride up to the centre and back again. Not only are the exhibits amazing but the building and gardens are excellent as well. We ended up having to come back a second time because the 3 hours on the first day was about 3 hours too short! An added bonus is that if you get your parking voucher validated you can use it for parking at the Getty Villa as long as it is on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amsfromaus
50,Gorgeous LA museum,Great architecture and gardens - parking is $15 but free for the first 90 minutes. The views of LA are amazing! Free admission makes the price right!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmbeekay
50,Wonderful,This is a must visit place ... It is so interesting and beautiful with loads of things to see. You can walk in the grounds then visit the villa with all artifax on show there is a on site restaurant so as you can sit and take a break i really enjoyed my day here highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tropsie
50,A great museum and a fittingly great gourmet restaurant on site,The Getty museum in LA is a wonder in itself with its unusual building and certainly even more unusual collections on exhibit. The real surprise was to discover on the outside level one of the most interesting and gourmet restaurants in that area. Pleasure at all points of this visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayneg82
50,If you only see 1 thing in LA this is it,"This was my second trip to the Getty Centre and it did not disappoint. The anticipation builds as you enter the monorail that transports you up the hill. Then the brilliance of the architecture combined with a perfect location on the hills over looking the smoggy LA slaps you in the face and you think WOW. The works of art are spectacular and the reason many of us go but for some it is about having a beautiful space for families to gather and watch the little ones running, smiling and enjoying the gardens. This time we ate in the restaurant and whilst the wait staff were a bit pretentious it did not ruin our experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birt1964
50,Superb,"A really impressive complex, with so much to see it's impossible to even begin covering it in one day. Great views of LA as well, thoroughly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peter102110
50,Best views in LA,"Spend the day here, you won't regret it. The views are spectacular, the art is renowned, the gardens and architecture are amazing. You have a choice of a cafeteria or restaurant and you can't go wrong with either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73erikaf
50,Incredible,"A perfect place to spend the day. The gardens, grounds and architecture may even surpass the art collection. There is always some new wonderful exhibit to see. Views of LA are fantastic and the cafeteria has the best museum food I have ever eaten (except maybe the Getty Villa in Malibu which is also worth a visit).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241micheller
50,just beautiful,"The Getty buildings are peaceful and serene sitting atop the hills and highway. Even taking the tram from the parking lot to the museums sets the tone with the views. The exhibits are beautiful and interesting, but I just enjoyed the gardens and buildings. I went at the end of the day so not so crowded, parking fee, entrance free. Have not been to the Getty Villas yet but that is next on the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjk_39
40,Very Good,"Interesting stuff and has a great view on Los Angeles. From getting there (by train if I remember well) and exploring this odd but original museum"" was a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JiaMTL
30,Nice garden,You will be charged a $15 parking fee but no admission cost. The garden is very pretty but the museum is average. There are better museums display elsewhere. This is somewhere you would want to visit if you have nothing else to do. Lots of school children attending as their field trips though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Decocrafts
50,getty center los angeles,"overwhelming. we were there for only 4 hours and I feel it will take at least 2 more visits of 4 hours to just get a cursory feel for the getty center.why 3 visits recommended?you can only take in so much at a time. museum fatigue. this first visit primarily included the architecture. a single vocabulary played in a full symphony with every variation possible. very little contrast but the views over LA from this hilltop provide some restpite.I have to say that the size of the complex really helps with the size of the crowds. you can find isolated spots even with the large numbers of visitors.I would rate this, and gehrey's concert hall as top places to visit in LA.interestingly both buildings went thru very long design processes for various reasons, earlier schemes were thrown out and I believe that very much helped the quality of design.keep in mind that both projects had unlimited budgets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rednet16
50,Awesome place,It is amazing that this lovely place is FREE! Parking is about $15 but well worth it! Visitors go up on a tram car and see great views on the way. The only problem with this place is there is so much to see! Plan on bringing a picnic lunch and taking your time. We thought an afternoon was enough time! Wrong. We saw the gardens and one building! Staff were very friendly and got a wheelchair for a guest with me when he discovered it was just too much walking! The place was crowded but not so much that you could not enjoy the time. Plan to go back again when in the area. Definitely recommend for all to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181robertad
50,A wonderful place to visit,"Do allow yourself time when planning to visit. It could easily be a 4-5 hrs experience. Besides the wonderful art collections they have indoors, the grounds are gorgeous and filled with fabulous sculptures. You can enjoy lunch at the terrace café. They seem to have more healthy choices or choose to picnic and enjoy the views of Los Angeles. The formal restaurant is really good too,Kids will also enjoy visiting, there are special activities to keep them interested and occupied. Plus they would love the opportunity to run outside too, not just being stuffed in a museum. It will make them want to learn. My 7yr old loves coming to the Getty. Check the website for special events too. They offer a lot of concerts and talks. Wonderful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freemaee
50,Excellent art museum,"Huge, multi-building art museum. We only had time to take in the additional (rotating) exhibits - never got to the permanent collection. Be advised, that while the museum if ""free"" you must park in the garage for $15. You then take the tram to the museum plaza. There are a lot of steps to get around the complex, but elevators are available everywhere there are steps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colorado_kid2
40,Great view of LA,"During a few days in LA we went to the Getty Center for a few hours. To be honest most for the absolutely great view and not that much the art work.The tram shuttle runs quickly in succession, the view is magnificent. The food is great-all in all a great experienceThe entrance is free but requires car parking fee of $15-first hour is free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poul_Duerr_Pedersen
50,Fantastic!! Free entry but pay parking.,"My wife and I just decided to go on a whim when we were on vacation in socal. We were blown away by the beautiful grounds and stunning views of LA! We are not art / museum types but we are so glad we went to the getty. Entry is free but parking was $15. that being said the getty would be worth twice that fee! With the fine art and the fantastic grounds to walk we could have spent all day here but did not have time since we got there a little late. you must see this place, you will not be let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAGNUM2005
50,Lovely,"The Getty Center is such a beautiful area in Los Angeles. It's a bit out of the way, but I think you should still try your best to get there. First of all, the parking is $15, but the admission is free. Secondly, there's so much art, you can't see all of it in one day. There's also a wonderful view of Los Angeles and its smog. I recommend visiting EARLY, because it gets crowded every day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114austinb
50,A MUST SEE,"I had to visit the Getty Centre and you do too. A huge complex set on a hill, with vast galleries and outdoor areas, the Getty Centre is one of the most magnificent galleries I’ve ever seen. It can be overwhelming; I chose to not visit some galleries, as modern art and photography is what I enjoy and there is so much to see. Fortunately they have excellent cafes and restaurants when you need a break. A highlight of my trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seatseeker
50,Big and Amazing,This place is wow.. Big and fun.. I like it so much I would go here again so many memories from just one visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petero404
50,Rembrandts for all,"Excellent facility for viewing the masters and enjoy the architecture. The facilities offer guided tours and on-site restaurants to take the whole day to experience the site. They also support exhibits for younger visitors to do hands on training. The displays allow you to focus on the development of the arts thru the ages. We visited for a day in January and then drove back from Florida for 3 mores days, on the way to Yosemite NP.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2497PZjims
50,"If you like art, you might need an entire day.","A wonderful art and cultural institution in Los Angeles. While we have the LACMA and MOCA, the Getty Centre is by far my favourite of it's type. Encompassing everything from contemporary to ancient, it incorporates everything from paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, drawings, decorative arts, gardens, etc... in numerous galleries and buildings spanning about. This is not the Getty Villa in Malibu (which mainly showcases Greek, Roman, and Etruscan works). The Getty Center, in Brentwood is about 750 acres and opened about 18 years ago in 1997. As what I know, they are only closed on Mondays and major holidays and has always had free admission. If you come by car, parking is $5 last time I checked. Unlike some museums I have been to, you can easily spend the entire day here. If in the rare instance it rains, or is a scorching hot day, they actually offer free umbrellas, just return them when you leave. For anyone who doesn't think LA has culture, just go here, and then go to the LACMA or MOCA, or many other as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
50,Too much to see in one day!,"This establishment is beyond belief. The grounds alone are fantastic equal to or better than some theme parks for beauty and style of gardens and walkways etc. from the tram ride up the mountain to the voluminous selection of rooms to visit, the museum is fantastic.The views of the mountains, surrounding communities and ocean are not to be missed.You only pay $15.00 for parking and the rest is free.Great place, some truly inspirations things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mildredo291
50,The Getty Center,"This was an excellent way to spend an afternoon. We could have easily spent more time there, as it was impossible to explore everything in just an afternoon. Famous art works, gorgeous grounds and gardens, and a beautiful setting - The Getty Center has it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111murielp
30,Better in Spring,I think you can find better permanent collections in other cities. The real specialty is the building and gardens which are best enjoyed in nice weather when everything is green.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EastBostonGuy
50,Must-see attraction,"We aren't art museum type people, but are both into history. We decided to visit the Getty Center both for the history and the views of LA. We were not disappointed! It is a really cool experience.We had already visited the Getty Villa in Malibu and were able to use the $15 parking ticket to validate the parking at the Getty Center. It's a great deal and both places have free admission to the actual museums. Parking fills up fast so it's good to get there by 12-1pm if possible (when we were leaving around 3:30pm it seemed the parking was completely full!) The tram was efficient and a fun way to get to the museum.The buildings and property are beautiful and clean with fantastic views of the city. The art is fascinating even for non-artists! It's intriguing to see pieces and study the styles used by artists in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries and compare those techniques with the works from the 18th and 19th centuries. There is so much to see and such a large area to cover (especially after our visit to the Villa) that we did not stay long enough to see the art from the 19th century on. That just means we'll have to plan another visit so we can take it all in.We can see why this is rated # 1 of LA attractions. It is a fascinating place in a beautiful setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finalsan
50,An amazing site,"This is a remarkable place, worth the visit for the architecture, gardens and perspectives alone. The museum buildings have a nice collection of art covering five centuries, but there are museums with more impressive paintings and sculpture. What sets the Getty aside is how the art is displayed--over four different buildings and what surrounds the exhibits on the outside. The Center also has impressive educational facilities that are generally open to the public.Also amazing is that the Getty does not charge an admission fee ($15.00 for parking only). The terraced facility has wonderful sitting areas on all levels and several places to eat, ranging in seriousness from kiosk (cold drinks, etc.) to cafeteria to full-blown restaurant.We spent about 4 hours at the Center and could have stayed a couple more, if we had used the study center. This is a real must visit if you're in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueNWashington
40,Unique temporary exhibits,"I’m a little snobbish regarding museums. This is a good museum, but not fabulous. What makes it a definite destination is the view and the grounds, so try to go on a day when the air is clear. There tend to be interesting, unique temporary exhibits. I’ve seen an exhibit on the printing press – in which there was a Guttenberg bible – and most recently a collection of amazingly old, but exceedingly well-preserved ~400-year-old tapestries. I think (although I don't know for certain) that you have to have a car to get here, so if you're visiting and don't have one, maybe drop this site to low on your itinerary. If you decide to go, it’s worth a several-hour visit. Admission is free, but parking is $15; you park in the garage at the bottom of the hill, and then ride a tram up to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliethefirehorse
50,Amazing building located in a great environment,"If you want to combine culture with your trip, this is the place to go to. Stunning views and great exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbY3670MN
50,Absolutely loved this place,Lovely trip up to the Center itself. I enjoyed the art galleries but the gardens are beautiful. I spent hours chilling with a glass of wine enjoying the tranquility. A must see if you want an antidote to the business side of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlogan1302
40,Well worth the hassle of getting there,"Hired a car with GPs but led us to a residential area where we encountered sign not to proceed but gave alternative address. When we got there, various road works and the centre was simply not signed at all. Lots of banners but not one sign saying entrance here. Singularly unimpressed. However, the rest of the experience was terrific. $15 charge per car and that's it, real value for money. Tram up to museum, frequent, clean and well organised. Buildings are beautiful and worth the visit in their own right. Lovely gardens to wander through with good access. Art work probably the least of the things which appealed but then I can see some fantastic works in London whenever I want. Impressionist gallery though was a real success. Exceptionally well hung, you can tell how passionate the curators are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663annies
50,Love the Getty Center,"I've been going to the Getty Center since it first opened. It never disappoints! A great place to spend the day or just a few hours. The art is amazing, the gardens incredible and sunset views on a clear day are great. The art is always changing so there is always something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarMik60
50,Spectacular museum and gardens,"Allow at least 4 hours, if you want to see everything inside and out. Take a sack lunch or eat at one of several places with varying costs. Relax in the gardens. Walk outside the south end of the building for city views. Take a tour. Free entrance but a parking costs and there is no real easy way to avoid that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonnyDub

50,A creation unto itself,Nestled in the hills over Los Angeles the Getty is one of the premier museums of the world. How they built such a castle in such rugged terrain must have been quite a challenge. A mujst see stop on any visit to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ocean_Rover_Blue_Wat

50,The Getty Center is amazing!!,"We Los Angelinos are awfully fortunate that J Paul Getty left us his huge fortune for the purchase of arts for us to enjoy simply for the price of parking!And, although the building cite in West L.A. is really ugly from below, it works pretty well once you're up at it. And, who can complain about the amazing Maliby Getty Villa! The cite, itself is worth the visit. But the artworks are fabulous! Lucky us!! Thanks, J Paul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinojeff
50,"Stunning, A Must-Do","As a native Angeleno, I've been to The Getty Center many times over the years. The most recent was last Sunday afternoon. It was my husband's first visit.We arrived around 2:30 pm, thinking that it would be less crowded, since it closed at 5:30. Wrong. There was an enormous queue for the tram up the hill. We opted to do the 10-15 walk to the top. Yes, it's at an incline, but it's a gentle slope and easy to manage. It's paved the entire way and the sidewalk is wide. If you're healthy, don't wait for a packed tram!In addition to amazing art, the Getty Center has beautiful gardens and a stunning view of the city. It's enormous and there is no way that you can see it all in a single visit. If you can research prior to visiting, that's probably best, but if not, take a few moments to look over the map when you arrive and focus on the collections that you're most interested in viewing. Make sure to save time for the gardens.In the past, I've taken the tours, which are a wonderful way to obtain a greater insight to the grounds and collections. I highly recommend them.We did not eat at the cafe or restaurant on this visit, but they have also offered a great selection. You can also bring your own picnic and eat on the grounds. There is an expansive lawn overlooking the gardens. There are many places to sit and enjoy a meal.This is a spectacular museum on all levels. I've not seen anything else that quite compares.Like my review? Check out my blog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
50,Amazing,If you are in LA you should go there. Incredible and sublime. It is truly amazing that LA has this level of culture so close at hand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2608IEmarkm

40,lovely grounds and views,"We went here to get away from the LA bustle. In addition to the art, there are plenty of places to sit, relax, have coffee or lunch and admire the far or aching views. Relaxing afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelG216
40,"Amazing location, amazing buildings, amazing artwork and exhibitions","If you want a top scenic view of Los Angeles that combines beautiful architecture, art collections and exhibitions as well as a restaurant that serves good food the this is a 'must see' place to go.Access to the summit is by unmanned vehicles that slowly wend their way up the hill giving views of the bustling freeway below and ultimately the city. Everything about this place is quality. From the people who volunteer to work here, the gardens and the art work. The Getty is involved in multiple restoration and education projects around the world and you get a sense of this by the diversity of items on display and topics coveredTo me a place of superlatives for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stargazer43
40,Great view of city and beautiful grounds,"I totally agree with another reviewing that I found the Getty to be confusing, and with a few exceptions the artwork doesn't compare to the great museums of the world. The grounds however are amazing and the views of the city are incomparable. Museum is free, $15 parking and short tram ride from parking to the museum. Very spread out so be prepared for a fair amount of walking. Someone older may struggle a bit. Probably good for family with smaller kids, plenty of places for kids to run and roam safely as a break from looking at the artwork. Totally worth a few hours of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomHNJ
40,Nice experience,"There is a lot to see so I would recommend researching the permanent and temporary exhibitions so that you have an idea of what your priorities are, in case you don't have time to see everything. I used a Getty Guide, which I would highly recommend. The cactus garden off of the south pavilion was really cool to look at, although the larger garden (intertwined circles) was much smaller than I expected. There were some very nice views as well. Overall I had a really nice time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShevaLew
50,Getty Museum,"This is truly a world class museum and facility for learning. Superb gardens, great tram up to the centre, very helpful staff and its all free !! We were lucky as we had a drop off and collect, there is parking available but that does cost. Tram up from the drop off point was fast and efficient taking you to the foot of the museum. There is wheel chair access via lifts. The paintings are superb and well displayed . There are photo displays which again were superb, gardens were imaginative and lovely to walk around,artistic in their own right. We even saw a hummingbird but our pictures don't do it justice,beautiful little thing .There is a film guide you can do to make your experience more enjoyable. Then its up to you with the free floor plan and guide.Guided tours are a good idea if you allow enough time. We did the quick whizz round as had a flight to catch. Although we will come again.The location is stunning with views to the ocean and the snow capped mountains behind. Very good views on a clear sunny day over the city and environs. There are facilities for drawing etc . There were 8-9 school buses in the car park , lots of children .Don't forget you can't take pictures inside, but you can take them outsideEnjoy a very very good museum ,well done !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pushpB
50,Spectacular architecture,Love this museum and thankful to Paul Getty for building this gorgeous museum which seems to have an abundance of riches. It was a pleasure to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559cata
40,Beautiful campus,"The Getty Center is worth seeing just for the beautiful gardens and incredible views of LA. The actual museum I found to be somewhat confusing in layout, and while the collection is good with some gems, it is not comparable to the great East Coast museums. I took one of the highlights tours, and found it disappointing, skipping over many of the paintings I wanted to see and focusing on decorative arts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flipper775
40,worth visiting,"Museum is really nice. No admission fee; just pay $15 for all-day parking. I was there when they exhibited Rubens art. It was really nice. This art museum is huge. I walked really fast but I still spent 2 hours there. My recommendation about this place is that if you plan to be there during holiday, avoid using your own car. It took us more for about an hour to get into the parking ramp. We were stuck in the traffic right when we got off the free way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cho_R4T
40,Beautiful... And free!,"What better a place to take the kids to see fantastic art, manicured gardens, and a beautiful view of west la. Just make sure to come a bit early since available parking spaces go quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014
50,So much to see,"The Getty Center must be in your top 10 sights when in LA. The art collection is great, the buildings and layout are amazing and the views of LA and its suburbs are second to none. AND you get all this for free. If you drive to the Center there is a $15 parking fee but it is the best money you'll spend in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BowenMJ
50,Must see,"Absolutely amazing building, loved the views, museum and even the super smooth tram ride from the carpark to the Getty Museum.Free to enter, just have to pay for parking. Really well managed and very generous of the Getty Foundation - thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayILikeIt
30,"Not a museum, but a museum?","Very modern and well designed building, but I didnt quite grasp the concept. Is it an art gallery? Museum? Contemporary design viewing spot? Either way, 2 hours here and we left. Some great views of LA to be had though and its free mostly except from the parking so you dont have too much to lose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9474GOmatthewb
50,You can spend an hour or a whole day here,"We were in LA on business and had one day for leisure activities. It was easy to sign up online for the 'free' tickets. Just needed to pay a small amount for parking. Before coming, we thought we'd spend an hour or so here before driving up the coast on Highway 1. Wow! We were totally blown away at all the interesting, informative, and educational history here. We took advantage of the free rentals of iPhones and headsets so we could do the self tour. You could spend at least a whole day here learning about each exhibit and also learning about the culture behind it. There were several school groups there and were a little distracting because no matter how hard the staff tried to keep them quiet, the kids were always noisy. We tried to avoid going to a particular exhibit when the groups were there. Worked out pretty well, but If you are one that likes to sit, view and quietly take in the exhibits, go when the kids aren't there.One more thing - Although I don't agree with the kind of man J Paul Getty was to his family - I do with to thank him for his vision of creating this fantastically important historical rendering. Whether you've got a whole week or a couple days in LA, put this place on you ""A"" list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrKaffee
50,Awesome place!,"I like art, and I appreciate museums, but I would say that this place is out of this world. A must see attraction if your are around. I recommend spending the last hours of the day there, so you can see the amazing sunset from such beautiful place. You will see how the travertine facades of the buildings change their color from white to different tones of pink and orange.Moreover, after finishing your visit spend at least 20 minutes to look the Getty Shop, even if you do not plan buying anything. They have a lot of souvenirs, art books, mini-sculptures and the classic ""Getty Travertine"".Even when there is no fee on the entrance you must pay USD 15 for parking. After parking your car you take a tram from bottom of the hill to the entrance of the Getty Center. There are some public transportation that goes to the Center, but I am not sure about them.There are some permanent collections and some others that are renewed from time to time. I recommend visiting the Getty Center webpage: http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/ in order to know more about them.The gardens of the Getty are beautiful, and deserve a visit every season of the year. Even when I never been there for spring, I bet that is the best season to go out to visit the gardens.There are some collections that do not allow photographs, even without flash. But, there are others that allow you to take pictures if you do not use your flash. Ask to any of the tens of security people around about it so you do not miss taking your own amazing pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andresvilla
40,Getty-Up and See Some Art,"The Getty Center shows a mix a modern photography artists, paintings, sculptures and decorative arts. A great place to spend a day. In the summers, bands often play here and throughout the year, many family day events take place on weekends. There is a gift shop and multiple locations to buy food. On a clear day you can see the ocean. Great views overall and if you have the time, check out a guided tour-the volunteers are packed with gems of information. There is a parking fee, but entry is free, so I suggest carpooling. Also, there is a nice trolly ride up to the museum from the parking lot. Be sure to bring a camera, just remember, not to use flash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntitled1
50,Family visit to the Getty Center,"My family of five including three teenage boys aged 15, 17 and 19 visited the Getty Center for several hours. We participated in a free one hour guided tour which included ""highlights of the collection"". The collection here is fantastic. The architecture is sensational and the gardens are beautiful. It is not an easy venue to get to, so don't be deterred. We used an uber cab and we're very happy we made the effort to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DownersAustralia
50,Great architecture tour,Building and gardens worth the visit. Spent the day and enjoyed it all. Collection ok and well displayed. Building and gardens as well as view are spectacular. And it's all free except parking. If you're nearby take uber or taxi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haverfordgranny
50,A Beautiful Massive Museum,"This museum occupies much of the top of a hill and has great views of the surrounding Los Angeles area. When you arrive the parking is at the bottom and you take the shuttle train to the museum. You need at least four hours to enjoy all there is to see. Since we spent most of the day we made reservations ahead and had lunch in The Restaurant at the Getty. The food was unique and tasty, and the server, Dylan, was always near. This is a must visit when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazinn2
40,Gorgeous outside grounds,"This is always a must see place but it gets packed so go early and plan to spend some time there. This is not the best place to bring really little kids, Well, its ok if they remain outside but really hard to watch or maintain them while you look at artwork. Maybe if they are in strollers but not tods or active kids running around. We saw many being yelled at and reprimanded by the security guards that seem to be at every corner. OUr kids are older but it even feels that they have to keep a watchful, stern eye on us at every exhibit. So that gets old and stressful. We liked the outside part much better because of that. Our teens thought it was stuffy too the way they were being treated so that is one complaint we have w/this place. Many nicer art museums are courteous, at least be kind, but here, they roam around as if they need to reprimand someone, anyone. IT makes for a more unrelaxed stroll. I don't know if its always like this but it was when we came here years ago and again this time. There were kids everywhere because of a school field trip so maybe that caused to be on high alert as well. Anyways, the art is always fun to look at, so many of them. But I like to point out the gardens and architecture of the whole place. Its just gorgeous That I would come for and a fun monorail ride into and out of this place. I can spend hours just looking at teh view from above into downtown LA or sit in their gardens. That's where the plus of the place is. The art is nice but again, the guards made it less fun. Definitely a must see once in a lifetime if you are here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livelovex7
40,A nice surprise!,We really enjoyed this private art museum with excellent views of Los Angeles and a surprisingly good restaurant! It is a wonderful way to spend the day in and around Los Angeles!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnthyne
50,not to be missed,"Start with the overview tour that will take you to all the galleries with an introduction by a volunteer guide. Each guide chooses their itinerary so your tour will be unique. Our guide, Katrina, was passionate about art and very well-informed. She clearly loves this museum. We wanted to take the architecture tour but it was raining the day we were there, so we opted for lunch in the restaurant. A bit of a splurge, but a gorgeous view of LA (even in the rain), and an amazing menu made this a great decision. Don't miss The Getty - an astonishing and beautiful museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne000001
50,Beautiful grounds and art,"I could spend forever at the museum, one day is simply not enough for art lovers! I would recommend taking their guided tours to start off your visit, the collection highlights was a good way to see some key pieces. Absolutely stunning gardens and architecture make this attraction a winner in my books - and worth the small hike it took to get there on public transport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camilleo573
50,"A ""Wow"" level top-class art gallery / museum. And free!","A must-see if you are visiting LA.The Getty is a little way north of LA, but easily accessible from LA by LADOT bus. Google Maps is the best way to plan a trip.We were staying in downtown LA and, (the only negative point), faced with a nearly 2-hour bus trip, decided to use a car service, which reduced the transit time to 30 minutes. Once there at the car park, we found a fairly long queue for the transit shuttle up to the Getty. Hint: with normal fitness, it's a relaxing 15-minute stroll enjoying the view of the surrounding hills. The weather was beautiful which helped!Once at the Getty, I strongly suggest heading straight to the information centre and checking if there are any free tours running. We were lucky and only had to wait 15 minutes for a wonderful architecture tour which we enjoyed immensely.The entire site is very photogenic along with the surrounding countryside. The architecture is a thing of beauty. In addition, there are always various exhibitions in the many buildings (photography, painting, you name it...)The restaurant/cafe is high quality, and there are refreshment stands in several places.Simply: if you come to LA and have an ounce of culture in your bones you must see this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjb1001
40,Interesting,The architecture and gardens are the highlight. There are beautiful views from many terraces. Not much art to look at compared to other art museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAG_from_PA
50,Best Sight in Los Angeles!,"The Getty Center has it all, great art, good food, awesome views, and some history to top it off. Plus all of this is free! We have been to the Getty Center a few times now and every time we go they have a new temporary exhibit for us to enjoy. The view from the Getty Center is amazing and in the Spring and Summer the gardens offer a nice place to take a stroll. If you are visited LA for the first time or are a long time resident that has not been to the Getty Center, it is worth your time, you will be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truofrehryan2018
50,Lovely free museum with great views,Was unfortunately there on a rainy day so didn't walk around the outdoors as much as you could but still got great views of LA. The art was very interesting too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EventsCecilia
50,GETTY CENTER BEST MUSEUM IN LA,"BEAUTIFUL layout, with vistas of CATALINA ISLAND on a clear day, sprawling CACTI gardens to the rear, and a MASTER'S COLLECTION...here is a hint take the 760 Metro Bus from WESTWOOD and avoid the $10 or $15 car parking fee....YOU ARE IN FREE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDfilmdoctor
50,Best of the best,The Getty Center is one of the preeminent art institutions in the world. It is a great day for anyone ever marginally interested in art. Absolutely one of my favorite places. People who are artistically inclined should look at their art classes. My daughter took a 2 hour (free!) sketching class and loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlliJ
50,a must in LA,"If you are looking for what to see in LA you have to visit getty center.Very interesting architecture, great overview of LA and of course some of the top eurpean masters paintings incl. irises by van gogh. great place to spend couple of h's, if possible go in the morning just after they open, later in a day it starts to get crowdy. i dont like pushing myself through a crowd to see paintings in a museum:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcinkB8103OG
50,Art...Views...Food and more and it's Free,"With over 5000 reviews, every superlative and adjective imaginable has been used to describe this beautiful museum and they ALL are appropriate. The views alone are worth the visit. On a nice day, they are spectacular. There are probably more photos taken here than in most of LA. Since it is free, you can't beat the price. However, do be aware that parking is $15 which you pre-pay at a pay machine before going to your car and leaving. Early in the morning the traffic to the museum can back up the interstate exit. The 7 level parking garage soon fills and over low parking goes across the access road. The line to get on the tram that takes you up the hill to the actual museum can become very long and take 30 minutes to board. You can walk up the hill on a nice sidewalk, but it is steep and takes about 15 minutes. The tram itself is interesting. It is actually a cable car that floats on a cushion of air. The museum itself is several separate buildings that contain various works of art and furniture. Though not as extensive as a Smithsonian ore a Louvre, it is a very impressive collection with several special exhibits. There are several places to eat that very in style and price from simple to very elegant. The real virtue of this museum is it's spectacular views of LA and the Pacific ocean. The grounds with its various gardens are a great place to stroll and to let children play. Families picnic on the grass and enjoy the beautiful views. Be sure to make a whole day of it and then plan a visit to the Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
50,Exceptional!,The gardens are truly amazing and then there is the art! From riding the funicular to exploring the exhibits and grounds this is a experience not to miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryofMB
50,One of the most beautiful museums in the world,The actual museum is breathtaking and the views spectacular. The permanent exhibit needs to catch up with the magnificence of the exterior...but it will. Plan a whole day here. there is so much to do and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelloDas
50,A fantastic setting!,"We were there for a full day and got to see only two special exhibits and one piece of ""art"" because we were blown away by the setting, the buildings, and the overall feeling of the place. Went on the architecture tour and took lots of photos of the building, garden, views, etc. and looked for fossils in the travertine. Also enjoyed a first class meal at the restaurant upstairs. Even the walk from the parking lot was nice. Will have to come back for the art the next time! I'd advise anyone to go even if they don't like art museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hahnecho

50,Wheelchair Info... Free... $15 to Park...Amazing Views...Great Art,"Outstanding Museum. Free wheelchairs available, flat and easy to maneuver. However, not one door into any of the building were handicap accessible - someone had to hold the door open for the wheelchair to go through. Don't fret, it was so crowded there was always a guest willing to help.Parking was a mess. Continuous traffic, multiple floors of underground parking. Might want to leave a bit ahead of closing to ensure you can get on the elevator to your parking level and not have to wait as long.The artwork was breathtaking and the collections well done. Will definitely come back. Outdoor cafe was delightful. Very impressive. It was very, very crowded on a Sunday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SayCheese
50,One of the best reasons to live in L.A.,"This is one of my favorite places to go for a relaxing day. There are always excellent exhibits, the grounds are spectacular with great views.

Reservations are recommended for restaurant. We didn't try as long wait for table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MO8ball
40,Must see while in LA,"Visiting the Getty Center is a unique experiencing combining art and architecture. As you read from the varied reviews, the site is stunning and you could spend a whole visit without viewing any art. The architecture, gardens and views are amazing.Access from the I-405 is good, parking is convenient in the garage (at $15 it's your only expense to visit, quite the bargain), you arrive at the upper level by tram. You can view the introductory film online to save you this time as you enter. Get the free audio guide. Dining options are good, not cheap, or you can bring your own. They have really done everything to make your visit a success.The art spans twelve centuries and is world class, BUT (my only but) is that the depth is not there as it might be at bigger/older museums like the MFA in Boston or the Met in NY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cararro

50,Fabulous and a bargain,"Unreal collection of art. I stood in a room of paintings I had only ever studied in college. To see them in person was an over the top experience.

I brought 3 tickets from Costco on Jan 4th, 2015. I went to universal studio on Jan 7th, 2015. When I checked in, the staff told me one of the ticket is registered and used in Dec, 24th, 2014. I was shocked. Since one of the ticket is invalid, I need to buy a new one from boxing office. It waste more money and time.

There are various buildings to explore and the gardens, open spaces and views are all fantastic.There is plenty of parking, generally speaking, by the access road, and then a tram takes folks to the museum itself, that is located on a mountain ridge.

50,Great museum on beautiful grounds!,"So many beautiful pieces of art, from paintings to statues, and antiques.

50,A Visual Beauty Inside and Out!,"This beautiful museum has three things going for it: beautiful art pieces, stunning architecture, inspiring gardens. Note that the art is not contemporary. The museum is actually a cluster of 5 buildings situated high on a hill. A quick (free) tram takes you from the parking structure to the museum. I visited this as part of a side trip to a Rose Parade package and it was worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsX5262FI

You take a tram ride up to the museum, and the views of the surrounding countryside are beautiful. Once at the museum, tour the cactus garden, view the Pacific, but spend most of your time perusing the various galleries and all they have to offer.

After getting on the tram and riding it to the top, which is a really nice treat-seeing the city sprawled in front of me-the actual Getty lived up to my expectations. The docents at the information desk and at the orientation room were very nice and helpful. The art itself is great as are the grounds. I would go back when they have another exhibit that I need to see. Made my weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cllvnv

There is a great lawn spot for kids to unwind and for adults to relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noelj166
50,First time was a Charm,"Loved the Getty Museum. The Gardens, even though it was Winter, were well groomed and very pretty. The Museum itself was amazing. I didn't expect to see so many profound artists and their works displayed: Degas, Picasso, Van Gogh, Manet, Monet and several others. I was very impressed and will be back on my next visit to SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781heidiw
50,Worth the visit,"This no-cost venue has something for everyone ($15 for parking). The different buildings house different collections and you can easily choose to focus on specific interests. There are gardens as well as art, so if you don't fancy looking at paintings, tapestries (current exhibit), and other works of art, you can sit and admire the architecture from outside. The center provides printed maps in many languages and audio tours as well. Enclosed parking is at the bottom of the hill and you have 7 levels to chose from with a sign telling you how many spaces are available at each level - the number can be deceiving since some folks have trouble keeping their vehicles in one spot. There is a tram that will take you to the Center at the top of the hill or you can walk. The line for the tram was long, but it moved quickly. I doubt we were in line 10 minutes. For those occasional rainy days, the Getty provides umbrellas, so feel free to leave yours in the car. We only had a few hours, but this venue can be a day-long experience if you have the time. Plenty of conveniently located restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56-Been_Around
40,Wow is this place popular!,Love this museum- the architecture and landscaping alone is worth the parking line. The photography center is not to be missed. Hands down fabulous curating since the first show opened. It is crowded though. So prepare yourself for lots of people around you also marveling at this beautiful museum... and enjoy the people watching!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karmadoggie
50,So FUN and beautiful!,"I have always wanted to go to The Getty but was unable too until NOW! I was NOT disappointed. Even though the tram was not working, the walk up the hill was thrilling! (they did offer bus trips). Well worth the walk....the scenery was spectactular as you reached the top. The works there were great to see. The café was reasonable for food both choices and price. It was very crowded but you really didn't notice. The staff helpful with suggestions (we had 5 children ages 7 to 12). A great time had by everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMS664
50,Amazing! Need to come again,"Loved, loved this museum and architecture. Amazing collection of great masters.An insightful and varied collection. Be sure to set aside some time to see this invaluable collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YVRFoodsnob
10,"NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE GETTY VILLA, THEY ARE IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS","We went to the Getty villa and I thought it was all on one large campus. the getty center is #1 for kids of all ages, the Getty villa was not!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3128JSsharong
50,Truly spectacular...,"Fantastic visit. The museums, the gardens, the views - TRULY spectacular. So much to see and do here - you could spend an entire day. Since they were out of iPods for the self-guided tours we took the guided tours for both the museum and gardens - one of the best tours we have had of museums or gardens - EVER! Even our 7 year old child was completely enamoured by the descriptions of the art, photos and stories associated with the objects on display. The views of L.A were truly delightful - one of the best views. And all this for free (with $15 parking which is well worth it). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globecommuters
50,Superb!,"The museum was packed, but it was well worth the wait as we stood in line for the monorail. We took a tour with one of the docents, who turned out to be one of the curators. It was truly wonderful. This was certainly a highlight of our visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvTaTrek
50,Crowded but definitely worth the venture,"We parked in the garage and took the tram up to the museum and just took in the sights for 2+ hours. So much to see and enjoy. The free iPod tours are really helpful, but they do have battery issues. Hard to complain about free though!The current exhibits were very insightful and informative - they really give you a good perspective of history, curation and restoration. I left wishing the gift shop was a bit larger but really, it was my only complaint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565andreaf
50,Fantastic - my introduction to art appreciation,"Magnificent buildings and displays, no charge to enter the museum but you do pay to park. Allow plenty of time to see everything - half a day isn't near enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarceyT
50,Can't Miss Attraction in the Hills,"The Getty Center is so many things in one. It is a spectacularly designed building, fascinating from an architectural perspective. It is a high quality gallery featuring many styles of artwork. Irises is the main attraction for many but there are great sections featuring furniture and illuminated manuscripts.Then there are the formal gardens and finally the best view in LA. The food is good though not cheap although there are a range of options available. Take the time to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor797
50,Fantastic collections and views!,"Visited the Getty Centre on a very busy Sunday - parked at the top so didn't experience the train up which looked spectacular- albeit a bit cramped. We had visited to see the art galleries, which are great - not too big so not daunting. It was very easy to see one section then have a coffee and see another. The architecture is stunning and in the beautuful Californian sunshine the buildings looked fantastic.The views from the Getty of the mountains, LA and the Pacific are breathtaking - worth the trip alone. There can't be a better view of the city anywhere. Amazing - we were very lucky it was a clear day.We had lunch in one of the cafes - the organisation of it was a bit baffling but the food was good and there were plenty of places to sit.Overall- fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonestone
50,Not to be missed . . .,"Although we have visited LA dozens of times, we have never had time to visit the Getty Center. This is not to be missed. Fortunately, the day we visited was crystal clear and the view was spectaacular. We loved everything we saw, especially the cactus garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwpnola
40,👍👍👍,"As art lovers, why not going to the #1 atraction on LA? There are a lot of expositions and temporarily art works and also a place where you can leave your children to see the art with other kids. Amazing how art is. When you arrived, everything was art. it was archirecture, photography, art, even gardens! A lot to see. Also it includes little shops AND restaurants and cafès . Go and enjoy because it's wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilygramosg
50,Great artwork and layout,The Getty is a great place to visit if you have plenty of time to make your way through the grounds and are not worried about rushing through or getting in and out quickly. The artwork is incredible in quality and in the shear number of pieces they have. I would not recommend taking young children who would not be interested in spending a few hours looking at things they cannot touch. It will not be worth the parking hassle and hike/train ride to get from the garage to the entrance if you are in a hurry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bguth11
50,"Beautiful environment, great collections","This is a beautiful museum. The site overlooks the Pacific ocean and commands views of the city of Los Angeles as well. The gardens surrounding the buildings are lovely. Really liked the architecture of the buldings themselves. There are numerous buildings exhibiting paintngs of many different periods, as well as other art forms including period furniture, photography, etc. One visit is definitely not enough to see it all.Of the permanent collections, one of my favorites is the Impressionists, with paintings representative of many of the most important artists of that period.The exhibit rooms themselves are spacious and allow for one to stand close or far from any given painting or object, with seating allowing a more lengthy viewing of the paintings for those interested in detailed observation.The practical aspects of visiting this museum, such as parking and food and beverage services are well run despite the large number of visitors.this is a ""must see"" attraction in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaD121
50,Amazing!,"My Husband, 22 year old daughter and 14 year old son explored this amazing place December 30th. To sum it up, Wow! My 14 year old was even impressed. And my daughter, who is a fine arts student, was extremely excited to see the Monet, Degas, Leonardo and Picasso originals. We also visited the WW1 exhibit which was right up my husbands alley. Overall the site is beautiful and has something to suit everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunloverSue
50,Stunning!,"The Getty center is a beautiful museum, with amazing art and stunning views of LA. Don't miss this when you are in LA! It is warm inside the buildings, but can be cool and windy outside, so dress in layers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoMama33
30,Fabulous place but way too crowded on this date.,"We were there on Dec. 30 and there were hordes of buses with people in town for the Rose Parade. Have been to the Getty before and have never seen crowds like this. We waiting over 30 min in line for lunch, couldn't get near certain displays. Also, it was very cold outside and the buildings were overheated...very unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jage44
50,Too little time,Beautiful place to visit. We were on our way to Hawaii and left home a day early to visit the Getty Center. We got there about 1:20 and had to leave by 4PM. Not nearly enough time. We will come back and plan on a 1 1/2 day visit. My wife loved it and also wants to visit the Getty Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgehG8999VY
50,A Must See in L.A.,"The Getty Museum is definitely somewhere you want to see in Los Angeles. The architecture and gardens are spectacular and provide some of the best views of the city. It is a great museum for kids because the exhibits are spread out and not too large. My 13 and 11 year old girls really loved the museum. The best part is that it is free, with the exception of paying for parking. I would definitely recommend The Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fieldtravels
50,Incredible Buildings and Collections,We were impressed with the facilities as well as the art. The views from the various terraces were breathtaking as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neetown
40,Enjoyed the visit,"Don't really know much about art or architecture but really enjoyed this place. I loved the open spaces and natural light, the gardens were beautiful. Even the artwork in the center was treat, a lot of different styles that I had not seen before from the Flemish artist to some great stuff by John William Godward. Really loved many of the exhibits even though was unable to view all of them.The views of LA were also great. Would have loved to stay longer and really enjoy the ambiance of this place.The Museum itself is free but parking is $15 , way worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AriBull
50,Worldclass Art Museum,"This is a fabulous art museum--the collection, the architecture, and the gardens are phenomenal. The views from the terraces and windows are works of art as well. For the price of parking ($15), you can spend a whole day here---if you like art and architecture. Even my teenage boys liked it. The restaurant was also very good, serving delicious entrees that look like works of art also, but very pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntheGo630
50,Pretty amazing,"Even though we visited Getty Center on a rainy day ( much needed rain I might add) this was quite the experience from the tram ride up to the Center, the complementary umbrellas to get to the entrance and the excellent exhibits.. I can just imagine how wonderful the views are on a sunny day . The layout and construction comes together to give the visitor the experience of appreciating art, sculpture, with the beauty of the building and the setting.Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours to have a full visit and enjoy some food also.The museum gift shop was just so so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pels7121
50,Truly a special place,"The Getty museum is a terrific place, even if you don't look at any of the exhibits. The art they have is world class. But the building and setting make it feel less like a static display amNod more like a walk in a park, surrounded by some of man kinds best efforts at expression. Take the tram up. A bit of a hike if you walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris-Meet-World
50,Spectacular location and great art,"The tram ride to the Getty Center is worth the $16 parking fee. Once at the top, you're treated to panoramic vistas. The art is really impressive and it's all ""free"". Very enjoyable even for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwwyjjliu
50,Best art center in a US City,The architecture of the center is mind blowing. Art exhibits were awesome. Gem of LA. Worth a visit - though may need a fullday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ram-chicago
50,Great Experience!,"This museum is a work of art in itself, located at a vantage point for beautiful views of LA and surrounding areas. The art inside and outside is fabulous. The museum is free but there is a $15 charge for parking. We went to see the Rubens exhibit. It was fabulous, great art and tapestries. We also enjoy the permanent collection. There is so much to see that it is overwhelming. We try to choose different areas so we are not worn out at the end of the visit. We eat at the Museum Cafe but it's confusing because there are different areas for the different choices. The food is delicious and the staff was very organized and helpful. They also have a restaurant and kiosks for snacks. We noticed many people bringing their own food and dining at one of the many tables available. This is a great idea when the museum is crowded or if you have small children. Try to get there early as the parking fills up and line for trams to the museum get longer as the day progresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5071MDbb
50,Most interesting place in LA,"Stunning building , great art collection and beautiful gardens & architectureWorth visiting even if you have no interest in art",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildcrazygoats
20,Almost wonderful,"We visited the Getty on a beautiful sunny day and were quite impressed with the grounds and the museum itself. We had a lovely day viewing the Rubens tapestries and several other exhibits. We wandered the gardens, which were beautiful even in their winter dress. We were awed by the amazing views and the overall experience itself. It all went south when we attempted to board the tram to the parking garage at about 1:30 in the afternoon. We were informed the tram would stop running for 30 minutes and that we would have to walk the long walk back. Being unable to walk that distance, especially on a decline, we found this pretty disheartening news. The museum offered NO other options and several people who were using canes, wheelchairs and had other difficulties were left to walk. What they told us would take 15 minutes took us 45 minutes to walk, having to stop numerous times along the way to reduce the stress. As many as 8 empty buses passed us as we walked, none offered to transport people that needed extra help. The worst of it was 5 minutes after we all embarked on the walk the tram started running again. We were really put out by this inconsiderate act on the part of the Getty and consequently will NOT be making the donation we had planned. The woman at the tram station was arrogant and bully-ish and had absolutely NO consideration for those of us physically unable to make this trek. A museum can be gorgeous and have the best exhibits under the sun but when they force their guests to physically injure themselves to get around, they earn a poor rating from me. We won't go back and won't recommend anyone else does either. There are too many wonderful things to do in LA to make this place a required visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzB898
50,"Impressive collection, outstanding setting","A thousand other reviewers have already told you what a great place the Getty Museum is. I love the architecture, the setting, the art collection and the rotating exhibits. This time I'll say it with pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeFlynnLaPlataMD

50,"A must go, see, spend the day","A combination of Gallery, park, sight seeing spot, restaurant, museum and architectural wonder. And it is FREE (except for the $15 parking). Truly a present to the people of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShigueS
40,"Mediocre collection, excellent view of the city","between the 2nd and 3rd of December, LA was raining, so museum was the only choice. I had visited the museum's website had a general idea about its collection.The site is huge, its lay out is also very beautiful, the view from the terrace is stunning, even in a raining day. the admission is free, so is the cloakroom. There are umbrellas provided for visitors which is particularly thoughtful.The collection has good range covers most periods of western art, also has good representation of important artists of the Italian renaissance period . However, it does lack heavy weight pieces, specially compare to other more significant museums. Then again, sometimes the joy of visiting a museum is to find some perhaps minor works of the famous artists, so I still think it is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mormad_Wannabe
50,Outstanding Museum,I try to go here when ever I am in California. I absolutely love this museum. They have done a lot of changes since I was there last. I must say that I am impressed. They have beautiful artwork and collections from all around the world. You absolutely must go and see it when you are in L.A. Plan to make a day of it. there are a lot of things to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278taraa
40,Interesting Collection & Grounds - Extraordinary View of LA and Coast,"Ecclectic collection of European Masters' paintings, sculpture, tapestries, furniture and photographs, all meticulously curated. Interesting architecture of the museum itself and wonderous gardens. Unparalleled view of LA and the coast down to Palos Verdes and beyond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveT615
50,Fabulous,"Our family visited the Getty Center this past weekend for the first time. We have passed it many times travelling on the 405 to somewhere else and always comment that we must call in sometime. So it has taken me 6 years to finally visit and it will not be the last time. It is incredibly well organised from the car parking, tram to the top, to the layout of the buildings and tours. We arrived around 10:30am - and yes it was getting busy by this time. Sort of felt like waiting in line at Disneyland for the tram but worth every minute. We did a HIghlights tour and walked around the gardens. We viewed a few of the other pavilions but didn't get around to visiting the Reubens exhibition - I will be back for that. We stayed until 3:00pm and took over 100 photographs! Faboulous winters day with views from snow capped mountains all the way across Downtown LA to Catalina. My two teenage children (17 &15) who were grumbling all the way there and husband actually enjoyed the experience also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussiegirl002
50,Beautiful campus and grounds with great collection,"I always love coming here just to immerse myself in the beauty. i'm a big architecture fan, and this is one of my favorite examples of modern architecture. The grounds are also outstanding.The art is fantastic and the rotating visiting collections are always world-class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mschmidt31
50,Great place,Allow lots of time. The visiting shows are great also. Probably one of the best in the world. I go back every 2 or 3 years and find different things to see. Top of your LA list. Must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZGandalf

50,"Wish we had more time to spend here, fabulous","During our 3 days in LA, this was one of the best places we visited. The buildings were spectacular, the art amazing, the food in the cafe delicious with a great variety and beautiful view, and the only problem we had was we didn't plan enough time at all to see everything. We were there about 3-4 hrs and really needed 6+ to see all the exhibits, the gardens, etc. The museum and the headsets that give you details on most of the pieces are free and terrific. Parking was $15. Everything was spotless clean. There is even a darling coffee cart in the courtyard if you want to take a break and have a latte etc and take in the view. What a place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyPeter
50,A very nice spot for arts and architecture,"The Getty Center requires you to pay a $15 parking fee. My significant other and I were stuck in the parking for 20 minutes trying to find a spot. The Getty was on that day at noon very crowded, on the 24th.Then you have to wait in line for the private center's streetcar to take you to the Getty's headquarters.The ride lasts about 5 minutes and goes at a relatively slow speed, whilst the CEO welcomes you on an audiotape.Arrived at the Getty, you are awestruck by the architecture. There was an exhibition of Rubens' work, and although it was only set in two rooms, I found it interesting, maybe not lit enough. But again the center was dealing with old tapestries, so this explains that.Of course, you can't take pictures of what is exposed in their exhibitions, but you can use your camera anywhere else, but no flash.The permanent collections are not very dense, although I saw one Jean Louis David and a Degas. Seeing them for real triggers something in you and they were very well exposed. A real wok has been made to manage the light all around the center and in the buildings and ailes, so it does not damage the collections.You can also grab a coffee or other stuff if you have the munchies for a reasonable price, and the staff is very friendly. There's a lot of people from abroad, you would not believe you're in L.A, of which you have several beautiful panoramas, since the center was built on a hill.The center's gift shop offers varied items, for all prices, from a magnet or a postcard to several blocks of real stone that was used to build the Getty, necklaces, fans, CDs and books for children.I really enjoyed my stay. My grandmother used to take care of museums in France and organized exhibits, from her granddaughter's point of view, this place will enchant you, whether you're looking for a nice stroll in the Center's gardens, if you're working on a research paper at their library, or simply enjoy looking at 1800s and 1900s paintings, sculptures and photographs. We stayed for 3 hours and had to go before closure at 5 pm, but felt like we would have liked to linger around the Getty a little more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/appolinnaire
50,must see in LA,"Start early afternoon to enjoy the beautifl view, walk around the Center and get inspired by the art expositions. Don`t forget the camera for a perfect sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/524mihaelar
50,"Great Art collection, garden and LA view","Admission is free and parking for $15. Arrived at 11:05am on Saturday and spent 50 minutes waiting for parking. I should take other advice to park across the street for same $15 but saved lots of time. The art collections, building architecture, garden landscape and LA views are all great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PngHop

50,A wonderful museum,"The Getty collection is wonderful, and the architecture and gardens add to the experience. It can get crowded, so plan ahead. If you like walking, park at the lot across the street from the entrance to the property (before going under the 405 freeway) and walk to the top (about 2/3 mile). You'll save lots of time in the parking garage and tram to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollyamas
50,A PLACE OF SOME SUBSTANCE IN L.A.,A cultural oasis in L.A. which is worth the trip to the city alone. Art and history in a magnificent setting with every aspect of a good day out there for the taking. The building itself is a work of art surrounded by lovely gardens (accessible) and many levels and aspects to take in the panoramic views of L.A. and it's surrounds - on a clear day. The art and displays are superb and the prospect of being confronted by art that one did not expect to be there is ever-present. There is something for everyone and the restaurants and cafes all seem to share the views.There is a lot of walking to do and so many places to photograph or just sit and look - so allow a full day and comfortable clothes/shoes etc. Pay Parking ($15 a day) is a separate enterprise but plentiful and hooked up to the access trains.Undoubtable one of the best things to do in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KERANG2014
50,Rejuvenating and Inspiring,"I consider this lovely Cultural Center to be one of a kind. It has such beautiful gardens and spacious buidings and grounds that it goes beyond Museum status.The Exhibits are diverse and interesting. ""Drawing in the Age of Rubens"" and ""Spectacular Rubens' is a must see, not only for its inspiration but for its contemplative tone that spars much in depth converstaion and reflection.If all you do is sit in the gardens, you will be rejuvenated - but of course, see the Exhibits, they have much to offer.I am looking forward to the upcoming Light, Paper, Process: Reinventing Photography event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyLeighCohn
50,Beautiful,"I'm not much into art, and we have lots of these antiques in Europe.The architequture, buildings, landscape and views are so beautiful.I value the outside more than the inside of the museum, but if you into art and antiques you have to visit the inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taestensen
50,Great Art Museum and Grounds - and it's free,"Not a bad bus ride from Westwood. Once you arrive, you take a tram up to the museum. I couldn't take the Gardens Tour due to the rains, but you could walk near them and the immediate area was nice. The building itself is a nice open space, and I couldn't believe it was free to see the art! Special exhibitions may have a fee - FYI. You can take photos in all or most exhibits. Nice areas outside to sit and have a drink (they have a kiosk where they sell wine, etc). I'll definitely will be back during my next trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95lisass
50,Really outstanting!,"Getty Center is unique! It's a place you can visit many times. Today, Rubens! After the visit, you can lunch. Expensive but delicious restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassiodnv
50,The Getty picnic,"My friends and I brought a full picnic and enjoyed the day on the grounds. The museum was interesting, the art speaks for itself. The view from the museums top balcony was breathtaking. We had a wonderful time.I wish I could say we were a ""posh"" bunch, that knows our art and sculptures, but we aren't, we still had a blast drinking wine and eating cheese then rolling down the hill and running up and down the ramp like kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476karinam
50,A great place for a day visit,It is a great place included nice museums and out door area with a fantastic view. The service from the staffs were also way outstanding. You don't even need to pay the entrance fee. Me and my friends all had a great time and would love to stay longer there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennyHsu
50,I see why this is the number 1 thing to do in LA,"Lovely grounds, beautiful art work, something to do for everyone. I even got free parking because I visited the Getty Villa that same day. Hard to find on the GPS but worth the time. Very friendly and informative staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
50,World Class -- and no charge!,"This comprehensive museum in an exquisite location on a bluff above Los Angeles should not be missed. The campus is extraordinary and worth the visit alone. The art collection of course is world famous.There is a restaurant, a cafeteria and a cafe on campus. The restaurant is excellent and rivals any in Los Angeles.There is underground parking at the museum. Once parked you take an electric tram up the hill to the center itself.Most surprising of all, the museum is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zuluquebec
50,A Must for your visit to Southern California,"There is a reason that The Getty Center is the #1 attraction on tripadvisor for Los Angeles. It should be on everyone's bucket list. This place is fantastic--the art collection and exhibits, the facilities, the spectacular views of Los Angeles....You should plan to spend an entire day or you will surely miss something (and you should see the views of L.A. during the daytime and at night--they are open late on Saturday). I cannot wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gentlecritic
50,Love it!!!,One of the best hands down places to take photos in L.A. It's a must so many one of a kind amazing paintings. You just feel smarter walking around. I love the garden and the view on a smog free clear day is mind blowing cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctortea
40,Getty Museum,"It was my only visit there so initial impressions were awestruck in terms of the enormity of the layout, the collection, the organization (with one hundred volunteers), and the extreme wealth that created it through Mr. Getty, his family and his foundation.The architecture was stunning... modernistic... innovative... impressionistic... and sprawling. One felt so miniscule in its midst. The detail to every single aspect was a story in itself. For instance, why are the stone floor tiles exactly 30 inches apart throughout the entity? Because that's the proper distance between people who are engaging in a meaningful conversation.The visitors from around the world gave credence to the museum's appeal. From curiosity seekers to artists gleaning from what others have created, there were thousands of people there yet due to its size, it didn't seem crowded. (Remember to take your 5 level underground garage stub with you or you'll be lost forever!)Classes and lectures occur daily so it isn't a static display of art. It is a learning center.Entire buildings are filled with classical pieces and historical images including Grecian, Roman, Euro and wartime mementos and films. Outdoor walks among gardens are self-guided or may be escorted by informed persons.In all, you cannot spend half a day there. Plan the full day. Food is available.While I praise it highly, I'm not inclined to revisit... perhaps it's too much for the mind. But what was most impressive to me was not the art but the generosity and commitment the family devoted to this world class art mecca. Literally a billion dollars was donated in collecting and constructing it. Shows what oil money can reap in the right hands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RICHARDD931
50,Wonderful!,"We had a wonderful day. The drive up from Santa Monica was fairly easy & parking underground, then getting the little train up to the Centre very straightforward. Once up at the top the views are great. The whole fabric of the place and the gardens are lovely. The art exhibitions and photographic exhibitions are absolutely wonderful. The café for lunch was very good. Overall, highly recommended and one of the highlights of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruth44421

50,Loved the Architecture and lovers of Art could enjoy the experience,"Great experience. Free access but you do pay $15 for parking and a train shuttle takes you to the entrance. Some priceless art on display and certainly of interest, even for the novice.Personally I enjoyed the architecture of the facility, the garden as well as the view of Los Angeles.Some displays are of a temporary nature so best to check before hand to ensure you visit when there is something that tickles your interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miket8888
50,I really wished to see it!,"15 years ago, when I started to painting in middle age,I wished to see this center . it was really more more bigger and intresting than I imagined!There is a tram from parking lot to meusum.you could have a panoramic view of LA and beautiful landscapes.

50,A day to remember,I went here on a personal retreat and this place did not disappoint - I spend the morning outside touring the grounds and looking at the views. I had booked a lunch reservation that was amazing and truly worth it. The afternoon was spent touring the art and while there wasn't much modern works presented but definitely an amazing gem!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelgenie1963
50,Gorgeous place!,"The most beautiful views of LA in the entire city! Amazing art and architecture. The volunteers are just waiting to help people. The grounds are pristine. All of this for free, although parking is $15. All the people in our party, ages 19 to 53, enjoyed the trip to The Getty. We had a wheelchair user in our party and the museum is extremely accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonya211
50,Sophistication in abundance,"The venue was situated perfectly: along Pacific Coast Highway peering out over the ocean. Parking was a snap, staff were personable and professional. The exhibit (we chose the Roman and Greek antiquities) was impressive. The breadth of the exhibits allows for intimate, short-term tours, or expansive, instructive ones. Its palette was broad enough to keep you there indefinitely or let you leave quickly but sated. We'll be back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatoCooks
50,Gorgeous Getty,"My second visit to Getty Centre and I absolutely love going there. The position, architecture and gardens are inspiring. It is really easy to pace yourself so that you dont get overwhelmed by the collections by finding a sunny spot to sit in one of the many terraces, most of which have fabulous views. Want to bring your own lunch and just picnic... thats fine. Its one of the few places in the world where you can have a fabulous cultural experience and a great day out qqall for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozbabetasmania
50,fabulous and very rare place,"exceptional location on the upper part of santa monica with a beautiful surrounding view on LA. The museum itself - which is completely free - offers some of the most beautiful painting, sculpture and furniture you have ever seen ( I discover superb french painters I never heard of...). You cannot miss it if you go to LA !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickt460
40,Wonderful Attraction!,Loved my visit to the Getty with friends! The day was glorious & the architecture as well as the art & the fantastic views of the entire city are incredible. Had lunch in the dining room which is lovely & the food was outstanding with good service. Taking the tram is fun too! so I say weather you live in Los Angeles or are there for a visit be sure to take advantage of this wonderful experience!.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenF202
50,Great Place For Kids,"Our grandchildren were visiting and we were looking for a new activity for them. We'd heard that the Getty Center is very kid-friendly. It is!The tram from the parking lot is fun and you see beautiful views of LA and Malibu on the way up. There are many docents and employees that are very helpful. We found the Family Room a great place for the kids to hang out, plus there is a central plaza where the kids can run around while the parents have lunch or coffee. I noticed but we didn't get to it that there's a nice play area on the ground level. Maybe next time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryReckas
50,Beautiful museum,Incredible architecture and art. The museum is designed so that the visitor doesn't succumb to museum fatigue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856amyr
50,Splendid gardens and incredible architecture,The Getty is an amazing attraction housing a large art collection. We got there near sunset so spent much of our time in the lovely gardens. Even in winter there were so many things in bloom. The golden sunset light on the bulidings created a peaceful ambience. We will definitely return on future trips to view the museum's collections more thoroughly.You can see many photos here: http://sanderfeinberg.com/photos/getty-center-los-angeles/,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanderf2016
40,"Interesting, friendly enviroment","You don't need to pay for tickets. Only for parking.It's a beautiful place with lots of pictures, statues, art exhibits from ancient times to modern day. Take an audio guide and go inside. There are some exhibits you are not allowed to take a picture, but mostly I took a lot of them. Outdoor is also beautiful with fountains, ponds, flowers and trees. The only minus was absence of water in the pools and ponds. From a distance you couldn't distinguish it because of blue paint. But approaching it disappointed a bit. It was due to hot weather and desire to save water. Though I think that close circulating wouldn't do any harm.Outside there are lots of drinking water points which is good.Halls are divided according to periods of time, so you move from one century to another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamop2014
50,Flawless,"For something that is free, could it be any better? Likely not. First off the tram ride up to the actual center is amazing, has great views of the city and the ocean. It's relaxing and fine. Once you get up the center though, the architecture is amazing. On top of that is the art gallery which is well designed and easy to follow. The garden is beautiful, and the views of the city while sitting in there are quite great. The staff were fun and friendly, but there is so much to see you can't possibly do it in a morning. We had plans that afternoon so didn't go into all the buildings and explore what the Getty really had to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristenmerke
50,Don't miss it,Wonderful art. Great Buildings and incredible views. The staff were really nice and the lunch was tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4738UBmaryf

50,Friendly and accessible,"This is a beautiful, free museum that seemed to actually WANT people to be there! You do have to pay to park in the parking garage and for food if you eat at one of their restaurants or food carts, but the museum itself was free. I was a little surprised the their Impressionist exhibit seemed a bit smaller than I expected, however the gardens are amazing and the view is spectacular. Been sure to take one of the guided tours that are offered every day. I especially enjoyed the one of the gardens. I had never before considered garden design as sculpture. We spent a wonderful morning here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbrock62
50,Architecture with style,So much to see plus the views of the City. Beautiful stonework and layout and it's free! Friendly staff and delicious food as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdt782
50,"Buildings first, collection second","This is a must, not just for LA, but for life. Clinging onto the side of a mountain and served by monorails and golf carts the Getty Center could easily be a Bond villain's hideout. However, it's unlikely any villain would have managed such an architectural masterpiece. The views and the buildings and the ability to roam around come first here. The collections are changeable and of variable quality; but a visit here really isn't about them. Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547tomo
50,Don't forget to get the Getty!,The Getty Center - Free except for parking fees. A free tram ride takes you to the top. Amazing views. The Reuben's exhibit was awe inspiring - 4 large tapestries.

Amazing quality art experience which is FREE except for parking or taxi ride fare. This is a beautiful space with art of many styles for a wide audience.

50,Beautiful Setting,The setting is spectacular and a big hill overlooking LA and the Pacific. The museum is big and we only saw one small part: the Reubens exhibit of four large tapestries. We had a live tour guide who was terrific. They also have free iPods that you can carry around with earphones that explain many of the exhibits. Next time in LA we are going back to see more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcduane
50,love this place,"If you haven't been to the getty sunset, you should make it a point to go. Fabulous. Also great are the free concerts they have during the summertime. The view is wonderful, it gets a nice diverse, well behaved crowd, you can have a nice picnic there, look at some art and listen to music.

When you are at Getty enjoy your meal in one of the (surprisingly) good restaurants!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobR-010
50,"Nice drive up to the hills, great views and enjoyable experience",My friend and I decided to go to the Getty after reading reviews on TripAdvisor.It was a very scenic drive to the Getty and undercover parking was nice as much as it was paid because it was rainy.We stopped at the cafe for a bite to eat before we went in and were pleasantly surprised.Inside (and outside) the Getty we found a variety of art in different forms and were pleasantly surprised. We in fact ended up staying until close time.The views from the Getty and the ride up there were absolutely magnificent. Would definitely take a drive up there again for the cost of parking (no entry fees).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camperth
50,World class art,"Truly not to be missed. The greatest art museum on the west coast. Something for everyone. Sculptures, contemporary, old masters and more. Great special exhibits.

50,"Diverse,outstanding art with beautiful gardens.",An outstanding venue to see excellent works. The view from atop the mountain add to the experience.The open center of the complex makes the site very inviting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intrepid1955
50,Excellent architecture and panoramic views of LA,This is a must when you visit LA. I liked more the architecture (Richard Meier) and the gardens than the exhibits themselves.I recommend taking the architecture and landscape tours. The tour highlights the way Richard Meier works with modules and how his architecture frames the amazing LA views. The garden that is a contrast to the architecture is also an amazing experience.We also had lunch in the center's restaurant and was very good and adequately priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeboraS280
50,Spectacular in everyway with interesting family history,"Bus ride up here was part of a Starline City Sightseeing package (paid).

The museum is free, it offers stone buildings with unique architecture, beautiful landscaped gardens displaying the use of steel, wood and stone, fantastic art exhibitions, food and beverages, and clean facilities.

50,Better grounds than art collection but well worth the visit,"Commanding a spectacular billion dollar view -- which is probably the value of the property upon which this sits -- the Getty Center is one of the most dramatic art museums in the world. The gardens are lovely. The permanent collection isn't yet up to other museums of this size and stature, probably because the Getty is still relatively new, but they've been making acquisitions at a breakneck pace and it's getting better. Some of the visiting exhibitions are fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333
50,A must in LA,"Great architecture! Pretty Gardens and good exhibits. Parking is $15 dollars, but the museum is free! After you park, you take the tram to the amazing mountaintop complex.

50,Spend the entire day,"What an amazing, beautiful place and to top it off... it's free; well, with paid $15 parking but it's well worth it.Spent only a couple hours here and felt like I could have spent the entire day. Many exciting exhibits to look at, especially the Rubens which is the featured exhibit. A great place to spend a day or at least, half a day.Just be sure to ask which exhibits you're allowed to take pictures of and remember to turn off your camera flash :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lov3ly
50,Peace and Art,"The Getty Center is truly unique, a mixture of architecture, nature, and culture. Its strong suit isn't its art collection, it is the way in which everything is situated.

I've recently availed myself of their tours and it has made my experience all the better (especially the architecture tour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArdiBo

50,My love affair with the Getty!,"I am a Los Angeleno who started going to the Getty Center on Day 1, October 12, 2007. I have not stop going since then. The Getty Center is the sanctuary of Los Angeles, everything about it deems an award, from architecture, to ""the"" restaurant, to top it off, its collections of art and objects.My favorite is the Manuscript Illumination Department. The collection at the Getty Center is the best in world. The Manuscript Dept. curators do such an excellent job in bringing in the most exquisite and tasteful exhibitions, its make Pierpont Morgan Library's collection looks secondary. The free demonstrations and lectures/talks are beneficial to all who like indepth knowledge of a particular subject. I say kudos to the Education Department for their support in teaching and continue education to the public at large.In spare time, if nothing else I would go to the Getty, just for the views!Yvonne F.Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MVYvonneF

And more importantly you dont pay a cent to get in.But, its a great place to visit if you're an art lover. For a regular tourist, you might get bored after a couple of hours.

50,Well worth your time,"Unlike many other cities, not much is free in Los Angeles. Museums, gardens and other major attractions are fairly pricey, so here is a real bargain. Free admission, but there is a catch: Parking is $15. Of course, if you are smart you can avoid this cost. There are regular busses from Westwood and other closeby locations where you can find parking. Also, you can park about a quarter mile south, where there is street parking, and then just walk.As for the Getty Center itself, the museum exhibits are world class, with works of Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh and everyone important. The none permanent exhibits are usually really good, and the gardens are, for Los Angeles, quite impressive. But it's the architecture that will captivate most visitors. It is really unlike any other structure that I have visited anywhere in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483warrenm
50,Getty Center in the Winter,"Beautiful site to view beautiful works of art. Getty Center sits high on a hillside. Impressionists and beautiful furniture, plus so much more. Go on a Garden tour and the Docent will explain the uses of the various plants. The view is spectacular. The sunsets are breathtaking. Take a camera, flash is not allowed in the exhibits), you will be amazed at the beautiful sunsets!. You can see forever - from downtown L.A. - Catalina (on a clear day), but you can always see the ocean. Take a snack or buy a snack and relax and enjoy the view between seeing the works of art. There is also a very nice restaurant, that is a real treat! Borrow a free headset that will describe various works of art. You will need to leave your drivers licence, in exchange for borrowing the headset, when it is returned, your license will be returned.There are plenty of clean restrooms. Elevators or stairs. If you have questions, there is always someone around to help.You will park your car and ride the tram up to the Getty Center entrance, very nice view! Umbrellas are always available for sunny or wet days, free of charge. Pay for parking before you reenter the garage. Take as many people that can comfortable and legally fit in your car, you only pay a $15.00 parking fee per car.Expect a relaxing day seeing beautiful, priceless works of Art.You may want to see Getty Villa first. If you pay for parking at Getty Villa, show your parking receipt and parking is free @ the Center, same day only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LADSunset
50,Great Museum,"Starting with a tram ride up the mountain this museum offers up a huge collection of antiquities and artwork from masters such as Rembrandt. The grounds are immaculate and the vistas are stunning. If you go on a clear day you can see all the way to Catalina Island on one side and the snow capped mountains on the other. The park like setting is very nice for the whole family to relax and play in the grass. It's definitely worth the effort - don't miss it. Admission to the museum is free, however they get $15 to park your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl081
50,Beyond the art,"LA has some great museums and this is no exception. However even if you're not in the mood for something indoors, this is a great place to have lunch and see the city - from views of downtown to the beach. Great place to enjoy lunch with out of town guests too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/601ga
50,Brill!!,The Getty centre offers a fun and very cheap day out. Beautiful art and breathtaking views of LA! Definitely worthwhile visiting the Getty! You can easily spend 4-5 hours at the Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sciems14
50,Beautiful Art & Beautiful Views,"The description doesn't get much better than the title of this review. The pieces of art at the Getty are stunning and not to be outdone the view of the Pacific Ocean from this mountain top is equally stunning. Come for the art, stay for the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPDucks
50,The Getty is always great!,"No matter what season or time of day, a visit to the Getty Center does not disappoint! It's especially fun when the Getty is hosting one of their Family Festivals. Check their website for dates!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aronaki
50,Spectacular - A Must See !,"Spectacular views, architecture, landscaping and wonderful exhibits.If you are in LA - you do not want to miss this. Be sure to make parking reservations though if you are driving. The admission is free but you do have to pay for parking. Their main restaurant, while expensive, is well worth it. Be sure to sign up for the landscape tour and see the grounds as well as the exhibits, but be sure it's a sunny day (as most days in LA are). Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2564JNmaryr
30,Spectacular setting; the art is an afterthought,The setting and the logistics are great. The architecture is stunning (although not always in a good way). But the art collection is haphazard; the curation seems to be an afterthought; and the architect seems to have been given license to place the buildings and the setting in the forefront of your consciousness at all times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DlovesJ
40,Crowded world class museum,"This is an amazing place. An astonishing situation and all the rest - views, exhibits, etc.Having said that, I'm not sure that it's an enjoyable experience. If you've been to the Met or the Prado or The Hermitage and stood in lines and been jostled by crowds and walked and walked and walked then you know what it's like. Finding it is an ordeal. Then the parking, then a crowded shuttle. And I couldn't help but think that this organization had an awful lot of money that it had to spend.If you have to choose between this and the Getty Villa, choose the Villa. Everything about it is easier. It's really beautiful. You make reservations and the number of people are controlled. Parking is relatively easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGPV

50,"Educational, Beautiful and Enlightening","Spent some time here on a day off and learned a lot of great informational facts about the start of the Getty Center, architectural info, took a central garden tour (I highly recommend) learning there is a reason for every breed of tree and plant on the grounds.The artwork is wonderful with new exhibits coming in year round. There are food and beverages available so you can spend a good part of the day here and grab a bite to eat in between tours or exhibits. Parking gets crowded so go earlier in the day. Sign up for all the free tours. Admission is free but parking will cost you $15",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxTheTrip
50,Beautiful,"The location, service, architecture, cafes, gardens....the list goes on. There are just so many reasons to visit and revisit this wonderful museum. The free tours that are available are a great way to get aquatinted w the history and purpose of the Getty. If you find yourself w some free time on a nice day....go! And enjoy the day at a beautiful location and don't forget to check out the sunset while your there. One of God's many contributions to art and beauty can be appreciated at a vantage point above the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jzarunner
50,A museum with a great view.,"The Getty Center is one of a kind. It is always free, which means NO entrance fee. This museum is located on top of a hill ( part of Santa Monica mountains) and on a clear day one has an incredible view to the beach and toward down town. If you come to LA, don't miss this place. It is a fun place, even if you are not into museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mathesonu
50,Perfection!,"A must see even if you have 1day in LA! Whats not to love-it's free, magnificent views, so much history, art, culture and definitely a gem. They've perfected a museum into a beautiful location..the most amazing views of LA! The grounds are immaculate, easy to navigate and a lot of places to sit, relax, have a coffee/snack and enjoy the views and take in the culture. Everyone is so informative and its a great place to spend a day. Note: this area is very congested with traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suziqq1
50,A must see when in LA,"Even if you are not a ""museum"" person, you would still enjoy the location, the views as well as the beautiful landscaping/architechture this place has to offer. Bring a picnic blanket to sit outside, or enjoy a nice lunch at the cafe. Plan on spending an entire afternoon here.I highly recommend this place, you will not regret it. Check the museum website for special events such as free concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linbay
40,A must see for visitors to L.A.,"You can easily spend a whole day at The Getty Center and have enough to do. Lovers of art will have plenty to see but one can also spend time just sitting around and enjoying the view - they have one of the best views of L.A. in one of the building balconies overlooking 405 Freeway with views of the Pacific, Catalina Island and on clear days, all the way to Westwood, Hollywood and downtown L.A. I always take new visitors to L.A. here as it provides them with a quick, long distance visual tour of the city. And with only the parking fee to pay ($15 the last time we visited - used to be $5), there can be very few places with better value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottLB
50,"Breathtaking site, varied collection","Visit for the site alone, high above the canyons and overlooking the Pacific (and the 405). The docent for the special exhibit was very good--I was engaged even though tapestries are not my interest! There is something for everyone--Decorative arts, Rembrandt, Impressionism, Sculpture, Primitive and outdoor spaces. The dining room is quite good. Not all dining options are open all days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonamesforme
50,Good luck finding a more gorgeous view,"While the art displays at the Getty are second-to-none, my favorite thing about this location is their VIEW! From the botanical gardens outside, you can see all the way to Redondo Beach and beyond! The one thing I haven't done here is to go at NIGHT, but that is a big goal for 2015.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kungfoofighter82
50,Amazing collection in an amazing setting,"The Getty is a gem of Los Angeles and really world class when it comes to the collection that they have on display every day, plus they are constantly bringing through exhibitions that keep it new and different every time you come. The setting is great too and worth coming just to relax in the gardens. Also, and this is one of the most surprising aspects, the cafe is really good and not very expensive either. A must see for anyone visiting or living in Los Angeles...single, couple, or family, it doesn't matter, great for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonk00
50,Spectacular Views,"One of the best locations in Los Angeles to see spectacular views of the city ... from the ocean to Downtown Los Angeles! Additionally, what better way to add some culture to your life while roaming around the museum. The Getty Center is hands down at the top of my list when hosting out of town guests however I love going anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPompilio

50,One of the most beautiful places in Los Angeles,"The art at the Getty is wonderful, to be sure, but the grounds and the view will take your breath away. Pack a picnic lunch and spend some time in the grounds, which are exquisite. A must-see! If you don't want to pack a lunch, there are also a couple of really good places to eat. Don't miss the Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmconnors
50,You must see this space!,"This was my second visit but certainly the best. You can immerse yourself in art, gardens and architecture all in one beautiful setting overlooking Los Angeles, The art is hard to compare vs most other museums. The setting can't be beat. The gardens were a little wilted due to the draught in Southern California but still excellent. Get here early if you can. The museum is free but costs $15 to park. Overall excellent value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk

The elegance is everywhere since we got on the tram. The artwork insides is comparable to other museum. Audioguide is free. Plus, the building is astonishingly beautiful. We took photo in every corner, and feel they are best during our LA stay. Besides, don't forget they have best panoramic view of LA metropolis.Parking is easy. However it cost $15, but is really worthy. Take your time, and then you are in the mood to explore the museum's beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benjamin0723

50,DON'T MISS THIS if you come to LA - plan to spend the day there.,"Incredible art museum on an incredible site. You ahve to see it to believe it. Bring your own picnic lunch, or buy food thwere. Have a glass of wine or beer from their stand, and enjoy what has to be the most spectacular view of Los Angeles. A MUST SEE!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SactoDiner
50,Awesome!,"After visiting the Getty Centre on my own in August, I took the opportunity to share it with a friend this trip.We did the Architecture Tour again - a must! The guide I had in August was better though ... more interesting little snippets of info.I still remember the parting words of the August Guide ""The Getty Centre is described as a museum containing works of art, I prefer to think of it as a work of art containing a museum!"" Says it all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyQ3
50,"Excellent, just wished had more time","Everything is very well set up for the large number of visitors coming. The tram to get to the buildings is the first nice touch, the buildings and gardens are beautiful. The actual museum has a great collection, I just wished we had more time to spend there, minimum a full day would be good to have, which we didn't. We took a tour (the museum and the tour are free), the tour guide was excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brvancouver
50,Free entry...parking $15,"It is amazing that JPG wanted to enrich as many people's lives as possible by making arrangements to allow the masses to view his art collections (for free) after his death. Of course, the parking garage is a separate entity ($15). However, if you can manage to visit both Getty museums in a single day, you will be rewarded with only having to pay the $15 parking fee once. You must ask for a voucher at the visitor info desk of the first museum you visit...and ask them to fill it out before you leave. Then, when you visit the other museum's visitor info desk, they will exchange your voucher for a validated parking pass. I recommend visiting the Villa in the morning, then the Center.Now, for the art: just go. It's free, and it is spectacular. A special bonus is the sunset view of the entire city if you are there late afternoon/early evening. The extra step of having to use the tram to get to the complex is not a big deal. Think of it as a Disney ride : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZdesert-rat
50,If in LA you should go!,"The place has beautiful gardens and a mix of art and open spaces. You can easily spend half day walking across the areas and expositions, have lunch at the cafe with an amazing view of the city. They have several sculptures inside and outside and a lot of space for the kids to play. Besides all of this, it is free (you only pay for parking which is about 15 USD).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuMarques
50,Wonderful,"If you have any interest in art or architecture the Getty Centre is an absolute must. You'll really need more than a half day to fully enjoy a visit.

50,Oh the humanity!,The art was breathtaking and so beautifully displayed. Wear comfortable shoes as the center is huge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7132YAjanes
50,"Memorable day, wonderful collections in stunning location.",its not just the exhibits that are excellent. The building steals the show. We took the garden tour. Only 45 mins and filled with lots of information that makes sense of the building and grounds. Not a place I'd take young kids to though. The ones we came across were either bored and misbehaving or running precariously close to the exhibits. People were getting caught out by the two main cafes closing at 3pm. You can still get drinks and small snacks from carts though. Allow a day to see everything properly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bn1
50,Not just a typical Museum,"This is must see for several reasons: architecture, views, gardens, and definitely the art itself. We were amazed that there is no cost for admission to the Getty Center and the excellent audio tour is also complimentary (on iphones where you access info by selection of piece rather than listening to long taped commentary). There is a charge for parking of $15. A tram which runs frequently takes visitors from the parking lot and has great views as you ascend the hill to the Getty. The multiple buildings have a beautiful, uniform stone architecture that gleams bright in the sunlight. Of the permanent collection, definitely see the large number of very famous Impressionist paintings (Van Goh, Cèzanne, Degas, Renoir, etc). A traveling exhibit that is also recommended is the beautiful Ruben's Eucharist tapestries. The center is large with many buildings and outside sculptures and viewpoints. The “gardens-as-art” design for the outside spaces probably make it worth multiple return visits throughout the year. There are 2 restaurants and food kiosks with good quality food at several price levels. We spent 4-5 hours and didn’t see everything, so definitely want to return next time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toby-Likes-Travel
50,Really interesting!,"This is a really fun museum. There are alot of things to see, with the Getty's many exhibitions.I like the fact that the Getty Center's exhibitions are of various subjects. They're not the same subjects, but from different regions, countries, etc. The Getty The architecture itself is very beautiful. I really enjoy the Getty, and I recommend it to anyone. It's a great experience!There's also a restaurant, a cafe and the Garden Terrace Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGravelle

50,Not Many More Positives I Can Add But Hats Off to the Staff,"The Getty Center is a joy to visit. The grounds, the art, the view...it has it all and I find it hard to believe anyone would find negatives about this wonderful museum. My visit was fantastic for all these reasons but I wanted to comment on the staff who put the visit over the top.Everyone I encountered, from the cafe counter folks to the gallery security guards were friendly, helpful and pleasant. I visited with a baby and I was always greeted warmly and once even given advice on where to find changing and nursing space.Kudos to everyone at The Getty Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michele_Emeritus
50,Wonderful Museum,"For anyone who hasn't been there yet, I would highly recommend a trip to the Getty. It's exhibitions, location and even its restaurants are all first class. Additionally, the design of the Getty and its architecture is amazing, plus on a clear day you have a wonderful view of west LA. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithStephen
50,A visual delight,"Lots to see at the Getty centre. Some fabulous artwork (Monet and Van Gogh), gorgeous park and garden, and spectacular views of L.A.from heaps of different points around the centre.A nice lunch at the garden cafe.I recommend doing one of the free tours even just to work out how to get around the giant centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LozzaCam

20,An average experience,"The view is stunning. Period. That's where the good part of the visit ends. The museum would be nice if the staff could handle young grade-school aged children in the museum area. My young boys have been to the Prado and MET, and they know art is 'not to be touched'...however, neither place treated them as inconsequentially as this one. (In fact, both places had staff chatting with them about art.) The staff here was jumpy every time my kids moved an inch and kept coming to warn them without reason and rather rudely, unmindful of the fact that the parents were standing right there! Clearly, they want kids to just roll around in the grassy patch below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pony101
50,Wonderful view. Not to miss when in LA!,"I went to this place because of users' reviews on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed at all.. The view is amazing, specially at the sunset.. A wonderful atmosphere of calm and quiet. I went by car, so I'm not sure if it is easy to go by public transportation (as most touristic places in LA, unfortunately). The gardens are beautiful and peaceful. I didn't try the restaurants, but I really feel like trying sometime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vaninha2013
50,This is worth your time!,"Even though I have been to the L.A. area many times over the years, somehow I never visited the Getty Center. Four of us spent a few hours here and were blown away by the massive grounds on a hill, the unique architecture, the beautiful gardens, and, of course, the artwork too. Even the tram ride was fun! It's impressive that there is no admission charge, making this place accessible to everyone. Parking is available for a reasonable fee, and there is public transportation that stops nearby. There were quite a few buildings and because we spent so much time in the first two, we didn't get to go in all of them.This is a place that can be enjoyed on so many different levels by all ages and backgrounds. We saw many families with young children outside strolling in the gardens and playing on the grass. People can just go see specific artwork of a certain period, or take the time to check out everything. There are commentaries on iPods that you can check out, which really helps explain the highlighted pieces.Definitely a must-see, and you can't beat free admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_Michigan_Mom7
50,Just do it!,"Have been to the Center a few times--and loved it every time! Last time went with my 9-year old son. He is opposed to the idea of art museums--and was not in favor of the visit. However, from the moment we boarded the tram going up, he changed his mind. He enjoyed the grounds, the architecture, the views--and the beautiful sunset. Granted, the art collection was not of great interest to him--but at this point just getting him to go inside to hear the names of the artists is an achievement....and this year he tells me he wants to go back. Kids should be able to enjoy the place even if they get to just run around--great art and great architecture will work on them by osmosis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kis1999
50,FREE-- Even if you don't love art-- it is worth the trip for the view,We had about 2 hours to spend at the Getty-- and really enjoyed the quick tour. It is free (parking is about $10) and the views from the balconies are spectacular. If you are an art lover-- you will find much to enjoy here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcfiddle

50,At day a Getty Center and then the Villa,"What a phenomenal value!! We did both in one day and all it cost was $15 for parking, no entrance fees, etc etc. Both places are incredible to visit - depending on how much time you want to spend at each, you can do both in one full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RFL0506
50,"Non ""artsy"" couple loved it!","We definitely aren't ""artsy"" people. I mean, I'm a photographer, but I'm actually not really super interested in classical art...but I really enjoyed the Getty center! It was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. The architecture there is beautiful, the view is breathtaking, and the art there was actually fascinating to me even though I normally don't care for artsy fartsy type things. I can't believe this place is free! (You do have to pay 15 for parking, but still).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kate169
30,Nothing from 1900 on...,"Is it wrong to say I was disappointed by the Getty?After taking the tram from the parking lot to the amazing mountaintop complex, I was sure I was in for an amazing art experience. And yes, there are some treasures here. But the collection is surprisingly small for a museum this large.Also, don't expect anything remotely modern. There's nothing newer than 1900 here. For a museum of this size, that's baffling.The buildings themselves are gorgeous, built of huge chiseled stone. Each building has maybe a dozen rooms with various artwork. While you can take pictures of seemingly everything, a guard stopped me from snapping a picture of James Ensor's Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889. ""Even without a flash?"" I asked. ""Yep,"" he said. ""Why?"" ""I don't know,"" he said. Someone should alert Google not to have a billion images of it - google.com/search?q=Chri…I love going to an art museum and getting lost for hours and hours. But the Getty is one of those musuems that has a million portraits of fat, old dukes and duchesses. I find those kind of boring.I did enjoy Van Gogh's Irises, the sculpture of Andromeda and the Sea Monster, Bouguereau's Young Girl Defending Herself against Eros and Gérard's Belisarius.Another strange issue with the Getty is that they have some paintings mounted very high off the ground. While you can view them from a distance, when you approach closer, the glare from the lights blinds you from seeing them. Since they're already 20 feet in the air, that means you can't get a good look at them.The Getty is a lovely facility by itself, and worth visiting for classical art lovers. Fans of modern art should look elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BowmanInc
50,Great Place to Check Out~,"The admission is free. Parking before 5pm is $15, and $10 after 5pm. Architecture is extraordinary, and u can enjoy the view of Los Angeles as well!!!Coffee cart: I got a mocha, and cookie!!! The chocolate flavor in the mocha was rich, but did not ""overpower"" the taste of coffee!!! The cookie was soft and not too sweet!!!

Amazing architecture, I could have sat outside for a whole day just taking in the magical travertine walls and floors, the angles, the light and the shadows. Amazing. And I will do that one day....... inside world class art rivalling most/all the iconic museums/galleries of europe. I didn't know you could find something SO SPECIAL in smoggy LA. Do yourself a favour, treat yourself with a day to the Getty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HellasHellas
40,"Indoor/Outdoor, but all fabulous!","The Getty Center is one place that I make sure to visit every time I'm in LA. This is one of my favorite places in the city - not because it has THE BEST art or THE BEST architecture - but because of the indoor/outdoor experience that you get as so few museums.I love (LOVELOVELOVE) the gardens and, being from Chicago, I love the fact that I can enjoy them well into the ""colder"" months. During my last visit we only had a couple of hours, so we did a tour of the beautiful gardens and then enjoyed the Josef Koudelka exhibit before hitting the cafe for a little bit of lunch. I could have stayed for the entire day, but we had a plane to catch.The Getty is a must visit if you are in LA - whether you live there or you're just visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4284GRsarahc
50,Stunning - inside and out,"Spent an afternoon here while visiting SoCA. Entrance to the Museum is free to the public, but there is a parking fee. Once you park you car, take the tram up to the Museum. There are ongoing docent led tours that are also free. We took the architectural tour, and some of my group also took the landscaping tour. After the architectural tour, I spent the remainder of my time exploring both the permanent and temporary exhibits. A lovely way to spend a day, wandering among the beautiful art works and gorgeous grounds. The views of LA are beautiful. There are food stations and cafe for when you need to sit and rest. There is also the Getty Villa in Malibu that encompasses his collection of ancient Roman and Greek artworks which is also free to the public. A truly enjoyable way to spend a day or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JinFO
50,Complete Immersion,"There are so many extraordinary aspects to this fabulous museum. The Tram ride to the top of the hill really allows a visitor to leave the city behind and immerse themselves into the complete art experience. There is a wide range of art for every taste from an exceptional garden to (my favorite) illuminated manuscripts from the dark ages. The Family room is a must for kids, it allows them to see and understand art without the pretension that most kids dislike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellentreanor
50,Amazing! A must do in LA,Spent a full day here and had a blast.even if you aren't an art lover the views and the gardens and architecture will blow you away.The artworks were sensational with my favourites being the impressionists.The special exhibition was on Rubens' the triumph of the Eucharist tapestries.The detail in these huge tapestries is mind boggling.There are 4 main galleries of art works and decorative pieces as well as many other buildings.Kids are looked after too.The food is not cheap but you can bring your own and have a picnic in the magnificent gardens.The best bit is that entry and the electronic guides and tours are all free.Parking can cost up to $15.Do yourself a favour and go see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryW584
50,Excellent collections in a unique atmosphere,"High-quality collections of paintings, sculpture and statuary, along with special exhibitions - I really enjoyed the Rubens Eucharist Tapestries. I love art museums, but I tend to get overwhelmed after a while. Not so here - an outdoor balcony with expansive views of LA or the botanical gardens is always just a few steps away. The contrast refreshes and allows you to shift perspectives. If you go on a weekday mid-day, I expect you'll, like me, have to work around some large school groups, but they can be entertaining in their own right. I'll be back when next in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEM196204
50,Spectacular,"Spectacular Rubens on display, outstanding architecture and beautiful gardens. We had lunch on site from the self service Cafe which served food made from locally sourced ingredients of high quality. A serene and welcoming location admist of all the hustle and bustle of LA. Great 360 views. Not to be missed. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJTeddy1

30,Beautiful garden and buildings,"There is no entrance fee in this museum, but the parking costs about 20$. There is a short railtride from the parking lot to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mark0h
30,"Bad museum, great building and grounds","Go here, but don't expect an even decent museum experience. Art collection is small and the pieces are unremarkable. Their ads are somewhat misleading - ""Van Gough: always on exhibit"" while technically true, you expect several pieces to view. They have one. Several Monets which are nice. Unfortunatly, all their decent pieces are in one gallery which makes it crowded and really loud and noisy. People are talking in above average conversation and even kids are screaming and crying. You can't enjoy the art. We also went on a docent tour. I go on these regularly elsewhere, and never have I been on a slower moving, more dull and uninteresting one.However, the grounds and building are AMAZING. Come here for that. Beautiful views, too. Absolutely gorgeous and fun to explore and just lay out and enjoy the atmosphere. To me it feels like you're i the stereotypical futuristic utopian society buildings shown in sci-fi movies. Good for 2 hours minimum, but could spend half a day easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffT860

50,Wonderful,Both art and architecture superb with great service and free to boot. Highly recommended and would love to go back and spend more time there. Allow at least half a day. Made the mistake of using VIP tours to get there - but once there had a wonderful time and came home by taxi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Audreyslittleone
50,A very interesting visit. Great if you are into history and appreciate art.,Allow a good few hours to visit here. We visited the Getty Villa the day we were to leave Los Angeles on an overseas flight that evening. Very relaxing way to fill in time before a long flight. No entrance fee but parking is $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmfenton
50,Windy!!,"Getting there was straightforward.The parking structure was very crowded and took us 10 minutes to find the parking. It was 15$ for all day- flat fee. We planned to be there for at least 4-5 hrs.The museum was very modern and it has multiple gardens and terraces for amazing view. Although it was 70 degrees, the terrace was super windy and cold! Make sure you carry additional jacket!The photography exhibition was disappointing. There were not many pictures and the quality of the work was average.they do have great art collection. Photography was allowed as long as no flash was used.The center was very stroller friendly and staffs were professional. I ended up spend 6hrs there and we took amazing pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzzyJas
50,Best Museum in the L.A. area,"The admission is free but the parking is $15 ($10 after 5:00pm). However, if you take a few friends with you, you can all chip in and get a very inexpensive and mind-blowing experience. It's located in the Santa Monica just off of the San Diego (405) Freeway near UCLA. You can see some beautiful plants in the Central Garden which is 134,000 square feet as well as other gardens. You can get a beautiful a view of L.A., the Pacific Ocean and San Gabriel Mountains while walking down a tree-lined path. It also has a natural ravine and waterfall. I love taking pictures, so this museum offers many areas where you can get some great shots.It includes four pavilions that have various art from the 1600s-1800s, various European paintings and sculptures. It's amazing how much this museum holds. It's totally worth the value. Plan to spend a great deal of time here since there is so much to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy

50,The Getty! Don't miss it.,"The Getty Center, a World Class Art Museum, is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Being a lover of art, architecture, gardens and great food, this place has them all and it never disappoints.The art is consistently fabulous and beautifully shown off in buildings that are themselves, art. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as the art is spread around in numerous buildings on the property. The buildings are all made from travertine stone imported from Italy. Certainly beautiful, but after a long day of walking, the stone can be unforgiving. There are elevators to get from floor to floor, but I recommend the stairs. The staircases too, are artfully created and designed.Pick up a free self guided tour on iPod at the main entrance and just plug in to learn about the art, artists and history of some of the most impressive pieces of art in the world. They have outstanding traveling exhibits but also house an outstanding collection of their own which includes European and American art, from medieval times to the present. Many of these awe inspiring works of art are on the upper levels of the buildings and offer skylights to view the pieces in natural light. Afterward, go outside the nearby doors and take in the views of downtown Los Angeles to the east or better yet, the ocean to the west. On a clear day, if you're lucky to get one of those in L.A., the views are amazing. The sunset from up there is also quite impressive and not to be missed. Be sure to go on a day when the museum is open late enough to catch it.The gardens are beautiful year round. This is after all, Southern California where there's always something in bloom. Grab a coffee from one of the nearby carts and sit around the manicured garden to enjoy it. Wander through and soak up the beauty of the flowers and trees. Sit on one of the many benches available and listen to the fountains that invite you to linger.Be sure to plan to spend all day at The Getty and dine in the cafe. The cafeteria style restaurant has a massive selection of choices all made from locally sourced ingredients. The food is always wonderful so be sure to time your visit to insure you have lunch.The museum is free to get in, but parking is $15. Small price to pay for the treasures you'll see.Lastly, don't miss the the gift shop. On your way out, return your guided tour device and the gift shop is right there. Filled with books, journals, calendars, gift items, art kits and more. If you enjoyed this amazing gallery, and I guarantee you will, it will be easy to find something to take home to help you remember your trip.The Getty is located at Sepulveda Blvd and Getty Center DriveOn the West side of Los AngelesFor GPS use:1200 Sepulveda Blvd.Los Angeles, Ca 90049Tuesday–Friday and Sunday 10:00 a.m.–5:30 p.m.Saturday 10:00 a.m.–9:00 p.m.Closed MondaysOpen Mondays, December 22 and December 29, 2014.- See more at: http://www.getty.eduSee photographs of my visit there on my travel blog at: vickitravels.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaPics

40,A rich experience,"We didn't totally know what to expect at the Getty and we were pleasantly surprised. The history, stunning art and sculptures and the beautiful architecture and view made for a wonderful morning.One tip - get there right when it opens to avoid huge line-ups later on.

50,Magnificent architectural building with stunning art installations.,"The building itself is a masterpiece, the surrounding grounds are beautifully landscaped and encompass various stunning art installations which involve all your senses as you wander around. There are views over Los Angeles all the way to the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica. If that isn't enough the buildings contain some of the most famous paintings, sculptures, and tapestries in the whole world! In each gallery there is something that takes your breath away. Talk to the guides standing in the galleries and they will give you a lot of information about the paintings and artists that you may not know unless you have a degree in Art History! There is a restaurant/cafe on site with reasonable prices and a good choice of hot and cold food/snacks. The best thing about this place is that these wonderful exhibits are free and therefore accessible to everyone, not just the well off! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_flying_goose
50,"Overall, a wonderful experience","The Getty center has a lot to offer. If you're a casual visitor like me, you get to see a wonderful sample of european collections and a breathtaking view over part of the Los Angeles basin. The qualitiy of exposure is very good: the lighting, object selection and display, with excellent audiovisual and information panels. Other then that, the museum offers a wide array of thematic guided tours, not just concerning the exhibitions, but also the architecture and gardens as well. Also, there is a great deal of family activities and workshops in the center's agenda. The cafeteria has a nice outdoor space to enjoy a meal or a small snack. All this for free (except for the parking). I spent 3 hours in the Getty which literally flew.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielmL1694QO

Yes, you do pay a small fee for parking, but from the winding scenic tram ride up the hill to the ride back down to your car, everything is free- even the audio headsets. The architecture is stunning, the art is priceless, the gardens delight and the meals and snacks delicious.

I was however really impressed with the generosity and warmness of the volunteers; the activities they had in store for the kids and of course the art collection they had. I was quite blown away with how impressive the collection was considering that we did not have to pay for anything except the parking fees.

50,"Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne, Oh My!","I've been to The Getty Center four times now and each time, it gets better and better. There are five separate gallery pavilions so plan on a repeat visit to fully take it all in. Don't expect to cover everything all in one day. It's just not possible. For first timers, here are answers to questions I get asked all the time about The Getty Center. It's open Tuesday through Friday and Sunday, 10 am to 5:30 pm. Saturdays 10 to 9 pm. Closed on Mondays, January 1st, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. Does it cost to get in? No, it's free, but the parking is not. Parking is in a parking garage and costs $15 ($10 after 5 p.m.) From the garage, take an elevator to the ground level where a tram takes you the actual Center. There are elevators scattered throughout The Center so don't be intimated by the wide and rather extensive set of concrete steps you see soon after exiting the tram. The steps lead up to the actual Center. I always take the stairs because not only do I look upon a visit to The Getty as a chance to see some fantastic art, but a visit is also sort of a workout due to all the walking you have to do to get around this huge complex. There’s a lot of walking. Cameras are allowed and you can photograph works of art, but flashes are not always allowed. Check inside each of the four buildings (called pavilions). Are food and beverages sold at The Center? A huge Yes! In fact, some people come to The Center just to eat. There's a fine-dining restaurant, called The Restaurant which requires reservations, there are also two different cafes, plus two different coffee carts in different locations that sell coffee and an assortment of other food items. Plenty of healthy choices are found at the cart too. I mostly eat snacks found at the courtyard coffee cart because it's located at the heart of the central outside courtyard. It’s a great place to sit and people watch while you recharge your batteries. There's also the option of ordering a boxed gourmet picnic lunch. Their website lists a phone number to order one of these. Gift shops and souvenirs? There’s more than one gift shop but don't assume that the cute little item you saw at the farthest shop early in the day (but that you didn’t immediately buy because you didn’t want to carry it around all day) will also be sold at the gift shop closest to the exit, at the end of your day at The Getty. Both shops don’t always have the same merchandise, and at the end of the day, more popular items sell out fast. You can always take your chances because sometimes they do have the same things, but if they don’t, the walk back to the other gift shop can be quite daunting at the end of a long day spent walking and walking and more walking. The Getty does things first rate by providing visitors with all kinds of assistance to persons with any kind of disability or special assistance. Wheelchairs are available. Guided tours are also available, including sign-language guided tours. Listening devices for visually impaired individuals are also available, as well as audio guides. Maps in different languages are found just a few steps inside the front doors, along with several uniformed Getty personnel who are there to provide assistance and answer all your questions. For example, when you first enter, don't be afraid to ask someone where a specific work of art is located if, for instance, you only came to look at that specific piece. Also, guards inside each of the galleries are quite helpful. I recently encountered a gentleman guard who was also quite funny. He had a whole routine rehearsed which he repeated every few minutes to each group of unsuspecting patrons. But don't assume the guards are in any way lax or casual about their duties. If you get even one inch too close to a painting or work of art, or even look like you might be thinking about touching something you shouldn’t, a guard will immediately announce your wrong-doing, loud enough for you to hear, but not so loud as to cause you undue embarrassment. Also, don't assume that The Getty only has paintings. There are entire rooms devoted to furniture, or sculpture, decorative arts, tools, crafts, architecture; really just about anything that has some artistic value and/or history. The Center also has a beautiful and quite extensive garden located adjacent to the buildings with a circular water feature at its lowest level. This garden provides a serene area to view outdoor sculptures and plantings, and there are also extensive areas of green lawn (where they don’t tell you to get off the grass) and areas with shade plus several meandering pathways, and areas to walk or sit, alone or in a group. One shaded area has a magnificent garden sculpture built entirely of large rebar rods which have been draped with Bougainvillea. The garden also serves as a great vantage point from which to look back at the façade of the buildings and observe the immense stone and concrete architecture. Architectural tours and guided tours of the garden are also available. The garden also has another purpose. Your kids can run around a bit in some of the garden’s more open areas to burn off some of their excess energy. I noticed inside one pavilion, a smaller room that houses a supervised kid’s play room. (At the time, some gorgeous Vermeer paintings were on display in that particular pavilion.) One of the room’s supervisors was also teaching kids how to make a simple but thematic art project - something for little hands to not only create but take home to remind them of their visit to The Getty. The Getty Center provides something for everyone. It will beautifully capture and maintain the interest of every person in your group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deb1ie
50,My favourite spot on the planet.,"I add this review purely out of selfish need, and cloying nostalgia.The Getty museum is simply my favourite place in the world. Perhaps fitting that the best things are free.The architecture is mosaic of eye pleasing texture, shape, and the skill of mankind. Spaces are enveloping, and the art simply unfolds - almost coming towards you rather than needing to visit each gallery.The real jewel through is the outcrop of cactus garden banished to the edge of the buildings and jutting towards the skyscrapers of the LA skyline that bristles back.It is my favourite view on the world, and when I returned last year with my wife and children to drink in the same view, I sighed and knew that I could die and regret only for those that are not fortunate to see this.Thank you to Getty - for turning dirty oil into a moving space, and for LA for being there to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simont288
40,Simply amazing!,"This place is amazing. The admission is free. Parking is $15, but there are local city buses from the San Fernando Valley and from the Westwood area that stop right at the entrance.The tram ride to the Getty Center was fun. At the top, the museum ground offers city-view (LA downtown), a glimpse of the ocean, and the beautiful hillside properties.The architecture and the garden were amazing. There are huge garden pieces made of re-bar, which were really creative. Absolute love the color and the beautiful curved lines from the re-bar in the garden....a great contrast. Restaurants were a bit expensive, but that is expected.The gallery were outstanding from furniture, tapestries, manuscripts, paintings, and sculptures. There were also special exhibitions, which change periodically. What a wonderful place in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Earth_91320

30,Nice place to spend extra time,"I spend the afternoon at the Getty center since there was really good reviews, but was satisfied with my visit. It is quite a drive from downtown and there is no entrance fee but parking is $15. I enjoyed the garden area but I was more enthused from the views from the Griffith Observatory earlier in the morning of my day. The architecture is beautiful and I was pleased with the exhibits as I quickly walked through most of them. Be mindful that there are multiple levels to this museum so wear appropriate footwear! The cafe is okay, it was on the expensive side and I had to wait in a line to get in while watching all employees just run in. I get the queuing to avoid the congestion, but I did spend $16 for a ""fancy"" chicken salad and a bottled green tea. Overall, a nice place to visit, but not a ""must see"" in LA. I quickly saw everything in about 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngellicaM
40,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing","If you drive here, you pay $15 for parking, but otherwise the entrance is free. The tram ride up to the museum is amazing, and then when you get to the top the views of the ocean, Los Angeles downtown, and the Santa Monica mountains are breath-taking. We were lucky to visit during a Santa Ana wind, so the visibility was unlimited.For my tastes, the achitecture and gardening were banal and unpleasant, but that should not take away from the art treasures at the museum. Take the free audio guide, or one of the docent tours, because they will enrich your experience. But you will also want to spend plenty of time on your own to find those items which really speak to you. Stroll the grounds and enjoy the views. Eat lunch at one of the restaurants or cafes, but be aware that they cllose at 3:00 PM.This is truly a Los Angeles jewel, and I challenge any other city to try and match what is found at the Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pontevecchio56

40,Spectacular setting for a museum,Overlooking LA you get fantastic views. The buildings are unique and interesting and the gardens nice to wander round. As museums go it is very well laid out and the exhibits are well displayed - you can get up really close to most of them. The audio tour headsets are good but do go on a bit and tend to repeat what is on the display info anyway.I was a bit disappointed with the art on display as so much of it was of the ancient variety - there was only one room devoted to the impressionists for example - I know thats down to preference but its worth checking that the art is what you like before going. Also a bit disappointed with the food outlet - only one open and hence very busy - little veggy selection.Getting here was easy - well signposted off the 405. Ample parking and monorail every 5 mins or so. Half a day was enough for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pete2216

40,The definitive LA museum,"You've never seen such a magnificent space for art, but you've seen more impressive collections in London, Paris, Madrid, New York , Chicago...you get the idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricLR_13
50,Go for the architecture and special exhibits.,The Getty Center is one of the places you should visit whether you live in LA or are on a vacation. I love the architecture and gardens. I prefer the special exhibits to the standard ones though. The food at the cafe is ok but you can bring some food with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msft1
50,The Getty,"An awesome place to spend an awesome day. Pack snacks, water (refreshments are expensive there). You need min. of 5-6 hours. Bring friends, share parking cost, entrance to museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolanda1953
50,Something different,I went to the Getty centre not knowing a lot about the art that was there. I took two buses to get there and found the public transport simple and easy. We had a lovely time and would visit again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelbell24
50,Have a beautiful day at the Getty!,"The Getty is a great destination. With beautiful gardens and patios, a spectacular view all the way to the Pacific Ocean in one direction, and Downtown Los Angeles in another direction, the Getty has so much to offer. Their galleries are beautiful and vast. The collections are not to be missed. Nice restaurants, too. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingforFun3333
50,Beautiful,"I had a great time. We had a picnic the weather was amazing and like always LA sunshine is incredible. Go on a date with your friends, or family. It's always a good time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Illiana79
40,An epic building on the Hill.,"I agree with most reviewers that this attraction is most unique in its site and how well the building blends with nature.The building's grid design both shields from the strong oceanic winds, and frames epic views seldom seen by non-celebrity home owners. The courtyard in the middle provides an area to relax, a place to sit down for a cup of coffee or watch the kids play.Richard Meier's use of light-reflecting white as the color of every wall gives the building a pure feeling. The ride on the tram up the hill adds to the excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BorzooS
50,The gardens are worth the trip,This is a gem on a hill in L.A. If you're there on the right day you can see forever. The garden is an ever changing art installment on it's own. Definitely a class act.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenl706
50,Garden is not to be missed!,"My favorites at the Getty Center: 1) The gardens are unique and a joy to visit. They look different each time I see them. A walk down to the main gardens is something you should not miss. Stop and enjoy the detail - it's fantastic. 2) There is always a great photographic exhibit. You will see historic photographs you will not see elsewhere. 3) If you can, have lunch at the Getty Center Restaurant -- great food and during the daylight the view is spectacular.Did you know that locals bring a book to read just to enjoy the peacefulness of the Getty Center? After you arrive at the Getty, you take a tram ride up the hill to the Getty Center proper. Leave your cares behind at the base of the hill and enjoy the fresh air, the view, the buildings, and all the good things to see.Check out the website for their lectures. You might find something interesting that will take place during your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731juliek
50,Amazing Observatory in Los Angeles,"We saw all the exhibits, took our time and saw everything. It is a history and science lesson that is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natlnd
50,Getty Center shouldn't be missed!,"Built high on a hill in Los Angeles - from the same stone, from the same quarries used to build the Roman Colosseum - the Richard Meier designed Getty Center is awesome. The permanent and visiting Getty collections are very interesting but the killer views stretching from downtown LA to the Pacific Ocean are spectacular. The interesting and varied gardens make for a great afternoon adventure. Admission is free. Head up for a coffee, lunch or dinner and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickC850
50,Best way to enjoy Culture and Art at no cost,"Fabulous Garden, Stunning View and Art that captures how lucky we are to experience all the possibilities at the Getty at not cost to enter museum. The entire grounds are so wonderful, If I could I would just enjoy the ambiance all day long everyday. I must have taken a 1000 photographs across the entire facility. Don't miss an opportunity to visit the Getty or even the Getty Villa also. Worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellycT6436ZM
30,"If you love Classical art this is the place, but .....","If you are not into classical art then this is not the place for you. While the buildings and gardens are nice the art became boring very quickly. They appeared to be displayed well, but I figured out that I am just not into Classic art. If you are here for the view there are other places around town to get great views, like Griffith Observatory. All of the fountains had been turned off for the drought which is understandable, but still disappointing to not get to see them running. The admittance is free but there is a $15 parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mans265
50,Don't Miss,"Even if you aren't an art fan, the architecture, the view, and the gardens are spectacular! But, the art is worth seeing as well and covers a wide range of periods. They also have a great restaurant for lunch or brunch. And, if you are lucky, they have free lectures. I've attended several and they were excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WJK63
50,Worthwhile,"Beautiful grounds high above Westwood and Bel Air. Sparse collection of classics and impressionists. However, a few high quality items. Don't miss the ""Christ arriving in Brussels"" in its special place. Have a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralph1230
50,"Even if art isn't your thing, go and enjoy the view!","But if art is your thing, you'll love the Getty! The collection is heavy on Italian Renaissance, Flemish masters, 19th Century impressionists, and many others thrown in. There's always a temporary exhibit on view.The Richard Meier architecture follows his normal formula of squares, but the grouping of the buildings on this hilltop location makes for something very special. The gardens and water features afford you places to wander when you've seen enough art. It's a great place to just hang out and enjoy the setting.Perhaps the best thing about the Getty is that it's free! There is a nominal fee for parking below and you take the tram up the hill. There is also very good food service available.I've been to the Getty many times and I've always enjoyed the visit. It is most definitely one of LA's finest attractions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cadmapper
50,Spectacular Views and Impressive Art,"Travel up a private railroad to the top of the mountain and disembark at a world of art, gardens, scholarship, restaurants and city watching. The Getty has a world renowned art collection , breathtaking architecture by Richard Meier, light café food, a snack bar and a class A restaurant. The gardens are worth the visit themselves, and it's got the best views of LA to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,LA Gem,"My wife kids and I spent almost a full day at the Getty Center. Spectacular place with stunning views and wonderful art from multiple genre's and time frames. Would recommend it highly, even the food choices available were pretty good! Good family outing, but would go back with just my wife as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1327JVmikec

50,Great destination in LA,The architecture is stunning and so is the view. Check the rotation for special exhibits. You only pay for parking and then take a tram to the site. The outdoor garden is nice and you can grab a lunch and explore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winetravelig
50,Los Angeles Acropolis,"The Getty Center in Los Angeles is not only architecturally stunning but it houses an incredible collection of mind boggling art. The restaurant not only serves good meals but has gorgeous views.The companion Getty Villa in Malibu, situated with breathtaking views of the Pacific is not to be missed. Also in a gorgeous setting, the Villa highlights beautiful antiquities. The outside dining area begs you to linger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864joep
50,LA's top attraction,"Best museum in LA - great collection of artwork, lovely garden and breath-taking city view. I went here in Spring with my husband and all the flowers were blooming. Will definitely come back again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124nhiv

50,Come For The Visuals Stay For The Food,"A tram picks you up at the parking area and deposits you to the Getty which is set in lush garden surroundings. My favorite is the Japanese Garden. There are outdoor tables and chairs for relaxing, planning your visit or having an afternoon Espresso, etc. The collection is diverse and sprawling. The restaurant has an interesting menu, but get there early or all the tables will be gone. There were four of us and everything we ordered was delicious. I like the Getty because it's more than a museum, it's an experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858glendag
50,Must see when visiting LA,"I've lived here in LA for 10 years. The Getty Center never gets old. It's constantly changing and it's beauty keeps blooming. The restaurant is amazing, worth the price (my mom was pleased), it's even nice to visit with friends for a relaxing picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulsB_12
50,worth the trip,"I am on the other side of town and in LA you are westside, valley or eastside and you usually stick your area. That said, I was granted a day pass and allowed to make the trip and it was worth it. A great experience and I would argue that you'd need more than one day to really take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
40,Beautiful Inside and Out,Very large and sometimes confusing as the different sections are on different levels. The restaurant is great. The views are superb. The exhibts are interesting but not as involving as that of other museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
50,Fantastic view - incredible art,Just visited the Getty yesterday and didn't realize what an amazing view of the ocean there is. Saw the Rubens exhibit with tapestries and especially enjoyed the post 1800 Art in the West Wing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weskinow
50,A spectacular experience,"This should be on anyone's list of what to see in LA. The view, the gardens, the art, the architecture. And it is free, except for parking. Closed Monday!GFo once and you'll have to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodBandB
50,Free and definitely worth a visit,Amazing building with incredible views over LA. The art work and sculptures are a beautiful collection. Lovely gardens. A MUST SEE whilst you're in LA. Can't believe it's FREE !! Quite a good selection of food and not crazily expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLW_1
50,The VIEW is simply amazing,"You must go here once instead of just driving by and looking at the ugly building up on the hill and wondering what on earth were they thinking. Looks like it's made of concrete block. Because when you actually get up on the hill it is worth being there. My favorite thing is ""THE BED."" It looks like a couch, pulls out to make it up. I want one. Bought the post card. Maybe someday I'll have someone make one for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyMermaid
50,Time well spent,So much history for all-comers. There are pieces of art that are key to many time periods of history on display. This museum is suitable for all ages and a must see for tourist,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351cd
50,A Must-See for Visitors to L.A.,"This is our latest addition to the historical and cultural gifts L.A. Has to offer. For a nominal fee, parking, transportation (people-mover) & museum admission are all included in this beautiful mountain-top locale overlooking Los Angeles both east and west with a view of the Pacific Ocean as well! Wonderful exhibits! Incredible location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolojo
40,Worth The Visit,This is a rare place worth visiting. The Getty family provides a free visit to its collection of art and the views from the site are breathtaking. You will pay a small charge for parking but otherwise the visit is free. Plan on eating before you get there because a tuna sandwich on site is $9. Otherwise we had no complaints and would go again but the next time we would plan to stay there all day. The site offers guided tours by volunteers which are worthwhile. Not often that such a gallery of art is made available to the general public for free so don't miss out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polish-Golfer
50,Wonderful,You must see this place. Fantastic architecture and landscaping. Free entry and tours which are really informative. We took a taxi from Century City which cost about $25 for four in the cat but I think there is also a shuttle from downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ptuji
50,Wow,"Definitely a must when visiting LA. The museum is well laid out, with many interesting exhibits. The setting was just gorgeous overlooking all of the city. The gardens (and we took the Garden Tour) really gorgeous, even though the water fountains were turned off because of the drought. There are permanent exhibits and visiting exhibits--now it is the paintings and tapestries of Rubens. Just fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731robinf
50,Museum and a View,A remarkable museum in a marvelous location----not to be missed when in LA. I have no more to add to reach 100 characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joebV179FY

40,Kiwi in LA,"This place is simply awesome, great views and a rich history. If you are in LA for a short time this is a great place pick up on a bit of history about LA. The building's and garden are stunning nothing short of spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abizmal
50,Great for a family,"The Getty Center has plenty to do for kids (even those who feel jaded and tired of museums). The garden is beautiful, and the views are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulusmom
50,What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday in LA,"The tram to the top of the hill where the museum is located was great. You could see downtown Los Angeles when you looked down the hill. The museum, itself, is a series of buildings with walkways connecting them. We went on a day that there was free parking, which made the visit even more exciting. The artwork, sculptures, gardens and catus were outstanding. There are places where you can just set and enjoy the outside and wonder through the gardens. Plan on spending the majority of an afternoon at the museum, then plan on going back to see more. It was one of my favorite places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amariej303
50,LA,I am not a lover of LA and probably never will be. But if you happen to be there or have a spare day to spend there The Getty Centre is a must.We at last managed to go. It is amazing not just the contents but the buildings and gardens.It is such a tribute to Paul J Getty that he has left to the world. They have some of the different art work. The way it is displayed in whole rooms is terrific. It really gives a complete feeling.Then there is the design of the buildings. WOW Followed by the gardens and water features. The water was absent when we were there due to drought restrictions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Picture468
40,Great View and Beautiful Building,"I have been to the Getty several times since it opened. It is a great looking museum and has a great view over Belair, Brentwood, Santa Monica and beyond. However, I was not impressed with the art selections. Lots of period room set ups, which do not hold my interest. I do enjoy it more when they feature an artist's work who I am interested in. Their offering is more classical, and not my thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxnarddragonlady
50,Peaceful and awe-inspiring,"There's so much to do here. You can sit outside and look at the garden, go inside and explore paintings, sculptures, photography. It's a good place to go with a small group. Alone, on a date, or with one or two friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952omart
50,Worth seeing even if you never go inside and see the art,"This is a great place to walk around, see great views of Los Angeles, beautiful gardens and water features (when they are functioning - many shut off currently due to the drought). We spent several hours just walking the grounds, only venturing inside when we needed to cool off, get a drink or use the restrooms (and in so doing, we'd take a look at whatever art work was in the building we used). There are lots of great programs for families here and concerts during the summer. You pay to park, but then you can visit as much or as little of the museum and grounds as you are interested in. For little kids, even the tram ride from the parking to the center is a treat! Great place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nuacara
50,"Amazing museum, lots to see!","Just the tram ride up to the museum is amazing. Parking is 15 dollars, but admission to the museum is free, which is amazing considering their installations are AMAZING!!!! On the way up you get an amazing view of the city. The museum itself has several wings and beautiful outdoor seating. My favorite part was the home furnishings installation. It was like being in an actual royal home. So many different furnishings and old, antique furniture. They've done an amazing job with preserving everything. Also, almost every room has a guide is who is FULLY equipped to answer just about any question you may have about the display or the museum in general. All the workers were very nice and helpful and answered all of my silly questions (and some serious ones) LOL. Anyway we also enjoyed the beautiful weather by sitting outside on a hill by the gardens. We grabbed a steak sandwich and some chips from the coffee cart (it was the only thing that was open because we went a bit late) - but it was decent. There's also a nice looking restaurant which I think may need reservations depending on when you go? All in all, we really enjoyed coming here, and so did our baby! It's up in the hills so there are spectacular views throughout the museum of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asma3022
50,A must in Los Angeles,"This is a fantastic museum, where one could spend a whole day. We spent 4 hours without having seen everything. The location and access by tram from the parking lot is an experience by itself !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJLauzon
50,Amazing Place,"If you do a tour here, I highly, and I mean highly, recommend Linda. She was the best tour guide with a great knowledge of the Center and showed us so much in only an hours time. We truly enjoyed our visit and would go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernwehcmb
50,"If you're in LA, go to the Getty","A shuttle takes you up to a museum atop a hill and it's amazing. The grounds are beautiful, the exhibits are many and to see everything, you'll need more than one trip. It's a was a gift to LA and you need to see it yo truly appreciate it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roxp8982
50,Must see,"Nothing short of awesome. Must see this at least once in your lifetime as the artwork is amazing, the venue and surrounds breathtaking and it has something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525shanec
50,Excellent,This is a hidden gem in LA. Free admission with $15 parking but well worth it. Amazing views and art. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USFlyBoy
50,Must see while in LA,The Architecture and gardens alone make this a must see place. Not to mention the amazing views on a clear day. Allow at least a few hours to take in the fine art exhibits too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seafare74
50,World Class Museum - SoCal Style.,"Rather than leaving his massive fortune to his kids - Mr. Getty left his $$$ to further art and culture to the world - and located the seven collections here in Sother California! The museum is FREE however parking can be steep. Thinking that you can bypass the parking by using public transit - which is scarce around both the Getty Villa AND the Getty Center.Some tips for first timers - There are TWO Getty Museums. The location where Mr. Getty housed his original location is in the Malibu/Palisades region of L.A. The Getty Center which opened in 1997, is located with the majority of the Getty Businesses at the top of a hill overlooking the 405. If you're into antiquities and would like to know what Mr. Getty's vision was for his museum, I would suggest a 3 hour outing to the Getty Villa in the Palisades/Malibu region. This museum was reopened after some remodeling - so it now gives the feel of an excavation as you enter the site from the parking lot. The Villa has an almost magical feel to it during the spring and winter months! (My personal favorite time is on those rare nighttime occasions.) The views of the ocean are breathtaking - and many aspects of the Villa are replicated from the Villa De Papiri (sp?)The Getty Center is much larger, and I would recommend targeting specific galleries for your visit - even the most hardy of Museum types get fatigue after 3 hours. When I take visitors - I almost ALWAYS start off with the West pavilion - 2nd floor. This is where a majority of the more famous paintings are located- However, some may choose to start off in the Furniture exhibit… others in the Photo exhibit areas. Still others in the Gallery housing the Works by Rembrandt. The Robert Irwin gardens are amazing. The views are exquisite.If you're taking a date, I HIGHLY recommend this museum to seal the deal.Both museums have exceptional family programs - you might choose to sign up for the Getty newsletter/e-mail if you have kids. The family day events at either museum - are NOT TO BE MISSED!!! Trust me on this!! So much more to say, but it's best to experience this place - then write your own review.One final note - everyone who volunteers and/or works at this place knows something about the art gallery they work in. The Getty has their act together!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaughtyNorris
40,It's Beautiful,"The surroundings can't be beat, and there's artwork too! It's a sanctuary minutes from L.A.Don't miss the Restaurant...great views, delicious options from drinks to dessert and the service is fantastic.The fee/cost is for parking only, $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AOneWorldTraveler
40,"Good Museum, Nice Restaurant, and Views of Los Angeles",We have gone to the Getty Museum several times. The Getty is architecturally beautiful with nice views of Los Angeles. We have dined at the Restaurant. The ambiance was quite nice and the food was good.We like to wander through the galleries. It makes for an enjoyable day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,"Thank you, Paul Getty","This is not like every other museum. It is in a secluded area (you need to take a free tram up), with lots of open space, few visitors, and a beautiful garden out back. I have a feeling that retired seniors come specifically to just hang out for a day. Even though attendance was low at this time of the year, they kept up with a variety of tours that occur every half to an hour.As I said before, this is unlike any museum that I've ever been to. Asides from the parking, which is $15, there is no entrance fee. The audio ipods are free. Special exhibitions are free. They don't ask you for dontations either. It is truly a philantrophic dedication.I didn't see kids here, but there is a pavilion dedicated to entertain them. The main exibitions include paintings, decorative arts and sculptures. I was especially blown away by the tapestry exhibit (limited time). The collection is focused around 1500-1600 Europe, which is just perfect for my taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheJackeh
40,Sunday afternoon at the Getty,"Hi,We spent a couple of hours here admiring the art, antiques, gardens and the view. The café/restaurant was not open when we were there as we got there a little later in the afternoon. I had my 3 kids with me (13yrs, 10yrs & 10yrs) and was pleasantly surprised that they were into it and seemed to enjoy our time here. Got some fantastic photos here.

We had a wonderful lunch in the cafeteria which has a surprisingly good number of different offerings, and had wine too! Portions are very generous. We ate our lunch on the patio taking in the views and the hillside homes in the surrounding neighbourhood. Be sure to sign up for an take the garden tour. It is worth it! The gentleman who led our ground was full of wonderful information and knowledge that he eagerly shared. The history is wonderful. The exhibitions are beautiful too. TK eu our time with those too. A trip to the Getty is a great experience for sight, taste and hearing. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j2b2m2
50,Incredible,"What a collection (Rubens, Breughel, Jordaens, Ensor, Monet, Manet, El Greco, Van Gogh, Millet, Rousseau, Cézanne, Tiziano, Bouts, Van der Weyden, etc.)! What a setting! What a center!Well organized affordable café. Free entrance (only 14 $ for parking lot).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzalo_de_Berceo
40,"Beautiful, inside and out","As others have said, the art collection is not the greatest, but the building itself is a masterpiece. If you're there to view Van Gogh's Irises, be prepared to be plowed over by pushy docents and other rude viewers. However, the other galleries are less crowded and it's easy to spend a few hours browsing.The best part? It's FREE! The audio tour (also free) is self-guided on an iPod, and is well done. You can choose to hit the highlights, listen to information on individual pieces, or take a gallery-by-gallery tour of the entire building. Plus, each time we go there are different installations, so there's always something new. Overall, it's well worth your time to visit, even if you just go for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripmom1999

50,Beautiful art in a beautiful setting,"The Getty is a must do anytime I'm in LA. It's a beautiful facility with views of the Pacific on clear days. A great collection of art including works by Monet, Van Gogh, Manet, Degas and more. Definitely worth a trip and you only pay for parking, not tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashley28806
40,The Center (sic) itself is the highlight,"This extraordinary building and gardens perched on a hill top is an amazing setting for a museum. I have to say, perhaps thankfully, that most great european art from the 18-20th centuries remains in Europe. But there are a few nice pieces, the main draw is the centre itself - beautifully designed, spacious, well set out, amazing views of the city.If this were in Europe with one of the collections from say the Louvre, the National Gallery in London or Edinburgh, or the Palais de Beaux-Arts in Brussels it would be peerless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NellEdi
50,A Must visit,"If you are in Los Angeles, this is a must visit. The Museum is a unique experience that will nurture your spirit. This is a bright museum with one of the greatest views and a unique art pieces, sculptures, paintings. There are four big buildings that have permanent collections and also temporal collections. All of us can write a book about the beauty of this museum but you need to visit and experience by yourself. The entrance is free but you need to do reservation in advance and pay for the parking lot. They have places to eat a very good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaraMarlene
50,"Nice place for art lovers and others, too",Most museums I have visited are dark and sleep-inducing. The Getty is so bright and nicely perched above LA that it is fun to walk around while taking in the paintings and sculptures at a leisurely pace. The gardens and lawns are also a highlight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelc850
50,All day experience - mostly for adults,"This is a beautiful museum on the hill in LA. You have to park ($15 per car) down the hill and a tram takes you up top where admission is free. There are at least four buildings with two and three stories of priceless art, furniture, sculptures from the 1200s to 1900 or so. There is another building with more contemporary art on temporary exhibits. They also have a library, three restaurants with plenty of choices, and grounds for picnics. There are some beautifully maintained gardens which provide a nice break from the endless art. I spent 6 hours here on a Saturday taking it all in. I used the self-guided headphones but there are tour guides that can get you around in a couple of hours to show you the highlights.There are also beautiful views of all areas of LA from atop the hill and museum buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imtom55711

And there is always the view that on a clear day stretches from Catalina Island in the southwest to San Jacinto in the east.The permanent collection is not that large, but the pieces they have are fantastic and it covers the range from post Roman to Impresisionist. For the classics, Greek, Roman, Etruscan go to the Villa, another great site.The campus itself is a treat, set high on a hill with buildings broken into bite site chunks. The various fountains and the garden are also a delight,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,The Getty is Great Getaway,"I love going to the Getty. You get great art, beautifully landscaped gardens, music and culture. You can escape boring and enter into an amazing world with your entire family for the cost of parking. A great deal and a great getaway here in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50cydneyd
40,art in a great setting,"The Getty has several galleries that are separated into separate buildings. You can see what you choose, and in between you can walk outside, or sit in the courtyards or gardens. The gardens are beautiful. You have great views of Los Angeles from the Getty. The exhibits are interesting, and well presented. I loved the ipods they give out for the self guided tours. It is a great public space, and the vision behind this itself is moving. Because of the layout, you can come with mixed ages, and kids can take in as much as they want and then be outside. The cost is only for parking. at $15,which still makes a great deal for a half or full day excursion. Don't forget the great sculptures in the garden by the tram.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m-sophia
50,Exquisite Serene Experience Inside &Out = a must see!!,"Have been there Several Times & Daytime w/family including 3 Teenagers, who bought wonderful Books in their""store"". I loved taking SLOW walks thru the various Rooms & slowly enjoying the Serene Beauty outdoor high on the mountain-top overlooking LA. We ate exquisite Gourmet Food in it's Best Restaurant. I feel safe, even going there alone, via Public Transportation. Admission is Free, but U must pay to park = well worth any price. Do Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loiss104
50,museum on the hill,"what a site to see. I love art and the getty is always good for a wonderful instillation. Not to mention its just as pretty and interesting to walk around the venue. Perfect for a wedding. The flowers in the garden is perfect for a quick photo shoot. The restaurant is not to shabby either but a bit pricey for what it is. free to get in you just pay for parking, great deal for a day trip out with the family or a couples date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niketac2013
50,Culture,"Great place to visit. Tram ride from the car park to the centre. Paintings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, furniture etc from approx 1600 to present day. Free entry but $15 parking fee. Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932barbarac
50,Number 1 for a reason!,"This is a stunning experience. Free other than parking??!! Wow. The setting and architecture are exquisite. I would suggest you allow enough time to enjoy the art and grounds, as the latter are just as impressive, IMO. Maybe not the last word in art when compared with the major galleries in Florence, Paris and New York, but it certainly equals or exceeds those in terms of the experience. Very Highly Recommended and I can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conscious14
50,A must see!,"My second visit and I would go again if I get the opportunity! This is one of the most spectacular places on so many levels. If you enjoy beautiful things, a true visual experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynanne
50,Extraordinary Museum,"This is a surreal experience to visit the Getty Center. Nestled on a hill along the Pacific Coast on the northern end of LA, the Museum was built for an extraordinary experience. Reservations are important for parking. Once parked, you take a slow tram ride up the side of the mountain to the Getty Center at the top. Once there, you can imagine being on the Mediterranean or Adriatic Sea. There are multiple levels and an open amptheatre type stair. There are several tours (at no charge). Take one that interests you. The Renaissance art is fantastic. My young nephew, however, was aghast at all the ""killing"" in the religious art (many of the crucifixion.) Enjoy some of the exhibits. They are all wonderful.I go and spend the day. I have lunch in the restaurant and take my food outside to enjoy the fabulous view. Walk down into the gardens. They are just beautiful.Whatever you do, you MUST experience the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrKatieRN
50,"Fantastic, and educational, Beautiful","A great place to spend a day, (more so than tacky Hollywood) and learn something and appreciate great art and REAL beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimofroanokeva
50,A must see!,"An absolute highlight of our weekend vacation in Los Angeles.We spent hours there, enjoying the view in the many areas and sections of this spacious inner museum and gardens.As with the Getty Villa (at an enitrely different location), this is a must see, when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave-in-BOS
50,WOW !!! JUST !!! WOW,"I have lived just five miles away but it took me a trip to Sydney from Fort Lauderdale to get me. here. There is no fee and no reservations to enter this fantastic place but there is a parking fee of $15. I have been to the best museums in the world and this one is high on my list. It is a great place to take the whole family a real learning experience for the young and the young of heart. I do plan a return trip when I pass the gates of LAX again. The one thing I liked was the set up, you don't get a wall filled with master pieces but a set up just to step back and enjoy one of the works of the masters. Parking is underground with a train to drop you off. The best time to go is Tuesday to Thursday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657JimD
40,"Brilliant architecture and art, but the staff....","What an awesome piece of architecture. So end out of an Aztec temple high up in hype hills above LA. Brilliantly conceived and well organised, and save for the very reasonable parking completely free. It is rich with art, and art for everybody, of whatever taste and expertise.However, avoid anything guided. The specialist art staff know very little about painting. I am a schoolmaster and my 12 year old pupils would have known more about French art then the American lady who bluffed very badly. "" look at this, it's very colourful..""!!! Really embarrassing and doing neither the museum nor the American nation any favours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harwood52
50,World class art museum that rivals Europe.,"This certainly deserves to be the #1 cultural attraction in Los Angeles. The expansive grounds, the tram ride up and view from the top of the hill, and the marble buildings are beyond spectacular. The magnificent art on display is the best that can be had for the billions of dollars endowed by Getty. Wow. A big variety of styles, etc. too.The exhibits change frequently so going back is a new experience, even for locals [me].Don't miss it if you visit L.A. Plan on at least half a day [4 hours].$15 parking fee but museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ethanski
50,Need a full day,It is a great museum and too big to be covered in half a day which I had budgeted for. The designs and artifacts are amazing. The garden tour was lovely as the guide explained things in a very simple and comprehensible manner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abhay55
40,Don't rely on your Garmin,"Garmin GPS took me round the residential streets but never got me to the Centre - got me to a road where there was a sign saying No access to Getty Centre -gps error. Eventually got there using my iPhone and the road signs. The design and build are quite remarkable - I enjoyed the gardens, views and buildings as much as the exhibits. Fantastic meal offerings there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanT167
50,Beautiful grounds and more than an afternoon's worth...,"Prepare yourself that you won't be able to see everything in an afternoon. The gardens are gorgeous, and they say the evening with a picnic on the lawn is one of the very best things to do in Los Angeles. It's great that the museum is free, even if the $15 parking and rather expensive cafe can come as a shock to those expecting a cheap/free day of fun. The monerail up gives breathtaking views of the mountains surrounding the museum.It's a great experience. I would recommend standing in line for the ipod to do the guided tour, it's worth it. It's free, they just hold your license.Go during the week, because the weekends can be extremely crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
50,Worth the trip ...,"I always felt that this place was remote but it was only a 15 minute Uber ride from Venice. Everything is beautifully set out, wonderful gardens, great photography exhibits and fabulous views. If you're into art, a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldieSydney
40,Nice,Beautiful views. Okay food. Very expensive! Nice to go because it's so close to where I live. Don't like that they have smoking areas. I think it should be smoke-free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jujubee720
50,A beautiful and well thought out museum,"For museum lovers, this is an LA don't miss. After your parking fee (this is LA after all), the entrance to the Getty Center is free AND comes with a flooringly comprehensive audio guide. I could lose myself for hours strolling around the normal exhibits. I truly enjoyed the traveling exhibit during my visit, which displayed pages from medieval picture books (basically, I'm sure the real name is fancier). To top off an excellent museum are the spectacular views of LA and the plentiful green space where you can relax and read or enjoy a glass of wine at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nderiley
50,serene,For $15 parking it was worth it. The grounds were wonderful. Too bad we only had a few hours because you can spend the whole day here contemplating and taking it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russ_Cathy

40,"It's pretty good, but not why you come to LA","Agree with the sentiment of most other reviewers - it's a pleasure to visit and something of a surprise in contrast with the standard expectations of LA. Great setting, the gardens are super impressive, the artworks outstanding, but really if you're a newbie to LA, surely you're here for Hollywood, Universal Studios, Disneyland, Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica. A top 5 no doubt, but not the first thing I'd do when off the plane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riddoch88
50,Pretty cool!,The view is so special and the Centre itself was so much bigger than i realized! Beautiful garden area as well.But the view! Gosh amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lordlaximus

50,Worth 12 hours flight from Europe,"The center is at a human dimension. Not to miss the free of charge guided tours. We visit the great temporary exibition of James Ensor this way. The guide transmitted the vibrations of her passion. There are outdoor drinks and ice cream stands. I paid USD 10.- for an ice cream on a stick. That will finance the next Van Gogh painting purchase! For art amateurs as I am, the Center is alone by itself a destination which worth to cross oceans and continents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delanuit11
50,Wow!,"As per the majority of previous reviews, can't really add too much other than this is a must visit even if you are not normally a regular gallery / museum visitor.Art and Architecture live in complete harmony at The Getty Center.The setting is stunning, the architecture inspiring, the collection impressive and the gardens beautiful.Biggest tip is to take the guided tours that run regularly and are relatively short (45 mins to 1 hour) and cover the architecture, the key pieces within the collection and the gardens. The guides are superb. In addition, they have a great ipod system to tune in to while you walk around the exhibits. There is no charge other than parking and I believe they have an arrangement where you can use the same parking ticket for a visit to the Getty Villa in Malibu on the same day.All in all, an amazing visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dime26
50,Oh So Lovely,"I visited the Getty with a friend on a Thursday. It started with a lovely tram ride to the museum. The museum is breathtaking with many breathtaking views of LA and the ocean. We spent time laying on the grass under a tree talking undisturbed. We then spent time going through the museum, which had many different types of art (paintings, photography, an exhibit on dance). It was a wonderful time not only looking through the exhibits, but also just walking the grounds through the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BF2531
40,Beautiful Grounds,"The Getty Center is stunningly well-designed, with great views, beautiful grounds and a good art collection. The Impressionist room had one of the best concentrated set of works from that era that I've seen. The star of the show is probably the building and grounds itself. It must have been an architect's dream to have a great setting and clean slate to work from. A lot of the water features were turned off while we were there, due to the general drought conditions, but that's totally understandable. It's kind of a hassle having to park and then take a tram to the Getty, but it really helps to separate the museum from the ""real world.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffb293
50,Great archeticure and views.,"the views are unrivalled and the Richard Meirer designed building is fantastic. The collection leaves a little to be desired, but the complex is unparrelled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmF2574NH

50,Another absolute MUST see,"World class collection (google it), but most important, shown in an uplifting yet relaxing setting. I think I spent 5-6 hours there and still hadn't taken in everything I wanted. A meal would have been nice, a thorough exploration of the grounds, but I got lost in the art (good collection of decorative objects too - a plus for me). Art is displayed with great lighting for the most part and your no flash camera will still get good pics. Thoughtful explanatory plaques and a great ipod walk through with commentary. The architecture is stunning, the expansive parking garage ($15) was fairly full yet one never felt crowded moving through the rooms, or rushed when you wanted to linger over a particular work. Really this was a great visit, and even if you only have a passing interest in art (i.e. head to the impressionists and ignore 600 years), you should still come. FREE, free, free - thank you J. Paul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Eye Candy in Los Angeles,"I love art and architecture in all their forms. I find beauty in many things be it a Pollack painting or a car wash from the 1970’s in the Valley. I have been living in Los Angeles since 2007 and I spent my first year as a starving student.Reasons to love the Getty Center:#1 - It is free! Sure it costs $15.00 to park but normally you have to pay to park and an admission fee.#2 – The architecture of the Getty Center is in itself a permanent exhibition. Architect Richard Meier designed the center to highlight the nature and visual aesthetic of Los Angeles. The buildings themselves seem to belong to the Santa Monica hill side they rest atop as much as the natural landscape. After parking, you will ascend to the museum on a free tram. Immediately you will feel the visual pull which keeps me going back for more. Every view is a picture, a snapshot of the enormous grid of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel mountains and the Pacific ocean.#3 - The design of the complex, the grounds were as carefully designed to compliment their environment. The central garden encompasses a 134,000 square foot design that features a tree lined walkway. Take your time here. Sit on one of the many benches or take a break on the grass. Take full use of your five senses and you will find a peace in this hectic city not often found.#4 – The galleries. The ultimate compliment to the city of angels? The design of the galleries allows for sun shine to illuminate the buildings and your experience as you take in the art for yourself. You will find collections of art, sculpture and photography from a variety of centuries.The Getty Center is by far one of my top three favorite locations within the city. Often when people think of Los Angeles they do not think of art or culture. \Unfortunately, they come to Los Angeles to visit the beach or amusement parks and then neglect to look deeper. Los Angeles is my home and for all the traffic and congestion it is possible to find art and beauty within this sprawling metropolis.You just have to know where to look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrinaD_11
50,Wonderful day,"We were traveling with our teenage daughters and wondered if this was going to be a tough half a day. We had already made a couple mistakes on our vacation and what a surprise we found here, the girls loved it as much as we did. If you have 4-5 hours this is the spot. Great musuem and fantastic views to boot ey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5457VAbobh
50,Awe Inspiring,"A ""must see"" as no trip to LA is complete without a visit. Allow enough time. Both the outside and inside are a visit on their own. The day we went the sky was deep blue and the gardens with the water flowing through them kept us lingering - unaware that the inside was just as compelling. So glad we went and hope to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2boston
50,A cultural celebration ....,"The CEO's welcome and his farewell the moment you board the tram will reverberate in your mind long after you exit this place.The use of grids,lines and organic shapes in this architectural masterpiece is fabulous.There are free tours conducted by scholarly guides and by surrendering your Driving licence you can get Ipods which will take you on a virtual tour of the artefacts and paintings on display.Most importantly,community participation is the central theme and everything is woven around this theme.The gardens, the sole lavender relief and travertines will remain etched in my memory.Just made me realize that this place, like the rest of USA, is a tourist friendly destination after all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vish201
50,Amazing,"Everything about the Getty Centre is truly amazing. The galleries, the architecture, the setting and the gardens, plus it is free. You don't need an organised guided tour of the galleries as they provide an excellent audio guide, again this is free. An organised tour of the gardens is recommended to fully appreciate what the architect was trying to create. You pay $15 for parking and if you visit the Getty Mansion, some 10 minutes drive, on the same day you don't have to pay another $15 for parking there. It is certainly worthwhile visiting the mansion. As others have rightly said if you do nothing else in LA do visit the Getty Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveMWirral
50,Worth a visit,This is well worth a visit not just for the museum pieces but for the gardens and layout as well.With free entry and a free audio tour this place has really been put together well. Good facilities for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julesr_7
50,WOW,"and this is free....The building itself is something to see as it sits among the hills.Gardens and views are breath taking.Give yourself lots of time.There is a $15 fee for parking, but, it is also good for the Getty Mansion.If you can... go during the week when it is not as crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel200905SL
50,This place is awesome!,"What a great place to spend time! And there are so many different ways to spend time here - with friends, in solace, in front of art, taking in the architecture, enjoying the gardens, dining. I can't say which I liked better - the galleries or the architecture of the complex. The art is of course great, but I could easily spend a day or more just moving around the complex, taking in the angles, shadows, etc.The food is pretty good, varied and reasonably priced. It is very well run and large enough to not feel crowded even when it may be crowded.I wish we had something like this back east that I could frequent. Clearly a standout in LA...a must for any visitor...and a great break from the frenetic pace of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adamsafe
50,Excellent,If you only do one thing in Los Angeles make this museum the one! We loved it and wish we had the time to spend a 2nd day. We heard it was the top rated museum in the US and we believe it. Good work Mr Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberetaw
50,Fantastic; a must visit,"I wasn't planning on going to The Getty, but boy was I glad I did. Free entry, parking fee is reasonable. The artwork, gardens and cafe are all first class. What a wonderful place to reflect on the amazing collections and wonder in the marvel what the Getty Trust has created. You have to visit the wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodieAU
40,The outside is better than the inside,"I would recommend this place to someone that is not an art fan. The outside of the property is so beautiful, that I could stay there for hours....They have two gardens, and both of them are perfect places to visit and have a good time. I'm not a museum person, so I've enjoyed the outside a lot more than the inside. In the cactus garden, you can take awesome selfies with the LA landscape right behind you.... it was a lot of fun!They also have some temporary photo exhibitions, and some of them are pretty interesting, as well.The parking fee is USD 15, but the entrance is free. If you have five people in your car.....it's a very nice deal.... :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aandressa25
40,Great museum and fabulous views - free admittance but fee for parking,"We spent the majority of the afternoon at this wonderful museum last week; we had been before but not for a couple of years and this place is simply phenomenal! Richard Meier, the architect, will forever be remember for the remarkable design he created for this hilltop location. The white 30x30"" stone slabs and the natural colored 30"" stone slabs remind me of things like amphitheaters of long ago - they are monumental and memorable but they are also functional. While the Getty has ""turned off the water"" to fountains and pools in deference to water conservancy - very necessary - those areas created for the water still look impressive and beautiful. Only by the entry steps is one unaware of where water used to be and now is not; it was not so obvious there so it isn't so obviously missing there. The gardens are equally spectacular even at this time of year when much is beyond its season. What an incredible place - just go and relax and enjoy. The art is fine and the current photography exhibit by Minor White is a great collection - much of it nature photography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westchicago
50,Gorgeous setting for a world class museum,We even liked the drive to the Center. On beautiful grounds surrounded by works of art and the restaurant served a wonderful lunch. I had a Cobb salad which was great. Nice wine list.The computer research area amazed me the most and there were visiting scholars all around.There's always new exhibits and after 3 hours or so it does not have the tiring feeling that one gets in a typical museum. Some of that may be due to the amount of walking you can do outside the buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/girardot
50,What a great place!,Beautiful building housing arts and antiquities. Completely free as well as the audio tour. Go to both on the same day (Getty Villa in Malibu) and pay for parking at only one place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raegan1313

50,So much to do. Too little time.,"My family and I had a few hours to kill in Los Angeles while waiting for our evening flight back to London. We had a look on tripadvisor and saw The Getty Center was pretty much the top place to visit in LA so we went.On arrival we were dropped off in the bottom of the car park and told we needed to catch a tram to the actual museum. I initially thought this must be a sly way for the museum to make some extra money from their visitors. But I was wrong.The tram was free and, better still, entrance to the facility was also free. There was an exhibition taking place (a couple actually, though we only had time for one) and even the entrance to that was free.This place was huge and it didn't deserve being left to the last day and then as a fill-in because there is nothing better to do. You should plan to spend most of the day here and browse through the whole facility. It is really fascinating.I don't know when I will next be back in Los Angeles but I will be sure to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271MarkW
50,Escape from the Smog,This is the perfect getaway while you are staying in L.A. The center itself is very impressive and offers a lot for the culture-hungry. But no matter whether you are an arts aficionado or just admire the view from the center: go there! Plus the admission is free and a little tram takes you up from the parking lot (which costs USD 15!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avivadarling

It is first a very beautiful place and you simply enjoy just being in this atmosphere, and then there are the exhibits, shop, and cafe.The changing Photography exhibits are always amazing.The staff is great and the place is just incredible.I have gone quite often and have never been disappointed.Did I say it was free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

50,Stunning views,"A fabulous place to spend a day, whether you are visiting LA or just want to stop and appreciate it for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamshaz
40,Pretty Impressive View and Buildings,"The Getty Center is an impressive piece of arts, sculptures, architecture and garden with spectacular views of the Santa Monica/Brentwood area, and the silhouette of the downtown LA further out among the smog. Unfortunately we've only had about 1.5 hours there due to next engagement, and also we lost about 25 minutes following up the wrong roads in the back side of the center. Apparently entering ""1200 Getty Center drive"" into the GPS navigator will lead you up the back hill to a private residence. Poor owner posted a sign in his driveway advising visitors to input ""1200 N. Sepulvida Blvd"" instead to get to the Getty Center front entrance.Parking is $15 but would be free if you exit the garage within one hour. Pretty pointless since parking and taking the tram up to the center will take at least 15-20min, and you need at least 2 hours there to fully enjoy the arts, garden, architecture and the view.Overall, we were glad to visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toga1k
50,"""GET IT"" AT THE GETTY","So, I’ve been to the Getty Center twice before this. Once when it first opened, and once a few years later with a friend from out of town. And we walked around, looked at the paintings, had some lunch, commented on the view, and left, having seen The Getty.But I’ve really never been to The Getty until last Sunday. Let me share with you the life-changing way to REALLY visit The Getty Center.1) GO EARLY! ON A SUNDAY! IT’S FREE! Generally, traffic is at its best in LA on the freeways on Sunday morning. The Getty opens at 10. Forget what you usually do Sunday mornings: go to church, read the paper, go to brunch, go to the beach, etc. Just be there at 10:00. This is a world-class museum, as you will note from the many languages that are being spoken all around you as you board the tram, and no matter what season you go, it will be busy. There is no admission fee per the Getty Trust, but there is a $15.00 charge per car. That means if you have four people in your car, it will cost $3.75 a person. Can’t beat that. Where else can you be entertained for a whole day for $3.75?2) FIRST, TAKE THE ARCHITECTURAL TOUR. You don’t care about architecture? Me neither. I just went because my daughter was taking an architecture course, and I thought I’d keep her company. Trust me when I tell you, to take that 45-minute tour is to truly know the genius that is Richard Meier. Every single stone in that place is designed for your comfort and pleasure. Did you know that beautiful travertine was mined in the same quarry where the stones for the Roman colosseum were mined? That all the railings resemble those of a cruise ship; open, and not solid so that as the sun moves across the sky, you will see different lights and shadows as it progresses? That the beautiful grounds tiles are made roughly the size of your own “personal space” which makes you feel comfortable even though you don’t know why? Me neither. I wish I could remember the name of our excellent tour guide – I think it was something like Janet Jackson (I remembered that) or maybe Janice Jackson – but I didn’t have my reading glasses on. I could go on and on, but go yourself and hear it first hand.3) NEXT, TAKE THE COLLECTIONS HIGHLIGHTS TOUR. Every picture tells a story, but if you go with a docent, you learn so much more! Who painted it? Why did they paint it? Were they friends with the subject? What was going on in the world at the time it was painted? Is it paint, or pastels carefully glued together? Or some other medium? Why was that particular background or area chosen? Who are the other people in the picture? Sometimes just learning that can put a whole new spin on a painting or piece of art. Sadly, I missed most of this tour because the architectural tour ran late (but it was worth it). However, I did happen upon the docent speaking about some of the paintings in different galleries as I walked through them, and could see that this, too, was a tour not to be missed. There is one at 11:00 AND at 1:30, so if you can’t catch one, hopefully you can catch the other.4) AND FINALLY, TAKE THE GARDEN TOUR. Not everyone cares about flowers and plants. But again, you will be amazed by the scope of these gardens, what you will learn, and how much more you will appreciate what went into creating them.For this enlightening day, I am speaking to adults. The Getty Center has other amazing programs and art tours designed for children, with little games and prizes which encourage them to learn and discover certain pictures, and notice the differences in styles. But if you are there alone or with other adults, you will certainly “get” what makes The Getty Center so very special by following my suggestions. So go. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathiek611
50,World Class! Must see in lifetime!,"I have been to many museums, art galleries, gardens, places with great views, and unusual combinations thereof...and this has it all. It is truly world class, and I would say the top attraction for Los Angeles and the West Coast.There is no cost other than $15 to park. Then you take a tram up the hill to Center which is built on the top of a hill which provides stunning views in all directions. There are different time period galleries to visit as one goes through the various buildings with paintings on the upper floor and myriad other things on the lower floors. The individual Getty guides iPods, which you can get for free as you enter, are wonderful and well done...simple earphones and numbers by the exhibit to listen to the information about it. You can go slowly or skip an area that is less interesting, though every collection is so fine that I suspect one would need a few visits to take it all in and not get too much sensory overload, in fact it would be a primary reason to return to Los Angeles.The gardens scattered about, not large, but very well done, were relaxing to stop at, and I should add that the whole place is very well kept and this adds to the whole experience. There are sculptures in different places which are most interesting...which is to say that the experience changes from art to history to gardens to sculptures to vistas, all enhancing and deepening the experience in a way not found in too many places.Now let me say that this trip was planned with a friend visiting us in Tucson from New York, and as I looked for things to do in LA...the Getty Museums are at the very top and a very good reason to god to LA... Unless, of course, you like endless backed up freeways, crazy drivers, and a great metropolitan sprawl.The eating choices are just right. There is kiosk in the center courtyard with a goodly amount of choices and seating, a large cafeteria with lots of choices and a good view and directly above it a good restaurant with outstanding menu and wine list and good prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintjack
50,An Amazing Place,"Beautiful architecture and gardens and views (on a clear day), a variety of art and exhibits. Not recommended for children. Wheelchairs for loan, even for larger sized patrons. Certainly worth a visit if in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallis642
30,Meh,"The facility is fabulous. The amenities are free ( free umbrellas?!?!? when it rains). Butv for the most part, the art is sub-standard. Photo collection is great. Cafes are great. Views are great. Art isn't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,"amazing landscaping, good art collection","the getty center is a wonderful place to walk, have some picnic and see nice art. Its not a huge collection, it takes about 2 hours to see all. Keep with you the parking receipt and go also to the Getty Villa, then your parking will be courtesy (at the Villa).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcos_mmdo
50,"Gorgeous, fascinating",Our son lives in LA and we always want to visit the Getty each time we go down there. It's an amazing place and different every time we go. And FREE!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariposaGirl
30,A lot of building but not a lot to see,"Nice building, nice views, not a lot of art. Annoyingly after trekking up here in the train there are no cafés open passed 3pm for a drink or snack which wasn't great in the heat and with a small baby. Not sure I would recommend the place to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCB1980
50,Totally deserves the #1 spot!,"Went here with cousins from Michigan and Canada and my three kids ages 8, 7 and 6. We loved it! It is a must see when you are in LA. It is not that type of museum that would bore you because there are lots of exhibits to choose from, from architectural, religious, art, photography and their gardens are spectacular! You will spend a good 30-45 mins taking photos (or, selfies!) at the gardens alone. Plus a picturesque view of LA and the beach from afar. Too sad we only spent 2 hours here. Allot half a day or even a whole to appreciate everything in this place. Did I mention that theres no entrance fee? Just a $15 parking fee which I think is pretty reasonable because you get to ride the tram from parking to the museum itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merceditasd
50,Must see in LA,"We didn't plan on visiting the Getty Centre but we had extra time and drove up. This was my favourite part of LA by far. Parking is $15 and then the rest is FREE. Incredible to think that this beautiful structure with stunning art is available to anyone who can get there. A quaint tram takes you up the hillside to a palace of travertine in the sky. There are multiple buildings with various types of art (photography, sculpture, paintings) for visitors. The gardens are stunning. The views of the city below are spectacular.There are audio tours and docent led tours available.A beautiful space MUST SEE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessaw510
50,Getty Center LA,"What a find in a big city, a real gem and it's absolutely free! The views of LA are spectacular, the gardens cry out to be enjoyed, the sculptures scattered around the gardens need a day alone to fully explore, the cafe is extremely reasonably priced for refreshments (if you haven't packed your own picnic) BUT the main attraction is the magnificent collection of art. There is Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh amongst many others - the mind boggles at the enormity of the collection. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly, it is in a nutshell, an absolute must on any visitor's list of things to see in LA. I will definitely return there when back in LA. Thank you John Paul Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629suel
50,Great place!,"Highly recommended! I loved this place! you can spend the whole day there: beautiful gardens, lots of interesting art to appreciate, great view of the city, and it is free entrance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melaniamb

40,LA 2013,Beautiful. Love it. Nice view. Spectacular artworks. Will definitely go back if time permits. Must see. Worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineluzelf
40,"Great setting, nice exhibitions","The permanent collection is quite interesting, but your emphasis should be on their special exhibitions. Besides the art the architecture itself is worth the visit, including the gardens. Unfortunately the fountains have been turned off (probably required by law) ""due to the drought"", but this is another topic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydreamer58
40,Pretty cool,Super amazing gift shop. Fantastic tour guides who really know the history of the collections. Don't go to be entertained--go to learn and you won't be disappointed. There are classes and workshops and projects. Great for artists and historians.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAnnC
50,I'm Addicted to this Museum!!!,The museum houses every genre of art that exists. The outdoor garden and the sculptures scattered around the exterior of the museum are tough to find anywhere else. There are so many different buildings and floors of art that you would need multiple days to see everything. This place is an art-lover's dream!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvanTravelGuy
50,Worth it for the building and views alone,"Lives up to all the expectations: the views are just breathtaking and the architecture balances the art and the lure of the landscape beautifully. It's free to visit and when I was there, there was a children's festival celebrating chivalry and the middle ages. Very fun.The art is breathtaking - I enjoyed the decorative arts and photography exhibits very much. Do try and make it to every inch of the grounds; there are constant surprises around every corner.The audio guide (an ipod touch that plays clips for pieces of art and particular room across the whole museum) was also free and a wonderful companion to the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/her0ng
50,So much wonderful art to see,"I had but a short time to visit the Getty Center but plan to return for a more extensive look at a later date. The layouts of each of the rooms housing the paintings and other works of art are well thought out and very appealing. The architecture of the buildings themselves is awe inspiring and the garden area is delightful. There are great views towards the city and ocean. For me the only downside was that there were 3 classes of fifth- sixth graders visiting and they detracted from the otherwise peaceful surroundings. I will see both the Getty Center and Getty Villa next time, as paying the $15 for parking pays for both locations. Also, take your parking ticket with you as you need it to pay before getting back into your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WStaso
50,Great view,"should visit here for city view. Bit far from city center, instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JHS432
50,Excellent museum,An amazingly wonderful view on the tram ride up.Took a tour as a quick overview. A huge facility with many different art mediums. Great collections of art. Ate at the cafe. Good selection of fresh foods. Definite must see. Museum is free but must pay a parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommal2014
50,nice proposal place,"My boyfriend finally proposed during our getty center trip. Beautiful location, nice, friendly staff, great exhibitions, very cool gift shops (always spend tones of money there :). Get that balancing eagle for a gift for kids, they love it!!!! if u live or visit la, it is a must see destination, as well as getty villa in Malibu. I was happy with the proposal and a 3CT gorgeous diamond ring (have to show off ...sorry :))) and he look to be more excited with the deal he got during auction at US Jewelry Liquidation . Will be coming back again soon !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katemM4165GY
50,A peaceful oasis high above LA,After the frenzy of Los Angeles traffic you can't quite believe how calm and peaceful this beautiful place is. Go for the architecture and the landscaping as well as the art it contains. We didn't have time to see all of the galleries but with regularly changing temporary exhibitions one could return time and time again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jandominic
50,Breathtaking Views,"I'm not much into old art but wanted to go here for the views and location which didn't disappoint. Amazing views over Los Angeles made this well worth a visit. Interesting gardens and landscape, fun journey from the car park, and if you like old art then you can't go wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CazandPJ
50,Awesome constrution,I'm not an art guy but the building is simply awesome. After 30 paintings I kinda glossed over and started looking at the way things were presented and hung. It's very crafty how they get so much on a wall and not have a problem. The art is really amazing to. The way the old masters did such detail work with limited tools and paints is special. But my enthusiasm was for the overall lay out and the fine detail to work. It has very close tolerances between massive stones set as walls and border fences. The whole place is awesome. Go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HamiltonTexas
40,Windows of Light,The Getty Center is a must see for tourists. The indoor restaurant provides a respite from walking through the many docent-led exhibits and landscaped grounds. The fresh luncheon offerings revive flagging energy levels in a light-filled setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAKSPIN
50,Beautiful art and vistas,"Another classic LA attraction. You will need to ""reserve"" a free ticket ahead of your visit through the website, but the only thing you pay for once there is the parking. A small fee to pay considering the beautiful Westside vistas and the myriad of art collections you get access to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKim84
50,A beautiful place to hang out for an afternoon and play critic!--Good food too.,"I cannot decide which I like better, the building or the collection. The Getty Center is an expansion of the original Getty Museum which I last visited back in the 1980's. They converted that site into The Getty Villa, a reconstructed villa as it might have stood in Pompei, to house their collections of art from ancient Greece, Roma, and Etruria. They chose a hilltop site overlooking the entire Los Angeles metro area. The complex was designed by William Meier who did a masterful job of creating a space that makes you feel light and joyous. The entrance pavilion pays homage to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum by way of its spiral structure. The central plaza is a wonderful place for people to hang out and recoup from museum fatigue with a Tmid-afternoon espresso. The entire complex is faced, inside and out, with rough-cut Travertine marble which plays with the light throughout the day. hey also had to good sense to put all the paintings on the second floors of all the buildings to afford the maximum of natural lighting through skylights. My only criticism is that some of the works that are mounted higher on the wall reflect the light from the skylights in the form of glare and one has to shift around to find where to get out of the glare. It's a small flaw in an otherwise magnificent building.We spend the day primarily looking at the painting collection. (There is much more than you can do in one day so choose what you want to see!) It is a good collection, although I find many pieces in the Norton-Simon collection to be more memorable. Of course there are gems. There are quite a few early Rembrandts, including the well-known portrait of the old man in a feathered hat. Van Gogh's painting of irises from San Remy and one of Monet's 30-odd paintings of the facade of the cathedral of Rouen are there as well. The sweep of the collection is representative of Europe as a whole, without a lot of depth in any one artist. The renaissance works include a few of the masters (Massaccio, Tiepolo, Reni, Tiziano) are represented but few of the works are outstanding examples. Among Dutch painters, the Jan Steen paintings are very tame for Steen, and the single Van Ruisdael landscape that I noticed was good but, again, not an outstanding example. The is hardly anything from among 17th century Dutch still-lifes, although the two floral paintings of Van Huysum have always stood out in my memory.What a beautiful place to hang out for an afternoon and play critic! And if you want lunch--it's gooood. (See the cafeteria review among restaurant reviews.)Admission is covered by the parking fee ($15) and you take a tram to the hilltop. There are several family and play spaces so it is quite kid-friendly. It is also very accessible. The staff is assertively friendly and helpful. They always gave useful guidance. I was a little surprised that they had not yet put together audio guides that you can access through a smart phone. Here's hoping they are in development.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11StephenP11
50,A great afternoon!,A GR& place to hang out in beautiful LA! The tram ride up is fun and the only cost is parking. The exhibits are top notch. Bring a sack lunch and chill out on the lawn for a bit - Absorb all the atmosphere in. The Getty center in LA's climate is great any month if the year!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adnana_Mendieta
50,Fabulous,"We had planned to visit the museum prior to our trip, but when we saw tripadvisor rated it the Number 2 musuem in the US we felt like we had no other choice. It deserves the reviews and it deserves the rating we are so glad that we spent the 5 hours here. The views of Los Angeles are a special treat that comes along with the museum itself. This is a don't miss spot when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2674ZMjamest
50,A great way to spend the day!,"This was a fantastic way to spend a day in Los Angeles. I love to take photos and the views, architecture and landscape around the Getty are exceptional. Parking was easy and as long as you get there early the wait for the tram up the hill is very fast. The garden is breath taking. Bring a blanket and find a spot in the shade and you can have a wonderful picnic. We had a baby with us and getting around the museum with a stroller was very easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieP7
40,Amazing Architecture,"You really need a whole day to see this centre. The gardens are spectacular, as are the views.There are good American collections as well as European art and furniture, personally I came to the US to see American arts and crafts, but if you have never been to Europe, they have it all.We had Sunday brunch in the restaurant, pre booked online. A wonderful selection of light modern food, presented beautifully. Check out the menu online as it changes with the seasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muddy_8
50,Reservations no longer needed,"Some people avoid this museum because of their old policy of needing a reservation for parking. Apparently, that's no longer the case, so go and enjoy. The views and setting are as lovely as the museum. Nice venues to eat lunch too, and wonderful shops and bookshops around. Really, one of the best things in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattayainsider
40,spectacular,One of the very best designed museums I have been to. Amazing views and open gardens. It would be a five star experience except that they don't have the same level of collection as a genuinely first-rate museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalcharlie
50,A Must See,"This was a fantastic experience, Besides the wonderful collection of art, the views are spectacular, the architecture is breath taking and the gardens beautiful. A very welcoming and slick experience. Everything very user friendly. Thank you the Getty Foundation for giving the world this gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanieBello
40,a little disappointed,"Never managed to get to the Villa when it was the only Getty in LA but finally got to the (now not so) new Getty Centre and had been very much looking forward to it. The architecture, gardens and views are stunning. While I very much enjoyed the art I was a bit disappointed at the range on display and couldn't help thinking that there must be so much more locked away in the basement! Would still heartily recommend it to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El_Timon
50,A 'MUST SEE' if you are in LA,"Very nice architecure, very nice views on the city, very nice art, very well organized! DON'T MISS IT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carltasso
40,A Worldly Collection,"For anyone that hasn't visited Europe, a stop at the Getty Center will provide them a glimpse of global culture! A very well maintained and curated collection. Sadly the CA drought has drained all of the fountains, except one, but overall the experience was worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinW447
50,Art Lovers Haven,"The Getty was a lovely trip with incredible art collections. Even the grounds were beautiful. I most enjoyed all the religious paintings, they were breath-taking. There were also many artifacts and statues on display, all were a feast for the eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalineLovesRoadtrips
50,awesome museum,"After a nice drive down Mulholland dr. we came to The Getty Center.After the initial wait for getting into the parking complex, it was smooth sailing. Parking is 15$ flat.A light rail takes you to the museum premises - very slowly. there are a few bulidings with various art exhibits from different parts of the world.the paintings in some places are exquisite. especially the italian ones.some major players in those exhibitions as well. there is an area where you can display your creative genius as well, great location to keep kids and bored adults busy.The best part however are the flowers at the botanical garden. what an array of beauties. have to go back again.All the fountains were off to conserve water during the Californian drought.this place is a 100% go to if you are in LA. Dont miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fahym
50,Can't say enough about the Getty,"One of my favorite art museums anywhere. Wonderful changing collections, stunning architecture, great cafes and the nicest, most informative museum guards. Be sure to catch the short orientation film and save enough time to enjoy the many incredible views of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firstdaughter
50,Better than expectations,"My wife and I weren't entirely sure what to expect. What we found was nothing short of amazing. Amazing multiple pavilion layout, with a fully guided headset tour. Plan to spend the entire day there. Even the café food was great! The art work on hand in the permanent collection will take away your breath and fire your imagination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796jonathanc
50,Wonderful,"I love this place. Ideally located on the hills that surround parts of the LA freeway. The views from the center are great, and even though LA is hot, the Getty center is much cooler, obviously because of the elevation. The art collection here is wide and cuts across pre-medieval to medieval to modern art; my advice is to arrive early so that you have enough time to take it all in (and I believe you're allowed to take pictures). A very good feature is the audio guide (I-pod with earphones) that provides you with a narrative for all the group collections and major pieces. Another major plus is the restaurant, wow, the restaurant! Great food, even better than a lot of restaurants I've visited in LA (try the chicken with mash potatoes and mushroom sauce). The Getty Center is definitely a must-visit in LA. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hungryblackman
50,Great Visit,"Cost for parking, but entrance is free. Art is wonderful. We visited for about 2 - 3 hours and could have spent more time. We quickly walked through all the buildings and did not spend time lingering in any one area. We could have easily spent a few more hours, if we wanted to read and enjoy more of the Center. Good place to take children, but they may get bored with the art if too much time is spent in any one area. There is quite a lot to see, so staying in one area too long in the beginning may limit time spent in other areas later on. If you only have a short time, I'd suggest a relatively quick walk-through and then go back later to areas you want to spend additional time reading or looking at the art or exhibits. They have a food area and gift shop. The free headphones for touring worked great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureexperience1
40,Clean and Wonderful Center,"Went here with my boyfriend one day while visiting California. It was highly recommended here and on Trip Advisor so we made sure it was a stop on our list. Parking is $15, then admission is free. Taking the monorail to the Center was very cool and the views were awesome! The Getty Center itself is very gorgeous and laid out very well. We went in the month of July on a Friday, and even in the late morning it was pretty crowded.It took only a few hours to explore the Center. I particularly loved the photography as that is something I am drawn to. Lovely place that I would definitely go to again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852seanc
50,Loved the Architecture,"The Architecture, gardens and Sculpture are just beautiful, the view of LA is breath taking from The Getty Museum! Entry is free and a must on the to do list!

50,Some Culture in LA,Incredible architecture and incredible views. Great exhibits too. I go stop by whenever I'm in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnaJ6078YZ
40,So beautiful!,I recommend going just to see the gardens and the view of LA. People can walk around the property and take tons of pictures then go to Malibu for dinner. Perfect for a date or just sight seeingThe art is ok... I wasn't particularly into any of the exhibitions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milubidulia
50,Wonderful Place to Visit,"The art is wonderfully displayed & they have many kinds so everyone can find something they like. We spent the most time in the gardens! Wonderful! We also took a picnic lunch with us. There were many nice places to sit and eat with a nice view & not feel like you were imposing on any restaurants, etc Be prepared for a little bit to get up to it. Parking is at a lower area & there is a free tram to get up to Getty Center. Not bad, just be aware, you walk through the parking garage to get the tram, then a nice ride uphill to the actual Center. Some walking involved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darlenej2014
50,Wow,What a view in addition to the magnificent Art Museum. You down at Los Angeles. Beautiful setting and gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rschagrin
50,The Getty Museum,"The Getty has been called the modern 'Acropolis' and when you take the tram up the hillside and come upon this jutting, curvaceous, very-white museum and its spectacular perch overlooking Santa Monica, Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean, you understand the comparison.Built by Pritzker prise-winning architect Richard Meier, the Getty comprises six buildings on 110 acres, and the beautiful museum houses European paintings, drawings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, European and American photographs, and decorative arts.I started taking photographs and realized that the wonderful dichotomy of the stark exterior and opulent interior decorative arts wing would make a playful visual essay...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHASINGSANTAFE
50,I thought I reviewed the Getty already,"I LOVE the Getty. The one near Santa Monica. The Villa, I could leave but I see something new at the main location. I am into art from the 1400s and they have a great collection that they change often enough that I can see some great pieces every time I visit. They also have special exhibits that are usually interesting.Take a picnic lunch and eat in the garden or on the lawn. Its so pretty and a great adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanghusF
40,nice place but certainly not #1 in la,"We love the Getty Center, but it is certainly not the #1 attraction in LA. Not even the top museum in LA - there are better collections at LACMA, Bowers and the Norton Simon, and there are better gardens at Huntington and Descanso. Great dining choices, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedml

10,You gotta be kidding,"Very avant garde. If you like mindless, pompous and artistic trash, you will like the Getty. Mr. Getty had no taste. They saw him coming when he was buying his ""art.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom9078
50,Must-see museum,"The Getty Center is a must-see destination for first-time travelers to Los Angeles. The museum is free (although parking is $15), but well worth the visit for incredible art displays and amazing views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiefGrandMaster
50,"Beautiful architecture, art and views.","My girlfriend and I spent a wonderful morning at the Getty Center. As neither of us are Art buffs we really only went to see the building and views. We did look at a few of the exhibitions which were very interesting. The gardens are beautiful as well.We really liked the idea of only having to pay for parking, it was extremely well organized. The building itself is amazing and it's position high up in the hills overlooking pretty much the whole of L.A means you get breathtaking panoramic views.This was a morning very well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dterry182
50,"Un-expectedly, breathtakingly stunning...go, go, go!","After multiple visits to LA where I must shamefacedly confess I hadn't made it to the Getty Centre, on this trip, I finally did and wow. It's quite simply one of the most amazing, fascinating, beautiful places in this or any other city I've ever been to.Exceptional value at $15 for car parking and then free entry to the centre itself means that there's absolutely no reason not to take a drive out to the valley and to take the tram up to the pristine white buildings perched on top of the hills.With room after room of antiquities, painting, sculptures, furniture, glasswork and furniture from throughout the ages to inspire and impress you, be prepared to step outside, wander round and have your breath taken away. The grounds are vibrant, well tended, generous and simply gorgeous with flowers, trees, water features, sculptures and views of the city that you simply cannot stop looking at. It's not only that it's impossibly perfect, it's that you don't expect it if you've never been there before and I imagine it to be the perfect place to take a picnic and savour the views and the atmopshere.With specific changing exhibits alongside the priceless pieces situated here all year round, this is probably not the place to take kids or anyone who needs entertaining. It's absolutely the place to take anyone who wants to experience another side of the city, indulge in a little culture or simply ascend above it all and while away a day in what seems like another world.Glorious.

50,Get there if you can,I recommend looking at the on line video to plan the visit ; there is lots to see never mind the fab views of LA from all points and the building itself. The cafe is also excellent 5 stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908stellaw
50,excellent,A really good visit. Amazing art works and fantastic views - all for free as well. Well done Mr Getty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682IanH682
50,"Cultural, beautiful and majestic","The Getty Center sits majestically on top of a hill above the 405 freeway in Los Angeles. A tram elevates you to the museum grounds. The view going up the hill in the tram is breathtaking. I have visited the different buildings that house the museum, been at the theater in the evening and eaten in the classy white table cloth restaurant. Yet the two amazing attractions are also the gardens with artistically arranged shrubs and trees,some which I have never seen elsewhere, and looking up at the architecture of the center itself. The way the light hits different parts of the buildings is a sight to behold. This is truly a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patdlng
50,Must see!,"Amazing feat of architecture, beautiful gardens, exquisite art. A quick shuttle takes you to the museum on a hill overlooking Los Angeles. Buy a coffee and delicious scone as a quick pick-me-up and see some of the most beautiful art in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marmatei2
50,Visiting the Getty,We were able to visit the Getty on a beautiful August day. We strolled through the museum and also enjoyed the outdoor patios where we could see LA. It is best to get there early as we noticed cars looking for parking spaces when we left mid-day. The tram from the parking garage to the center and back was fun as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheila916
50,A Must See,"You will not be disappointed if you decide to visit the Getty Center. The art exhibits, the buildings, the grounds are all first rate. The center has something for the whole family to enjoy and the views from the grounds of LA are amazing. The art collection is top notch. All exhibits are impressive as well as being educational. The grounds are landscaped extremely well will a good variety of plants. I look forward to returning on my nest visit to LA. This center is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolvewrine1952
50,The View...Is...Wow,Left here and realized I didn't look at any art. I just looked at LA. Can't imagine a better view of this beautiful place. And the architecture of the museum is fabulous 80's contemporary. This place is worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonderwandernyc
50,WOW! Fantastic and FREE on top of it!,"What am impressive museum! I really wish I had time to view more of the collections, but what I saw was fabulous.First you should know that this gem is FREE! If you cannot get there by public transit, you can drive and park for $15. After that it is free. You cannot beat that to see a world class museum. I am from the Boston area and to see the MFA is $25 a person. This is an unbelievable bargain!First be sure to watch the orientation movie and then take as many tours as you have time for. I took the Arts and Architecture tour and the guide gave a very informative tour. I really learned so much from her. I also really enjoyed the Impressionist building and the photography exhibit.Be sure to leave time to tour the gardens and enjoy the views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buttercup92
50,Superb museum!,"What a treat to be able to go to the Getty Center! The museum itself is housed in a fantastic building design by Richard Meier. It has an incredible view of LA. The art collection in it is spectacular. They have a beautiful collection of medieval manuscripts as well as prints and drawings from the renaissance on. From Canaletto to Rembrandt, Ingres, Renoir, Van Gogh... I wish I could go back time and agin to be able to admire everything. We did not have time to visit the gardens, we spend the morning at the wonderful Huntington Library and Gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomerols
50,I didn't know that they has such a rich collection!,"This museum surprised us in the most positive way. It started with the building, which was constructed by the same guy, Richard Meier, who constructed the town hall of The Hague, The Netherlands (where the Peace Palace and the international court of justice are). Then the garden. Although small, it was a wondrous landscape with an interesting combination of plants from both arid and humid environments, nicely situated along an artificial stream. And finally the interior. I didn’t know that Ensor’s Entrance of Christ in Brussels was part of their collection. This is one of the greatest post-impressionistic pictures! And they had Van Goghs Irises, one of his best paintings, and a smiling young Rembrandt. We needed more time, but our car was waiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert_Christophor
50,Breathtaking!,"Admission is free, Parking is 15 per car. Best place to go for awesome pictures and interesting exhibits! This museum is an absolute MUST SEE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502meln
50,WOW,A must see for anyone who appreciates art and architecture. The museum itself is as incredible as the works that sit inside its doors. Its perched on a hill overlooking LA and is just a stunning marvel of modern architecture and design.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacimovic
50,A place to go,"In the noisy and crazy environment surrounding LA, Getty Center is an true oasis. The architecture and gardens are astonishing. Particularly I did enjoy any specific exhibit, but even though the visit to the site, including the ride by tram to the mountain, is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiosteinberg
50,World class museum 5 minutes away,"The Getty provides the angelenos with a fantastic museum close by. The Getty is located right of the 405 Freeway. Plenty of parking but get ready to pay $15 per car. Admission is free. If you come by Bus or Taxi you do not have to pay.. A bargain.. The gardens are amazing, The views of Los Angeles are breathtaking. There a few choices of places to eat but if you feel like bringing a picnic - they are plenty of large lawns for you to enjoy... I recommend you spend a few hours here. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WittyK
40,"Well worth a visit, a bit laborious to get there, self service not wonderful","The good. A really beautiful setting on the top of a hill with really spectacular views of the LA area. we really liked the building architecture and of course the art. We like the impressionist period and managed to see several artworks not seen in the flesh before so ver satisfied! The less good. Access to the Getty is by a dedicated metro up the hill which you take from the parking lot. maybe it was us or the direction we came from but we found the signposting to the Getty car park rather cryptic. We got a metro straight away but you might have to wait some time for one at peak times (same for the ride downhill at the end of the day...). We also used the self service cafeteria for lunch. The food was ok but the service terrible and disorganized, it wasn't that busy but my lunch took ages to be prepared (it got processed after several later orders) and then it sat on the counter getting cold. By the time I received it, it was uneatable and I asked for it to be be replaced. That kind of spoilt the experience of eating together.So conclusion - really worth a visit but beware the self service!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nazaire
40,Interested grand sons...,"My wife and I took our grand sons, age 12 and 15 years old. I don't know whether they were both just being nice or what, but they didn't complain and seemed interested in some of the art and statues. From the tram to and from the museum, we spent about 2 hours on the Getty Museum grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FKI2014Sept

50,Beautiful Grounds,The Getty is awesome! I went with my boyfriend and had the best time walking around the museum. and the grounds are beautiful as well. They have beautiful fountains and flowers and plants. there is a nice little cafe outdoors that you can grab a lite lunch. You have to park in a parking area a little ways away and take a little tram up the Getty. The views from up there of LA are very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
50,One of the best Places to take out of town visitors,"Whenever I have friends or family visit me from outside LA, I always bring them to the Getty Center and the response is always fantastic. people love the combination of Great Architecture and Gardens in a beautiful mountaintop setting with those fabulous views of LA. The mix of culture and nature is a hit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShuMamoon
40,Beautiful and promising,"At the top of a hill overlooking a freeway and Los Angeles, this museum has a small collection, but hopefully growing. The building itself is impressive, as is the train going up the hill. The strong features include a Van Gogh blue lilies masterpiece. It only takes about 90 minutes to see the entire museum, but if you are an art lover, you shouldn't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeBaileyCole
50,"Beautiful, serene, magnificent…...","This is a place for those who love museums, historical sites, and want a serene place to visit. The architecture and story of the building of the museum is fascinating. Also, the docents are extremely knowledgeable and want to help with information. The gardens surrounding and the view are so peaceful and serene. It is a lovely spot to just breathe. We ate in the little cafe, soup and fruit and it was delicious and healthy. I enjoyed this visit very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6LisaH
40,Good for a few hours,"This was a huge museum, and a lot of interesting art. We spent 15-30 mins on each section. There are 5 sections (N,W,S,E and Exhibition).

50,Extensive art collection and beautiful architecture.,"Admission is free, though parking for the shuttle service is $15, so come with a group. There are many types of art scattered throughout the expansive grounds. There's also a little cafe in the courtyard where they sometimes have live music. Sculptures can be found while meandering the premises, all while taking in the architecture that J. Paul Getty had made for the public to be able to appreciate fine art for a price unparalleled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLRYacct
50,Not Enough Hours in the Day...,"The Getty Center is still FREE. The parking is 15.00/car but the museum is gratis. No expense was spared in it's construction and it's galleries. It is truly Magnificent. The views from almost anywhere due to it's lofty Santa Monica mountain location are expansive and all encompassing. They have delicious food at two restaurants, where the selections are many and are cafreteria style. There is a more upscale restaurant, but I haven't been...yet.The attractions are varied and always breathtaking. Manet, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Matisse, Italian frescoes, marble statues, amongst many other artist's works, reside here.Pick a few friends, plan a day and arrive early.

50,Absolutely beautiful!,"First off, make sure you read the website carefully to find the parking entrance! I had quickly read the address before leaving the hotel and heading out. I ended up in the neighbouring streets which was exactly what I was trying to avoid! The Getty really needs a few more signs to guide tourists. Go early as the parking lot fills up fast. It is also a much better experience with fewer people, there was no line up for the tram that takes you from the parking garage to the Getty and then part of the enjoyment is the feeling of having this expansive architecture and amazing views practically all to yourself! Go on one of the free tours. We went on a garden tour as a way to become familiarized with the grounds. Very interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday005

50,Getty center a true Californian jewel,Getty center it's an amazing place to go. The gardes are a dream you can have a picnic there. Art is amazing and always,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmenmadani
50,Getty Museum,"Our family has enjoyed both the Getty Center and Getty museum in Malibu multiple times. As long as you confirm parking in advance, both museums are a nice way to spend about 2 hours with the kids. In both cases, the architecture of the museums in and of itself is definitely a major part of the attraction. The Getty should expand the ""investigative scavenger hunt"" they offer for kids--as they get through the cards quickly and they enjoyed finding the art. I don't recommend eating at either place. Both offer occasional planned activities/shows (music; plays) and it would be worth it if possible to coordinate your visit with an enhanced offering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543susanned
50,Beautiful and worth it!,"Plan to spend the day as there is much to see. There is a huge underground parking garage which does charge but admission to the Getty Center itself is free. You will park and then take a tram up to the top. The whole place itself is like a work of art. Amazing architecture and the gardens are an absolute must-see! When I went, you were allowed to bring your own food and we had a picnic on the lawn over looking the garden but I don't know if they allow that anymore. EIther way, there is food and wine available for purchase on site. Plan to spend several hours as there is much to see. I even stumbled across Van Gogh's Irsies. It is a lovely way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahLMT

50,I Could Live Here,"The Getty Center is gorgeous. Peaceful. Calm. Refreshing. Park for a nominal fee and you and your car load of visitors or stressed out LA dwellers can ride the Getty shuttle up and away into the hills to paradise.The ride up is a transition from traffic, deadlines and worries to what feels like another world.On a clear day LA is far away and down below - miniaturized in the distance from the hilltop view.The marble buildings, the pools and fountains, the gardens are cool and soothing and able to release imagination and loosen the knots. I feel free and ""new"" at a Getty visit.The art is wonderful - Classical, historical and contemporary.Expect to spend four or five hours here.

50,Amazing inside and out,"A true treasure in Los Angeles and completely free. A normal person would never think they would get to see such masterpieces in their lifetime yet there they are (rotating exhibits) right there at the top of the hill, right off the 405. This museum is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. The only thing I DON'T like is the sound of people squeaky tennis shoes on the beautiful wood floors when you're contemplating the gorgeous artwork. Also, the food options are not that great if you're spending the day there, and the visit is not completely free - parking is around 10 bucks, but I'm not complaining. The outdoor garden and water feature (when we're not in a drought) is really amazing and zen like. Very highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morgan6157
