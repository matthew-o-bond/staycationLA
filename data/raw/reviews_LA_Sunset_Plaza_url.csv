40,Small but interesting area of the Sunset Strip!,"This area comprises a couple of short blocks of specialty shops and restaurants (most of which have patios for those with dogs). The restaurants are on the pricey side but uniformly good in my humble opinion; I especially like the Chinese-Japanese hybrid restaurant called ""Chin Chin"", which I recently reviewed separately. Le Petit Four is another good restaurant. Mel's old -fashioned diner, a wonderful retro place, is also there and has the standard diner fare as well as delicious, thick milkshakes and malts! There are several high end clothing and makeup/skin care boutiques, some very nice salons including the well-known Jessica salon and other shops and services there. There are free parking lots on both sides of the street for your convenience. They have their own website including a great directory that I recommend visiting, which is SunsetPlaza.com",cmkr1969

Le Petit Four has some really great French cuisine, I love the Chinese food at ChinChin, and the new Italian place is also good fun for drinks and a pizza! There is always lots of outdoor seating, plenty of parking in the back, and there is plenty of celebrity/people watching. Once in a while it can feel a little pricey and snooty, but most of the time it's a fabulous place to walk around, shop at Fred Segal or one of the other great little boutiques, and have a great outdoor meal with some friends and a bottle of wine.

Their Dry Martini's are brilliant.Whilst the menu is good and the ambience great the thing that really make the restaurant special is the Maitre 'D - Dmitri Dmitrov. He is a sort of John Laurie character with Rudolph Valentino hair, an Eastern European accent powerful enough to seem to be invented and manners so visibly courteous it is almost theatrical. He ducks his head, bows deeply as he escots you to your table in a room filled with pictures of vaudeville-era unknowns. His attention to providing service is beyond compare. Nothing is to much trouble for him. I went there with some friends to had moved to LA recently and tey suggested restaurant. They don't go there often but when we arrived the Maitre 'D remembered them by name and greeted them with cordial but respectful greetings.Apart from the restaurant being a favourite of Jennifer Aniston, Johnny Depp, Anderson Cooper, Dave Stewart etc it is worth going there just to experience the service of Dmitri.",Kruger C
40,"Choices, choices, choices","As a set painter in Hollywood we often wind up working within walking distance of Sunset Plaza which is really cool as everyone on the staff wants different food. We all go to different places and then sit together at the common tables. If you like eating outside and doing some people watching while having some good food and laughs with friends, this is the place to do it. Tourists with family and/or friends can come here without too much fear of getting robbed which is a plus in parts of this town.......and I'm not talking about pick pockets or thieves. I'm talking about restaurants. The ones that ply the tourist trade tend to be priced out of this world, at least for Americans. Foreigners from countries with still viable economies would probably think they were rather cheap. Nevertheless, there is something for every budget at this location.",Ruben C
50,Very nice restaurants,"loved all the shops and restaurants along Sunset Blvd, so many choices in food. Loved a place called Church key.",Ruth L
40,A nice area on Sunset....,"Sunset is a little up and down and although it is slowly being gentrified as the years pass, a lot of it is a little seedy. One stretch they have got OK is Sunset Plaza. There are good restaurants anf the central reservation is nicely planted.",DavidHBlair

30,Plenty of eateries nothing special,"Sunset plaza is part of sunset boulevard. Whilst there is a strip of restaurants, it is just a name where supposably celebrities eat? Nothing special.",David & Tricia
50,We walked up to Sunset Plaza from the hotel.,West Hollywood is a great area to walk in. We stopped in at Rosa Mexicana for a Margarita and some guacamole with chips.,Giudita
50,Seeing stars!,"Anyone who thinks that Los Angeles doesn't have its fair share of sidewalk cafés should pay a visit to Sunset Plaza. A chic, little two-block strip of fashionable but expensive boutiques and outdoor cafés nestled between Hollywood & Beverly Hills, Sunset Plaza's trendy bistros line both sides of the Sunset Strip adding a European flair to West Hollywood.",Simona R
40,Outside dining hot spot,We asre big outside diners and this is probably the best people watching spot in LA. Right on the Sunset Strip with great looking people and cars. There are multiple choices for food and they are all good so just find a parking spot and wander until you find the menu that suits you.,buddy r
50,Cool area in West Hollywood,"This is very nice to visit, as it is so different compared to the other end of Sunset Boulevard where the expensive houses are located. Here you some strip clubs and very nice restaurants - can recommend to eat at Le Petit Four.",Mads

40,Classic West Hollywood,"You definitely feel like you're in West Hollywood here! Restaurants and fashion boutiques all in a stone's throw of each other. As expected, they come with a higher price tag. Traffic is intense but that's expected in LA. Will be back!",us_traveldiary
50,Delightful,"Just a wonderful place to stay! Rooms are large, beds are comfortable, nice breakfast that is included with your room rate and the staff are so very nice. Wouldn't stay any place else.",CayucosGirl

30,Large Variety of restaurants,The sunset plaza has a wide variety of restaurants and cafes with all types of cuisine to offer. It's a nice spot to sit back and watch the world go by with friends and family. The shopping was fairly pricey on the plaza and there are much better shopping bargains to find in la.,renee n
40,Great choice of restaurants,"The strip has a great choice of eating venues, I wasn't really impressed with the shopping. We stayed at the Andaz Hotel on Sunset Boulevard walking distance to a numerous amount of eating establishments. Noticed a lot of shops vacant so I guess the Strip isn't as popular as it used to be, although in saying this it's a great place to stay especially the fact that you can walk around without having to get transport.",Dragonsholiday
50,Shop & Eat with the Stars,"I can't wait to shop & dine at Sunset Plaza when I come to West Hollywood. I love to shop at Nicole Miller, BCBG,& Sunset Kids. They have great finds & good attentive service. It is so much nicer than mall shopping.My best service this year was from the owner of Sunset Kids. I needed various sizes for 5 different children & he was so helpful.We always shop & then have lunch , or dinner. We never miss the landmark Mel's & we love Cafe Med. I have seen several celebrities there. We like to dine on the patio & watch the tour buses, nice cars(old & new) & people watch. You have to go.",Nanc8

50,Good Shopping and Eating!,good few shops close to hotel - restaurants excellent along the plaza. Great sales at this time of year!,LindaT1313
30,Be careful to shop only within the Sunset signs or you may get ticketed,"There were many shops and restaurants in this area. Some were overpriced but interesting to look at. Great parking in the back so nice not to have to pay while you shop or eat. Large signs at each end reminding people that they will be ticketed (or towed?) if they leave that area and go beyond to shop, like to H&M.",Jean705
30,Over Rated and A Waste of Time,"Locals who go there do so because its close by. Tourists will find nothing of interest here. Its essentially an outdoor mall with little restaurants and while the parking is good, there is nothing special here anymore.",colonelscott
50,Be seen,"Our tour guide pointed this out and gave us the low down on the benefits. Lots of celebrities and even more fabulous cars passing by. If you want a great place to sit outside, star gaze and check out the world most expensive cars while having a nice cool drink this is the spot in Los Angeles",J L
40,Nice shopping and lunch,"I like the Sunset Plaza because there is few nice shopping stores like Roberto Cavalli, Armani Exchange and etc. So after little shopping spree you can have a lunch and relax in the choice of nice restaurans that located in the Sunset Blvd.I would recomend this place for lunch time.",Yana S
50,Great entertainment,"This is a cluster of small outdoor dining restaurants sitting on Sunset Boulevard. The views are terrific, exotic cars, cute models and we actually saw a tv personality. THE PRICE OF THE FOOD AND DRINKS DEFINITELY IS WORTH THE ENTERTAINMENT.",Kathy M

50,Delicious afternoon,"Thanks to our thrifty bell at the Roosevelt, we happened upon free parking in a very elegant part of West Hollywood, Sunset Plaza. We lunched outside on mussels and trite, and before the coffee arrived I dipped into the BCBG next door. It was a lovely afternoon and I would recommend the area hands down.",Kampol and Euge... B
50,We've walked miles,"I think it's enjoyable to walk leisurely along Sunset and the Plaza. We have done it often. We will stop in to grab lunch at any one of the numerous cafes. We have our ""A"" favorites. Shops are nearby if you are interested. I think it's best when you are not in a hurry and can just relax and enjoy L.A.",D w

40,Go for a stroll and star search!,It is a nice trendy neighborhoold with cafes and restaurants. The stars will typically hang out in this neighorborhood (along with paparazzi). Go to the local starbucks and people watch!,sjsanchez
50,Star Spotting,If you come to LA and your searching for a celeb this is the spot. Tons of food options at wonderful outdoor eating areas. The beautiful people are here even if they aren't stars. Great for people watching besides a great afternoon dining spot. Check out the million dollar cars on Sunset as they pass by. Everyone needs to eat here once.,Steven B

40,Oasis on the Strip,We were staying nearby on the strip and we received some restaurant suggestions from our concierge. We walked down and was pleasantly surprised by the variety and number of restaurants. We chose a local Italian restaurant that we enjoyed.The area is easy to walk around it and is probably a great place to people watch in warmer weather. It was a cool November night so that wasn't happening. It's a nice area. Would I go out of my way to go there. Probably not unless I was going to the area to a club or just touring.,coachboon
40,Great options.,"First, you can park in the back lot for free and go to a ton of great places. Le Petit Four is my favorite there, but there are a lot of other great restaurants and bars and shops to go to.",Geoffrey S

50,"TOURIST SPOT, FOR SURE","SUNSET PLAZA is a place where I had many a lunch and fabulous shopping. The original Brown Derby, a true celebrity spot, morphed into one of my favoritr restaurants, LE DOME. Sdly, that too is gone.Walking from La Cienega Boulevard to the west is a tangle of classy and tacky . There are some pretty funky places to shop in,. KATANA i(I hope that is right) is a really magnificent Japaneserestaurant, it is really quite imposing, it is on the right hand side as you travel towards the SUNSET PLAZA. Unfortunately, I didn't eat there, but will the next time.You will think it a bit tacky too. There are so many tourists that I'd be surprised if you saw any celebs.You will find lots to do, especially Eating Drinking and Shopping. MAYBE A TATTOO!",QUEENIE_ELLE

I received a body treatment and a facial and I was blown away. We travel a ton and love trying so many different spas. This spa by far is a hidden gem. If you are blessed enough to have the opportunity to try a spa, Ole Henriksen spa is the place to try. I had Danny for my body treatment and Angelica for my facial, what true professionals. My wife had Narine for her facial, she loved it as well! Not to mention Narine has her very own book on skincare. The people who work there are true professionals!",saun v

50,Stepped up!,This place is walking distance from about any thing you could need or want. Our hotel room and countyard were very very beatiful and the House of Blues is 2 doors down that was fun but the hotel was as nice a place i'd ever been the staff (paticularly Carlos and Fred the manager and general manager) were very very accomodating the rest of the staff also Our room was extremely nice windows opened to the courtyard the jasmine and bougenvilla were right at our 2nd story window fragrancing our room Beds were very comfortable parking was easy and more than ample pricing was very fair GOOD TIMES! at the Best West Sunset Plaza Hotel rick,Rick S
