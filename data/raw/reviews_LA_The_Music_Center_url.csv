50,Incomparable auditoria,"A unique assembly of performance auditoria is one of the largest performing arts centres in the US. The most recent stunning addition is the Walt Disney Hall which was unveiled in 2003.Fortunate to attend a LA Phil performance we marvelled at the Gehry design and the magnificent performance space with superb acoustics.We were delighted to see Renee Fleming in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, performing in the most enjoyable Light in the Piazza.A lovely concourse around the performance venues has open air cafes and water features.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,An unexpected interesting trip,"Ok, our family happened to just go in and wanted to have a look around. We found out that there were 2 options of walking tour. One was on your own with a hearing device that would guide you through the place and the other was a guided tour.If you have the time to spare, minimum 2 hours; take the guide tour. We had a fantastic guide Kathy Hubbard who was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. She made the dry topic of architecture, buildings and history so interesting. Thumbs up to Kathy and The Music Centre Symphonians üëçüèª",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oscarsee
30,Lots of construction,"SO, just the average rating as there is a ton of construction going on in the courtyard of the center.... it will be beautiful when completed but as of right now... not really anything to talk about.... the theaters are great (went to the Ahmanson this trip), and look forward to having it completed as to enjoy the pre show comforts of the outdoor seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markj4golf
50,Humans gets to the heart of the matter,#Humans We have been seasons ticket holders for decades and if you are open to having a show truly move you this is a must see. This poor family is so dysfunctional it makes you feel happy about your own life. Everyone can identify with some aspect of this drama. The writing and ensemble cast is some of the best that I have ever seen. The acting nuisances and subtleties definitely did not go unnoticed. A must see for theater fanatics or just people that want to eavesdrop on an afternoon in a family‚Äôs challenging life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cape-SoCal
40,Great place to see a show and eat dinner,"The Music Center consists of 3 theaters, The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson, and the Mark Taper Forum, I haven't been the the Dorothy Chandler in years, but I have visited the Ahmanson and Taper many times, The Ahmanson is the theater that has the ""bigger"" shows musicals, comedies, and dramas. The Taper is a much smaller, intimate theater, almost in the round.Both places are excellent if you are a theater fan. They have prices in every budget.In addition to the theaters, there are several good eating venues, all owned and operated by Patina Restaurants,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyincali2016
50,Excellent freetour,"Enjoyed a free tour that focused on the exterior of the Walt Disney concert hall and the interiors of the Taper, Chandler and the Ahmanson theaters. We saw the stunning stage settings within and the no-expense spared auditorium of each one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
40,A must for Theatre enthusiasts,"Dorothy Chandler theater (opera and dance), Mark Taper theater (play) and Ahmanson theater (musical) are the 3 theatres in the centre. A must visit for all theatre lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
50,An evening to remember,"The music center has multiple live performance theaters and is the place to go for seeing live theater in Los Angeles. Since you have The Dorothy Chandler for music, The Mark Taper for new style of theater and the Ahmanson for more traditional plays you have it all . This is completed by great grounds on site parking and restaurants both on site and with in walking distance. Some come just to see the fountains and grounds, most for the full theater experience. Check for last minute discounts. Tickets at their website or at discount for some performances on Goldstar. Enjoy dinner , or lunch and a play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA
40,"A beautiful night in Los Angeles, CA","My wife and daughter and I went to see Amelie at the Ahmanson Theater, which is part of the overall Music Center. I've been there before to see plays and it generally a very nice crowd. This evening was exceptional because it was clear, there were no hawkers bothering you or obnoxious buskers. It was just a nice night out with the newly developed park between the courthouse and County building all aglow with light. It was very nice. Nearby are a host of good restaurants, like the Blue Cow, and Museums - the Broad and the LAMOCA. Want to see those.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmZ4014DO
50,Review of the docent-led tour,"My sister and I went on the 90min free tour, led by the wonderful Carol Smith, on 2 August 2016. It includes all four auditoria, and because there were no performances scheduled we were able to enter the Disney Concert Hall, as well as all of the others.The tour takes you into some special places, such as the Founders' Room in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (no photos allowed), and the smaller Ahmanson and Taper theatres.Carol was engaging and enthusiastic - exactly what you want in a tour - the passion of someone who loves the centre, and conveys that so spectacularly well.I had done an equally as wonderful tour 18 months previously, and as a consequence had attended a performance of the LA Philharmonic (excellent) . I now had the opportunity to share the experience with someone else.Great venue, great tour! Keep it up LA Music Centre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,LA Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is great!!!,"I attended the ""La Boheme"" production. It was absolutely fabulous. Orchestra, singing, sets, costume were all just wonderful. Had a fun time. Very worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susangK9032XX
30,Disappointing Performances this Season,"As a season subscriber to the Ahmanson Theater at the Los Angeles Music Center, I am very disappointed with the lack of quality performances they have had this season 2015 - 2016. There have already been a couple of performances that I have walked out on because they were so stupid in my opinion. The other major inconvenience is the way the theater was built, there are steps every where both inside and out. They have never really made the complex accessible for disabled people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
50,Beautiful theaters~,"My favorite place in DTLA! If you love theaters, this is the place you need to check it out.3 theaters in this center, Dorothy Chandler theater (opera and dance), Mark Taper theater (play) and Ahmanson theater (musical).Beautiful courtyard with nice fountain. Many seating area with shade. There is a restaurant and bar in the courtyard. Also, taco stand and convenient store.Parking underground. Nearby attraction are city hall, Walt Disney Hall and The Broad museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
