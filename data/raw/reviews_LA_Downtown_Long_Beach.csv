Like downtown LA, Long Beach has completely transformed this area into a very friendly place for locals and tourists.It's taken years, but the transformation has been incredible. Easy to walk around with a variety of shops and restaurants. Go down Pine street and you can walk all the way down to the Aquarium. There are plenty of things to do for kids and adults.

30,"Watch your back! Lots of people around, lots of homeless","Downtown Long Beach has so much going on right now, there's lots of high-rises going up and lots of construction. Always watch your belongings because now that they tore down the park by City hall (new glass towers on Ocean Blvd) the homeless population has swelled and gone amok in this city.Other than that, there's lots of things to do, festivals, harbor cruises, Aquarium, Queen Mary, The Pike Outlets (needs more shops - like Victoria's secret, makeup, Sephora, kids stores, toy stores, etc...)The Vons grocery store on 600 E. Broadway is also an interesting experience. Watch your belongings here too. Not the same like it was in 2010. Too many homeless out front, they take over the bus stop and cruise the aisles looking for unsuspecting people to snatch their wallets. This Vons also allows dogs which is a no-no because they are not certified service animal dogs. Too many people that are not native to LB are moving here and don't understand the laws and hygiene. Who wants to shop for groceries and bypass dog pee, dog poo, dog hairs? Outta control. Go to another grocery store outside the downtown area if you can.. Maybe El Super.",townieconcierge

We love the design of the freeway access into and out of Downtown Long Beach. You can make a legal U-Turn if you miss the downtown exit on Freeway 710. There is also a clear sign for the freeway U turn on 710. Always be cautious though, as it's sad to know the British Family got killed by making a similar U turn in Florida.

30,Walk with Someone Downtown.,We stayed right downtown about 1/2 mile from Pine Pier. We had occasion to enjoy a few restaurants in the area and walk about a bit. It has much to offer if the air were cleaner. We did enjoy the walk down to the aquarium area and the shopping district with the Ferris Wheel. The lighted Ped. bridge gave a nice perspective of the busy streets after dark.We also walked the block around the Renaissance Hotel and the large sculpture area across the street. We found the loudspeaker music being played in this park very irritating and much too loud to permit a cell phone conversation.There is also a homeless group living in the greensward area right next to the side wall of the hotel. This walk was nicely planted and would have been a pleasant walk except for that. I was happy to not be alone.,Violette54

40,Pretty Clean and Tourist Free!,"For an ocean front downtown, one has to admire how much it has remained free from the look of tourism. Sure, it features many restaurants, shops, and what have you, however, it isn't choking with overripe chains that will leave you fleeting for the toilet. The place has kept its local charm and that charm fits the perfect balance of cleanliness with a hint of grit. You know, just the right amount that you feel safe, but know its enough to still feel local. That said, be sure to check out the many available condos for rent in the area! It's certainly worth your stay.",Thomas G
40,Surprised,"Having been to LA many times, I thought LB would be similar and had no interest in visiting until a friend told me otherwise. We met a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. We stayed at the Renaissance in the middle of downtown.I was surprised at how clean it is, how nice, and not too much traffic. Nothing like LA. I also liked that you can walk to many places.

40,Walk and walk,You can walk or ride a bike the Downton Long Beach. You cna take beautiful pictures and is well located.,Mab0828
30,From the hotels to the waterfront,"Downtown is difficult to quantify in Long Beach. It's kind of a sprawling area between Broadway and the waterfront over a stretch of about 2 miles. So I'll only write to the hotels and restaurants area. There are so many great choices and if you stay near the performing arts and convention center, you'll get the most optima and best bang for your buck. You can also walk to the waterfront area from there and avoid the hassle of parking. I like staying in downtown LB for business in nearby beach towns, most are less than 20 minutes drive, and LB has more to offer. Safety is my only concern and the reason for 3 stars. Daylight is great. At night I don't see near enough uniforms, but I see plenty of people and craziness that keeps me alert. Going out for a lengthy stroll alone may not be the best idea.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"

Close to the ocean, downtown Long Beach is a fun place to visit.",Amy R
40,"GREAT PLACE TO WANDER, RENT A BIKE OR ENJOY THE HARBOUR","There is so much in the downtown area that is listed under individual postings.

Rent a bike and go up the entire coastline to Seal Beach or just stay around the harbour area. No shortage of interesting adventures",SenorGancho
40,Downtown..improving .. headwinds..STILL,"I am a born and raised local, owning all our homes 4 miles east of Downtown.In my youth , I was forbidden to ride my bike downtown due to rough and gritty demographics and struggling businesses .It was MUCH more dangerous than now.Downtown has had a long hard struggle to become ""Tourist attractive,""/respectable"" and less fear .Improving Demographics and cost of housing is a plus as is the rising tide of opportunity which can ""raise all boats"" It is MUCH more pretty now .There are MANY upscale cafes, galleries, hotels, bars etc.It is a ""happening Place"", Lots of fun festivals that did not exist years ago.Some Critics might call this Gentrification but to me as a local , I enjoy seeing my hometown improve and there is enough housing for all demographic levels to reside ..There is plenty for all. However the trend is upscale and more upscale .So Where are the long time Downtowners going? Many are still there.Middle view :: There is a continued struggle dealing with Poor and Very poor.Think ""New Orleans by the Pacific"" The Downtown Associates have these great patrols who deal with them but they cannot be everywhere all the time. Crimes of opportunity happen in most large urban cities and despite the ocean close aura, do not be lulled by the beauty, bad people are close and they get around. Our Police do an xlnt job considering the labyrinth -maze of the downtown ""quilt""I am a cyclist who rides downtown from my home 3-5 days per week. I KNOW the routes:If one is on Bicycle..stay close to the Water..4th street or south. The bike lane system can get you around very well but finding them a challenge despite what brochures promise. Use the bikestation center and make them draw you a map because the Bike advocate map is cryptic.The Bad : If in the heart of Downtown ;Do NOT walk ""above"" 4th street after dark .Take Uber, Lyft, cabs or public transport whenever possible..There are many dark places where evil-doers can hide. The Police do a good job & are quick to respond but cannot be everywhere 100% of the time .So one must continue to be vigilant and carefulThe most crimes occur: above 7th street from Cherry on the East all the way to the 710 freeway on the West.As one can see on a map , 7th street is only 3-5 streets north of the Downtown area.DO NOT walk around staring at Fone-Device..thieves are targeting unsuspecting device users .Better to stop at a sidewalk or store ,get your bearings and proceed .Like New Orleans, Long Beach downtown is a FUN Spot It will remind you of The French Quarter or Magazine Street.Bottom Line : Downtown nicer but there are challenges..Be Safe and have fun, 'cause there is much fun to be had.Bring Plenty of back up power for your devices and try to hang out where the are lot's of smiley people.The area of 1st St and Linden is a nice village"" that locals enjoy also.",P-and-A-Belmont

50,"You've come a long way, Long Beach!","Did a tour of the City with friends that I worked with here thirty years ago; I must say that their redevelopment plan seems to have worked well, the downtown area is lovely and vibrant, with lots of attractive shops and good looking restaurants. They've managed to retain the best of the old buildings while adding new structures that blend well with the older architecture. You get the feeling of an open, airy city that would be a pleasure to go for a long walk in. Ocean Avenue is a delight to the eye, from start to finish. We all wished that it had been so welcoming back when we worked there!",DonaldYokum

10,Must be missing something here,"I wanted to put a review on regarding 'Downtown' Long Beach. Here I am not referring to the pier area, but the downtown area a few blocks back from the sea front.In my opinion, it feels dirty, soulless and somewhat threatening. We walked around on New Year's Day after having breakfast at the Breakfast Bar. You only had to turn a corner to feel it had a threatening vibe, with many rough sleeps.Even as a couple, it did not feel safe, I certainly would not recommend walking around alone even in daylight!",OnTravelsAgain

30,Parking way over priced for the area,"Having lived inLB for a few years, I certainly appreciate all the improvements to the area. But I feel that they put a little too many generic chain restaurants in the newer Pike development and not enough things to actually do. Would love to have some unusual shops, but not much other than a bunch of mediocre chain restaurants one after another. The Old part of Pine North of Ocean blvd has some more nice non chain restaurants. Do like the comedy club and the few restaurants that have have dancing and turn into nightclubs. I think the ridiculously overpriced parking really keeps a lot of people away. It is Long Beach after all not Beverly Hills. Shoreline village can be fun for kids with a few tourist shops and nice ocean views.",Timothy V
40,The city by the sea🌊🌊,"Not just Downtown Long beach, but Long Beach in general is a place for diversity & freedom. Starting from Ocean Drive, it is a scenic route going east into orange county. Dwntown LBC is a expensive area as far as living or renting one of the beautiful condo's that line the shoreline. Now for tourist, pine ave is one popular place, but it kinda sucks at this moment because of the repeated venues. For instance, there two taco places, two asian sushi places, etc. I think 2nd street is nice one can find eaterys, music, shopping, bars, etc....2nd streets popular venues would be Panama Joes, Legends bar, Dawgs (gets realllyyyy packed) ..if you keep walkin east you will run into belmont shore / Naples where u can participate in non motorized water sports....Kayaking, rowing, paddle board, rent a boat, Gondola thru Naples, hydroCYCling etc. Off broadway st which stretchs east to west always shows off the LGbt pride and there is a gay and lesbian center for tourist.

50,"I live here so it's easy to overlook, but friends from out of town love it.","I live here so it's easy to take it for granted. With a mix of the old and new it is magnificent. From turn of the century art-deco to modern it all mixes beautifully. For many tv and film fans, most productions 'set in Miami' are actually filmed here. For high end hotels there is a Westin, Renaissance, Hilton, two Hyatt's, a Hilton, the Queen Mary, and a Courtyard, Best Western, Varden, Rodeway, only to name a few. High scale eateries all the down to fast food, organic vegetarian, and pubs and small craft brewhouses galore. An expansive arts district and shopping, both boutique and chain retail all within walking distance of each other and the waterfront; as well as one of the largest convention centers in the area complete with a major sports arena and a major 'green marina area which annually hosts one of the largest gay pride celebrations each May and the nations most prestigious, and oldest running open wheel street racing event, the Long Beach Grand Prix each April. Pine Avenue is the main spot for fine and semi-casual dining and spirits and it often closed off to traffic for special events. Going on a cruise, stay at the Queen Mary the night before or after and Carnival Cruises terminal is just a few steps away. Also Catalina Express is right there as well. We also have a world class Aquarium of the Pacific.Not to be confused with the Long Beach Arena, painted by one of enviromental artist Wyland's largest murals in the world, encompassing not just the building but the roof as well. This is a great place to be year round and especially April through Labor day there is always something going on down on the Marina green, the Pike, or around. And year, this is all in walking distance. There is free mini bus transportation throughout the area and a minimal charge will take you east towards Belmont, Naples, and Alamitos Bay. There is even a water taxi. And free harbor tours as well. And our year round weather is almost always in the 70's or the 80's. Disclaimer: I do work for the Long Beach Grand Prix as a volunteer yet I am not paid or encouraged in any way to say this. As many of my friends have told me, they had no idea this was all here. Yeah it is, and we even have a ferris wheel and an everchanging lighting motif lighthouse. I'll be working at the grand prix and hope you make it out here.",James L
30,Good for a stroll Not much to see,"Not much to see- library, City Hall, post office, heading to free way. It is a walking city in the sense they have side walks, but you might find yourself ending on the free way. There are ample signs to tell you how to get around but you are probably better taking the bus to unfamiliar destinations. A lot of the stores are closing down (eg Nordstrom Rack) and Ross didnt have great selection. Other stores didnt interest me. Doesnt seem like a very popular tourist area. Better for business meetings. Kids will enjoy the boat trips and aquarium.",Melissa-Sue J

Right there is not customer service at all , she had degraded me I never said I wanted anything free for her to talk down to me was very disrespectful and for that reason I would never visit the pike again nor would I recommend any one to spend there time or $ there.

Relative to other places in the Southern California area it can be less crowded. But that not to say it doesn't get busy here. It does. A decent place to spend an afternoon.",am08540

God Bless.",robertlouisdonovan

It has the wonderful Naples residential area, Queen Mary and attractions, Belmont Shore, Waterfront and Oldtown. There are wonderful restaurants, golf courses (public and private), modern hotels, a world trade center and an airport that is large enough to accommodate the continental traveler but small enough to be usable. Long Beach is close to Baja, San Diego and the metropolis of Los Angeles. And, like all of the Beach Cities of Southern California, the weather is nonpareil. It's a great place to visit, vacation and to live.",LHANN2013

50,Wonderful and beautiful time,Loved everything. Kings fish house and the dueling piano bar and the restaurants are wonderful. We go every year and love all.,Julie C
50,SECOND STREET IS GREAT,"Lots of shopping, restaurants, and the beach is a block away! Give downtown LB a shot, you will not regret it!",jayhawkgrant
10,Stay away and protect your wallet!!,Nothing good to say about this place. Needs a major cleanup and revamp of the entire city. Parking is a ripoff. There are better beach cities to visit.,luvhb4evr
40,Great restaurants and boutique shopping,"Not a huge variety of stores, but there's enough to keep the group entertained when out for a stroll.",Anita I
50,ASOA,"Always south of Anaheim. I spend most of my time south of Anaheim street. From the new gyms, to some of my favorite hideaway restaurants, to the clean streets and friendly (and interesting) folks at Walmart, what more could you ask for",SonicSpringBok
50,day trip,Downtown Long beach is very pretty and an awesome place for a walkabout and little shopping. We stop here quite frequently when driving through or to dog beach.,Arlene E
40,"It,s great and it,s fun",Daytime or nighttime you have a reason to visit. The stores for shopping and the restaurant and bistros are wonderful. Put on your walking shoes and enjoy a great gelato or a smooth latte.,4minuu
40,Cool Events and Great Food,"I was there w/my family for the Soundwalk 2013 event (Arts Village) and it's always a good visit. Numerous really good eateries, craft beer, music venues. We always have a fun time.",MrDibbs90712
30,Poor City Planning,The city council of Long Beach has been screwing over downtown for years with poor planning and illogical developments. They want a thriving downtown like Chicago or New York but unfortunately they have piecemealed the development and now have no commerce and lots of section 8 housing.,MattA55
40,A Nice area to Visit,"Nice clean area, plenty of good shops and also only a short walk down to the restaurants. always great views wherever you look, a place you feel really relaxed in. Could not find anything negative about the area just watch out for the cost of some of the parking",Yorkie1948
50,Great food and ambiance!,So much to do. Great food. Definitely take the water-taxi for a quick and inexpensive tour of the bay.,jillian4227
40,Nice but crowded,There are several nice places to shop and eat in the downtown area. Parking can be a pain but it is worth it when you do find a spot. They do have parking garages.,Juanita K
50,Found the new Now and Then Thrift Store!,We got a little lost while trying to find WalMart of all things. We turned a corner and there was the Long Beach Now and Then Thrift Store! What a treat that was. I was really impressed with the 5th avenue area! I don't think I have ever seen a WalMart store front like that! How cool! Great place. Can't wait to go back and explore some more!,Susan B
30,So so,"I would rate this as ""so so."" I mean, there were no stores I felt compelled to go in, food options were chains like Bubba Gumps or P.F. Changs, and it was a long walk to nowhere. We had bikes, and I will say that the sidewalks were wide and there were bike lanes in many places. That made it worth while. Downtown is where you go if you have a specific place to go- Queen Mary tour, boat ride, convention center... But is not a small beach town with things to look at as you leisurely stroll.",Jodie D
40,Go to end Rainbow Harbor,"Go there down to pine avenue to Rainbow Harbor there are many atraction including whale watching, harbor watching, Aquarium of Pacific and more.",Adam B
40,"Great place to visit, eat and shop","Downtown Long Beach is one of our favorite areas to visit whenever we come to California, especially to attend a conference like we did recently at the Long Beach Convention Center.There are plenty of great places to eat, shop, even see a movie. You can take a historical tour, visit the amazing Aquarium of the Pacific, or have a picnic on the waterfront. The Queen Mary is also close by and is a fun place to eat, take their tour, or stay overnight. Of course there are several great hotels in the downtown Long Beach area, so you can easily walk to all of the above if you're so inclined.Parking can be expensive, however, even if you stay in a downtown hotel, but even when crowded, you can usually find a parking lot or garage to park in.Take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront as well. Downtown Long Beach offers something for everyone.",DiveMoreWorkLess
50,An exemplary urban renaissance,"Walkable, bikeable, sunny and friendly. They have a zillion shops, bars and restaurants to explore. Great bike poath right on the sand for miles and miles. Enough of the cool older character of the town is preserved with addition of new living space and entertainment. What's not to love?",BainBear
50,Great sights day or night!,"Great food, adult and family fun. Take the kids or on a date night, there's much to see and do. Activities galore and reasonable prices.",Juscreativ
50,Great Dining and Walking Area!,"I loved the fact that you could walk, rent bikes, eat at very good restaurants, catch a movie, shop, and walk along the water all within about a one mile radius. The Passport shuttle bus was free and nice to take in the evenings.",yincaro
40,of course it's beautiful - Long Beach is rich!,all that offshore oil drilling has certainly created an impressive Ocean front skyline! Don't look out at the ocean too much though - unsightly oil rigs...,topjoe
50,Good times,"Whether it be families, couples or singles, there's always something going on. Its also a good jumping off point for Disneyland and LA and even San Diego if you're coming from very far.",Corriedol
50,Warm Beautiful Charm !!,"Long Beach down town has something for everyone,sea ports, great entertainment, Food of All Kinds,clubs, shops, you can walk to most.coffee shops, Beach Areas, Fishing, Boat Rides, Bike Paths.and a ton of other events all year Long.",Ritchie H
20,bad neighborhoods,you go from one good part of town right into a bad section. it vary from street to street. I think you be careful and better close to the water. Becareful of PCH it go through real bad area,Sally C
50,A nice place to walk. Lots of really good food.,I love walking around downtown Long Beach. It's safe. Lots of police in the area. Good food places. All flat sidewalks. Even a good cigar store in the area. I think it is called Joe R's. On Broadway st.,Alan W
40,perfect for spring break,"i love the ambience that i can hardly get in my country. i strolled along the beach,but the other side u can see luxury condo,american houses etc. with breezy wind and sunset. what a perfect view to catch!",taniaiskandar
50,Shhh! Let's Keep it to Ourselves,"Long Beach, and specifically downtown Long Beach is my home and I simply love living here. Long Beach is a melting pot of cultures within the larger melting pot of LA County. We have a variety of restaurants, good transit, plenty of sunshine and wonderful people. It's a big city, so don't do stupid things and be unsafe, but enjoy a city that centers around families, friends and fun.",DinLBC
30,Great place but depends on where you are,"The touristy areas - The Aquarium, Queen Mary, Shoreline Village, Pine Avenue - the area near the waterfront are all extremely nice areas, clean, with great places to hang out: Attractions, restaurants, bars, cinema, bowling alley, comedy club, etcVenture behind that into the real downtown area..well, it's a real downtown area complete with the ghetto folks and the homeless people. There is a very strong police presence so they obviously want to keep the streets safe.If you're going as a tourist you never need to go further than the touristy places anyway and you'll have a great time.",Off2SeeItAll
50,Long Beach is a classic port town!,"Long Beach has many sights that hearken back to the earlier times of the 30's and 40's. There are dozens of excellent restaurants, some with breathtaking roof top views and swing dancing ball rooms. Close to the convention center, the Queen Mary, the Aquarium, Shoreline Village and the inimitable Pine Street, Long Beach offers something of interest to everyone.",Michael P
40,My wife worked up from E Ocean Blvd,I love the beach. I ride my bike on the bike trails. I seen plays at the Long Beach Convention Center. Been to the Aqua Center. The queen Mary is there. Boats rides on the ocean. Nice beaches. Nice shops and restaurants I patronized. Done some business there and my wife use to work near there where I hung out waiting for her to get off work.,DjEjWiz
40,amazing long beach,"4th street is a ""must go for a walk along this street"" for antique hunters and then catch a movie at an old theatre and try going to nearby seal beachs' amazing although a bit pricey touristy shops and restaurants/pubs or the long beach museum (it's free). after a hectic day, the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden is the place to go to for some ""ohmmm"" time. the carp are simply amazing to look at and you can contemplate what a great time you are having in long beach. *sigh*",Ylocanabelle
30,suggest see Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach first. Then see Long Beach if you have time.,Long beach has really gotten to be a nice place. Still have a little ways to go. But is very nice. You can go to Manhattan Beach or Hermosa Beach for a much better view and more restaurants and excitement. But Long Beach ocean front is catching up. I suggest see Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach first. Then see Long Beach if you have time.,Mike D
20,Kinda Sketchy,Long Beach is a mixed bag of nuts! There are great places to eat and lots to see but you have to navigate all the homeless to get there.,LiliyG
30,Great renovation,"The city did a good job renovating this area, new stores also.",HumbertoM
40,A Real City!,"As an ex-pat San Franciscan I really enjoy Long Beach downtown. It feels pretty urban, in a good way, restaurants, shopping etc verey good.",MargeBee12
30,busy,Busy and tight one way streets in some areas. Lots of homeless (sad). Denny's downtown is ok.,Electrichic
30,Why am I here?,"Unless you are here for a convention and can enjoy one of the overpriced downtown restaurants, there isn't much else to see. We stay away because of the overpriced parking which is practically in a different zip codes from the restaurants.",SweetnDandy
40,VIBRANT CITY!,Lots to see and do in an urban environment! Great restaurants and shops!,Cathy G
30,Lots to do!,"I used to live in LB and watched it grow into what it is today ... and it's still growing. Love what they've done to the downtown area. There are great places to eat, entertainment, movies, shopping, upscale dining & bars, great hotels, attractions and more. There are still some tricky-woo neighborhoods and parking can be rough but if you're staying at a nice hotel then neither of those will be an issue. If you have questions or concerns, call before you visit. You'll find that most folks are very helpful, friendly and full of information. Enjoy your visit!",Doggie_Mommy99
40,Pretty good place to just chill.,I really like Long Beach. A few times a year I head down that way to visit the Queen Mary or take the Catalina Express.Downtown Long Beach is a nice to place to just hang out. The Pike is alright for shopping or dining. I really love Shoreline Village. It has some cute shops (including a hat store that I just adore) and a perfect pier atmosphere. I would recommend taking a water taxi over the Queen Mary and checking out the ship or touring the Scorpion Russian Submarine next to her.,Lindsikins
