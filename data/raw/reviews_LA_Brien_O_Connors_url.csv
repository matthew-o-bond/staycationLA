40,Great Burgers!!!,"This place opened a few years ago and when it did we were eating there at least once a week. Their stuffed burgers are the best! And at that time their Fish and Chips were great as well! Then things started changing, not sure why. The Fish and Chips went down hill fast. They kept changing the fish out for some reason. The service had gone down. We were waiting almost an hour for dinner on a slow night and our orders were gettting messed up. The food was very greasy and we would go home with bad stomach's. But then, I believe they got a new cook. And some new waitresses and everything got better. The Fish and Chips are still blah! but now they have broiled chicken that is great!!! And the burgers have always been great. I would definitely try this place out at least for the Burgers, Chicken And BEER!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielallen1969
