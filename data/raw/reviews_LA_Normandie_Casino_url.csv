30,Tournaments Galore,"I know the Normandy is not the first place you think of when it comes to a poker room, but I would encourage you to take a look. If I could rate just the tournaments, I'd give them a 4.5 star, because they are well run, are varied enough to keep things interesting, and are an over-all comfortable experience. There are often snacks served, and the players here are listened to. The Floor is attentive and the breaks are reasonable. If the little things matter to you, as they do to me, you will be encouraged by the proximity of the restrooms, and the careful attention of the service staff.",christina_onthe_road
20,False promotions.Understaffed.,We visited after seeing a $25 coupon in a Vietnamese newspaper and a $20 sign up bonus in a poker mag.When we visited around 7pm weekday only one person was working the desk.The poor guys priority was obviously to keep the poker games full.It took him almost three hours to sign us up for players cards and process our coupons.He was busy the entire time.One of my friends was dealt a full house at pai gow which won him another $25 bet.Unforunately the dealer did not have the passes.You may have guessed who did.He was also resposable for scanning the players every hour another nice promotion if Thou can get it.The casino itself was 70's Vegas.The clientelle a mix of AfAmericans and Mexicans.Plenty of security. The Bookmakers restaurant was quite expensive compared to the Bike and Commerce who both have very inexpensive player menus.The casino offers only card games as per regulations.$10 min pai gow b/ j.,charliebigtime
