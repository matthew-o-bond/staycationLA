50,An interesting museum showing you how much Italians have contributed to American. Well worth a visit..,"The reviews said this Museum is small - and it is, but I spent 3 easy hours there as the big screens showed such interesting information about the Italian people, events, inventions and contributions that the Italians have made in America.A must see and not just for Italians. Take your time and enjoy the ambiance in this lovely old building in downtown L.A. Well worth a visit and nice to leave a donation to help the Museum grow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyNo1Place
40,Small but growing. Very interesting.,"This museum doesn't have a lot of exhibits because much of it is accessed from touch screen monitors. Is of our visit, it had only been open 2 weeks. But it is worth a visit. Located around the corner from Olvera Street, it is located in a historic building in what was once Little Italy.An interesting fact from the museum: Italians in the states were interned during WW2 including the famed opera singer Ezio Pinza and Joe DiMagio's father.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mish_the_Fish
