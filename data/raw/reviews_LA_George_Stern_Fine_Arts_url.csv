40,George Stern on Melrose is an interesting gallery,Both George and his brother have galleries in Los Angeles. I like George's because he deals in California Plein Air which I happen to enjoy very much. The gallery is usually open but they do have show openings which are fun. George is well respected around town and a nice person.,love2skiLosAngeles
