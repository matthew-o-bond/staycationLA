50,What a beautiful location and fun activity.,"Saw this adventure on Groupon and opted for the 2-hour ride with long-time friends. All 4 of us are novice riders and the 1 hour ride would probably have been plenty. But we totally enjoyed the leisurely pace taken by our guide Donna. She gave us a good briefing before saddling up and the area is beautiful with huge oak trees. The terrain is diverse with plenty of ups and downs. The horses appear well taken care of and for the most part, behaved well. They are intelligent animals and know when they can take advantage of you. Although it is a multi-use area, we only saw 2 bicycle riders and 3 hikers. We had the place pretty much to ourselves and the beauty and quiet serenity did not escape us. This is definitely an outing we will do again.",Linda H
50,Trail Ride in La Verne,"Lovely ride with great trail boss! The Marshall Canyon ride was we worth the experience. Haven't rode horses for many, many years and enjoyed the pleasant ride. Nice group of people and would suggest you to enjoy the adventure! Don't forget to tip!",gkeyes2016
40,Fun Ride,"Easy to ride horses and the guide was great. Horses share the trail with mountain bikers, and our guide was constantly watchful for bikes and would shout, ""Horses!"" so that they would know to stop and either let us by, or we let them by. One horse had hoof issues and would walk super slow, but the vet wanted the horse to go out once/day. My horse was the opposite, he wanted to go fast, and needed to be held back, which was not a problem and kind of fun. The ride was up and down along the canyon, with trees shading the trail. We went on the 1 hour ride, but would like to try the 2 hour next time. The only bummer is that cell phones and cameras are not allowed, so we didn't get pictures of our ride.",DeeFry
