40,Not very crowded,We came along and noticed how calm this beach was compared to others so we just sat back and enjoyed the beach for a few hours. It was so pleasant and wonderful. California is so blessed to have so many awesome beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,Hot surfing spot in the summer if you like lefts,"From Spring to Fall this spot is known for long left peeling off the point when South swells pour into the region. Best at low tide, early morning when winds blow off shore. Takes swells 3-18 feet but watch out for the dangerous violent shore break when it gets big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
40,Beautiful beach and a left,"Nicholas is a beautiful beach, secluded and clean.There is plenty of paid parking along with the standard pay machine. If you don't wanna pay, you can hike a hundred yards or so from PCH. I think it's worth the parking fee.Lifeguard station is there although I haven't ever figured out when the lg is on duty/schedule.The beach is nice and wide with plenty of room for peace and quiet.It's clean--please keep it that way. No food, but there are porta-potties by lifeguard tower. The shore break can be kinda strong so take care when you swimIt's also known as zero's and is a way fun left--one of very few lefts in the area. Kinda localized but wait your turn, don't drop in and give a hoot and all is good in the water when you surf.Enjoy, smile and pack out your trash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle

50,The beach less traveled,There are less people on this beach than others. Has a life guard and easy access from the pay per view parking lot.The cash meters are a challenge. A nice beach to take a walk or watch the sunset. Very little activity when we visited as it was near sunset. Took our beach chairs and watched the sunset. Later two other couples walked along the shore arm in arm as the sun was coming down. It is fun to try new places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
