50,Dynasty Typewriter at the Hayworth,"Comfortable, intimate, quirky theatre - a great place to see a live performance.I went for the hilarious Workjuice Improv, put on by Thrilling Adventure Hour alumni. Loads of laughs. Check them out on the last Wednesday night of each month.Good sightlines, easy to hear the performance. Comfortable old theatre seats.Their DynaPop popcorn smelled so tempting in the lobby, and they serve soft drinks and candy, too.Their pre-show montage shows the impressive lineup of past performers. Check out their schedule and see a show - it's a fun little theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaggageConveyorBelt
50,"Small, intimate, great venue","Went here last night to see The Crossword Show- great little venue. They have coffee, popcorn, and I was extraordinary happy to see they also had La Croix. Will definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DizzyDreamer92
40,Harmontown,"The theater was small and intimate, but I actually prefer shows of this size! The content I saw was Harmontown which was a great show.I was lucky enough to meet and get a photo with one of the cast afterwards, Spencer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
30,Small theater,"The Theater: The theater is a little outdated. Very small theater but intimate. Every seat is a good seat. The deco & seats are quite old. Not very impressive especially in this entertainment city - LA.The Show: If you love Beatles songs, you will enjoy the show. Lots of hit song, perfect to sing along. There is a live band, however, only one lead singer unlike the real Beatles. In the show, he will also give you the history of Beatles. It is quite informative.The Parking: Street parking is challenging. Parking lot next door charges close to $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Haven't been in a while but love this place!,"I first went to the Hayworth to see Latinologues. Jeez, prolly 5 years ago. When you walk in the lobby I felt an immediate connection to the theater. Very intimate and cozy. The place was dated, but not to the point of distraction.I also saw Lovelace and fell in love with the theater. I so seldom make it up to that part of town anymore but just wanted to give my thoughts on the place.Anyone recommend one of the current productions?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950jenniferr950
