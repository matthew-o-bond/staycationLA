50,Views down to the sea from the high cliffs..,"On April 24 tired of being in lockdown in our home, we drove up the Southern California Coast. The temperature varied by by a few degrees, but I t was in the low 90‚Äôs F at the beach. A slight breeze was blowing. Nice to have Air Conditioning in the car and importantly, Navigation. We passed by the Seal Beach Navel Weapons Station where a very large US Navy ship was docked, but as we looked at it, we noticed two tug boats beginning to move it away from the dock and out to sea. There was Red Tide along all the beaches and Marinas we passed. An Allge that turns the sea a dark red tone. This happens maybe once a year. As we went North, the Peninsula roads became narrow and one lane of traffic in each direction. A nice drive to areas we have not been to in 40 years, yet so close by.",James Weaver
50,Ecological Preserve,The park contains ecological preserve and tide pools. Amazing rock tunnels where waves rush in and crash through. Enjoy the marine life but do not touch or take anything.,Russ Lacuata

40,How to access tidepools,We learned the hard way that some tide pools are not accessible. Here‚Äôs the easiest way to access tide pools:‚Ä¢Park in the main parking lot‚Ä¢Walk SE along the road until you reach the Cliffside trailhead (google maps says this is near 5052 Palos Verdes Dr). There is a path along the road so this isn‚Äôt unsafe.‚Ä¢Take the cliffside trail down to the beach. This trail can be steep in places and sandy. Be sure to wear the right shoes.There are MANY tide pools at the tip of Inspiration Point. Be sure to visit around low tide.,Katherine C
50,Unparalleled Beauty,You can have an enjoyable experience right here in our backyard. A small hike leads you to a wonderful cove where you can enjoy the marine life in the tide pools at low tide. Bring a picnic and either have it in the cove or on top when you return to your car.,HFRANCIS_RPV
50,A cove for all seasons,"You will find excellent parking (cost) off of PV West. The trek down is safe but a little arduous, specially on the wave back up. You will have to time your visit with low tide, specially a minus tide. The reef is very accessible at low tide. You will find numerous sea creatures. The point is also accessible but be careful of the rising tide. Also a couple of water ways are seemingly navigable but are not recommended unless your are an experienced waterman. Be sure to take your own water and snacks none are available. Leave yourself enough energy for your trek back up to the parking lot. Well worth the effort if you‚Äôre into the sea and all it‚Äôs wonders. Be sure to keep the smallest footprint.",Surfpv
50,Worth the drive & Must see!!!,"We have been coming here as one of our routine trail run. The view is fantastic, clean air and easily accessible.There‚Äôs a clean bathroom in the park, picnic tables and ample of parking.There‚Äôs only one entrance so watch to your right side when approaching and go in wear you see the name & parking rates. You will have to do a U turn and come back if you miss it.Summer time: there‚Äôs a lifeguard on duty so you can swim.",Lizen Y
30,"Nice park, good place for a walk but some of the trails were closed, the views are amazing","We went there to hike the Abalone Cove Trail but they are revitalizing the area so there were areas you could not get to. Some of the trails were closed too, which was disappointing but what areas we could get to were amazing. The views of the area are incredible and walking on the beach and rocks was awesome.",R84W
50,Beautiful area!,We went at the height of summer and it was too hot for our young kids. Definitely bring water with you in the summer! There is a pretty decent elevation change between the parking area and the ocean trails and paths. Several of the hiking and tide pool areas were closed at the time we visted due to unstable cliff sides. Not sure when or if these will reopen.,Isaac B
40,Tidepools,"It's an intermediate walk from the parking area to the shoreline, but you will be well rewarded with scenery and critters along the way. If you love, or just like, looking for the ocean's living things, this is a place to visit.",davidkoch2017
40,Enjoyable visit,"Beautiful trails for walking, although the kids especially enjoyed collecting rocks along the shoreline.",Sandy S
50,Worth the hike,"A bit of a hike to get down to the shore but well worth it if you enjoy tidal pools...I'm from the northeast where I do a fair amount of tidal pool exploring but everything is bigger, brighter and more beautiful in California!",johnpw
30,No sea life to be found in the tidal pools,"Perhaps there usually is sea life in the tidal pools but not on the day we visited and its quite a hike to get down to the rocks...and back up again! Still, we got to watch dolphin swimming just off shore so that was fun...but getting up early to make low tide was a waste!",Judi-in-touch
30,"Wonderful hike, gorgeous views","We spent about 3 hours hiking around and playing on the beach. Just gorgeous local, friendly people nice way to spend a morning.",flycatcher06

30,Pretty stroll,"We went around 2pm, so it was really hot... Beautiful scenery but I think we should have gotten there earlier to see the tide pools and to enjoy the walk in less heat. You definitely need tennis shoes as the walk is steep and very dusty!",Debbie H
40,Not an easy hike to the cove,"The trail we took was very steep...roots and rocks were in abundance. Hiked down to the cove and found that the beach consisted of rocks. Saw many families with little kids hiking down and was wondering if they knew this as they appeared to be ready to hang out on the beach...towels and coolers, etc. The view from the cliffs above were outstanding.",Linda B
40,A tough walk,"It's a small rugged trail down the cliff side that takes about 15 minutes then a walk over a bunch of 6 inch rocks to get to the sand. But take the time and go all the way to your right to see the tide pools and the living ocean life in them. Younger kids will like what is there, teenagers not so much. Worth the effort but you do need some energy to get down and up.",Jdk_mn
50,Fascinating Place to Visit,My kids always love coming here while on vacation. When your from Ohio you don't get a lot of chances to experience sea life. We usually spend around 90 minutes hiking around here. The tide pools are the greatest things to explore. Highly recommend!,Mike T
50,Best hiking trails ever!,"Tons of breathtaking views and trails! Some trails more difficult then others depending on your hiking ability. There's some easy trails up top but the more difficult ones are at the middle on the way down. Need plenty of water cause they can get tiresome. Beautiful nature and water views. Great for friends, beach area is decent but gets pretty crowded in summer. I love it here!",Marz J
50,"Great for family, and close to Terranea Resort.","A nice spot at the water to get away and relax with your best friend. Take a picnic basket and folding chair, sit back and enjoy the beautiful view and the peace and quiet that surrounds you. We have the same view from our home and see it everyday.",b0bbettea
50,Beauty of California,"Pack a lunch (or at least a bottle of water) and enjoy secure (paid) parking while hiking the bluffs and quiet beach.A mid-week morning visit and you'll have the park nearly to yourself - a rare treat in crowded Southern California. I bring all my out-of-town visitors here to show off the whales migrating just off shore and the occasional sea lion fishing in the surf. As the day warms up, more visitors arrive but everyone you meet on the trails is friendly.Paths are well marked and the cove has a rocky beach. Its a bit more challenging than strolling on sand, but its fun to scan the rocks for unusual shapes or colors. Since this is a protected area, you cannot take anything, but this keeps the area beautiful and unique.Go and enjoy. You may not want to tell anyone about this hidden gem!",Partypoodle
50,Great place to hike and explore local wildlife,"When we were visiting LA, a friend who lives in San Pedro took us here to go for a hike and to explore the local flora and fauna. Wow. If you are in the area, this is a must visit. And as a local, a must visit as well. The hiking trail is wide, although some areas seem to have recently eroded so it will take a little agility to maneuver from the hiking trails up top, down to the water and back. The area itself is rocky, not sandy although sandy in parts. The rocks are very slipper so be careful. We were there for sunset and it so romantic. Highly recommend for nature lovers. :)",jemcannu
50,Blissful and peaceful day,"Great drive in Palos Verdes. Always easy parking and never crowded. I hiked down a small driveway to get to the beach. It was very peaceful and not too many people there at low tide. The best time to find sea treasures are at low tide. I found abalone, lots of unique sea shells and sand dollars. Great sea glass finding as well. Nice place to surf or body boarding. The people are very friendly here in California as I am a native but have been away for 25 years. The beach does have life guard stands but no life guards were on duty. They do not have close bathrooms but it is a great place to get away from all the hustle and bustle from traffic and stress in life as we all experience. If you are looking for sea glass in particular, this is the place to go as I found over 50 beautiful pieces. Blue, clear, brown and emerald green. This is one of my many places I love to come.",jodymermaid
50,Peaceful,"I went out on this venture by myself and I couldn't have been happier. The hike down to the water was a breeze and it was amazing to see the view at the different heights as you descend. There was about twenty people enjoying the view, but I decided to risk falling in the water to walk on the rocks that were exposed.So many little creatures and anemones are hidden in the shallows, it's so magical to see them. So many little starfish! This is a great place to bring your kids, they'll love to look at all the cute little animals and plants.This is also a great place if you're looking to snap a few beautiful pictures, especially at sunset. Don't pass on going to this place!",Olivia B
50,Tide pools,"What a way to get up close and see star fish. Make sure you go at low tide! Take your camera as there are seals, Whales, dolphins swimming by!",marge m

50,memories of Abalone Cove Park,"I liked this place better about 20 years ago when it was popular for gays and nudists;Nowadays it's like a lonely ghost beach with no one to talk to, and the people that doarrive are sometimes scary.On the plus side, it is a scenic area, great place to take photos.",lonelyG111
50,Go Early!,"In order to enjoy the tide pools, be sure to get there by low tide. We missed it by 90 minutes and we couldn't walk out very far. But we did see lots of wildlife, and the view is amazing. It's a slightly difficult walk from the parking lot, but worth it.",Adam B
40,Local Hike to Abalone Cove,"This is a wonderful treasure and great destination for a moderate hike. You can observe all kinds of sea life in the tide pools, including starfish, urchins and anemones.",olinmom
40,Beautiful but Limited,This beach is a beautiful area that was not crowded on a summer/Saturday afternoon. The tide pools are legendary - but - unfortunately - most of them are off limits due to danger of rock fall. I would guess that the off limits area will remain in effect - for ever! - SAD! - But - the rest of the beach area is nice - and as said - it was not crowded.,Susanne L
50,Our favorite part of Rancho Palos Verdes,"While the tidal pools were closed to falling rocks, this still ranks as one of our favorite parts of our LA visit. Being from NW Florida, I had no interest in going to any of the sand beaches around LA. However, what we don't have is awesome rocks and cliffs. Every part of this park was great, looking at the water and rocks from the top, walking the trails along the cliff or sticking our feet in the Pacific on the beach at the bottom. It was a beautiful day and this was an amazing place. Another place made for pictures.",Grover R
50,Beautiful place to stop and enjoy the shoreline.,Beautiful place to stop and view the shoreline. There are many trails. It is a great place for kids to explore the tide pools..,Diana W
50,"Beautiful views, lovely hikes","Take a hike around the many trails (not too hard). There was a warning sign about rattlesnakes that ""rattled"" (excuse the pun) my 7 year old, but we did not see any. My 11 year old was excited and wanted to find a snake afterwards. When you get to the beach, it is rocky, but the beautiful. Continue walking and get to the tide pools on the rocky cliffs (wear proper shoes). One side was closed, but you can relax in the cold water (it was freezing even though the temperature was about 90 degrees). Fun day.",Edgarin1
50,Such a fun spot to visit for all ages.,"The tide pools are spectacular here. It is a fun place to take young children and older children too. So much to see and explore. The parking is limited, so plan to arrive early especially on the weekends.",lynchesmd
50,One can spend the whole day in the area,"Beautiful shorelines and many trails. People are catching Abalone in the Cove, but you have to get a license and there are limits per year. The trail is about 40 feet above the sea level.",Zhi-Shao LIU
50,Stunning....,Within one stop you can be in the tide pools and high up on the rocky cliff... And relax on a sandy beach...,Schienenbus
50,"""Sea Cave""",Hiking over rocks or down toward the ocean was very exciting and adventurous. The most memorable was the sea cave with the water flow moving very fast as it came out of the came. Tide pooling was something I had never did before and it was great. Playing on the rocks in the water and the view was exciting.,GUCCI415
50,Wonderful beach,"This is an amazing beach, different from the typical sandy beach people envision of Southern California. Natural beauty with great vistas. We will definitely return.",mnimmo123

50,Great for the whole family.,"This is a real experience for a family, especially if you have young children who will be mesmerized by what they can see and touch.",David R
40,Off the beaten path; OUTSTANDING Beauty,"This area of Southern CA - SW portion of LA County, is a hidden jewel and a good distance from downtown LA and Hollywood; a huge benefit too. The isolation and coastline/ocean beauty is well worth the effort(s) to get there. Clear views of Catalina (Island) add a good bit to the enjoyment and beauty (I repeat myself) of such a public and open part of the world. There are a couple of accessible trails from about 300 - 500'[ AMSL to access the water's edge; one in particular (Abalone Cove Shoreline Park) requires a FEE to park. Parking near the trail access adjacent to Terrenea is FREE. Visiting the shoreline during LOW Tide just adds to the beauty and benefits of the visit.",PVJOE

50,Great time with kids,"I have two kids that love to explore and are very comfortable in the ocean. They had a great time exploring and finding new things. The kids found several star fish, as well as many new creatures to us. (We mainly do Atlantic side. ) Bring very sturdy water shoes, if you don't have them and you explore your feet will get cut up. This was our most enjoyable experience during our visit.",Brady123456
50,Picturesque,"This is a family favorite. It's an awesome beautiful retreat. I don't have to drive to Malibu! I love the picturesque cliffs! The hike down to the tide pools is easy and great. There's always something to see. On my last visit, I went on a 2 hour trail walk with a friend. We walked over rocks, the sandy shore, up and down steep trails. It's better than being at a gym.",Angie M

50,Beautiful place!,"There is about a 10 minute hike down to the water.... but well worth it. Plenty of hermit crabs and other sea life that would be difficult to miss. All kinds of tiny crabs were everywhere! Also, a nice and clean, small, sandy beach that the kids can play on. And there is a shower near the lifeguard tower to rinse off. Parking is only $5 for the entire day.",Tiffany M

40,Great little place to stop,"I loved this place for so many reasons. It's beautiful everywhere you look, there are all kinds of places to explore and there is a life guard and shower on one end which made it easy to let our kids splash in the surf with confidence. Lots of fun, sun and some science and exploring too. One thing to note is there is a climb down to the beach area which might be hard with small children, it feels longer and steeper going down than it was going back up to be honest, but if you can manage it, it's well worth it!",Kelly Y
50,Nice mid-week hike,"Loved my hike today. We round our way around the boulders and saw lots of fossils and different strata on the way down. The steep incline gave your calves a good workout. Happy I listened to the reviews about wearing sturdy tennis shoes. Lots of loose gravel and rocky inclines on way to the tide pools. Make sure you read the tide tables we did and enjoyed a view of sea stars, sea slugs, anenomes, red and purple urchins, tiny little albalone, hermit crabs, whale spouts out in the distance and beautiful blue green water. The only concern I might of had would be be really really careful with small children the paths are steep and the loose sand one can easily lose their footing... But there were two buses of children behind us and although I was sure i'd be catching one of the kids on the path below the kids all made their way down nicely. :).. Great park volunteers.. :)..",janetatevet
50,What a gem!!,"We stopped while driving by and what a treat! We weren't prepared to get in the water but did walk the trail down towards the water which is easy to walk but sandy. You can do it cautiously in flipflops.Plenty of parking ($5) and clean bathrooms.Fantastic views, and we're looking forward to coming back and exploring the coves!! Go across the street to the Wayfarer Chapel. It's amazing!!",seaLoves
50,GORGEOUS and worth the trip!,"Now, when i was first planning my trip to LA I didn't include places like this. Sure Venice Beach was on the list, but this is WAYYYY better. We accidently parked in the archery range but they kindly asked us not to next time. So, go to the 5 dollar parking. the beach is rocky and you need to be fit. Not marathon fit, but able to climb down and up, like many flights of stairs on sandy ground. if you have bad knees think long and hard about how bad they really are.That said, this place is lovely. There were only a few other people there. We saw an octopus, and many many many urchins and anemones. Lots of other critters. If you fish there is a little sea cave that is deep and probably a great place to drop a line. We did see a dead seal which was sad but that also means there may be seals around.Bring a camera and sunscreen and a bottle of water and your relaxation game.",Lori B
50,Spectacular Views,"I stopped to checkout Abalone Cove on a whim. I really wanted to checkout the tide pools but had no idea what to expect. I didn't do my research!Here is some info:-Parking is $5-Short hike is required to access the tide pools and shoreI didn't make it to the tide pools this trip, but I did make the hike down to the water. The hike down was pretty easy, but sandy. There were some steep lose areas but very manageable. Once you get to the bottom of the cliff area there is nice beach with smooth rocks and sand. Further south are the tide pools. I opted for the beach area. It was so quite and peaceful. I felt like I was someplace else.Near the parking area there is a nice walking path and a few picnic areas. The views are spectacular.",ExperienceMy31
50,SPECTACULAR tidal pooling and views,"GET the tide table! GO at low tide with appropriate footwear (it's worth investing in a cheap pair of fisherman's boots) and explore the tidal zone. On this visit, I saw purple urchin, a purple sea hare, electric blue anemone, chitons, hermit crabs, other crabs, assorted fish, and much more.",MontereyFoodie
40,low tide adventure,what a place to go make sure you wear sturdy shoes there is a little hike down from the parking lot to the beach but then there are two areas for tide pool viewing one small area close by and one larger area about a quarter mile to the point both have plenty of critters for viewing remember only use a two finger touch this is a eco reserve,Rick. S
40,Scenic Trails and Bluff,"Abalone Cove is a good place to go explore without worrying about getting lost. it's a short decline hike to the beach area. There are other hiking trails that lead to the cliff above the ""cave""The payoff of getting down to this part of the shore is worth every moment. The rocks, the sea life, the breeze and the serenity. Wear water shoes if you have them. It's better than getting your shoes wet and do not wear slippers. Some areas are pretty rocky and you can easily slip and fall.Make sure you go at LOW tide, or when the tide is at least halfway on its way out.It's gorgeous and well worth the hike.",orcaandbeluga
40,Beautiful vistas,So nice to walk here....gorgeous views. Try to time it when the carpark is not full of tourist buses!,EllaToronto
50,Great fot kids,when the tide is down is great for kids in scout outings or family outings. take sturdy shoes or extra pair of shoes to walk on the rocky shoreline,ZXY
40,Beautiful location but not a swimming place,"The Palos Verdes Peninsula has some of the most beautiful sea viewing locations in the South bay. Keep your eyes open on the trail going down to the shore. The shore is rocky. Not a place for a picnic or small kids. Also, Not a place to go swimming- very rough. You can ""get away"" there and enjoy the view though.",Californiafamilypv
20,Not worth a trip,"Very frustrating visit. The beach is beautiful because it is different from other beaches, but you'll have a greater experience just looking at pictures.It is almost impossible to see the ""cove"" and the hiking trails are poorly signalized.My advice? Don't waste your time.",CarolPrado

50,Wonderful place to visit,LIving in the area it's one of my favorite places to visit. The scenery is so beautiful and enjoyable.,ingy11
20,This place isn't for everyone,"The problem with reviews is sometimes you get the wrong idea.My family and I read the reviews and thought this place was going to be heaven on earth. We found the place (oddly enough GPS was a little off) We talk to the parking lot attendant who says this is a great place to get photos of tide pools and easy to get to.I am a big guy, walking isn't really a problem but walking to this place, I took my life in my own hands. You walk out of the parking lot and perhaps 100 yards later you get to the trail leading down to the beach. Shortly after walking down the path you realize this isn't a trail but a goat path, very narrow and very step. In fact if people are coming up you need to step into the bushes to allow them to pass.Going down this very steep incline was not fun, mostly loaded with 40# of camera gear. We get to the beach and it is a rock beach (thousands of river rocks line the beach) Well you have to walk along these for a few hundred yards till the next part to get to the tide pools.This was tough on me as well as my family. I twisted my knee and ankle making it even more difficult.Along the beach were families with kids. One group of kids were inspecting a dead seal or sea lion that was getting tossed around by the waves lapping at shore.. Good parenting.. let your kids play with dead things... Good thing the lifeguard was watching... I do mean watching not really doing anything.I make it to the area where the parking lot attendant told me I could find tide pools.. apparently what he meant was I had to go into the water and climb some rocks and since it was high tide (not knowing this as I am from a land locked state) I wasn't going to see anything. I didn't want to risk my camera gear so my wife offered to check it out. She said all she could see was a pool of water with some people drinking beers and hanging out in it.. Not the type of tide pools I wanted to take photos of.While walking back we asked a lifeguard if there was an easier path.. He grunted and my wife asked him if he would drive me to my car as I am injured. He agreed even though I didn't want to... So he drove me to the top of the hill, I had to walk about 1/3 of a mile back to my car. My wife and kid had a cross country adventure of their own going over narrow walkways and up steep areas. ... Not a fun day not a place we plan on going back too",LVgabeg
40,Worth a visit,"For the price of parking a car, you can search tide pools and get some amazing views of the coastline.",Francesca B
50,Sacred Cove. You rock!,"Yeah...amazing rocks, and aquariums! Natural aquariums! Do you like sea life? Colorful things? Tiny things? Colorful tiny sea life? Rocks of all weird shapes, patterns, colors? If you say yes to those, this is your type of beach. Don't come if you are looking for sandy beach with pretty girls in bikinis.The trail is steep at some parts. The most straightforward way to get there from Abalone Cove parking lot is walking along Palo Verde street all the way to Sacred Cove and go down a steep trail with a big pipeline. This cove is a half moon shape cove between Portugese Pointe and Inspiration Pointe. Do NOT go from any of those pointes and jump down the cliff to swim over to Sacred Cove. The strong current could throw you into the caves/rocks and traps you there. Those areas are called ""washing machine"" for a reason. Not a good reason, by the way. There's a sandy part between Inspiration Pointe and Portugese Pointe. Go to either the right or left of the sand to see tide pools. Make sure to check low tide before you go. The tide pools are more colorful when it's sunny. Take your time. Sit down at a random tide pool. Or better yet...lay down next to a pool...look carefully for a long time...you will be fascinated at what you see. If you don't want to look at tiny things, there are bigger things for you to look at too: seals and pelicans. And rocks. I saw the most interesting family of rocks there. Some look like cookies, some like eggs, some look like bacon, some like layer cake. Oh yeah I was hungry when I looked at them. Anyway...just look down. And be amazed. Like me :)One tip: Don't go to Abalone Cove if you don't like flies. (Huh...like anyone could like flies!)",NoReturnNope

50,Wild and Beautiful,"One gets a sense of the wildness, potential danger, and incredible beauty of the Pacific and the wildlife at Abalone Cove. Be prepared to wear good walking shoes or shoes with good treads. If you are sure footed, wear shorts. If not, wear long pants. The rocks can be rough and slippery. But the views and potential of seeing shoreline wildlife are worth the walking about and climbing. Great place for kids.",Bgoodtoall
40,"Good, at least as every ecological reserve must be","Another good spot in Palos Verdes - with the advantage of an accessible beach - but not as good as the Point Vicente. The paid parking is a negative aspect, but the views are just as good, but I guess that, because of the beach, this place is a bit more crowded than Point Vicente. The picnic area is not as pleasant or nice as Point Vicente's, so I guess the beach is the only point of visiting this park.Though not spetacular, this place definitely deserves your visit.",pvdesign

More fun than many, many island beaches!!Customize your hike according to group, skill and fitness level. We push to the top for maximum work out and let me tell you... We are winded!!Take it to the ocean for a swim in virtually calm waters. Tide pools for the curious hiker... Starfish, crabs, all kinds of natural wonders to admire and respect!!Something for everyone here at the park.Kids 4 and up... Really great for the curious active children. Hikes may put little ones in a kid pack.Pointers: wear sturdy shoes. Walk left from the parking lot (when facing the ocean) Follow the trail. The trail is a decline and at times steep but not dangerous. For those that cant handle the hike down... tables and picnic area has a great view too!!Be adventurous.Limited shade. Bring an umbrella for little ones or plenty of sunscreen. If you go right at the bottom of the first incline... That's the easy route to the beach. Go straight for ADVETCHA!! Follow the trails that call to you. We didn't get lost!Says no dogs but I have never seen dogs on leashes be bothered. Keep in mind the rocky terrain and heat.Seriously. A very well spent day!!

40,Fun way to spend an afternoon,"I went here with my family during low tide, and it was so much fun! There was great wildlife, and we saw so many sea stars, urchins, and all sorts of creatures. It was really beautiful",TrustmeIknow11
50,Wonderful tidepools,"A somewhat challenging hike down to the tidepools, but so many animals and gorgeous scenery. You must go at low-tide!",BabaDi
40,Nice place for sealife,"If you are lucky enough to find a parking place, take the ten minute walk down to the cove and explore the marine life and the tidepools. There are majestic views of the Pacific Ocean on clear days. Be prepared for cool weather. Even in the summer time, it rarely gets above 70 degrees. Good for a family picnic and hike.",Chris S
50,Great Hike,The Parks & recreation of Rancho Palos Verdes takes pride in the maintenance & tour aspect of this area. . Truly a remarkable experience!,Maria G
50,Lots of nature,"We love going here when it is low tide. Lots of interesting rock ledges, etc. & a good view of Catalina Is. on a clear day. You can walk on the beach or hike the tails on cliffs looking down at Abalone Cove. This is the place in the TV Series that they shout some of the scenes at the very end of part one (Pearl Harbor) !!",RANCHET
50,I Love this place!!!,"A beautiful location, make sure to go at low tide to see ocean critters.Wear comfy shoes for the semi-steep hike down a dirt trail. Its not far, but a challenge for kids 5 and under. Bring $ to park in lot (less than 10).",lorigramster
50,Amazing,"First, you want to get a map from the staff member that you pay your parking fee to.We started at the tidepools below Portuguese Point but my kids wanted to explore more, so we hiked Portuguese Point (a not so easy 30/45 min. hike especially with a 6 and 8 yr old) and ended up at Sacreds Cove near Inspiration Point. The tidepools were amazing... Lots of crabs, sea anemones, sea urchins and even some star fish.On our way back we found that you can just walk along Palos Verdes Drive from the parking lot and take the Sacred Cliffview Trail (I think that was the name- its a narrow path).Oh and being a mom I must warn you the water seems to be quite deep right off these tidepools so I would not recommend this area for small children that sometimes run off (2 and 3 year olds).",Sweet_Pisces
50,Peaceful,Nice and quiet area. Great drive along coast via San Pedro or Torrance.,HB_CA_Native
50,"Great place for a hike, beach walk, and a picnic","We stumbled upon this park as we were heading out of LA on our way down to Newport Beach. After eating Randy's donuts were thought we would walk some calories off. This park was $5 and was worth it. Walked the beach, the pebble rock, and hiked up the cliff for some great views. There are picnic tables where you could picnic.If ever in the area again, we would definately hit this park again!",BuddysArmy
40,Abalone Cove climb,"This was a public park that could have been better maintained. I went only 2/3rds of the way down to the water for fear I could not climb the hills back up! But my son went all the way down and loved the cove and the shells, etc.",Pam N
40,Great for hiking and view of the ocean,Nice place to go for a relaxing hike when the pool is not open. Wonderful views and an occational body surfer to watch adds to the fun.,LeVoyageur4
40,A nice place,A nice place to visit especially if your staying at the Terrenea resort,travelshooter71
50,Fun for families,Bundle up wear your rain boots and discover nature. We found an Octopus and last visit a starfish eating a huge fish. Always something to see and do...A good work out walking on the rocks and up the hills on the way back. The fresh sea air and sun is very relaxing.,teacupmama
50,beautiful beach and cliff,"state park, walk down to rocky beach and up to ecological preserve with incredible views of coastline as well as dolphins and whales cavorting.",bbcsilverlake
50,A SoCal Hidden Goodie!,"The Abalone Cove tide pools offer one of the best places to view mini marine life. Everything from starfish, hermit crabs, and sea slugs can be found here. Parking costs around $5, but it's well worth it! Visitors should be aware of the long hike down to the actual tide pools from the dirt parking lot. It took us about 20+ minutes to hike down due to the loose rocks and gravel along the path. Once you get to the beach and navigate about 5 minutes through crumbled stone, the beach sand is a godsend.We were there around 3PM on a weekend and there were no more than 40 people around. Most of them were families and students (taking notes on the abundant marine life). The tide pools are quite calm, but navigating on the slippery rocks requires calculated steps as it's quite easy to dunk your shoes in water. Not fun! There is so much to see and observe in the water. I was surprised to come across hundreds of hermit crabs scurrying along the rocks. It's quite easy to spend a few hours here.The hike back was pretty brutal. Walking down the hill to the beach was quite painless, walking back up it was another story. Pace yourself. It can be a good workout. Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes and bring a camera!",HYPERSHARK
50,Biased Review,"We live on Abalone Cove, so I'm biased in my love of the place. Great local tide pools. The beach is a strenuous hike back uphill for those not in good shape. Rocky except for occasional low tide. Good for a short day hike.",Alyson D
40,Absolutely Fabulous,"We went to Abalone Cove the end of September, I had read the reviews and thought this would be a great spot for a relatively easy hike. I found the trail was well marked and easy to walk. The views of the ocean are spectacular. We didn't see too much in the way of tidal pool activity..but you have to go during low tide. The tide was coming in when we went, the waves were quite large and we did get a bit wet. would recommend that you find out when low tide is and try to go then. The parking lot was closed and we parked at a roundabout just up the street from the gates.There is an information area where you can get some maps of the park. would also recommend going to Wayfarer chapel- which is across the street. Don't forget the camera for some great pics",superjoe749
50,My favorite nature park in the Los Angeles South Bay area,"If you're into sight seeing and nature treks, Abalone Cove is for you. December-March is the best time to visit this place for tidepooling though it's open all year round.Abalone Cove is actually composed of two coves w/ three separate tidepool areas so there is a ton to explore even if all you're doing is going to check out the tidepools. My boyfriend and I were there from high to low tide (apx. 12pm - 5pm)--it's pretty amazing how quickly the water levels change and expose all kinds of stuff in the process. It's maybe a steep 5 mile hike (2 of which is over large uneven rocks and stones--hiking boots would help here) to the farthest tidepool from the nearest parking lot. We followed a family through a ""Do not enter. Don't even think about it"" sign to a path to lead to the 2nd cove. Yes, that's actually what it read. If a family w/ a little 5 year old girl could hack it, why couldn't we? The path turned out to be a scenic shortcut to the other side. A decent pair of tennis shoes will get you to the bottom in one piece. I had hiking boots so I pretty much flew down the cliff. There is almost a somewhere easier path to take down to the bottom albeit not very scenic.Your standard fare creepy crawlies at the ocean were all there in the tidepools. Starfish, sea anenome, sea slugs, hermit crabs, little fishies. Every inch of the tidepool was filled with color and crawling with life. You could almost hear them all breathing in any quiet spot. Bubbly noises like soda fizzing out, echoes quietly throughout the pools, if you listen hard enough. I image it's not hard to do since this place was almost devoid of people. A perfectly warm sunny day on a beach and no one in site? God bless! I love a secluded beach. I'm guessing there aren't too many people since it's not too easily accessible from the main road.Besides all the fun ocean things to touch and poke and prod was the great view. There's the view from above when you're hiking down to the bottom and the rocks and gravel that seem to swim endlessly into the ocean. All covered in lovely green moss.There are all kinds of interesting rock formations along the beach. If I were a geology geek, I'd probably have a field day here. There's another trail where you just walk in between two gigantic slab of rock and there are several different layers of--sediment? I dunno. Rock stuff--maybe I'll check it out next time.We also checked out three different sea caves located in the center of each tidepool area. They were tiny but noisy. The water crashes against it and create a kind of ""blow hole"" affect on the surrounding rocks w/ big enough crevices in them (click the 3rd picture below). It's refreshing by the caves, there's a cool mist and it's almost instantly 5 degrees cooler in the shade than in the sun. It was a relief from the sun that was occasionally beating down on us (yes, that's a February in Southern California).I'd still recommend this place for families as long as the kids are relatively good at following directions since the climb down to the bottom can be a bit steep.",mstinawu
