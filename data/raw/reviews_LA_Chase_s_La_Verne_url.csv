40,Dinner with the Family,The food was outstanding and we understand why it was a bit on the pricey side.It is a good place for adults and special occasions. The interior has high ceilings and so the noise level is quite high-suggest reservations for upstairs or toward the back outside wall if you want to have a normal conversation.The steaks are large and you can easily share a meal. Don’t forget to order a side of truffle fries as they are amazing.,Serendipity5333
40,Good foods nice atmosphere,We like restaurants where we can sit outside. The service is very good. Food is good. We go about once a month.,Marleysmom2
20,Too Overpriced,"The times that I have go there the food and drinks are way over price and there was not enough room. Now with the new place, they have over extended them selves and the money they put into it they are going to have to pass it on to the customers. Not a place to go !!!",tonygR4168NK
50,Outstanding customer service!!,Went to Chase’s last week to grab a quick bite with my daughter at lunchtime. We were feeling sad as my youngest son had gone back out of state to where he goes to collage and we were trying to cheer ourselves up.It worked!!!The server who helped us was over and beyond helpful!! Like she sensed we needed cheering up!She explained to us that it was only the second day since they had moved the restaurant to this new location that they were open at lunchtime. That was a surprise to us !! We thoroughly enjoyed the food and drinks we ordered and especially the service!!Thanks again Chase’s restaurant for such a lovely afternoon spent on the patio !!!,Beachlover391
50,No matter what you order you will LOVE it!,You will not only enjoy the food but the atmosphere & customer service is GREAT! We have been there as a family with kids under 18 and have had zero issues. They can also cater to your dietary needs there as well.,1babyangelkiss
50,Rib eye is my favorite,Special wood BBQ outside to grill the rib-eye. Wife and I get the large steak and split it. Mouth-watering as I write this rvw. Don't miss out.,patrick h
50,Date night,"My wife and I have a regular Friday date night. I like this place for its good choice of wines, seafood special, and always great dining experience.",AbdulMalik S
50,Friendly and helpful,"They take me to the right person to attend my need. Rebecca from the Foothill Blvd, La Verne Branch, is such a great person. They talk to you like "" you're a friend"" and it feels like I'm very welcome.. Of course the rest of the people in the branch, treat me well. Thank you.",suzette57
40,Hot off the grill,La Verne has a charming old town feel and Chase's fits right in. Started the meal with a chopped avocado appetizer served with grilled baguette toasts. The waitress (very pleasant and helpful) recommended the fish of the day - halibut. Everything is prepared on the grill outside - the fish and the asparagus accompaniment. The halibut was perfectly cooked - moist and fresh. The danger of dining al fresco - flies and sitting downwind of the grill.Overall it was a good meal and I'd recommend Chase's if you are in La Verne.,Robin L
50,A great little place!,We went here for an after dinner coffee and drinks (for the ones in our party that drink).Jennifer took very good care of us and she was awesome! I'd highly recommend this place to anyone!,Rvshap
30,"Nice location, uneven food",I have been here numerous times since they opened. Never quite sure what you will get. Nice patio if it is available.Food is an adventure. They have a little grill out back and meat can be dicey. I mean that sometimes it is great but lots of times it is not cooked to spec. I have experienced both. Sometimes one person sends their steak back and than takes a long time to be replaced (awkward).The biggest issue I ever had was an inaccurate bill. Some friends have indicated the same thing.,richarddbowen
40,Great summer restaurant,Inside is fine but the patio is perfect for warm summer nights. Food grilled outdoors (while you watch if you like). Just like a home barbeque -- in a very nice home.,mach2pt2
50,Dinner,Great place for a dinner date downtown la Verne. Chefs pork chop special and the swordfish were both excellent Features outdoor patio seating and a small indoor bar. Great wines and a wine shop next door,RickSanders
40,Worthy to stop,"This establishment is a good place to stop by after work or on the weekend. The food is good, the wine pours are poor (no pun intended), but the ambience is great.",TBSoCal71
20,"Weird stuffy atomosphere, service is blah-salad too salty","Tried their seared tuna salad. Most salt I have had in a long time.I've eaten this type of salad in many restaurants but this was by far the worst I have had. Waitress was never present so I left most of the salad on the plate, paid the bill and left and have never been back since.",Beachlover32586
