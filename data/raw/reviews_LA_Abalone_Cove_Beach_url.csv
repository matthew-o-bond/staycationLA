50,Perfect Vantage Point,Perfect vantage point for Catalina Island and whale watching. A lot of sea creatures and things to explore. The tide pools are amazing.,Russ Lacuata
50,Rocky Beach,You have to love going to a sparsely populated beach. If so you won't mind the half mile walk down from the parking lot or the half mile back up a very steep incline. At the bottom/beach you will explore lots and lots of tide pools and watch a lot of breaking surf on the rocks. It's very California and a lot of fun.,davidkoch2017
50,Beautiful,This was really beautiful!! If you want to see the tide pools be sure to go at low tide. We were lucky enough to see some seals swimming in the cove. I would recommend this drive and view.,40andtravel
50,Home,"Hidden gem and must see if you’re visiting Los Angeles. It’s 30 minute scenic drive away from the hustle and bustle. There are many shops, restaurants on the way and scenic stops for picture taking opportunities.We park at Abalone Cove recreation park and from there run 2.5 miles out and back along the side walk trail.I highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to see beauty and coastline.",Lizen Y
