50,"Magical, intuitive healer","I have visited Taly a total of 3 times. I suffer from migraines (5-7 per month) and after visiting Taly I didnâ€™t have a migraine episode for 3 straight weeks. I know if I lived in LA and could visit her consistently, I would have less episodes. Taly made all my experiences relaxing, healing and spiritual. She was sensitive to my needs and emotionally supportive, as well as provided me with tools that could help me at home. She continues to check up on me and make me feel important and worthy. I highly recommend a session (or 10!) with Taly for a true healing and spiritual massage experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shauniiee

50,Best of the best!,"Taly is a wonderful massage therapist! I always left a new person-- relaxed, rejuvenated! I never missed an opportunity to book an appointment with her whenever in LA. She is also a wonderful person and terrific artist!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMKMontreal
50,Intuitive Massage,"Although I visited Taly a couple of times in March, having recently had a dreadful massage, I knew I had to give her props and send people her way who have similar pain issues as I.Without trashing the other establishment I want to point out the ways that Taly works.1. Intuitive bodyworker.2. Goes right to your ""spot"".3. Uses essential oils, soothing music and other little tricks to give your session a high success rate.4. A kind and caring person.As I stated I went twice. Taly accommodated the most convenient times for me. In fact the first massage was on very short notice.After each massage she checked in with me to see how I was feeling. And both times much improved than when I walked in.It really doesn't get much better when one is in pain than to have someone who knows what she is doing lay hands on one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliAdvice
