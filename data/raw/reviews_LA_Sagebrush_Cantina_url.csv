40,"Something for everyone! Fun, food and fantastic atmosphere.","The Sagebrush Cantina offers Mexican food in a fantastic atmosphere. It's big with booths, a busy bar and lots of lovely outdoor seating, with built in gas heaters. The food was delicious, tacos in particular and the serves generous. The staff were super friendly and we had a great time. The only issue my partner is a celiac and no one seemed to know what was gluten free.... or even what gluten was. We were told the corn chips were GF only to be informed later that they were a blend of corn and wheat. Needless to say that partner was sick the next day. I think they could afford to mark et GF items on the menu to avoid any confusion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/48dinam
50,Taco Time,"My first time at Sagebrush Cabrina in Calabasas. Love the atmosphere, great food and great service. Today they also had a fundraiser so there was a live band which shows me there care about the community.Another #abouttowndeb pick for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AboutTownDeb

40,Amazing food and very unique atmosphere!,"The Sagebrush cantina offers a wide selection of Mexican dishes, and has an array of wonderful drinks. The guacamole was outstanding. The restaurant itself is huge, and we chose to sit outside on the patio, which was wonderful on a 72° evening. I suspect on a Saturday night this place is hopping! Here are the quiet weeknight, but still had a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21parisf
40,Nice Sunday brunch,"Three of us were here for Sunday brunch. The food was varied and everything we had was wonderful. I was especially impressed with the omelette bar, so entertaining to watch them being made to order. There is something for everyone’s taste here. The only reason I didn’t give them a 5 is that they were fairly slow with beverage refills, but it was a busy time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
50,Great Ambiance! Amazing Sunday Brunch!,"We love Sagebrush Cantina! We were first introduced to them because of their incredible Sunday Brunches! The price has unfortunately gone up quite a bit in recent years, but it is a pretty intense brunch with bottomless mimosas, crab legs, and even fruit infused vodka shots (at least the last time I was there for that)! The ambiance is great as there is actually a running model train that goes around overhead. There are large animal statues, trains and planes for the kids (and grown ups) to look at and enjoy.My most recent experience there was more like a 4, as they misplaced our ticket and we had to wait quite a while for our food... but the waitress was super nice and I've been here so many times, I'm giving them a pass this time.They have a large stage that offers live bands. The band tonight was pretty awful... SCRATCH THAT... the SINGER of the band tonight was awful! The rest of the band sounded pretty good. I actually thought they were doing live karaoke until I asked the waitress where to sign up and she said it was the band! Yikes! But that's okay.The parking is also a bit of a drag as there was a $5 ($6 if using card) valet charge. However, I'm pretty sure it's not valet on weeknights.Another thing that was much appreciated was their kids menu selections. I have been hating most kid menus lately as they've been a nutritional nightmare! But most of these (pizza aside) come with sides of fruits or veggies. My son had the ""Zen Bowl"" which was brown rice, chicken, carrots and broccoli! He love it and I felt good about it too.If you can afford it, get a big group together and go for the Sunday brunch. Or just enjoy any night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Thursday night,"Great music with karaoke with live bands.Good food, great beer .The people that was singing created good atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explore71521
50,Wonderful place to eat,"I visited the Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas , Ca. It's located off the 101 freeway near Westlake Village. Years ago I visited this restaurant and loved it's outdoor patio for eating. It has great Mexican food and for me it was like going back in time. A warm and relaxing place for a good meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gailr
50,Fun place,"The food here is excellent, and if you like beer they have a huge selection of draft beers that are excellent. As I mention in other reviews, I like a place that has atmosphere, and this place does. It also has a great outdoor seating area. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that at night the music is very loud. And although the place is big, I prefer a place that is a bit more quiet. But even at night you can sit pretty far from the band, so you can still hear the people you are with. Sunday brunches on holidays is also fantastic!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secondavenue
30,Great place to sit outside,I liked the outside seating areas for Sagebrush. The food quality was average and service was good. They have a salsa bar and brunch on Sunday. It is a good place to listen to music and parking is easy to get in and out of . Good place for families or after work with friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
40,Nice afternoon lunch,We stopped in here for a nice meal on a hot day. The restaurant was quaint and we really enjoyed lunch. I found the chips and salsa to be quite addictive. Everyone enjoyed their meal and it had a nice atmosphere for the afternoon. There was no doubt in my mind that it gets to be a fun adult place at night. If one is in the area on a pretty day it is worth a visit to just relax outside and enjoy the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BOBBYGHollywood
