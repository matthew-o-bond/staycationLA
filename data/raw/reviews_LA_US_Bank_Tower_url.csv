50,Tower of Calitastical VIEWS!,"This is worth every dime you spend. I would recommend going at sunset, but anytime of the day is awesome. Pay the extra dollars for the slide! It is short but super fun! Grab a cocktail and don't miss out on the outdoor deck! The paparazzi photo is also super fun!When you are done ...walk across the street and take a gander at the Central library!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223pammyb
