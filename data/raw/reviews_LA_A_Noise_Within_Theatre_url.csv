50,"A venue with wonderful, classic productions","I recently took my wife to see a production of Frankenstein on her birthday. What a spectacular production. The energy level was very high, costuming and stage crafting was very classic and well thought out. For those of us that dislike some of the nouveau avant-garde productions of classics, The Noise Within Theater was a delight. Very well balanced between a fully classic staging and the production goals. Superb. So. Parking was a little odd, but with plenty available ""behind"" the theater in the Metro Bus/Train Parking lot. We were able to park in front of an elevator and stairwell so we felt safe enough. We did not observe any security and only a few ""characters"" in the area. The walk from the Metro Parking was a little uphill, but negotiable for those in wheelchairs or walkers. The area around the theater was exceptionally clean and the theater itself was magnificently comfortable and very accessible. Every seat in the theater was excellent. We actually were a bit stage right and felt we had better seats than those center stage. Tickets were acquired on-line and printed at home. Now, the big secret not to overlook are their SUNDAY RUSH tickets. These were a terrific savings and the availability of some of the best seats was remarkable. I'm guessing we saved around $50 with this option. If Sundays are not a choice, don't overlook their Budget Seats on the sides. Excellent view of the stage and a good option for students. The volunteer staffing and ushers were the best. They do have a nice refreshment bar that offers soft drinks, wine, coffee, and snack items. We did observe many people with drinks inside that had cover lids on the cups that surprised us. Overall we had a fantastic experience and look forward to other trips and productions.",Daniel M
50,Classical Theater in Pasadena,"""A Noise Within"" Theater serves up classical fare in an intimate theater setting. There are no bad seats--good sight lines throughout. We saw ""Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" and greatly enjoyed the well-acted production. There is free parking right behind the theater.",RebelVirginia
50,Not a bad seat in the house,"We saw The Man of La Mancha last Saturday night and was very impressed with the cast, sound and seating of the unique theatre. I like that this is a kind of like a theatre in the round environment, with stadium style seating so that you can see over the person sitting in front of you. There is plenty of free parking in the rear lot and plenty of restaurants within walking distance.",Alan661
50,Top notch!,"Attended this theater for the first time last weekend. It was an absolute delight. The production was The Man of La Mancha. Exceptionally done! My husband and I not only entralled with the venue, but the performances were highly professional. The best part of going is that we didn't have drive to L.A or Orange County to see a quality production. We just purchased tickets to see Dorian Gray.",Gelaffey@gmail.com
50,One of my favorite theaters in LA,This is some of the best theater you'll see anywhere. They are experts at comedy and farce but also present powerful drama.,hereismeg
40,Creative and intimate performance,"I just saw A Christmas Carol here and it exceeded my expectations. It is a modern theater with a small stage and the actors often go up and down the aisles, so you are always close to the action. The quality of the sets and costumes was outstanding for such a small theater, and were very original. Marley had chains attached to the ceiling, the ghost of Christmas past entered on a swing, the ghost of Christmas present was a huge giant covered in fruit, and the ghost of Christmas future was a creepy thing on stilts. The acting was top quality. Scrooge and the narrator both had excellent theater voices. The cast was very diverse and unique, and I especially liked Tiny Tim, who was perfectly cast. It was a little scary in parts, but my six year old still loved it. My only complaint was the dialogue and the heavy accents made it difficult to understand some times. At the end, the cast greeted the audience and posed for pictures, which was pretty cool.",Brbnkseaj
50,Five Star Performance!,"What a treat to see A Christmas Carol at A Noise Within! This classic theatre offers excellent views of the stage, and totally engages the actors with the audience. The performances, lighting and sound were all outstanding. Parking is an easy walk from the gold metro line station to the theatre via a walkway. Overall, A Noise Within theatre is Highly Recommended and offers a truly magical performance. Bravo!",Robert V
50,"All seats are good so one can go ""affordable"".","This is a charming community Theatra with plenty of FREE MetroLink parking near-by. Hidden from the view of major street, the setting is intimate yet roomy. Obviously the liking of the shows depends on the actings and the attendees but it is a nice and safe venue for solo female theatra lover.",HappyGeekyWoman
50,"intimate, high quality","Totally impressed by last night's performance of A Tale of 2 Cities. Acting was superb, staging was creative, and the adaptation was imaginative with all of DIckens' central themes captured. It's a compact theatre, but with stadium seating every seat's a good one. The facilities are first rate and well-maintained. Tickets are well-priced, and made even more affordable with the occasional discount.I'll be coming back.",linda c
50,Convenient and comfortable,"We loved the play we saw here and perhaps that biased our feelings about the theatre in a positive direction. It is conveniently located right off the 210 freeway and offers free parking in a large garage very close by. The theatre itself is horseshoe-shaped and medium-sized. While we sat close to the stage but on the side, we still had a great view. Given the design, it seemed that there was not a bad seat in the house.",Lorne29
50,"An incredible experience for ""Off the wall"" performances","I have never been disappointed when I attended any production. They have a way of taking a time honored classic and re-creating it into a modern day revelation of what the author had tried to create. Passionate and explosive are the only words I can use to describe the energy of the performers. The visual effects are stunning and more than that, everything always comes together so seamlessly that you become a part of the experience rather than an observer. It's a MUST SEE attraction.",David_DeMulle
50,"fantastic performance, great theatre","We went to support one of our friends who was in a production and this is how we discovered the theater in Pasadena. Of course, we went to support but were really taken aback by how fantastic a theater and theater company this was.Easily accessible on the metro Gold Line and plenty of parking in the Gold Line structure, this community theater is easily accessible.If you are in the Pasadena area this theater provides a great opportunity to support local art, and at the same time you will enjoy a fantastic production and an enjoyable show.Well we go back? Yes.",CAZADOR
50,More than just a noise within,"This wonderful theater is not know by many yet but it should be. It's a theater in the round with perfect view from any seat. If you're a first timer going to one of the Christmas performances to get totally immersed.Good acting, dancing sets...parking is behind in the metro parking structure. There are often discounted tickets online, making it a real bargain.",DamePeg
50,Julius Caesar; an incredible trip to ancient Rome,"This Shakespearean play was done in a modern setting and very simple mostly black costumes, by a relatively small company. It's a small theatre with seats in a semicircle, and the actors are often in the aisles or in a balcony space. It was among the best productions of Shakespeare I have ever seen. The company transported us to Ancient Rome: the crowds, the demagogues and their power over the crowds, the love for Julius Caesar that Brutus turned to hate by his speech to the crowds, the incredible speech that Mark Antony gave to turn the crowds against Brutus. This production is over, but they will be doing Romeo and Juliet next season. I can't wait to see what they do with that well-know piece, already done do many times and so many ways. Whatever The Noise Within does with it will be like none other. Buy your tickets early!",sandylindy
50,Candide!,"Interesting seating arrangement put the audience right in the performance. We were able to see a limited performance which was entertaining, funny, theatrical and a nice operetta. The orchestra plays on stage as there is no orchestra pit, so it is a nice change.The story and characters were well performed; it held the interest of the audience and had a nice intermission. This was refreshing because the theater got a little warm and is located downstairs.Parking was interesting, as it was at the metro station and entry is from the rear of the building. All in all a nice evening.",Tim_the_Enchanter417
50,Love this little theater!,"I've been a season holder on and off since they were housed at Cal State LA. Great performances in an intimate space. In all, this is one of my favorite theater experiences in the LA area and my husband and I will continue to review our season tickets each year.",mouseparade
50,A theatrical gem in the San Gabriel valley,"We have loved this theatre company since their days I downtown Pasadena. Their new location is terrific. We have seen a lot of shows here and they are always of the highest, most professional and exhilarating quality.",David R
50,"Small, cozy theater","Every time I am in Pasadena I try to go and see at least a play. It is a nice, small theater with sits surrounding (almost) the stage. In spite of being relatively new, it inherits a long tradition of the theather carrying the same name which for many years was hosted in a quite disrupted building downtown. Plays are usually selected with great taste. I don't know who he is, but the art director of the theater knows very well what he is doing.",giulonragu
50,Classic plays by excellent ensemble,"The Noise Within Theater is small and intimate, and the productions are consistently first-rate. They focus on classic repertoire; we've seen at least five plays there, and each one has been excellent. There's not a bad seat in the house, so lower price tickets are fine.",Mary M
40,Classic theatre acting,Seating is stadium so all seats are good. Actors are professional and top notch. Parking in back can be confusing to new comers who look for theatre from the front on foothill blvd. but well worth seeing the plays,Rosemarie H
40,Energetic!,A very intimate theater in the round with every seat a good view. Parking is in the metro transit garage at the rear of the theater.,tjcola
20,A Strange Venue,"This a bizarre little theater, we went to see Macbeth with friends and children and had trouble finding parking ultimately discovering that it's a parking lot shared with Metro train riders and the garage was practically full. We then had to walk through an alley, past some homeless people, and in to the theater via a back door. The only way to get to the lobby, and the box office, is through the stage space it self and actors were still rehearsing! Not very professional. We also encountered a rather pungent, sewer-like smell (which disappeared then came about again during the performance) which one of the ushers had told us has been around since the theater opened.The space is attractive and the play itself was rather good with top-notch actors. We were left with the sentiment, however, that this is a little too small town dinner theater that's in need of much better management (it seems to be run by a husband and wife) - especially in a city that has much to offer, including theaters that are much closer to the center of all the action.",mrwunderfulness
40,Fun theatre,Interesting offerings.Fair pricing.All good seat in the small theatre.Fair to excellent acting play selection variable.Semi-remote parking is an issue.Recommend,packcal
50,Great Theatre!,"A Noise Within consistently puts on great classical theater. The space is beautiful, and there are really no bad seats in the house. Their subscription series are very flexible and the staff is friendly and helpful. They also offer great classes for adults and kids. There is ample FREE parking next door in the metro lot, and you can enter the theater from the back, without having to walk all the way around the building. Great place!",Mayarimom
40,"plush seating, but not enough parking spaces on site.","- love the comfortable new seats. Arranged in an arc, surrounding the main stage ensures a clear view from many angles. This totally redesigned theatre is much more pleasant the old venue in Glendale. However, the Lobby with stark white walls, hard concrete floor, and harsh lighting, feels cold and clinical - much like stepping into a mid century hospital.Parking spaces are limited on site although they have additional parking at the Metro Parking structure. We usually park on the streets a couple of blocks away to circumvent the hassle.The last play we saw there, Eurydice was a general disappointment. Great staging, great lighting but lame dialogues. The opening scene has many ""valley-girl"" cliches.The leading lady has a very shrill and piercing voice.Their inaugaral play, Shakespeare's Twelve Nights set to a Carnival in Cuba, had some bright and splashy musical scenes, but as the play developed it got way stretched out and tedious.Too many similar scenes repeated is boring. Chop-chop-chop, we got it already!Editing is crucial in good, tight, productions.We see a lot of plays - average 3 a week.We liked their more classical production when they were in Glendale.Eccentricities of a Nightingale was nicely done.",3Kells
50,Great Noise I am Now a Season Subcriber,"I love plays. I see probably 18 a year in LA area, New York and sometimes London. This regional theater is top notch. I love seeing well produced classics. The theater itself has no bad seats. It is very intimate and comfortable",Ralph H
50,"If you want great theatre, come to ANW","A Noise Within is a fabulous repertory theatre company, housed in a beautiful new theatre in Pasadena. The season is divided in two, each half comprised of three plays that are presented in rotation. A Noise Within focuses on classical theatre, so there is always a familiar title or two, including some Shakespeare, Moliere, Dickens, Wilson etc. But they go beyond and produce and perform classical theatre that is a little broader and more adventurous than many companies. The production values are superb; staging and direction are top-notch and interesting. The resident company is very good.The current production of Eurydice is mind-bending. Eurydice is part of a Greek myth; remember the story of Orpheus? Eurydice is not the center of that myth; she is Orpheus' wife. Sarah Ruhl, a contemporary American playwrite, wrote a play about Eurydice and ANW has put it on their stage. Fantastic! Can't compliment the play, the production or the company enough. ANW is also dedicated to community outreach and provides tickets for students in local schools so the next generation of theatre goers has the opportunity to see good quality live theatre.Try this theatre if you are looking for a smaller theatre, less expensive, east of the big downtown Los Angeles theatres, with wonderful shows!",Carol B
