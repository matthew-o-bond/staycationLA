50,"Best place, best value for wine, beer and spirits!",I canâ€™t tell you how good this place is - you will know when you go there. Have a tasting of anything you want. Have some wines you never thought existed and the beer - amazing!I can keep going on for days and would just say - try it and you will want to go back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikecS862YK
50,Review from a non-drinker.,"I don't drink. Never have. I have friends and associates that do so when I need to buy a gift, Wades is my go-to place. Without exception, I get great advice as to what to buy and have yet to be directed toward the most expensive bottles on the shelf. Plus, I've gotten rave reviews from the recipients for my ""good taste"" in gifts. Helpful, friendly, and for this customer, a trustworthy resource.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdlewiswlv
50,Fantastic Selection and Tasting Rooms,The selection of single malt whisky was amazing. The spirit tasting room has 1400 spirits and the friendly and fun staff has a deep knowledge of all of them. Definitely worth the trip up from my stay in Burbank. I will be back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattt385
40,Wades wines,"Great friendly people, but they did not have the wine I needed. Hard to find location. What a very large selection. Maybe a sign in agoura road would be a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dukester6
10,The Wife of the Owner is a Liar & Bad Peson. Really High Prices!!!,"We booked the middle room of the tasting room for a Birthday Party. The Wife of the owner abruptly cancelled the reservation 5 days before we had 30-35 people coming to the location for the party. She made up some terrible excuses that were complete hogwash to defend her abhorrent behavior. The prices at this place are sky high as well. You're better off going elsewhere if you value integrity and honor in those you deal with. It is too bad the owner is the way she is. If this were a well run establishment it would have some real upside. Unfortunately, Honor Counts and they have none.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyFunTimeTravel
50,New Tasting Room (Sundowner Tasting Room); Brilliant! 1400 Bottles of Spirits,"Wades Wines is my ""go to"" place for Spirits and they have opened a brand new tasting room with over 1400 bottles of spirits. It is amazing. They serve some snacks as well but it's all about the incredible selection of Scotch, Bourbon, Tequila, Gin, Vodka, etc. Best of all, you can try em and buy em.....a fabulous night out for Friends and Dates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Very hard to find but worth it,"A premium liquor retailer with a huge selection of wine, beer and spirits - you can find hard-to-locate items here - with a tasting room attached. The tasting room has I think 100+ beers on trap, and they regularly offer curated wine flights and beer flights - though these are a little pricey (for example, $18 for a flight of four different wines - you can buy a while bottle for that!). I have also seen scotch and tequila tastings in the retail section itself. They offer small bites in the tasting room but it's not that great and not worth the price. All in all, a pleasant place to shop for and taste premium wines, beers and liquors, but as its buried in the back of an industrial park, very hard to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519rong
40,Best malt whisky offerings in SoCal,"Excellent exotic beer, wine and especially malt whisky offerings in SoCal. Friendly, well informed staff, competitive prices and weekly tastings to inform and surprise. Good ambiance in the bar but inside only seating. Fun place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7537PVjohnf
50,A hidden gem!,"We have enjoyed numerous visits to Wades Wines since being able to sample such a wide variety of spirits before investing in a whole bottle is so rare. Our last visit we focused on gin. Marty (incredible knowledge of his craft!) shared Monkey 47 and Calyx and Gin Mare with us. He pointed out the differences between them and gave such an inspiring presentation that we brought all of them home. After our gin tasting we moved into the lovely tasting room for beers. Great ambience and wonderful staff. Next visit we will focus on brandy since we've already experienced bourbon, tequila and gin. Find Marty when you go--he's great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Max-TN
40,Unexpected,"Very cool tasting room with lits of choices of beer, wine and premium liquor. Good selctions of craft beers to taste with friendly knowledgeable stsff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805onthego
50,Great Selection of Wines!,Wades is a great local wine shop that has a wonderful selection of smaller production and hard to find wines. The staff is super knowledgeable and very helpful! They also have weekly wine tastings featuring good quality wines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcdreyer
20,I saw the Downside Today,"First, I will say the staff has been very helpful over the years, however their prices for wine and spirits available in other stores (Total Wine, BevMo, etc) are higher. You can purchase wines and spirits that are not readily available in most stores, especially wines from local vintners---this is their strength.However today I saw a customer drop, accidentally, a bottle of liquor and of course it broke. The customer was clearly upset but was still charged for it---despite the customer's concern, there were no comments from the staff---this is wrong. Simply saying, something about store policy requiring you to pay for broken items while extending some understanding to the customer would be fine. Shutting them off, despite the fact they still made purchases is simply not good PR.When I visit again, I will really reconsider going to Wades. BTW, the customer did pay for the damage and still purchased another bottle of the liquor",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docgeo70
30,Nice place to try new wines,It is always fun to stop into Wades. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable. I would recommend better food to accompany the wine tastings. The cheese tray is boring. It would be nice to have a chefs dinner sometime. Try new wine and new foods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coopersmom2007
50,Wines of the day,Go and see Don at Wades wines he is very wine savvy and can point you in the right direction whatever your budget is. A great variety of wines are available here for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T6062NVbrians

50,Floor to Ceiling Wines and Spirits,"Wades Wines offers one of the most extensive collections of fine wines in the Westlake Village area.

I always get an education when I enter Wades doors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3563JVpaulk

40,"Great selection, outstanding expertise","We are not big consumers of wine but I have to say how wonderful it is to have real experts so closeby. Their selection is not to be matched and so are the experts. When we need something really nice, this is the place to go. Prices are fair too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseSlome
50,wine tasting fun,Wine tasting at Wades is a terrific way to spend a few hours on a Friday evening. The setting is funky fun and the wine is great. We found some very nice wines and came home with bottles to enjoy.Wades also has a fabulous selection of whiskey and scotch and experts to help.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KallyF
40,"Fun little place with very knowledgeable, approachable staff","We met some friends there last Friday early evening for a wine and beer tasting. We'd seen the sign from the freeway, and it looks so unimpressive, it's totally impossible to know that what lies inside is a great wine/beer/liquor store with a good-sized sit-down area. The guys had a couple of the draft beers and enjoyed them very much, the girls decided to try the $18 taster / mini-flight of the french wines that were on the specials board. They also offer snack food... kind of ... I ordered a cheese platter - such a shame that it was served up in a plastic tray! Since the drinking ware was glass, it couldn't have been the ""Health & Safety Gnome"". However, don't let the plastic trays put you off: the cheese was nice and the overall experience was great for a Friday evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
50,Liquor store with tasting room,"Nice place to bring a date actually, assuming they drink beer or wine. Limited food options. They usually have an interesting selection of beers and wine tastings. The store has nice value and pricier options. Knowledge staff. Marty is to whisky like Yoda is to the Force.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hitcher84
50,What a great find!,"Tucked away in an industrial center, this place is awesome. Not readily visible from the street as their front door actually faces the freeway. Literally thousands of wines to choose from. They also have a wide selection spirits and dozens of beers. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They have a wine tasting area that we have gone to with friends and had a great time. There are limited hours for the wine tasting area so be sure to check their schedule before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7473PKmichaelg
50,Great Place to enjoy wine and/or beer,"Who knew this place had 125+ beers on tap; in addition to one of the largest selections of wines, beers, and spirits around??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blytheanderic
50,Great selection and customer assistance....,Wades Wines not only offers a great selection but their knowledgeable staff is always there to help assist with your selections.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottf532
50,Master Marty Spirit Guide,Wonderful selection of wine and spirits. You will only find good to great quality selections - this is a place for people with discerning tastes; reasonable value; and great advice through Marty's encyclopedic knowledge of spirits and distilleries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247lillys
40,Their vast beer and wine knowledge makes Wade's feel kind of like school...(with beer and wine),"A huge selection of beer and wines combined with the amazing knowledge of the staff makes this a great place to learn, and more importantly, drink! Also, a wander over into the spirits area will give you an equal education on all things vodka, whiskey, rye or any other alcohol. A fun visit, unless you're Mormon I guess :).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Used2Surf
50,A must visit when in The area,"What a super place to go, unbelievable selection of wine, beer and other items, with the most friendly and knowledgeable service staff, a must visit when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17jimn
50,"Such a wonderful place to sample good bourbons, beers and wines.",We fell in love with the knowledgeable staff as we strolled through the aisles filled with a wonderful and vast inventory of spirits. There is a beautifully decorated tasting area with a large list of options to try out before committing to buying or just drinking a full sized one. We went twice since we couldn't not taste it all in one session!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Max-TN
40,An impressive selection and helpful staff.,"Wades has a huge selection of wine, beer and liquor. The people who work there are very knowledgeable about their products and excellent at making recommendations based on your preferences or budget. Certain staff members specialize in specific products, so don't hesitate to ask for help. They also have a section for beer and wine tasting where you can sit and order wine or beer flights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bstorm
40,Best Selection of Wines Around,"We started going to Wades in 2006 when we first moved to California. Some friends mentioned that they had a great selection of wines, and they were not wrong. They have wine and beer tasting, and it can get very crowded. That is one complaint I have, as it can get too busy. When we first starting going to the wine and beer tasting, it was more casual. Now, you have to wait to be seated, and it can get very busy. Having said that, we enjoy it and usually come early to pick out some wines to purchase before we go in for the tasting. I love their selection of Pinot Noir, and Wade's carries a wonderful selection of local Pinots that I love and have had the opportunity to visit the wineries. If you love wine, you should visit Wade's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caukwiphyllis
40,Impressive!,"A great spot tucked away in the most unsuspecting place, quiet industrial area. Great selection of liquor with knowledgable experts to help you in your search for the perfect spirit! A wonderful surprise is the bar with MANY tasty beers on tap. DO NOT OVERLOOK this place. You will not be disappointed. Hours are limited (Thurs-Sun for tasting room I believe).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TruthfulTraveling
30,"Wide Selection, but Not the Cheapest in Town","We went to look at different bourbons that they were selling and had heard that would do tastings. We were directed to the resident expert and had several questions. Before we got to taste anything he asked if we were going to buy a bottle. He would not let us sample without a purchase. Then it was like pulling teeth to get information out of him about the different types. I was hoping for so much more!The wine variety was impressive, but most of the bottles that I knew could be purchased elsewhere at a cheaper price. We also did the wine and beer tasting. The guy that sat our group was rude to us when we made a simple suggestion. Not sure I would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qbert33
40,"Nice Selection, Pricier than Total Wine, Has Some Values","This store is located in a warehouse area, a bit hard to find. Lots of wines, stored at good temperature. Most wines are priced ok, but definitely higher than Total Wine which offers a larger selection. The staff here is very good. If asked, they will put a Wades sticker on your bottle and provide you a list of local restaurants that will NOT charge you corkage if you bring a Wades Wines stickered bottle. If that practice continues, then the slightly higher cost of the wine is well worth it. Again, wines are stored continuously at cool temperature. Weekly tastings can be fun here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam
