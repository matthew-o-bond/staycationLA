50,Here on a work visit,"I was here to meet a peer in my field of work and while on the campus, I had the opportunity to appreciate the surrounding, it's buildings, services, dorms and artworks of some of their students on display. On the displayed artwork, I can only say they are excellent and the campus should be proud of such high standards and work pieces produced by the students. The environment and school are also nice and there is a sense of calm and serenity everywhere. Staff / Employee culture is great and the work climate is infectious.

40,You Drive By OTIS en route to LAX ...,Otis College is right on Lincoln and you drive past it as you're hurrying to LAX for a flight - so stop in on the way back.
