50,Great bar,Loved the place. There is a good friendly atmosphere. Went to watch a Celtic game while in L.A and all the members of the supporters club are so friendly. The staff in the bar are all nice people also. Very welcoming. I will definitely be back next time in L.A,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finn1001
40,Good Food at a Lively Pub,"We visited Joxer Daly's on a Friday afternoon around 3:30. They have a great selection of beers on tap (and bottles) and sporting events to watch on the big screen monitors. The food and the service were both very good. The bartender was very busy and still took the time to check on our table. She was very outgoing and personable. The only down side would be parking (street parking only). Also, the website menu prices are not current - the prices have gone up. Maybe we were too early for happy hour. I would say the prices are average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11JerryB
