50,GREAT FOOD AWESOME SHOPPING,I come regularly to buy merchandise direct for my store. Look forward to lunch at all the great places in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielbR3588MP
40,be prepared to do alot of walking,"I love exploring the fashion district. I find it's easier to take metrorail to Union Station and then Uber or lyft to Santee Alley. Wear comfortable shoes (Preferably closed toes, as there tends to be alot of puddles of water from street cleaning)and clothes that are either easy to take on and off or like me leggings and a tank top, for me it's easier to try clothes on OVER mine, as dressing rooms are not always that private. Start early and be prepared to spend all day as there is so much to explore. Mid week will find more stores open and less crowds than on weekends or mondays (alot of places seem to be closed on Sundays and/or Mondays) beware of the guys walking around claiming to have designer bags, it's all not only knock offs but the absolute worst quality junk. The shoe shops are the greatest and my most favorite thing about going to the district",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastfixitmom
10,Not what we expected,"We knew this was an area that had a lot of whole sale shops but we did not find any shops that were open to the public, also it felt a bit like a massive market stall.Not worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115darenp

30,"Everything you need, plus tons of stuff you don't...","I've lived in California my entire life, shopping in downtown is a staple, especially if you grew up in the Los Angeles area. The Fashion District is hit or miss and more often than not, you'll find a TON of knock-offs. Fashion District has it ALL, fabric, ribbon, thread, clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. Here are some tips if you've never been:1. Always care cash - haggling is expected, cash allows you to purchase tax free and more often than not, you can negotiate better prices when you have cash2. Don't carry a purse - the area is VERY crowded and the crowd is a mix of locals, tourists and unfortunately, people trying to steal from you, so carry a coin purse with cash or an over the shoulder satchel or as cheesy as it sounds, a fanny pack.3. Park at the structure on Maple and Santee above the McDonald's. it's the cleanest and safest and it's close to everything4. Dress comfortably and wear walking shoes5. During inclement weather, take an umbrella, a lot of the stores are out in the open or on the sidewalks6. Do NOT listen to the guys on the sidewalk who are offering you name brand purses, obviously they're knock-offs, some of them are VERY believable, some are BEYOND obvious fakes, either way, it's illegal to purchase them7. Try the food at your own risk, if you have an iron stomach, you'll be fine, otherwise, steer clear8. Don't buy anything until you've looked around a few shops, chances are, you'll see the same item, more often than not for much less",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/work2travel05
30,Different,"There are a lot of shops with anything you could ever want. There is Santee ally, which has so many different types of stores. Great place for cheap clothing and electronics and luggage. You can haggle if you want a better price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshkj
40,Shopping spree galore!,"The stores were interesting, most of the stores have the same items but depending on the store you go to, they may be cheaper, so make sure you have a look around before making a purchase. Theres a lot of alleys and streets to explore, it’s like a maze so keep track of where you parked and how to get back. I’d also recommend keeping a few $1 notes on you while shopping in case you need to use a toilet because there is no public toilets, you’ll need to have a look around for signs at stores that have toilets, you usually will have to pay $1 to use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickiiNaulu
50,Great deals to check out on,"My first visit here and I loved every moment of it, from the food sold in the side of the roads to the great deals on food and drinks sold in food carts.Just a small tip, there are heaps of knockoffs sold there which is why a lot of products are cheap to buy, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find any quality great deals cheaper then anywhere else.I’ll definitely be going back in the future for another adventure.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deacon619
40,Shop to you drop,"I have never seen so many shops in one place. This is a girl dream come true. Whatever your looking for is here. Make sure you have your walking shoes on, because you can spend all day down here and you still haven't seen everything. Parking is something else. You can drive around and you may have to walk a little or you can pay for parking I've seen as high as 20 and as low and 5. Depends on the time and day. Now it open 7 days a week. what I found out is not all stores open on the weekend. However it so many store you won't miss it. I found my wedding dress down here. Paid 125.00, I seen the same dress at one of the malls for over 400.00. I couldn't believe it. I also go it tailored down there also. I found my jewelry down here also. Whatever your looking for it down here Shoes, Jewelry, Purses, Fabric, luggage, toys, clothes. So you have so many place to choose from so down get something as soon as you see it, because you may find it cheaper at the next store.Don't be scared to let them know you seen it somewhere else for a lower price because the will match and so of them will go lower. They have lots of place to get something to eat. You just have to eat and walk. The later it gets it gets harder to move around. However I just love this place and if I didn't leave so far away. I would be here everyday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliebY7845UV
50,Great source for fabrics!,"My best advice. Arrive before 9AM and find parking. I found the best fabrics in the 9th & Wall street area. Don't be afraid to go digging through the thousands of bolts of fabric to find hidden gems. Unitex is one of my favorite spots to shop. Saeed is a wonderful shopkeeper with many years of experience and always willing to help. It may not look like it but he knows where everything is in that jungle of fabric. Some of the trim shops are gone and have been replaced with wedding chotskies. If that is what you are into, have at it. I for one am a textile hunter and usually spend half to full day when I visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingsolo79
40,Wow!,"Sights, sounds, aromas, food, culture, people and so many stores to visit. You really need more that a day, just to take it all in.

50,"Mecca for deals, fashion of all sorts, accessories, fabric, display, much more",I was in the fashion business so I’ve been coming here for many years. Things have not changed nor have prices in general. But it’s massive so be sure to wear comfy shoes and prepare A LOT of walking if you’re on the hunt! Lots of bargains even 2 dollar tops. Paid street parking or parking garage but not that easy to park hence will need to walk a lot. Be sure to get the amazingly delicious Mexican street hotdog!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julietengwilliams
50,Over and over,I've been here several times. Come to people watch and look at cheap every thing. This is not Milan...or Paris. This is LA with tons of cheap junk. Enjoy!I came on a Thursday this time and no one was here. It is fine to be quiet but come on the weekend and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
20,Gritty and confronting,"When travelling to the ""fashion district"" be very clear on what you want from there. If you are looking for bargain high street fashion, then you will probably be better served by Nordstrom Rack, Saks of 5th, Bloomingdales outlet, Ross, Marshalls or the Citadel Outlets.We went in late summer, it wasn't super busy and it didn't feel super safe. I would recommend if you go, go in a group, go during the day.There are sights to be seen, like christening dresses, gawdy prom suits and a range of T-shirts from south of the border.The myth of up and coming designers is a bit of a myth as I didn't see anything that came close and I suspect that the rise of instagram has negated the need for a store front in a high crime (after dark) area.If you make you own clothes the fabric stores are perfect as the offer a range of interesting fabrics and accessories.The proximity to skid row means that there are number of homeless in this neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fernetdan
50,This is the place to shop for great deals,"Fashion District is a great place to shop for great deals at great prices. When ever I'm in the area this is a must shop. I love the vibe of the atmosphere it makes you want to explore and see what other deals and specials they might have going for the day. Some places do nicker, but not all or will because most visitors just pay the asking price w/o question. This is a great place to send the day. Parking is tricky as to street parking or some of the parking specials vendors offer, but be very carful; some of the areas looked shady. We park on the street with meters you must pay. It normally good for two hours; which should be enough time to shop and get some good deals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmellD

20,Sounded like it would be flash.. it wasn't,"We decided to get out of the main LA boulevards and spread our wings a little, we walked through downtown streets and saw signs for LA Fashion district.. this appealed to me in the hope that we could get some great shopping... this wasn't the case. one of the other reviewers said it isn't Milan or Paris and he is right its far from it... the shops are low end and whilst it was great to see a different part of town this is one I wouldn't rush to put on my list of things to do in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68

Easy parking and parking lots with attendants if you must.. Excellent quality or not just look and examine not returns. Bring cash. My favorite place to shop other than New York City and Chicago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/751rosab

50,This is not Milan or Paris,"I've said it before. What we can see of this fashion district is not high fashion, this is LA with it's huge gaggle of low end bargain manufacturers and jobbers.But possibly just important, it is one of the best locations to get ""bacon wrapped hot dogs"" and oh yeah people watch.If you want the runways of Paris or Milan then this is not for you.....go to Paris.The rest of us will arrive at 10am, wander around, buy a cheap lunch and then wander around a bit more and then stumble back to our car with 12 items that we spent less than $50 for.I highly recommend,Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto

40,Probably NOT What You Were Expecting But Still Amazing,"Being from the midwest I always assumed The Fashion District would be some sort of slightly less glamorous version of Rodeo Drive. Not even close. Think more like Tijuana - but the prices aren't necessarily negotiable unless you're buying in volume. The San Pedro area is for those with retail licenses only but most of the surrounding areas are open to anyone. There are no recognizable ""chain"" restaurants so if you don't like indie food you better take along some snacks. Mostly asian and mexican food. Parking is not free but I recommend using an Uber anyway if you're from out of town. Take a rolling suitcase along to transport all your finds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyr629

50,Not for the Faint of Heart!,"The fabric section of the Fashion District is an amazing cacophony of sights and sounds. I was unsure if I wanted to go on a tour of the Fashion District as part of the LA Costume College, but I'm sure glad I did! There are bolts of any fabric imaginable, bundles of ribbons and trims, pounds of buttons and beads and tons of bling! Everything is inexpensive. Buyer beware though. Few fabrics are marked, so the quality needs to be checked. Some shops have prices, some do not. Most seem to haggle over the cost.My favorite shop, and a little oasis of sanity and quiet, was the California Millinery Supply Co. at 721 S. Spring Street. It's a little bit of a walk from the center of the fabric section, but well worth it! I've never made a hat in my life but my sister wanted to buy supplies so I went along. This shop is amazingly interesting. It's like taking a step back in time. There is even a shop cat who I mistook for the feather duster at first. There are vintage hats to current hat forms available. The mystery boxes stacked almost to the ceiling are intriguing as are the jars full of trinkets, shelves stuffed with ribbons and trim in all shapes, colors and sizes.This shop has been in business since the 1930s and is a treasure and something everyone should experience. Be sure to take time to converse with the shopkeeper, she is a fascinating character!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingFreeWoman

40,Lots to see and cheap,"Firstly after reading some of the poor reviews I can see why some of these people have given such a review.This isnt really a ""fashion"" district per se, if your looking for a crazy deal on an Armani jacket or a Gucci bag you've come to the wrong place.If however you are after stylish and trendy clothes for all occasions you'll be quite happy. They had loads of mens formal shoes of all types for wearing with suits. Lots of mens and womens winter jackets, casual and smart casual wear, womens sportswear. Plenty of trinkits, knick knacks and curio. Kids toys and clothes. Lost the girlfriend for more than an hour, partly her shopping like crazy, partly me doing likewise haha.There's definitely junk here and it's easy to spot, you can tell by looking at the items material which are nicer and the price tag usually confirms by being a bit above the crud stuff. Lots of blingy jewellery here too if that's your thing. Awesome discounted cologne's and perfumes aswell. All in all it's pretty great but it ain't no high end fashion bargain destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeljr89
50,"So much fabric, so little time...","I have been to the fabric section of the LA Fashion District twice in the last year, shopping for fabric and trims to costume for a children's theatre in Colorado. I didn't make the trip specifically for this but was able to incorporate it into my visits. So glad I did! I only visited the fabric stores part of the LA District and that was big enough on his own. Shop after shop of yards and yards of fabrics and trims, many displayed on the sidewalk. You haggle for a price and they cut it right off the bolt standing right there. Eat on the go from one of the many food wagons, you don't want to waste time sitting somewhere. Parking not a problem as there are folks with flags everywhere directing you to their particular lot. $5/day is what I paid both times, very fair. Note: one big store, Michael Levine (actually 2 buildings across the street from one another) has not-as-cheap fabrics but still inexpensive and air conditioned, well organized and tons of helpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CO911dispatcher
50,Wife and daughter thought this was a home run.,I took my wife and daughter to this area and was a bit worried as it is near the not-tourist-friendly Skid Row area. No problem on that count as they have their own security patrols. I would suggest you do some research before going as the sheer size is overwhelming. Santee Alley is probably a good place to start. My wife and daughter both brought home some unique clothes and accessories they had never seen elsewhere and spend very little to buy them. There are a lot of restaurants and food carts in the area so if you go for it and make a day of it there are plenty of places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IkoIkoIko

50,"Mind-blowing Wonderland, Need to hunt down bargains!","Fabulous! Didn't know that LA Fashion District existed till just before this trip. We had a little more time, so checked out Santee Alley – mind-boggling HUGE Fashion District! Is a design, warehouse, and distribution hub; retail and trade.Sensational prom dresses, beautiful ballgowns & cocktail dresses; reasonable prices. In Santee Alley, boho prints, skin-tight bodycon dresses, floaty chiffon numbers, accessories, fabric, knock-offs, one of the many amazing stores. Most stores prefer cash buys. Buying more than one item could generate more discounts. Shop carefully, most stores haven't got fitting rooms. They generally have mirrors, and don't mind if you put it on, on top of the clothes you are wearing (in view of other shoppers), which I have done before (ask before you do it).I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Walking around was a pleasure, only going a few steps, and into the next store to check-out the fashionable, trendy, sporty, vampy, cute-sie apparel on offer; stilleto shoes with 8-inch heels, flat pumps; it is all there.LA Fashion District is 100 blocks; for ease of putting-on/taking-off tops in the absence of changing rooms, I wore a tank-top; bring a holdall, backpack or luggage-stroller to carry your shopping; have comfy shoes on. Plenty of food options, there are downloadable maps of this gigantic area; we only did Santee Alley. If you are a shopaholic, a Definite Must to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquitohc
50,A MUST IF YOU LIKE SHOPPING,I love wandering around the wholesale shops. You can find almost anything at great prices. I top up my wardrobe when visiting Los Angeles. Parking is available all day for around $5. Wander to your hearts content and find a fabulous handbag for $10. Just bought loads of clothes and handbags for around $15 each item reduced from way over $100 each item as shop closing down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyla39
40,Looking for Daughter's wedding dress,"The freeways were packed getting there so we opted for side streets through china town. Saw a lot of homeless encampments.Parking is challenging. We found a place that allowed for the entire day for 5 dollars and tipped the attendant as well.We googled shops prior to going so we had an idea of where we wanted to go. There were several fairly close together. All limited you to trying on only 2 dresses to allow them to serve more customers. The last shop had an employee that made all the difference, Carlos. He was at La Queen boutique. 912 Santee St, Los Angeles, CA 90015. It was wonderful and fun. He evaluated my daughter and then stated with confidence he knew what dress and ran down stairs. He came back with a beautiful gown. She had one dress in the dressing room already and he put the dress he picked first. It fit her like a dream. He asked if she was going to say, ""Yes, to the dress"". She said Yes and he pressed the button on his phone and it played the wedding march. All the girls cheered. It was just hat she needed. He was wonderful and helpful with the veils. It would not have been such a great experience without him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canurse2017

We saw leggings/jeggings, makeup, inexpensive jewelry, various types of shoes and clothing, hair accessories, etc.The outdoor vendors are set up like a flea market, although there are nicer stores/boutiques with bridal gowns/prom dresses and expensive clothing. I suppose there is a little bit of something for everyone! I would suggest shopping around ""The Santee Alley"" for the optimal pricing of goods.We had fun and our 14 year old Daughter snagged some Anastasia/Jeffrey Star makeup for about 1/2 of what Sephora has it for!Note: Even though you may find a garage that advertises parking for a certain amount per day, once you enter the garage you will end up paying more than what was advertised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdin10ac

Look at the craft and material area, rugs and THE jewellery market its a mind blower... have brought so many clothes from here and they last and last...I always go here when in LA..when time permits.... down load map of area and study it so you then know where to go... do not miss Santa Alley... great trendy name brand handbags etc but compare shop prices there and how well made the bag .

20,Look for deals online,If you are looking for fashion then this is not the place to come. The stuff that is sold here is knock offs and cheap quality stuff. The area is not so great as well and can be somewhat dangerous at times. You have to pay to park and unless you are looking for fabric I would advise you to shop online for better deals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch
20,Fashion district not impressed,We took a bus tour and this was our first stop I thought it would be more interesting but it was not. Yes they have fabric every where and the only stores I found good was the main jewelry center but would not trust what they were selling unless you have an expert with you. Their prices were so high yet they were willing to bargin down so low which makes you wonder what they are really selling. I can say been there done that will not be back was not worth my time- we did walk up to the financial area which was way up high great views from that point we did a lot of walking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90dianee
30,Deals,"Fashion District is a good place for casual clothing at a discount price. Most of the items are off brand items. The great deals are in evening dresses. They have 2-3 blocks of boutiques and great dress options for all ages and styles. If you are going, best time to get there is by 10-11am, park by the Santee Parking lot structures and like most crowded places, watch out for pick pockets. This is a good place to find deals but you do have to be ready to haggle and stay alert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee1050
50,Get your walking shoes,"We walked around the Fashion District for hours and hours. The kids didn't want to leave. There's lots of toys everywhere that caught their eye. We bought some cool hats and sunglasses because it got pretty warm during all that walking. Shopping? There's women's clothes, men's clothes, kids clothes, shoes, socks, hats, purses, toys, blankets, and more. And there's plenty of places to eat. We ate from one of the street vendors. The Mexican food and watermelon lemonade was sooooooo good and it was inexpensive. There's a McDonald's nearby too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theLadyRho
50,need to bargain,"The best time to shop here is during weekdays as weekends gets too crowded. Good tip is you need to know how to bargain their price. If they say $12, ask for $10. Also if you pay cash, they give you a better deal than paying credit card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mari_reys
40,Good for getting textiles and accessories if you're a designer,"I wouldn't go here to get fashion really, but there's a lot of textile shops and shops with accessories. This area is good if you're a fashion designer og want to get creative...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CasperH
40,Spend a day at the LA Fashion District,"On a recent trip to LA, my husband and I visited the LA Fashion District. What a surprise. Not fancy - so don't expect Beverly Hills type shopping. Great shopping, great prices. What more could you ask for? If you love clothes and shoes, this is the place to go. Loved Santee Alley for great bargains. If you are looking for a special glitzy dress, this is the place to go. Almost blinded by the sequins and rhinestones. Only issue with this area is the lack of restroom facilities. Loved it so much, we went back a second day to visit the textile district. Blocks and blocks of fabric. Lots of notions, drapery and glitzy fabric. Only one store had a great selection of quilting fabrics. Great prices. Will definitely go back again and plan to spend more time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbarden
30,"No, I don't want to buy a diseased turtle...","Ok,For what it is (cheap fabric, cheap clothes, etc), this district is ok. However, if you're a visitor picturing a Rodeo drive style fashion strip, you wont find it here. This is more for people looking to buy fabric to MAKE clothes. The actual shops that sell actual clothing are nothing special. Its mostly cheap knock off styles, and tacky bargain brand items that you can find at a K-Mart. Some random stuff too... like live turtles (why?) and goldfish (none too healthy looking), knick-knacks, random art prints, etc... I enjoyed myself for people watching, but wouldn't come back.Note: This is downtown LA, and we have a huge, out of control homeless population. Keep that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatEmeraldGuy
40,Sidewalk Runway!,"Don't expect to feel like it's the hub of beautiful fashion and designer shops . . . . there is Beverly Hills for that! This is the location where the work gets done. You'll find loads of fabric stores, shoe vendors, hand bags, etc. at wholesale prices. You just have to know where to go to get the deals! Do your homework before you venture into this congested sidewalk runway or you'll leave stressed out and with empty bags.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
40,From Manufacture to shop!!,"Here is a place where you can obtain the latest fashion styles at a wholesale price.Don't ask to buy one piece you will be most likely kicked out or ignored.Make sure come with enough time to explore it thouroughly and find the best designs with the best prices, don't forget to bargain.Although most people don't now this but a lot of the vendors open on saturday mornings.Last time I was here it was from 7AM to 10AM, you will be able to find some unbelievable deals at a very good price.Also make sure you look at the garment very well thats not damage.In conclusion this place is great for shopping with great prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastback19
30,If you're into fashion,The LA fashion district is an area south of the center of downtown and offers a wide variety of shops and businesses that are part of the LA fashion industry. All kinds of clothing and fabrics are offered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
30,More of the same once you've been around the first bit,"A group of us went here for the day, partly because some of the guys hadn't expected the weather to be so hot in Feb and needed more stuff. At first it looked quite interesting, certainly very colourful and vibrant everywhere but after we'd done the first 10 shops it seemed that they all stocked really similar stuff plus I'm not sure how much labelled stuff was the real deal. I managed to go around the whole lot without buying a thing which for anyone who noes me would say it's unheard of! For any UK visitors it reminded me of the old Blackbushe market but a lot bigger. Definitely worth a visit though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliP504
40,Good buys,Always good buys in this area if they have what you're looking for. Lots of garments focused on Latin influence.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalclear2
20,"Good to shop around, but very disorganized area","Many shops, many things to look around.But, the blocks are full of trashes and unpleasant things going on.The City should help the homeless people out and stay them in a safer place. Not a good situation they are in at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theworldanddaniel
40,A Fun Experience and Insight into the World of Fashion,This is the 2nd time I have been to Santee Alley. Took my daughters and granddaughter on a weekend this time and it was so crowded you could hardly move but it was fun to have the experience and my granddaughter found lots of bargains. Next time we will do the separate areas of the things we are interested in and not Santee Alley.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgalex

30,Be Prepared to Hunt,"My husband and I were looking for casual outfits and dress suits. Los Angeles Street is the place to go to to find quality suits, but the stores are intermixed with cheaper goods. Know your brands, and check out the quality. A $130 men's suit, can look like a $130 men's suit on. Negotiate prices. If you leave for a named competitor they will drop the price. Do try to get your hands on a map. It saves time by showing you in general where to find what you are looking for. Santee Alley was pretty much flea market/swap meet goods. Almost all the women's suits were church suits with matching hats. I was asked several times if I was a pastor's wife or first lady. I never did find a nice busines suit for myself, but my husbnad found several nice suits, ties, socks and quality hats. Weekday parking was very inexpensive and plentiful. We paid $4 for the day. The hunt for bargains was fun, and we love haggling over the prices. There are hidden gems tucked away here and there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinem201
40,The Good The Bad and The Ugly,"When we arrived the area was packed with people, probably 2pm ish. Where the taxi driver dropped us off was cnr of Maple and Olympic, the area just looked like a great big market, full of cheap clothing at cheap prices. We bought absolutely nothing, everything seemed dirty and cheap. We kept walking and came across a new section which was full of fabrics and arts and crafts, my husband instantly had a look of ""oh no"" on his face! lol. But if you are into these types of things you are in heaven. There was also another section of handbags, but this time hubby was ready to forget about living! Then came the jewellery section, I had a great time Hubby not so great. Well worth going too all the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LissyL0u
30,Low cost clothing items,"Great place when looking for low cost items. Of course you can find expensive clothing as well, but the main focus seems to be low cost clothing and the quality is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW60s
40,Not what I expected.,"I was a little disappointed as I wanted to spend the day getting a complete new wardrobe for me and my daughter. I felt that it was cheap and nasty road side stands that had hundreds of the same item. We still had a good time, window shopping and we did buy one or two items, but it wasn't what I thought it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karens429
40,Great spot to find bargins & EAT,"Wear comfy shoes and be prepared to walk. It gets very repetitive, but deals can be found. I love just walking around looking eating from the many street vendors! There is tons of people everywhere, don't suggest taking little kids with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcelao750
40,Purchase clothing,"It good to visit on a weekday. But watch traffic is heavy. Parking is quite expensive, but available every corner. Get out the car and walk around stores that sell all kind if items, from clothing,shoes, jewelry, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zwinbawie
30,Too much of the same thing,We didn't go buy anything specific but after walking around some it gets very repetitive! Everyone sells the same stuff. It was hot and crowded. We went on a Sunday maybe that's why i also had my kid in a stroller which made it harder to navigate through the crowds. I would go again but not on a very hot day or with kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saragabrielab
50,A utopia of inspiration,"I lived in LA this summer for my costume/styling internships. I fell in love with this place. This is a unique resource anything you could ever need in any texture or color, spanning 90 blocks. Great for freelancers, entrepreneurs, artists, tourists.Also don't forget about Santee Alley, the huge outdoor bazaar. I got some in-expensive treasures and souvenirs for my friends. Hat for $5? Okay : ) Definitely barter.Oh and there is a massive flower district. Who knew? This also spans for blocks. Beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1585TLmeganb
50,Remember…this has nothing to do with fashion...,"Just remember that this has nothing to do with fashion…it is a lively market (mostly clothing and knick knacks), mostly by/for Mexicans…but we just loved walking all over the neighborhood. It almost felt like we were outsiders gawking at a local cultural phenomena known only to the locals. Even my teenage son loved the place…even bought a couple of tee shirts. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixpackDC
20,Outdoor bazaar in skeezy surroundings,"I thought the idea was that the wholesale stores were open to the public, but mostly what we saw were lots of cheesy little stores and outside vendors selling knock off cheesy merchandise. That was after parking in a skeezy area and walking through a pretty yucky area to get there. Most of the wholesale places appeared closed (this was a Saturday, which was supposed to be the day the wholesalers are open to the public). I did get a dress for $5 and some MAC lip gloss for $3, but mostly the whole thing reminded me more of an outdoor bazaar than a fashion anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbanyTraveller44
30,The name is deceiving,"Your might be imagining by the name that this place is like fashion avenue in New York. But you can't be more wrong. If you are waiting to do a luxury and designers stores this isn't your place.Most of the stores sale flea market stuff or high volume. This is were sellers come to buy. The weather here is hot and the alleys doesn't same safe. Also there are a lot of vagabonds here.On the other hand if you are looking for a lot of cheap clothes, this is the right place.P.S. Most stores are only opened during the morning (up to 3 pm) so if you are planning a late evening trip you will find everything closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarianoN_11
20,"Full of shops, but go early","We didn't had a clue that the shops only open in the morning, so we went in the afternoon and it was a huge dissapointment, it even felt kind of insecure. The shops that were open didn't look that good either, but perhaps was because of the hour. If you've ever been in Moroleon in Mexico, that's preatty much like it, or at least we kind of think that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933karlisg
40,Walk & Walk to find the best deals.,"One of the best places for fashion retailers with out a doubt.No very clean to have lunch and no many options just Mexican and Korean Food everywhere.Look options for parking, there are all different prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StefannyBlanco
10,SKIP IT,"HOT, dirty, junk. Would never go back. Was like a giant swap meet. Cheap clothing, cheap toys. Pay to park like a sardine. Nothing worthwhile there at all. You pay for what you get. The items were cheap prices and cheap quality",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josL7740YS
40,"Bring cash, plenty of cheap stuff.","You can buy many items, from knock offs to decent stuff. Just make sure to bring cash, because 9 out of 10 sellers don't accept cards, checks or any other forms of payment.Parking is a headache, but save yourself the trouble and pay the parking fee. Don't be cheap by using meter, because my sister had her vehicle broken into while they were walking around. (Several years ago)There are NO bathrooms, so be prepared to pay $0.75 a person to use the facilities. Even the McDonald's doesn't have free restrooms. Paying customers only and it's LOCKED! My last advice is be aware of your surroundings. Plenty of shady peeps walking around, looking for easy prey. So make sure you keep you $$ in a safe place on you. And lock up your car, even if you paid for parking. Better safe then sorry!So keep safe and get some good deals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cl0rissap
50,Back to it!,"I see the mixed reviews and some horrible reviews. I agree with some of the descriptions but not the ratings. I give it an excellent rating for all it is and is not. Yes here is tons of cheap and tacky stuff, but some interesting things also. But import and local stuff does have it's own personality and charm. For restaurants there are some good ones, but one must study ""TripAdvisor"" for those. The best are a few blocks away. So go find a treasure or just go and buy some cheap tacky jeans or even some plastic sunglasses for the beach, but you must chill. If you want art go to the museum, if you want glamor, go to (tacky) Hollywood, If you want amusement parks well then go to Disneyland. Come here and have a fun time and stare at the locals. And yes, I recommend the fashion district for those who know what to expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
40,Great fashion Deals,The Fashion District is located in Downtown Los Angeles and is the center of many importers and distributors of fashion from all over the world. There is much diversity to find and the prices are excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
40,Cheap clothers,It was my first time there and it was about what I expected. There were lots of cheap flea market quality clothes and an abundance of hot dog carts. Wear comfortable shoes and go to the bathroom beforehand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRS_MARCUSMACK
30,LA Fashion District,This is an area you should only visit if you know what you want and where to get it. Parking is neigh on impossible and many of the wholesalers will only sell to members of the public on specific days or to trade only. I've long given up going to the area and instead always head out to the Outlets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaybea33
50,Great prices,I love going to the fashion district. There are many stores and the prices are really good. This is where vendors buy stuff also. If you go wear thin clothes because most places do not have dressing rooms. Not a great area so keep your purse close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallysP7784RS
20,Yikes! If Knock Off Brands Is Your Thing..,"I visited the fashion district for the first time last weekend and honestly I can't say that I've missed much! I wouldn't consider myself much of a ""bargain shopper"" if you will however my girlfriend had to come down here for some material or something! As I walked down the ""alley"" I couldn't believe how much cheap and knock off brand kind of stuff was being sold! My friends call my bougie all day but I don't care it's a bit of a disgrace to the designer to be selling all these replicas and bad ones at that lol yikes! If you can't afford it then you just can't afford it! Anyways I can't see myself having a need to ever visit down here again instead I'll be on Rodeo Dr darling!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
10,Watch out for the homeless people.,Blocks and blocks of stalls crammed into dirty streets. Mostly all having the same knock off handbags and bright tourist t shirts. Spend a morning walking until your feet hurt with little to show for it except the homeless people following you begging for money. Save you effort and go to the outlets instead or volunteer in a shelter if that's what you're into.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862MelissaM
40,If you like shopping ... go!,"Walking distance from my hotel in downtown LA, this is a couple of blocks packed with shops offering all kinds of clothes and other items. Loads of variety and definitely do bargain! Lots of eateries in the vicinity too.One thing i missed seeing were souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajeshkk
40,Need to know what you are in for,"I go here to purchase fabrics in bulk for projects or to find something unique for a smaller project. The selections are vast and the shops are many. So many notions and choices, blends and polys, love to walk for miles just looking at all the possibilities. It's great to come down and make a deal on tights or rhinestones and find bulk fabrics and sometimes a maker who can do two dozen shirts for a chorus for a show. Love the vibe here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberlyMaynard
40,Men's specialty store:Clade,"Went to Clade men's clothing store on 6th and Spring st. A small store with very special pieces designed by Maya Reynolds, whose store it is. They are made locally of beautiful fabrics. Very special and unique. A great find in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Batyah65
50,A great place with treasure!,A great place for fashion shopping! Spent a full day here- a lot of cheap clothes to see/ buy. Most stuff are similar from one seller to another.NOT a place for high end stuff!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveEye
40,Large area,"This is a cool area to walk around in, but its a very large area and it is hard to know exactly where to go as a first time shopper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389ValerieP
30,It was fun for a bit,"My family of seven went just to see what was there, as my dad sells clothing online. We've never been before. First, it was very crowded (odd for a sunday). Most of the good shops were closed. Like some other reviews said, it was mostly the same thing over and over, but they all sold items at different prices. Huge makeup store in Santee alley, but I wouldnt trust it. As a professional haristylist, Im weary of makeup and hair products sold in stores like that. For my sister it was fine, as she likes makeup of any sort. I bought a few shirts from the ONLY plus size shop we could find and another store nearby that went up to larger sizes. They also had socks (which seem to vanish) for cheap so that was nice. It was very hot and I spent the entire time thinking how I needed to use the restroom, but I wasnt willing to spend money just to go pee. We didnt try any of the little cart food, since my stomach is so sensitive and risking food posioning wasnt worth it. Alot of hispanics and asians running the stores so unless they spoke english, you were out of luck asking questions about anything. We didnt get through it all as small children and a brother with a bad attitude caused us to leave, plus, the lack of parking means we needed to use a meter and it cost 3 dollars for an hour.In short, Id go back to see other shops (probably without kids) and maybe buy more, but only during a cooler time period. Id also bring my own food and drinks, plus use the bathroom ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParizzA
50,Patience is virtual,"I come here whenever I am free to shop or sometimes look around for new trending outfits. Majority of the clothes here are very affordable and if you are a fashion addict and like to see what you are buying, come here. This only disadvantage is you have to be extremely patient if you want to buy something very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez
40,Bargains,The corner hot dog stand with the bacon on the hot dog is delicious. It can be a little overwhelming since there are so many bargains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tequiasb
20,Fashion for wholesale,"The place is good to wander around if you are downtown but it is an area for wholesalers and not mainly for retail where you want to buy one or two items, although you might be in luck in a few shops. If you want retail go to a nice mall instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
30,Endless stores,We came to the fashion district to find something for my brother and we ended up walking around several blocks just looking at all of the stores. We were able to find what we came to look for and also did some people watching. Unless you are looking for Fabric or dresses then you dont really need to head here. We came here only because we were in the neighborhood on a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
20,not worth the time,If you like sparkly dresses that are all the same then this is your place. The stores had all the same dresses. 99% of them were for teenagers. A few limited 18-20. You have to pay to use the bathrooms. We did find a McD and bought a coke to use the bathroom. Fake jewely was great. found lots of stores selling silver and fake diamonds for 1/2 price. Like Mexico you negotiate your prices never buy it for what the sticker says.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamdiger2
50,Great deals!,If your looking for cheap fabrics this is the place to go. We found fabric as cheap as $1 a yard!!! City blocks full of fabric & notions stores. Bring your own shopping bags & good walking shoes it's a whole day trip😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421alishar
40,"Love the Fashion District, but not for everyone.","If you like an adventure, and like to save money, this shopping is for you. Prices are great and styles are in fashion with some stores better than others. No even close to Rodero Drive, but very interesting. People, people, people everywhere. Kinda reminds me of Mexico.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllinoisSenora
50,GREAT BARGAINS,I was in LA over Thanksgiving this year and visited the Alley Market of LA. Fantastic atmosphere and so many great deals. My mother and I ended up buying a huge duffel bag with wheels and filled it up and the convenience of not having to carry so many bags was great.Highly recommend any visitor to try this place out because you may never know....you could be in luck for great deals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214pepef
50,"Cheap or expensive, tons of stuff.",One can get almost any kind of clothing here. Or one can just go down and people watch. Raid the discount rack for one dollar shirts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
30,Cheap place to buy,"We went there on a Saturday morning and the place was packed with stores. All kinds of things for sale: wedding/party decorations, fabrics, bags, clothes, etc. They are located in their own areas, so first we only saw fabric stores and as we wandered further, came the bag and clothes stores. There’s also a dollar store, where I found lots of cheap nail decorations. All the items are pretty cheap in the area, and I think it also reflects the quality, which isn't maybe the best..It is a vast area and you probably won’t find the same store again (or want to walk all the way back to it), so be sure to buy everything that you want while you’re in the store. We found the nearest bus stop from Google Maps and walked the rest of the way to the stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juunu
10,Don't waste a day of your holiday here!,"The reviews were mixed when I read about the LA Fashion District and unfortunately I agree with those which were negative. My partner and I came here in the hope we would find some unique LA fashion for a good price. What we found was an area full of stores which look like either wholesalers (for fabric & costume jewellery) mens suits of poor quality (we didn't find any other men's clothes!) and stall upon stall of cheap women's clothes (think leggings, jeans covered with appliqués and touristy t-shirts). It reminded me of a cheap flea market- lots of plastic sunglasses, t-shirts and bags which were tacky and unfashionable. I don't think I have unusually high standards- high street fashion such as Zara, Topshop, Banana Republic etc is my style and compared to these brands the quality was poor. Moreso, there wasn't anywhere we would even consider stopping for lunch and overall were disappointed we had wasted a day of our holidays going to a place with absolutely nothing to buy, nor any character or charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_angel
40,Place to be for Bargains!!!,"I love to shop! There were so many shops in the Fashion districts, I didn't know where to start. Generally, the apparel is moderately priced and I would advice you allocate at least a day to shop so that you get to have a look in a few more stores than we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvetteA718

20,Cheap and nasty,This place felt like I was at a bigger version of a cheap flea market. I did not see a single thing I wanted to buy. It felt like a complete waste of time to visit this place. It's probably okay if price is your only motivation and you do not care about quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonh954
50,Great Pricing,"Take a day and go to the fashion district. You will not believe the buys you can find. Plus food, drinks and more fun as you can walk miles shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DD19351
20,What on Earth?,Maybe this place is live on the weekends but wow was it ever ghetto on Tuesday afternoon. Walked out quicker then we did walking toward it. The jewelry district is better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradr879
50,Trip to the District with Wife and Granddaughter,We stopped by on our way down to Disneyland as we had never been there. This is an attraction all by itself! MY wife and Granddaughter shopped and looked for over 5 hours. Plenty of great bargains and now my wife wants to go back ASAP. Doesn't matter what you are looking for it is there. Also love it that you can haggle over the price....take some cash as you can do the haggle part better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamj234
50,Shop Til You Drop!,"Love this place! Go on a Saturday morning to find the best deals. You will find lots of deals and even designer steals. The prices are always not firm, so try your shot at bargaining. I could spend the whole day here. You will get lost easily because there is just so much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacaygal1
50,"SHOPPING, SHOPPING, SHOPPING!!!!","If you like shopping and great bargains, than this is the place. The Fashion District consists of blocks and blocks of nothing but deals.

50,Wedding dress shopping,"The stores here have a wide selection of wedding dresses, personally did not find ""the one"" yet but I will most likely be back to browse again. I cannot believe how inexpensive it can be to buy a dress here! A few of the dresses that I did like were between $150-$250! And the ladies working are more than willing to negotiate prices. I def recommend taking a trip to the fashion district, doesn't hurt to look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneC959
30,Both repulsive and exciting,You would probably not find something to buy but you might gather new experiences. You will be squeezing through the passageways with thousands of Latinos looking at thousands of shops with cheap clothes. Each of the Latino shop owners will play there preferred ethnic music and let you loudly know what treasures they have in store. You can feel this incredible energy and joie de vivre... As a foreigner I got the idea that this ethnic group might play a bigger role in the future...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosC172

20,Tourists/Travelers- Don't Go- Skip this,"I've been hitting the alley's and fashion district for over 20 years. There used to be great finds, but now it is all junk! So not worth it. The service is horrible, parking sucks, there are no public bathrooms and everything is cheaply made. The only place I do recommend is the fabric shops like Michael Levine. The selection is amazing, not very cheap though. There are other vendors where you can find basic fabrics like Satin, Cotton, Linen and Organza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Guapastravel
50,Bargaining at its best!,"Yea, it's sort of a sketchy area down there but I still felt completely safe. If you love a bargain you must go! Tons of items at great prices!

50,fun shopping,no clean bathroom-even resturants do not allow use of bathroom. most vendors will bargain on prices.too many purse and dressup clothes stores. the alley is the best part if you are limited for time. best to go when opens at ten and on weekday.most often no dressing rooms so makes the purchase of pants/jeans impossible even though the prices of such are great and styles varied. be sure and get a map otherwise you will find yourself on streets you already were through. Cabs do not stroll the area so plan on needing to call a cab and waiting 10 or 15 minutes-you must have a physical address and the cross street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hillmel
40,Fashion district can be fun if you can find your way around!,"Found lots of cheap clothes, purses, shoes, and prom dresses as well as lots of fabric stores and children's clothes. Had a hard time finding better quality fashionable clothes such as what you would find in Nordstrom or Saks. Did find one good store, Vertigo that had great clothes for a trendy office environment! Use the bathroom before you come as they are far between and dirty. Weekdays are the best time to come in the early morning or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraL108
30,Fun find,"Do not go on weekends it is so CROWDED! Use the bathroom before you get there it is very hardto find a clean bathroom. Ok now the shopping they have some great stuff, hand bags,shoes,flat irons the good kind, make up like MAC and Urban decay. Fun place the clothing is not high end quality not even mid range quality think walmart-papaya some HM like clothing. Oh great place to buy costume jewlery. Also there are plenty of pay to park lots just don't leave valuables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elvia92563
40,Interesting Place,"We've never been to the district, so we thought we'd give it a try. We were there the weekend after Christmas.There are blocks and blocks of stores, and then more blocks. Santee Alley is an experience in itself - get there early to enjoy the shopping, otherwise you will be in a crush of people.In my opinion - the quality of the goods is not so hot. But, that being said - we did make several purchases as its nice to know we spent $7 for a sweater that most likely won't be in style next year anyway. If you're looking for really good deals of Ross/TJMax quality - I think this is a good place to visit.The wholesale items are mixed in with stuff we can purchase - but its not a big deal as they store employees are quick to let you know what you can purchase. Speaking of store employees - we encountered some very nice store employees, no one was pushy or tried to do a hard sell at all.Bring cash, most stores want cash and not credit, though we did find a few that took credit.Going on the weekend we did - many of the shops were closed. But that was fine - being our first trip up there, it was overwhelming enough so the quiet streets was welcome. I can't imagine this place during normal operations.Suggestions: Be VERY specific in your recollection of where you park your car. All the lots begin to look alike after a while and they are all over. Bring cash. Study the map prior to determine which areas you want to hit (womens shoes, mens fashions, etc) and park near there if possible - again, know exactly where you parked.Though many shops were closed when we went, the ones that were open were closing out their items because it was the last week of 2013. We got some really, really good deals - womens blouses for $5, etc.Would we go again? yep, we're going to try to hit the closeouts again next year. Do I think the quality is very good? No, not particularly but I bought my son a jacket for $40 that we'd pay over $150 at a normal store. So, when he outgrows it next year I'm not going to even worry about it -If you haven't been here before - its worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTravelX4
50,Its Obvious the Naysayers Definitely need to let me show them around,"I live in California, I am in the Fashion District 3 times a week for business and pleasure.I have learned how to navigate and find some of the best kept secrets you would definitely not want to share. If you are in town, and want to shop for trinkets (jewelry, fabric etc. Then you really need to be with someone who is well experienced in the FASHION DISTRICT, as you will clearly be lost on whats good and whats not!Yes, we now have an influx of spanish speaking, why? They work there (labor is cheap), and they buy there, as cost of merchandise is also cheap. There are many hidden gems to find department store closeouts, Brand names sample sales and sooo much more!Dont go if you hate being bumped or pushed or have a weak blatter, this is not for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MogulMindset
40,Great Fabric District,"Loved having the opportunity to go here to shop for fabric! I loaded up on Friday and Saturday morning. The parking is more expensive on weekend days, so if you can shop during the week, take advantage of cheaper parking. 9th and Maple is where it's at for fabric shopping. Park your car near here and spend a morning in fabric heaven. Take advantage of the street vendors for lunch and buy yourself a delicious street dog...though don't drip on your fabric purchase like I did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86flowergirl
50,Best shopping spot in LA,"At the last day in LA, we decided to spend the rest of our time in Fashion District. I didn't expect too much, but I was wrong. I really regret we'd have spent a whole day. During weekday, there're plenty of All-Day-$3-Parking available. As the stores closes from 4pm, you need to cover before then. Most stores accept only cash. You should definitely hit Shantee Alley first, but there're some bargains in in other areas. Many stores sells whole sales only. There're lots of bargains, but some items are not, so be mindful. If you want to buy tacky souvenir T-Shirts, you may want to save all your T-Shirt shopping here. When we come back to LA, we'll come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Wonderz
10,Why the hell is it called fashion district?!!!,This place was terrible! All the shopps had the same things. Everything looked cheaply made and like it was made for a low class street walker. Avoid it at all costs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Habawi
40,"I thought this would be a high-class collection of outlets, not a Tijuana bazaar.","It wasn't what I expected, but I had good time anyway. We came thinking that it was some collection of high-end outlets where expensive clothes might be had on the cheap. What it really is is a bazaar lifted right out of Tijuana. It was crowded and crazy, but I thought it was fun. We bought a few clothing items, perhaps of questionable origin or quality but reasonable nonetheless. The crowds are mostly Hispanic but very friendly, more of a family atmosphere rather than a ""hustle the tourists"" type of place. There are too many vendors to count, food, clothes, trinkets, etc. I saw one large store just devoted to piñatas, fancy ones, too. Parking can be a challenge (as can trying to make a left turn) but there are dozens of hustlers with red flags aggressively trying to persuade you (in an entertaining manner) to park in their lots. We went just a ways past the heart of the district and easily found a meter (this was a weekday, mind you). The only thing unnerving was that this borders on East LA and we traveled through some pretty gritty areas after exiting the freeway before we hit the district. I would advise people to go spend half a day there with realistic expectations about ""fashion"" deals. Again, it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaka_Frank
40,Saturday morning budget shopping,"Been to LA 4 times and never miss this. It starts early Sat morning (5-6 am ?) and goes to10:30-11 am. The streets are lined with racks and tables mostly with clothes. Spanish and Korean are the official languages but everyone knows how to answer ""how much?"" If you don't like crowds, don't go. This is not for everyone. If you like paying $10 for 3 t-shirts, the same ones you will pay $12 each on Hollywood Blvd, then this is the place for you. Blouses-shirts for $5-8, jeans, belts, .shoes, ect. My wife and teenage daughters manage to fill a suitcase full of clothes at about 1/5 of what of what it would cost in Canada. Definitly not for the faint of heart, but a bargain shoppers paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raylap
40,Worth a trip...,"Unbelievable bargains to be found. Take cash, as they will charge you extra tax and card fees if you pay with credit card etc. Plenty to see and do, but alot of the shops start repeating themselves.

Not that I am complaining, it was bargain shopping, go there with plenty of time and lots of cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetinaK

50,Find what you want/need here.,I was looking for a dress for my son's wedding this fall. I had a color and style in mind but did not want to order a dress online. Went to LA Fashion District and found the perfect dress and it was less than online. You can find almost anything in the fashion district.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanR306
50,Go If You Like to Bargain,"A friend of mine, who has been going to the Fashion District for 10 years, guided me through it recently. I brought cash so I could better negotiate with the vendors. Many are willing to give you a deal, so don't be afraid to ask. The worst thing they can do is say ""no"". We went on a Saturday morning/early afternoon and it wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be. Many vendors were eager to help me find what I was looking for so I didn't have to waste my time looking when I knew what I wanted. We had a great time at O.K. Mike's on Santee, which carries very unique women's clothing. The salesman in there was a stitch. It's worth going just to watch him interact with customers. The food is also part of the experience. Right outside of the shop was a hot dog vendor-ginormous bacon-wrapped hot dogs grilled in front of you. Grilled onions, fresh pico de gallo with avocado, chiles, etc. A must try! So delicious! The Food Court is a good place to find a clean bathroom. If you buy something at the food court you can show your receipt to use the bathroom for free, so keep your receipt all day in case you need to come back. Bathrooms are scarce in the District. I got to experience cherry rice while visiting the Food Court. We brought with us a cart on wheels so we could put water bottles in it as well as our purchases. It made shopping all day so much easier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseA_11
20,...,This was not at all what I was expecting. I expected high class shops but in fact I didn't see any.

A lot of low quality stock and touristy junk. And area seemed really dangerous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasnaM798

30,not as exciting as it sounds,"I expected to see top of the line brand new fashions here, but that just isn't the case. What you have is store upon store selling cheaply made items, mostly to retailers.Prices are low, and if you request a sample from a place that says wholesale only, you might be able to buy only one of what you want. I would also point out that many places will not take a debit or credit card (seems odd considering that they want to sell massive quantities).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AC301

50,"Lots of fun, great deals!","First of all, if you're looking for an up-scale shopping experience in L.A., this isn't the place (go to The Grove in Beverly Hills for that). The Fashion District is crowded, energetic, and has lots of variety. You won't find designer clothes or jewelry here, but you will find awesome deals. My wife came here to find some fabric, and she bought several yards for a quarter of the price that she normally buys it at. When you ask them how much something costs, they'll just toss a random number at you. The first time we just started walking away. The owner started lowering his prices right away - we just kept walking. He kept lowering it until he got it low enough to what we wanted. Other times we would give them a really low number, and agree to something in between. Most will haggle with you. If someone doesn't budge, just leave. There are other places with the same stuff that will give you a great deal.The fashion district is a lot of fun to come and check out. It is a little dirty and has a somewhat third-world feel. That's all part of the fun. If you have time, or want to get great deals on jewerly, fabric, luggage, drapes, or clothes, come here and have some fun.Tips:1) Stay off 6th avenue. I found 9th avenue less crowded. 2) BRING CASH -- do not use credit/debit cards. 3) If you don't mind paying a little more for parking, the $10/day parking feels safer and is easier. 4) The smaller shops will haggle. The bigger, fancier stores will not, but they still have the exact same stuff. 5) Keep an open mind and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AceonW

40,A diamond in the rough,"LA Fashion district is huge! Yes, take your bottled water, your comfortable shoes,and CASH. Don't settle on a good price - it should be exceptional. Thus, know your prices because the business people sure do. They can tell if you have money or not because they watch (or have watchers) you buying at other stalls. Yes, some things are over the top (i.e. too fancy for moderate tastes) and much is repeat items in other stalls, so, if you have a bad memory, bring your notepad, note what stall number it was (some have no numbers) so try to remember where you last saw the item and go back and haggle stating that you saw the item cheaper at stall.....down on Santee Alley or whatever position. This is a cash market. All these stall holders are a community! They will try to brow beat you into a ""good"" price but, what is good for them is not necessarily good for you the bargin hunter. So, firstly shop in regular shops, remember the prices (and quality) and then go to the alleys and do the bargining. Food is very much 4 out of 10 and it is nearly impossible to find a toilet. So, if you need to use one, make sure you know where they are - and what standard they are. Toilet cleanliness 3 out of 10. Last comment is that it is a must to visit the fashion district of LA.

30,if you want a deal,"then you gotta check out the alleys! i mean you will not find the high-end designer things, but you'll come close. Bring cash! Try the bacon wrapped hot dogs, and the corn and mayo. Recommend you do not bring big purses, pack light.Now the last Friday of every month, the California Mart (on 9th and Los Angeles Street) holds a sample sale open to the public. You get to go into the designer showrooms and purchase their samples for a great price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinadiggydoll
30,Good for people who need fabric,One of my friends recently came to LA to buy fabric for dance costumes. This isn't my thing but I know she found a ton of great fabrics and what she said was a very reasonable price. There is a lot of duplication but very unique fabrics. You can ALWAYS negotiate a better price so don't take the first offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktmonster

40,Busy and bustling,"Wow, there is so much going on at this place. Make sure you carry cash because a lot of the vendors do not take CCs. Also, if you have any collapsible bags, bring them. The vendors use a lot of plastic bags which is terrible for the environment. If you are in need of a ball gown, prom dress, or sweet 16 dress, this is the place to go. I'm sure there is no other place on this planet that sells such a large variety of formal gowns. Unfortunately, some of the vendors do not allow the customers to try on the dresses. I think that is ridiculous.The vendors at the fashion district are located near Santee Alley. They also sell shoes, jewelry, venetian masks, toys, and accessories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Rabbit

50,OMG....WOW,"WOW, if you love to shop and get great deals, do not miss the Fashion District. There were lots of great deals and lots of shops that you get so confused with what to actually get. As a prior reviewer says, DO TAKE CASH because it helps a lot and it is really convenient in shopping. Feel free to haggle (especially if there is no price tag on the merchandise). Parking was extremely reasonable. If you think this is a quick stop, think again. I am blessed with a patient husband, so ladies if you have an inpatient person with you, leave them at home :-) because I was there for a total of 8 hours in the two days I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NnanyeluE

40,Santee Alley - great for locals and tourists,"I've lived in LA for many years, and work 1/2 mile from the Fashion District, but only recently visited here. I took my two teenage daughters and, wow, did we have fun. Santee Alley is, in my opinion, the main reason to visit the Fashion District. Its multitude of shops, variety of goods, and decent prices makes for some great shopping. Depending on what you're looking for, you might not make your purchase at the first shop you visit. It's likely that another shop will have the same item and you might be able to negotiate a better price.While downtown LA is getting safer, I strongly recommend getting there early and leaving well before dark. If you do that you won't have a problem. Wear comfortable shoes, bring cash, and don't expect to easily find a restroom. Also, avoid the street hot dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkyLordHeuksa
30,Bead lovers? Hightail it to 8th and Maple in the LA Fashion District,"Be prepared for endless shops, huge shops, millions of items, and so many beads and findings. There are other places along the way to buy beads, but the main bead shops are concentrated just near the Flower District at Maple and 8th.We walked from the 7th Street Metro, but you can take a DASH bus. There is also a parking lot nearby if you are driving.Take along your business license or retail tax number so that you can buy wholesale and not be charged taxes (if you are from out of country). The merchants are very good about honoring your business status.Bring a backpack or be prepared to carry lots of bags. You will shop till you drop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hadassh28

30,Santee Alley - Not to be missed,"After reading several reviews I was a bit skeptical as to whether I should go there or not and I am so glad I went on my gut feeling. I drove there ALONE and while the neighborhood is not beverly hills it's not the worse hood I've seen. Like with any place you travel to you should always be aware of your surroundings, park close by (don't try to save $5 and park 5 blocks away), watch your purse - same as you would at any mall. DO TAKE CASH it's the only way to shop here and you can haggle prices if you have cash. I bought lots of Hello Kitty stuff for my daughter, tons of hair accessories for 99 cents and up to $5 that normally sell for lots more at the stores, there are alot of shoe stores as well as clothing stores. DO NOT EXPECT TO BUY REAL JIMMY CHOOS here for $20 if that's what you are looking for go elsewhere this is not the place. This is a fun place to shop for normal items, skinny jeans that are not name brand, imitation shoes, designer knock off purses (if you like them) etc...Didn't eat anything there although many reviews advise not to leave there without eating a Santee Alley Dog, unfortunately I didn't get to that. FYI... the knock off designer bag sellers are usually in the corners and will approach you or tell you in a very low voice that they have them. They will take you to some parking garage close by for you to see what they have in their trunks. Again, if you are alone, I would not recommend this. I wouldn't even recommend it if it's two people. We were a group of 6 girls so we were not worried. Do enjoy yourself, it's the whole purpose of this ""adventure"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/made1024
40,Good bargains at street vendors,"Even though it was raining, we enjoyed finding bargains and having lunch at a small Mexican/ Korean restaurant. I only bought 2 items - a Guess jeans jacket for $5 and a cute top for $7. My new friend got 6-7 bags of clothing and spent $200 or more in about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitnesswla
40,"Overwhelming, exciting experience","Los Callejones! I had been hearing of this place for about a week straight, so we were excited for this shopping experience that our friends were telling us about. Wow, I will say its absolutely amazing and overwhelming! Saturday was probably not a good day to go there were hundreds, maybe thousands crowding the streets and shops. If you take kids, hang on to them tight! It reminded me of small shopping towns in Mexico but with more people. Sure you might find a bargain from clothing, soveniers, fabric, home decorating, you name it, but I wasnt impressed with the prices. I wanted to purchase a Disney T-shirt with jeans set for a 4 yr old, but could see paying $32 for it, I wanted a bargain. My husband was able to get some nice dress shoes, 2 pair for $25, they started at $40. And dont be fooled by all the mexicans working their, the shops are owned by the asians, which I have no problem with either, I myself am a minority. For the experience to say you went, then do it, for the bargains, not so much. Although we had some awesome mexican Hotdogs sold by a street vendor, the smell alone makes your mouth water, they were fresh and delicious anywhere from $4-$6 per hotdog depending on what you want on them. One last tip, try to avoid the weekends, parking and driving was chaotic, plus the hoards of people shopping, and no bathrooms that were decent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TND9350
50,Love it,Been going for years. Santee alley is where we always go. It is about 7 blocks long maybe longer..just dont think anything you buy here is authentic. They sell alot of knock off makeup. Like mac mostly. They are super cheap on most stuff. I love the $7 sandals and endless $1 accessories. My boyfriend goes.for the $25 new era hats and the $5 sunglasses. Which are awesome by the way!! The only down fall is the ghetto alley and surrounding area. Like super dirty. But its a must see if your in la. Me and my boyfriend love it so much were going back asap! Stop by its worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Solushy
40,Great shopping - leave your husband behind,"It is a must see, a full day outing if you have the time. They sell just about everything, shoes, jewellery, wonderful clothes, and it is so colourful. I agree with the other writers that there are plenty of food places and we chose to eat at a hispanic style diner.. we guessed the food was going to be good because the place was full of mexicans (and it was good). I did not feel unsafe at all, and I loved the atmosphere. If I lived in LA I would visit often. If you are a shopper leave your husband behind and soak up the bargains and the environment. Yes take plenty of money if you want to buy up big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auzzigirls

40,A Mandatory Stop on Every LA Vacation,"Personally I love the area, love the shopping, and even love the walking. Yes, it is more like a flea market, so don't look for name brand clothing (at least real name brand clothing), but there are still a lot of nice things. My only advice is to make sure that you don't rush to purchase something you want. Chances are you will find a store a block down the street that has EXACTLY what you are looking for at a cheaper price. Happens every time. We will definitely go back today before we leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanelOnTheGo
50,I have gone to the garment district for over 20 years,"The garment district used to be the be all and end all place over 10 years ago. It was a generous whole sale place where the owners who sold their knock offs and clothing at a discount wanted your business. It was fun and ethnic, meaning, you could eat reasonably prices fresh fruit and corn on the cob from Spanish speaking vendors.Now, the garment district has turned into a crowded hell hole. If you don't look Hispanic or speak Spanish, they will jack up the price another 10 dollars thinking you don't know the game. Its turned into a place of B.S. where some vendors, not all, insult your intelligence and discriminate.I can get better quality clothes at the Citadel Outlet off of the 5 Freeway for the same pricing as the Los Angeles Garment district, and better quality, too. I refuse to go down there anymore. Its just plain flea market trash and the glory days of the garment district are now over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mofiffy
40,had a fun afternoon,"My sister and I travelled all the way from New Zealand to LA and only had one 'spare' day left for shopping after all the 'must do's' were out of the way. It was a toss up between Santee Alley and the Citadel outlet... based on advice sought on these forums, I chose Santee.Just so happened our only day left was a Sunday, which of all the shops in LA Fashion Distrist, only 30% was predicted to be opened. Oh well, we went anyway hoping for the best. I would say those 30% opened are those in Santee Alley.....which is the only place we were making a beeline for anyway!We had a blast going through all the shops, yes it gets repetitive after a little while (probably all the same stockist?) but for cheap sunnies you can't go wrong - 4 for $20!! I also bough a few summer dresses and perfumes. Was very happy at my purchases! I did not find any of the sellers pushy at all (not like Tijuana), of course they tried to sell you stuff, but if you decline they did not pursue you either.We went during a very hot day in July - make sure you bring water or you will get dehydrated. We lasted a total of 6 hrs before we felt it was too much for us.Overall a great day out, do it if you're looking for cheap deals and like the marketplace atmosphere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m1che
20,Swap Meet-esque,"We decided to check out the swap meet, I mean Fashion District, in downtown LA. We found Santee Alley and it was pretty much all the same made in China stuff from booth to booth. I was hoping to find a knock-off Louis Vuitton bag, but didn't find much (the counterfeit police must really crack down on the fashion district). It was fun to look around and people watch, but I wouldn't make a day trip out of it, unless you research it and know where you want to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lojo89
50,Shop till you drop!!!!,"Forget Beverly Hills Center or The Grove, this is LA's best shopping location. But make sure to go on a weekday if you can, cause some of the stores are closed on weekends.The main section of this district is at the cross section of Maple and 12th. There's a strip called The Alley, which is basically an alley that stretches 5 blocks and is flanked by shop after shop offering the same types of fashion you find in the malls at much, much cheaper prices.You can even find some great brand name knock-off sunglasses for $5 and purses for $20-40. Cheap electronic stuff too.Highly recommended for a productive and fun shopping experience.Oh, and try a bacon wrapped hot-dog at one of several surprisingly clean vendors. They are to die for!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelPoo
10,It's a flee market,"Did I miss something? I was sorely disappointed. It's a flee market with repetition of junkly goods. I was looking for name brands sale. Besides, those items don't begin to compare with those sold in New York. I guess I'm spoiled",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Be4Real
40,Vibrant and fun day of shopping,"Just this weekend the wife and I took our two children down to the Garment District for a fun day of shopping. We have done it on several occassions and always have a fun time. THIS IS NOT THE ATTRACTION for anyone that is meak, unconfortable with crowds, strangers and afraid to negotiate. The best area and the one that is the most crowded is the area surrounding Santee Alley (Between 10th and 12th and on Olympic).This place is full of low priced clothes, designer knockoffs, and some of the best bargins I've ever seen. The best deals seem to be on women's shoes (between $5 to $20), cell phone accessories at half of retail, fashion jewerly, and packages of tshirts and socks at about 20% of what you pay in the store. A lot of people also like the knockoff Gucci, Prada, Kate Spade and Fendi purses, wallets and sunglasses.Things to avoid buying are: (1) the sunglasses as they are often terrible quality; (2) the $5 DVDs copys of newly relesed movies; and (3) the turtles, birds and other pets (as the turtles go they are illegal at the size that they sell them and the other animals are often sick or diseased). Also beware of your surroundings, I only say this because it is very crowded and I have heard of pick-pocketing in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekld
50,A Good Place To Shop,"I have shopped at the Garment District since my kids were small. The Garment District have saved me A LOT of money on clothes, shoes, purses, toys and etc. My children are grown now and they love shopping downtown Los Angeles as well . I still love to shop downtown even though I have moved from the Los Angeles area. I live 77 miles from Los Angeles now.We have started many friends shopping at the Garment District and they too like shopping there.My EX-husband said he went downtown to the Garment District just to see for himself after we broke up and was astonished of the prices he found downtown and gave me an apology because he could not understand how I managed to have so much merchandise off of so little money when we were together.But he found out for himself that things were at a reasonable price and he sometimes shop downtown as well now even though we are no longer together.Not only do I like the discount prices on most things, I like being around the different cultures as well. I also like being able to get things that are different from others like clothes, house decor, shoes, tee shirts etc. There are some places that have Plus sizes also.Too, a good thing is if an store owner or his/her staff see you coming back to their store and learn what you like they will save things for you that you may be interested in purchasing.Finding good bathrooms and good places to eat is beginning to change some now. That was a problem.At anycase, The Garment District is really a good place to get good deals. I wish I could shop there more often. Infact, my daughter and I will be visiting the Garment District real soon.We catch the Metro Link and spend a day shopping downtown when we do shop and come back home on the MetroLink.If you are going to take your children PLEASE hold on to them and monitor them at all times because the streets can be quite one moment and without warning jam pack with people. Plus, there are so many things there that can attract a childs attention.I hope if you go you will enjoy yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pckn
50,Shopping with a difference,"I wish I had been able to spend more time in the LA Fashion District. It was a real kick. As it was, we wandered the 90-block area for the better part of a day and went back the next day. I wish I had requested the map well in advance of visiting. It was in my stack of mail when I returned home. They have a map online but it isn’t printable and it is really small on the screen. We walked into the area from our hotel. We first found the Los Angeles Flower Market and paid the small entrance fee to wander the world of wholesale flowers. We returned the next day with the car so we could load up. We then wandered into the Men’s wear area but as my husband didn’t need a new suit we passed on. We repeatedly encountered people with black plastic “trash” bags, which I found strange. Drawn by the incredible activity we ended up in Santee Alley. I grabbed a few designer replica bags and enjoyed the bustle. Now, I had my own black plastic bag to drag home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EatSantaBarbarian
40,Can't miss Santee Alley!,"My husband and I visited the Garment District for the first time a couple of months ago and what a trip! Too bad I had a bum knee, otherwise we would have been there for days....and days...and days....Although I am Latina and the majority of the shoppers and sellers were Latino, I suspect that the reason I saw few non-Latinos shoppers was that they might be intimdated by language, safety, parking, knowledge. I feel sorry for them,they missed out on a grand adventure, appropriate for all. There were families with children, old people, young people of all colors and bargains to last until the end of time. We spent most of our time in ~Santee Alley~(just ask, someone will point you there) but there are keys things to remember:1. Wear good walking shoes and if you have a rolling cart, mini shopping basket or stroller, bring it to carry all your goodies back home.2. Arrive about an hour before everything opens (9am) to get a good parking space one of the rooftop parking lots.3. We brought a small cooler filled with frozen bottles of water and it saved our lives!4. Bring lots of cash, small bills and don't be afraid to ask if that is the best price they can give you.5. I pass on the ""alley dogs"", they look good but oy!!6. Be prepared to spend, spend, spend!7. Don't be afraid to wander outside the garment district, after we got in our car and left the parking lot, we noticed that only two or three blocks away there was the Fabric District(bolts and bolts of fabric, buttons, laces, zippers, beads) the Flower District and the Jewlery District. By that time my feet has begun to swell sitting in the car and no way was I going to get out and walk again!8. Watch your back and watch your stuff. Most folks are very nice and very helpful but becareful......9. HAVE FUN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pioneer34415

I just can't help myself. It's really FUN",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving34349
40,cheap way of shopping,"If your looking for cheap prices the garment district is the place to be.I take my wife there often.It seems better to buy from dealers who have racks and stands outside they drop there prices down to something so cheap you are wondering if they are making a profit. From what i hear if you get there before 12 in the afternoon thats where you can get name brand clothing in bulk meaning if you buy 10 at a time are something like that but we got there after that and if your like me you dont need 10 of the same shirt. It is a place of endless amounts of little dealers working out of holes in the wall place's. You cant show too late by 200 o clock afternoon there closing up and calling it a day you get mostly kids clothes and womens clothes really cheap, but in my experience mens clothes are a bit higher. I couldn't even see all the stores if i wanted to there is a main street for these seller's, i cant remeber the name but you will know it when you see it it has good deals on that street womens pants for 7$ nice dress up shirts for women 3 for $10.00. What you need to do is get to the back streets and thats the deals. you should park where you can remember and bring something to drink, they do have places and little mexican resteruants hidden away but this place is so big theres no gaurantee that you will find them there is indoor type pavillions with clothhing. Just one caution they do have name brans clothes for cheap but if the the price is too cheap for something you know cost a lot it is a fake but i dont care if you dont. stay away from the waches and jewrly there poor quality. I also think you should not make any dealer charge tax they dont usaully but if they do there taking advantage of you most prices are nogotiable so if you dont feel like haggling then just ask for no tax most dealers will do it to save the time are because there scared of loosing a costumer. p.s. why your there enjoy hollywood its a short drive and its kind of cool to walk around and get something to eat. if there is anybody that knng in la please email me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventurer27960
