50,"If you love Laurel and Hardy, you must go","Yes, this is really just for fans but it's great to see where such an iconic scene was filmed. Walking the stairs was a great experience. Be careful with Google's directions, they send you about 3 blocks from the actual stairs. They are marked at both the top and bottom. Street parking is free if you can find it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1187HBlisag
50,If You Love Laurel and Hardy; You Must Walk These Steps,I love old comedies and The Music Box is a classic Laurel and Hardy short film. I recommend you watch the film on YouTube before going. It is a safe area and easy to find. Walk up and then down again. This should be a part of any trip to Hollywood...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y654TAmarkw
50,Standing the test of time for 85 years,For all L& H fans this is a must visit. Located in a resedential area it was difficult to park but slot found. Heart sank on reaching the steps as the street sign had been subject to graffitti and the plaque commemorating was suffering from wear. The steps are now shoe horned between two housing areas but still have that magic feel as though L&H had just pushed that piano up them. Needs some tlc but worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neil-1138
30,For Fans Only Really,I'm not a big fan of Laurel & Hardy but I was in neighborhood and thought I'd check this little part of Hollywood history out. I was lucky to snag a parking spot nearby. There's a tiny little plague commemorating the film that was shot here on one of the first steps going up. After that it's just walking up some slightly narrow steps. Half way up I passed some kids rolling a joint. I'll be honest as far as exercise goes it's not a bad workout if you were to go up and down these steps a few times. If you're a fan of Laurel & Hardy it's definitely something worth checking out. Otherwise you're not missing much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Not just a Staircase,"The Music Box steps are in a lovely secluded area in Silverlake. Parking can be tricky, and make sure to pay close attention to the signs.

40,"If you're a fan of the Oscar-winning short film, you must do this!",This was my first visit to the famed Music Box Steps. We began a 3.5 mile circle walk incorporating many of Silver Lake's staircases from here. Free street parking. Just a block from Sunset. Do the walk and then get a meal or drinks on Sunset to round out a great date activity!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saranger
50,Pilgrimage,What can i say? It is an honour to visit these iconic steps. Take some old stills from the film with you and you can recognise all the points. It is obviously a bit more built up since the film but mostly the same. Not too tricky to find. We also visited the house where A Perfect Day was filmed and it has hardly changed. We also payed our respects at both Stan and Olivers' graves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blahdeblah
40,"If your a fan of Laurel and Hardy, then you'll love this!","I recommend that you watch the episode right before you visit, you're gonna be blow away at how much has changed! Everything in the in the TV show looks huge, but now everything is squeezed in tight, but those stairs are still there, looking just like they did when they filmed the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793halm
