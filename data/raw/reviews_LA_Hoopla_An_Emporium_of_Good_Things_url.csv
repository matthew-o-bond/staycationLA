50,Lovely store for locally sourced gifts.,"I have a mailbox here, and Lori or Scott always lets me know when a package has arrived. I also like the unique cards, gifts and Altadena centric artwork, but really motivated me to write this is I have finally found a good chamomile tea. Sleeping Beauty Herbal tea is a blend of chamomile flowers, rose, lavender and lemon and is truly a lovely brew.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qwertynmm

50,"Eclectic, eccentric, extraordinary!","I love walking into a shop that is stocked with items the owners love. Hoopla! Emporium is one of those delicious little boutiques that is jam-packed with carefully chosen surprises in every nook and cranny. Every time I step through the door, I marvel at the variety and number of items Lori and Scott are able to fit into this tiny store: fairy gardens, crystals, jewelry, books, teas, jams, toys, stuffed animals, soaps, cards, fine writing instruments, textiles, and of course seasonal items. It's a wonderful place to pick up unusual gifts.While most of their products are crafted by artisans, many local, I think Hoopla! must be the foremost purveyor of items created by Altadenans. It's the only place I know of where one can buy merchandise year-round that promotes and helps fund Christmas Tree Lane, the oldest large-scale outdoor lighting display in the US. Scott and Lori treat their customers like family, and it's always pleasant to spend time in their shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spinymountain
50,Best Gift Store for the Area,Hoopla has many specific gifts about Altadena and from Altadenean vendors and artists. The store is lovely inside sporting a closely knit array of fabulous gifts and cards. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729debh
