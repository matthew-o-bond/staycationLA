30,Good for the enthusiast!,"Great for group events, Bucks parties, and birthdays! The fields are large and varied! No real areas to watch people battling against one another. Common areas need an update.",Dean E
40,Paint balling with Reaper,"I had a great time paintballing at Hollywood Sports Paintball Park with David Reaper Justin. It is located in Belflower, California. They have a lot of fields too. The only reason I’m not giving this place 5 stars is because there were 2 Hispanic middle aged paintballers there that got in my face both on the field and then when I was back at my gear bag getting ready for the next game. They were upset that I shot there sons instead of asking them if they surrender. I would have gladly offered an opportunity for them to surrender had they not been trying to shoot me at the time. You can’t ask someone if they surrender if they are shooting at you still. Otherwise you might as well find a new sport. It’s like Kobe Bryant about to score a buzzer beater to win the game, but instead he asks the defense if the surrender.",Jonny Vegas
30,Birthday Fun,"When my 11 year old son wanted to have a paintball party and I decided to host his birthday party at Hollywood sports park. He and his friends had a great time and the total cost was reasonable. It was a major disappointment when the park employees turned off the air compressor 30 minutes before the party ended and many guests couldn't finish the games because they no longer had air in their guns. So I don't recommend selecting a time close to closing time. There were also no lights while the kids were eating.If planning to throw a party there be sure to ask to reserve tables, this was not offered to me but friends since have been able to do so. The park could use a deep clean but it is better than the one in Corona. If throwing a party, I recommend bringing wipes, hand sanitizer, and disposable tablecloths. I was able to bring in my own food, ice chest with drinks, and they refrigerated the birthday cake. There is a snack bar on site and the food was pretty decent-- no diet drinks available. We opted to rent the vests and coveralls which was extra, not included in the party package but worth it so the kids could carry extra paintballs and water bottle. I also recommend wearing old shoes. Bring sanitizing wipes for masks.",Anna S
50,Disneyland for Paintball & Airsoft,"I've played paintball since the original Splatmaster days.I love the game, but it can be impossible the find the time to travelall the way out to the unincorporatedareas where the fields are safe and legal.Enter Hollywood Sports.A golf complex in the Los Angeles City area- Bellflower, to be exact-that has been transformed using large scale movie props and vehicles, along with lots of structurebuilding and space planning, to create a paradise for both paintersand softies.Several scenarios are available froman Old West village to an Alien Wasteland, along with full serviceand we'll-stocked rental facilities,pro shop, shooting range, video rules theater, group staging areas with lockers, tablet check-in . . .It's all here, within 30 minutes of where most Angelenos live or work.The staff and referees keep it easy,fun, and safe.The minor deficits are occasionallines waiting to pay, and a well wornfeel to the paintball facilities. New to the game, or veteran,You'll love this place.Everybody I've brought here, has.",Trent W
30,Amazing complex for paintballing - but needs a serious cleaning & remodel,"The complex for paint balling and airsoft is large and quite impressive. Several huge areas to paint ball with cement walls, cars, and buses to hide behind for a true feeling of combat.Many of the attendees are young adult males to middle age males, which you can tell have invested heavily into the sport and come regularly.We came to the Hollywood Sports for a 8 year old birthday party. For most of the kids, this was their 1st time paintballing. They offer a lite option to minimize the pain of being hit - which I can attest to worked as none of the kids came out crying.To get the party started, it took about 1 hour before they even got on the field.Training video, equipment was all part of the set up.The kids were guided to several different fields to find amongst the birthday party group. The amount of paintballs that were given was limited, and cost additional to have enough paint balls. So this was something the kids were bummed about at the end when they ran out of paint. Prepare to spend an extra $50 + for more paint balls as the birthday party offer does not provide enough.The party had an air conditioned private room, which was nice.The whole entire complex needs cleaning and fresh paint. I would not have a birthday party there due to the dirty and trashy feel - but it if was cleaner and remodeled then I would definitely consider it.Recommend the kids where long sleeves and pants. THey are given head gear, gun, and some paint balls.The old the kids the better this location is for a party or group of boys.If you are just there to view, there is not a good viewing area. So this was a disappointment as I was hoping to see the paintball wars.",ALinCA5512
