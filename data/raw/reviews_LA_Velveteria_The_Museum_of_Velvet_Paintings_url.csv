50,Go see it!!,Carl was super friendly and full of great stories. There were so many eclectic paintings with interesting comments and set ups. Very worth checking out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77shanas
50,"Strange, fun place!",This little hole in the wall museum has creative art and a very entertaining host. This looks like a collection/hobby that he is personally sharing with you. Be sure to check out the art in the bathroom (photo below). It’s well worth the $10 cash admission charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkeucla
50,"Great fun, had a blast!","My sister and I visited this museum today, and we thought it was amazing. It was kitschy and fun, and anyone who wrote a review complaining about the owner hanging around is missing the whole point. He is a part of the story for each painting, and without the information he shared, it would have been so much less interesting. We had lots of laughs, too. I had been wanting to see this place for a long time, and it did not disappoint. If you grew up in the 60s and 70, you will especially appreciate many of the subjects. Worth every penny of the $10 admission. Thank you, Carl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jyunllc
30,"cheesy fun, interesting collection, ANNOYING proprietor","A visit to the Velveteria **SHOULD** be a fun, cheesy, schlocky experience, considering that the proprietor owns more than 3,000 velvet paintings for his collection. (These are swapped in/out periodically, to keep the museum fresh for subsequent visits.) The place is relatively small, consisting of a small entryway, one large main display room, one black light room, one small side room, and more paintings in their restroom; but all walls and floor space are FULL of these paintings. Some are truly beautiful; some are silly; some are merely average in quality. Together, they make for quite an impressive and enjoyable collection to visit.What was NOT enjoyable, however, was our experience with the proprietor, who believes that no customer can be left alone even for 10 seconds to walk around the museum/displays to enjoy the paintings at his/her own leisure. The proprietor talks enthusiastically and knowledgeably about everything he owns, but alas, hovers on top of visitors the entire time they're there. Quite literally, my partner and I did not have one minute to ourselves to discuss anything we were seeing.A note to the proprietor: Instead of hovering over and smothering your customers, as you do, it would be MUCH better to give a quick 5-10 minute overview of the place when people enter, explain to them that you have knowledge and stories about each and every one of your paintings, and warmly welcome people to ask you any questions they may have. That would have made our experience at Velveteria so, so, SO much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187hughk
10,Don’t waste money,"First, I’ll tell you up front I didn’t get past the lobby, which looked like a bad garage sale. When I was told $10 each to go into this dirty makeshift space, I walked away while the man working by lounging on the couch yelled “Loser” at me. That is what caused me to write this. Certainly there are better ways to spend money in Chinatown, which is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zootarts
50,A Must Visit,When in town I would truly recommend the Velveteria it is a great place! Carl had a story for the paintings on black velvet. There is a room with the black light showing off the art. It was amazing to see such detailed work by hand! $10.00 admission was worth it! There are events that go one so keep an eye out!Thanks Carl!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711norman
50,This was awesome!,"I must preface my review by saying that if music wasn't considered an art, I would have absolutely no interest in art whatsoever. None. That is, until I went here.I was staying around the corner, read the TripAdvisor reviews and knew it was something I'd have to check out during my stay. There is a LOT to do in LA, but so much is hype, super-expensive, or downright cliche. This place is none of those.I had 'budgeted' an hour, ended up spending two and could have stayed longer (lucky for Carl I didn't). This place may not appeal to everyone, certainly snobs, perhaps those with 'art school degrees', or other made-up credentials. It certainly resonated with me, and the owner - Carl - made it worth the price of admission for the stories, the history alone, even if I'd never even seen a painting. And, there are many. And, they are fantastic.I'm still not certain how it works with the 'personal' tour, i.e. if you show up and then 20 minutes later a group shows up, are you on your own? There were already people in the museum when I showed up but I basically had the owner's undivided attention and it was priceless. Each painting has a story, and honestly the more you know about pop culture, the more you will appreciate the paintings and what Carl has to offer. You can just walk in - cold - and the art is great on its own, but to fully appreciate this experience you might have to be 'middle-aged'. Or older.If it wasn't velvet - was canvas - this would simply be another LA gallery, probably not a museum. But this medium is increasingly rare, evokes many memories of Tijuana, cheesy motel rooms...and those are all good.Be forewarned: The owner knows his stuff! He's lived and breathed every minute of it, don't waste his time. As much as he is highly entertaining, he's also a fountain of knowledge. I'd go back just to spend more time talking to him...It's an all-ages thing but honestly, leave the little ones at home if for no other reason than you will enjoy this experience all that much more, get the real 'inside-scoop', experience all the rooms as they were intended...And, it's only TEN BUCKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
40,DO NOT MISS THIS,Its 'out of the way but not hard to find. It was closed but a sign on the door gave a number to call. We did and went to lunch and returned and Carl was there as promised. It is not much to look at from the outside but DO go in. Carl was a great tour guide and had some great stories to tell about his collection he has collected for almost 20 years. He allows photos and will let you browse on your own if you want. Allow at least 1 hour to look around. You have never seen so many velvet paintings in one place before. Many are autographed and Carl will share his story as to how he had them signed. Many unique 1 of a kind. It's worth the time and 10 bucks to stop in. Help a small business owner survive by visiting and telling your friends. We will for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler225
50,GREAT MUSEUM - Definitely worth it!,"This is a really great museum located in a very unconventional place - don't be scared off by the fish market next door! Carl, the guy who runs the place, is a RIOT. Ask him any velvet painting question you've always had, but were too afraid to ask: the man has answers. It's $10 for admission (cards accepted) and you can take pics inside.Also - don't be afraid if you get there and no one's there. Carl is the only one runnin' the joint, so there's a phone number on the door that you can call to let him know you're there to let you in. We called a couple times, but he finally came back to the museum after about 5 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsleos
50,Off the beaten path,"Unlike any museum visit you'll ever have. Definitely worth the $10 entry fee. Carl, the curator, was warm, gracious with his time, and full of interesting stories. If you're downtown and looking for something off the beaten path, check this out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traviss167
50,A hidden gem,Just go- it feels a bit shady when you first walk in but it's worth the entrance fee to explore all of the surprises in this unique museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F274JVerinl
50,The best thing in LA so far!,"Hilarious, amazing, interesting - the owner Carl shows you around and the paintings are just incredible, ranging from very kitsch to very well painted, loads of famous faces, as well as unicorns and Frank Zappa on the toilet. So bizarre! If it seems to be shut you phone the number on the front door and Carl who lives nearby will pop over and open up for you. It's a must see, it's unique in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JinnyJones1982232a
40,Quirky and fun but not in a great neighborhood and I would go with someone,"I loved this place. Really quirky!!! Not fancy and not really a true museum but two large rooms and some extra hallways in the back. Has seen better days and really more of a storefront. The owner has put his heart and soul in to the place and the work on the velvet is excellent. Also quirky and even a bit odd at times but the place is put together with love. He does seem like someone who had a good time in the late 60's and 70's. In Chinatown and I would not go alone. I just as a woman would not feel comfortable by myself. I was with my son. However, I just loved it and my son who was not excited to go, loved how passionate the guy was! It did cost $15, but I thought it was worth it. I really like quirky places so I very much enjoyed it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink
40,"Funky Art, Tour by Carl","I read about this ""Art Museum"" in AAA Guidebook and was curious. This turned out to be a fun little place on the edge of L.A.'s Chinatown. When I was a kid (1950's & 1960's) I saw painted glow in the dark velvet art sold for cheap at street corners and at flea markets. Carl, the guide and proprietor has been a collector for many years and is totally engaged in this art form. For $10, he provides a guided tour of his museum including engaging stories of the pieces, his guests, and his travels. Consists of 3+ rooms and a portion of his 2,500+ work collection. Definitely off the normal and memorable. Best suited for adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5026OSjohng
50,Kitschy fun for the adventurous traveler.,"On the outskirts of Chinatown lies a store front museum that is not to be missed. For $10 you can enjoy a vast collection of vintage velvet paintings. There are classic Polynesian girls, big eyed children and crying Elvis as expected. There are also quite a few new works featuring Martha Stewart, Oprah, and Anderson Cooper in a thong. The owner is very friendly and happy to tell you all about the different works.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean92802
40,Makes you want to start collecting Velvet Paintings!,"Small, packed, fun museum. The curator, Carl, has amazing stories for each exhibit. You might have forgotten this lost art, but you are quickly reminded how wonderful and fun this aesthetic can be. Swing by and support this very unique place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynebC1491WV
40,Quirky. A Fun Stop.,"I had read a review about the velvet painting museum in the LA Times a few months back. It had made an impression so my friend and I decided to stop in this self-made museum located in the middle of Chinatown. The entrance fee is $10. The owner Carl is super enthusiastic about his collection and is a wealth of knowledge on the history velvet painting. If you take the time to listen to him you will learn a lot. Much of the space is filled with quirky and humorous paintings, many made by artists living in Tijuana. However he has many paintings made by artists in the 20s and 30s that lived in Tahiti and other locals?.and some of these are actually quite exquisite. I say take an hour and have some fun looking and listening. And don't miss the bathroom. It is filled velvet paintings with...all sorts of people and animals painted on toilets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Who Can Pass Up a Museum of Black Velvet Paintings?,"This museum is a must see for your friends who seek out the 'odd and unusual' roadside attractions of Los Angeles.Crammed into a tiny space one block off the main road running through LA's Chinatown, it's chock full of, yes, paintings on black velvet. The place raises this artistic phenomenon to an entirely new plane.Hand over $10 (look, they need support, ok?), and you can browse on your own in a handful of tiny rooms chock full of velvet paintings. Some of the rooms are themed (think Elvis, nudes (adults only, please), black light), and interesting hand written descriptions tell you all you ever wanted to know about black velvet paintings.It's fun, it's cute, quirky, and worth a detour. The owner/s are often there, will share their insight and knowledge with you, and talk about how they got into this crazy idea in the first place! Caren Anderson and Carol Baldwin have over 3,000 paintings, and about 450 are displaced at any time.In addition, there are special smaller exhibits that are worth notice, usually closer to the floor, such as a unique Unicorn Birthing Center and a special shrine to ""Dog, The Bounty Hunter"".By the way, this little gem is just 2 blocks from Phillipe the Original birthplace of the French dipped sandwich), in the center of Chinatown, and near Olvera Street and Union Station.....so you can make a day of it if you wish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoBe
50,"Funky, Offbeat, Eccentric Fun","If you're visiting and want something different and non-touristy to do, or if you're a local who has yet to venture downtown, this is a great place to start. This funky little Chinatown storefront is run by a down to earth bohemian couple who sincerely love the art of velvet painting. It's tongue in cheek and serious at the same time. You can find the traditional clowns, poodles, hula girls and Elvises, but also Howard Stern, military men, Barry White, Sammy Davis Jr. as Jesus, Ryan Seacrest as a unicorn, the naked lady room, the backlight room, and Satan tempting you to the darkside, to name just a fabulous few. The collection changes every couple months, and it's always good, whether kitsch or straight forward, most paintings are amazingly well crafted.It's $10, takes about an hour, and when you're done, walk two short blocks to Phillipe the Original for a killer french dip. It's a great couple of hours in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flymonkey
50,You *MUST* visit if you're anywhere close!,"Full disclosure - wife and I absolutely adore the offbeat. For anyone else with the same warped sense of ""art"", this is a must-see! This is hi-camp at it's very finest - an extensive collection of velvet paintings with all the usual suspects, but so so so much more! The Three Stooges on velvet. Liberace. Cal Worthington with his ""dog"" Spot. And scattered among the pictures of dogs playing poker are some pieces that are stunningly beautiful - true works of art! So make a great day of it and visit the Little Jewel of New Orleans (restaurant/sandwich shop around the corner) and have a luscious dessert of amazing creativity at the Velveteria - I promise you won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morris91030
50,Great little spot in Chinatown. Not just kitsch!,"When we walked in, I was a little put off by the $10 fee to see a small room of velvet paintings. What I didn't realize was that there's WAAAAY more behind the curtain. This is a well-curated and fascinating collection of velvet paintings and other related items that was pure entertainment. There's even a room of nudes and black-light paintings, and definitely ask to see the bathroom. (Especially if you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain. I won't say more than that.)The owner was fantastic, and was half the experience. She has great stories, and knows a ton about art history. She can also give great recommendations around the neighborhood... we went back to a place she recommended for dinner, and loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plinkonet
40,Well Worth a Visit,"My host in Los Angeles treated me to a day of off-beat attractions and this was one of our stops. I'll admit that I was not particularly interested in paying $10 to look at kitschy velvet paintings, but I was more than pleasantly surprised by this museum. If you think that velvet painting is just garish renditions of clowns or Elvis, think again. While there were plenty of clown and Elvis paintings in the museum, there were also lovely Tahitian paintings by American artist Edgar Leetag and the painting of a WWII pilot by Louis Behan was amazing in its detail. (Just take a look at the pilot's map!) I was also fascinated by the history of the velvet paintings commissioned by American servicemen in Vietnam for their wives and mothers.One of the owners, Carl Baldwin, was there when we visited and his enthusiasm for velvet painting and its history was boundless. His guided tour of part of the collection was fascinating and gave us a real appreciation of this art form.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longhorn74
