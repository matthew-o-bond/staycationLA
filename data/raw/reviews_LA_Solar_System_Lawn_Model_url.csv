30,Not on the lawn,The model is lines in the pavement showing the orbits of the planets. Good to see as you walk the central path to or from the observatory entrance. The lines don’t continue onto the lawn so can be confusing if you don’t walk the central path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
30,Griffith Observatory feature,"Along with the Astronomers Monument, the Lawn Model is found directly outside the Griffith Observatory. It shows the size of the orbits of the individual planets around the sun and is one of the many other features and things to do whilst visiting the Observatory. Lots of people gather outside on the lawn and steps up to the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
