50,Beautiful afternoon for a walk and sightseeing...,"Did not expect to see so many roses and such a beautiful lawn. I am not sure if this is an automated light, but it is on extremely well maintained grounds. Large trees, shade, plenty of space to walk, parking on the street, a delightful neighborhood to drive through and explore the many homes. Some from the 1930â€™s, some under construction in a very modern look, all with gorgeous views as the go up the hillsides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
50,Beautiful Lighthouse!,"We arrived a few minutes after they opened on a beautiful clear day. The tour was just about to leave but they saw us and waited for us. It is free but at the end we gave a donation. This lighthouse, out of the three I saw on this trip, became my favorite! It's a beautiful lighthouse in a beautiful location!!! I wish I could remember our tour guides name. He was WONDERFUL!!! He was full of knowledge about the lighthouse. The wonderful tour guide and the beauty and history of this lighthouse made it worth it! I believe the tour was about 1.5 to 2 hours. There are steps you have to go up. Highly recommend!!! There is also a small gift shop on sight. I was excited to get my Lighthouse Passport stamped!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745ginaw
50,"Great park with views, picnic tables, bring a lunch!","The lighthouse is part of a lovely park with fabulous views of the ocean and shipping harbor. It would be a great place for a picnic lunch. Many picnic tables, some right by the cliffs. Beautiful trees and a cute small garden around the lighthouse. The lighthouse tour docents are friendly and very interesting, chat with them even if you don't take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307kayk
50,take the tour,"Glenn did a great job of informing and answering questions. Interesting tour where we actually got to go to the top with a great view. Furnishings, clothes, pcitures etc. Contrary to other reviews, we took pictures and Glenn kept kids interested and participating.If you are in the area, free parking and free tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wineanddine32

We had a great guide and very informative tour.....all the way to the top. The view is spectacular. The tour is about an hour and is free but they accept donations, which are well deserved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callan1034
50,Lighthouse Tour,What an impeccably maintained lighthouse! Our docent was Glenn Scoble. We thoroughly enjoyed Glenn! He is so knowledgeable about the lighthouse and the history of the surrounding area. He even chatted with us after the tour. What a beautiful day that we will forever remember!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellec817
30,"Great seeing the inside, but","I enjoy going through Lighthouse, each one is so different. Unlike the round lighthouses this is a Victorian building built in 1874. The first light was a 2,100-candlepower light, in 1898 was replaced with a 6,600-candlepower light which could be seen 22 miles out to sea. The lighthouse can only be seen on tours. Hope you get a little more lively tour guide than what we had. After taking my first picture inside I was told inside pictures were not allowed. I am not quite sure why the furnishings are not much different from other period places where you can take pictures. There is no longer a light in the tower but there is an amazing surrounding view of the coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormKeith
50,"Beautiful Lighthouse, Amazing Docent","This was an adorable, well maintained lighthouse. The docent for the tour - Tennessee- was incredibly informative. She clearly was passionate about the light and its surrounding area. She gave great overview information, and went in-depth when visitors requested more info. Also, lovely views from the lantern room. Small gift shop; tour by donation at set times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hi183987123
50,View to enjoy,"Nice little lighthouse. Check for hours of operations. It was closed when we went. Nice place for photography or just for walking, jogging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanaG31

50,Quaint Lighthouse,"This is a quaint lighthouse which is located in a park with large, lovely trees. Well restored and worth a visit. Restrooms available in the park area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7190HDlisab
50,Incredible Lighthouse,We loved seeing Point Fermin Lighthouse! The tour was awesome. Tours are only 1 pm to 4 pm and are for small groups. You need to be there early so you can get on the list! But so well worth it! Thank you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodis58
50,Excellent Docent!,"Thanks to Polly, our visit to the lighthouse was a hit with our little cub scouts.We had planned this a year ago but were just able to swing it this year and with only 3 in the group able to attend we visited the aquarium, then here. The boys loved it. Polly was GREAT with the boys. She let them look, ask, answer, even gently examine a few items with permission. We found out why only a few are allowed at a time on the tour. The top of the stairs where the light used to be (downstairs now) could be dangerous with several bodies and open stairs. I was proud of our group for minding the rules and being careful and Polly being watchful, but not bossy. The kids really enjoyed her and all the stuff they got to see. It was my first lighthouse that was actually built into a house and we all found it interesting on our first visit here. The boys even loved looking at the vegetables and flowers while we waited for the tour to start. The day was a success!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjsr
50,Point Fermin Lighthouse,"We stumbled upon the Point Fermin Lighthouse whilst filling in a day prior to a cruise from San Pedro. we were actually looking for a restaurant when a couple asked if we had visited the lighthouse - we hadnt heard of it! We were given a tour by a very informative young lady, and thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent. Would recommend a visit to anyone in the area for a couple of days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feline111
50,Nicely restored,My wife loves lighthouses so we had to stop here. Worth the visit. The light house is restored and we had a tour while we were there. You should stop here if you are interested in Historical sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raroboy
50,Beautiful Property / Great Historical Tour,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Point Fermin. The location and ocean views are incredible in the park around the lighthouse.The lighthouse itself is open Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 - 4:00pm with small-group guided tours on the hour.You can imagine that the volunteers here are passionate about the history of the lighthouse - which is as much living quarters and homestead as it is a former light-beacon for ships.Very thorough tour lasting an hour describing the late 1800's structure and the various families and historical keepers of the property. Authentic period furniture throughout the property and obvious phenomenal views from the top of the lighthouse. Beautiful, well-manicured lawns, gardens and flowers around the propertyTour is described as free - but obviously a nice donation should be made at the end of your tour.Small gift-shop / Great Visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveBinkley
30,CLOSED!,"We stopped by this historical lighthouse on a Wednesday afternoon around 3pm and there wasn't a soul to be found and the place was locked up. We were able to read some signage on the history, but was really wanted to see inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Napunani
50,Fantastic tour of a beautifully maintained lighthouse!,This is a beautifully maintained lighthouse built in 1874 in the Victorian Stick Style. It is actually located in San Pedro. Ann Barnett was our tour guide. She is perfectly suited for this job She is fun and funny and knowledgable. She made the tour so fun! The gardens are also beautifully manicured. It was a wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolacabana
40,Very clean and interesting look into history,This well restored building has been converted into a small attraction that shows us how the sailors of old made there way around our coast. On a clear day you get a beautiful view of Catalina Island. Adjacent to a very nice park area it is a great place to unwind. There are a couple of eating place right on the street so you can relax. Parking is free and abundant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
40,GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY TO PHOTOGRAPH,"Fermin Park is great by itself, but add in the Lighthouse and it makes it all that much more special. Great to walk around, photograph from all angles, or just enjoy this piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
40,Unique Lighthouse in Beautiful Setting!,"The Point Fermin Lighthouse is located in Point Fermin Park in San Pedro, California. It is a beautiful area with unobstructed views of the harbor, nearby cliffs and Catalina Island. The lighthouse is unique as it is housed in a lovely three-story home. Tours of the Fermin Lighthouse are free, with donations appreciated. The tour was fascinating and the tour guide was knowledgeable as well as humorous. Point Fermin Lighthouse is unique and interesting. It is well worth a visit if in the San Pedro area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
40,Nice find. Hidden.,"I came here for a weekend music festival and was pleasantly surprised. Nice park, beautiful view of San Pedro and Long Beach harbors. You can even see Catalina Island in the distance. We will return and tour the lighthouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KipColorado
50,great one to start,We have just finished visiting all the Missions along the California coast and where deciding what was next. We settle on Lighthouses. We started with Old Point Lighthouse here in San Diego and that was a good one. But we drive up to the Point Fermin Lighthouse and had a blast. The tour was great and the people who did the tour where full of information and answered all questions. The area it was was of course by the water and plenty to see and do. We took our 10 year old granddaughter and her mom and they enjoyed it also.Great day trip or if you are in the area would recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanDiegoJudi
40,The centerpiece of the park,"On Sunday, my wife and I went to visit the park on our way back to Long Beach. While the park was great, the centerpiece was the lighthouse. I love lighthouses. While they serve the same purpose, they are so unique in how they do it. Most often, like my home town, Pensacola, there is a house next to a separate town the has a light. This is different because it is a house first with a light on top. Positioned at the point closest to the San Pedro harbor, this light was critical to guiding ships away from the rocks and safely to harbor. It is a very interesting design and a great light and house together. Take the time to visit the park, you will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
40,"""So glad we went in.""","We were by the lighthouse for just a few pictures and the view from the point on a wonderful sunny day. Saw we were there in time for their 100 scheduled tour so went inside. Tours are kept to small groups. Our tour was wonderful. Inside furnished with many donated items of the early years. Tour leads through the above ground levels of the building and concludes in the Light Room at the top. Some of the floors are wheelchair accessible, some are not. Tour will last about an hour. Be sure to ask for John, who was our Guide. He is very knowledgeable and encouraged questions, friendly and full of background information. No charge taking the tour but you'll want to leave a nice $$ donation for such a good tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75dave
40,"LA lighthouse, in the park","Nicely maintained light house. Being a labor day weekend parking and getting in and out of the park was tough, but the lighthouse was nice. Worth the trip (not the traffic on holidays or weekends).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umbear
50,So Beautiful,"We had a wonderful experience in San Pedro. The park has lots of big beautiful trees, a great view of the ocean and cliffs plus just up a hill is the Korean Friendship Bell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erlinda2g
50,Love seeing Lighthouses.,"Norman Smith was our tour guide and he was fantastic. He went above and beyond to tell us many details about this lighthouse. He interacted with our 17yr old and even told him about the children that used to live there and how they all lived. Our son found it interesting and learned a lot. We are in the Lighthouse club and enjoyed this tour very much. Its by donation only, but please leave one. Theres always restoration work to be done and we are sure every dime helps. The grounds are very pretty also. Thank you Mr Smith for a fantastic tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jweith
50,"Interesting history, great view","We took the 1:00 tour, which was donation only. We could easily see Catalina Island.

40,Beautiful Scenery,My fiancÃ© and I love going to this park. The lighthouse also has free tours daily that is really nice to hear a little history of the southbay.

40,must see for lighthouse enthusiasts,"Located in a pretty park to picnic at, is a dear dollhouse lighthouse sister to Hereford inlet lighthouse new jersey. Free tours given by volunteers at the lighthouse do an extraordinary job at teaching the history of the lighthouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacog543
40,Lovely!,"We really enjoyed seeing the inside of this beautiful lighthouse and hearing stories about the various lighthouse keepers and their families. The docent led tour is informative, full of history - and a little gossip too, depending on which docent is leading the tour. All in all, an enjoyable experience in this beautiful oceanside park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieW51
50,"Free, But Worth A Lot","While in the L.A. area on business, we decided to take a day trip to San Pedro to see the Point Fermin Lighthouse and Cabrillo Aquarium. The Lighthouse has a fascinating history, including the personal stories of those who served (including two sisters) as lighthouse keepers through the years. Guided tours are provided, and there is no charge. We arrived on a slow day, about an hour before the next scheduled tour. One of the guides offered to take us on an unscheduled tour so we could continue on our way to the aquarium. Very knowledgeable and courteous staff. Best of all, no crowds and a perfect day, weather-wise. And while donations are both accepted and appreciated, there is a free attraction. The panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean, the sea gulls, and the park offer postcard-perfect photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennesseetraveler58
40,Nice historic building,We were driving the coastal roads and came upon this nice park with great views and this old historic lighthouse. Definitely worth a stop if in the area. Has several photo opp areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
40,Beatiful lighthouse in the middle of a lovely park.,Came upon this by accident while exploring San Pedro after spending a day on the USS Iowa. What a treat it was. A beautiful lighthouse with a lovely garden all around. Wonderfully kept and informative tour. It was great hearing about all the history of this place and very friendly staff. Very romantic for a walk with your lovely through the park and the ocean cliffs. Sit on a bench outside and relax in the ocean breeze.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsK1099DH
50,Informative and Fun,"We spent the morning at the USS Iowa and got here about 3:15. Oops, the last tour begins at 3:00 but, since no one had shown up for that tour, the docent took us around. She said it was a shorter tour since they closed at 4:00 but we thought it was complete and excellent. She knew all the history and about all the rooms in the house. It has been lovingly restored by the volunteers and docents and furnished in period furniture.There are several floors and then you get to climb up to where the Fresnel lens was kept. What a beautiful view out the windows on every level. The lighthouse is on a point of land and surrounded by Point Fremin Park. Beautiful setting and an excellent way to top off our day.There is no fee but a donation goes towards maintenance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
50,Historical Jewel,"A jewel box of history with a view. Make time to visit and take a docent led tour of the lighthouse. The history, pictures and artifacts bring the story of this lighthouse to life through the knowledge of the docents. The view of the coastline is magnificent if the weather permits. We enjoyed it so much, we stayed for a second tour by a different docent. That was a plus because each docent tells the lighthouse's story from their perspective. That was neat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob-a-Link
50,Beautifully restored lighthouse,"A beautifully restored piece of history set amongst the backdrop of a very nice park and of course the pacific ocean. Just down the road from the Korean Bell of Friendship, which is also very worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BRYANH811
50,What a beauty!,"What a perfect addition to an afternoon spent in San Pedro. Blue skies, warm sunshine, picturesque and expansive views of the Pacific as well as Catalibna Island in the distance all from this Historic Lighthouse. What a gem! Well kept, manicured lawns and lots and lots of trees surrounding this Victorian style lighthouse. It really reminds me of an East Coast Lighthouse?Donation-only tours are given - very informative and interesting if you get the chance! Just such a lovely secluded and relaxing atmosphere. Lots of steep stairs, so it may not be appropriate for everyone, but even just admiring it from the park with a picnic lunch and a dog is enjoyable enough! Such a great area to spend a day - you have so many choices of attractions to visit:Korean Friendship Bell, Fort MacArthur Museum, Marine Mammal Care Center, and Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and beach. I would definitely suggest a day trip to this area! Really nice getaway!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
40,Lovely tour of the light house,"I walk at Point Fermin often and enjoy the beauty of the grounds overlooking the ocean by over 100 feet.There is an old home there with flowers abounding around it. This is the old light house at Pt Fermin.I went on the tour which was led by a lady who spoke slow enough that I could enjoy and savor the suroundings and history. Each room, each floor and finally the top floor.There was no fee but donation only. Well worth the 45 min spent and light into the past history of the early family who once lived there as pioneers to the light house.I especially enjoyed hearing about the young girls.Sometimes as I walk by, there faces come to mind still smiling.There are not a lot of times the tour is available, but it is a lovely addition to living in the area.Before or after the tour, the park is literally magnificent for a walk. I have scene numerous whales overlooking the ocean there.Also, while watching one of my favorite shows, I recognized the light house and area as part of the set, Murder She Wrote.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabelsart
50,Gem with views and very friendly staff!,"This little gem tucked within Fermin Park is a beautiful Victorian style lighthouse. Beautiful views within the park and at the top of the lighthouse. Very knowledgable, patient and friendly staff. My 6 year old must have asked 20 questions and docent ""Polly"" answered ALL of his questions so sweetly and patiently. You can see era style: kitchen, bedrooms, bath and historical articles and pictures. I recommend the 30 minute tour. Many stairs to climb, sometimes steep, so dress in appropriate clothes and shoes. Free admission, but are very appreciative of donations. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWind26
40,Gem by the Ocean,"Point Fermin Lighthouse is a restored historical landmark with guided tours clear up to the light tower itself. It's surrounded by a beautiful huge tree shaded grassy park right on the point overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Even on a 100+ hot day, it was cool and refreshing for our picnic. We had 4 kids from 8 to 15 who all enjoyed most of a day there.More than that, it's part of a much larger historical area all within walking distance or a short drive - The Korean Friendship Bell, Fort MacArthur Museum, Marine Mammal Care Center, and Cabrillo Marine Aquarium where you can go swimming in the ocean. We were able to see Catalina Island clearly 22 miles away and the Long Beach Harbor and breakwater on the south and Malibu on the north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenR702
40,Nice afternoon with great stories,My husband and I took a quick afternoon trip fom LA to explore a new part of this giant city. A quick 25 minute drive and we arrived for the last free tour of the day: 3pm. Very knowledgable volunteers take you through the house and tell stories about the families who lived there and manned the light. Set in a lovely park this would make a great afternoon picnic spot with lots of grass for kids and pets to run around. We finished off with an ice cream and stroll along the bluffs. A nice place to take out of towners.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayouens
40,Well Worth the Drive From Los Angeles,"An easy drive from Los Angeles, the Point Fermin Lighthouse is located in Point Fermin Park, San Pedro, California. The lighthouse was built in 1874 and is an unusual Stick Style construction. It is maintained by volunteers and tours are offered Tuesday-Sunday from 1:00-4:00 p.m. The interior is not handicap accessible, but the views from the top are pretty spectacular. We ate at Walker's Cafe, located across the street and we would recommend this restaurant. I have reviewed it separately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/composthappens
