50,Friends of the Vine is Fantastic!,"Finally dropped into Friends of the Vine, and it is Fantastic! Not inexpensive, but a fantastic selection. Fred (the owner) is a delight!",Richard K
50,Nice selection - friendly staff,"Stopped in for a 'final-final' with some business associates after dinner - awesome selection of wine - nice place to relax with a laid back vibe, good music mix playing and very cool waitress (sorry forgot her name). Cheers",J J L
50,Best wine bar in the world,"Can't say enough about this stellar establishment. They have wines for ever ones palette and with the ""Cheers"" environment if a ""can't miss"" place. The corkage charge is ok, and the selection is great. Will be back often.",Helicopterbob
40,"Nice location, laid back, a little pricey","We were in town visiting family and went there on a Thursday night. It was a little quiet, but very casual and relaxing. We sat at the bar and talked with the locals. The owner, Fred, was very friendly. He even bought us a glass of champagne (three people in our group) and made recomendations for wineries to visit in Santa BarbarCounty.The pros:- Nice location in Redondo Beach- Casual, relaxing atmosphere- Friendly staff- Great group of ""locals"" who frequent itThe con:- Prices were a little high but it was for good wine.All in all, I would say it's worth it to spend $50 or $60 on a bottle to check this place out.",RiverEddy
10,"Friends of the Vine, enemy to the people","Wow, shocker of the day! I was going through my credit card receipts for the week and I noticed one from ""Friends of the Vine"" in Redondo Village. Maby I was totally enamored by my friends loveliness and didn't notice at the time but apparently I paid $15.00 for my glass of Dutton Gold Chard (6 oz.) and $15.00 for her glass of Rombauer Merlot (6 oz.). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is TOTALLY OUT OF LINE! and to tell you the truth I feel outraged by this and if they don't fix this mistake (for I'm sure it must be a mistake) I may have to start another crusade to warn my fellow Face Bookers of the grouse pricing abuses going on during this economy.",David F
40,Just like Cheers,"The staff are friendly and it is a real local hang out. Comfy lounges and great service, sit back, enjoy the wine with a cheese plate and then head over to HT Grill and drink some more wine by the firepit!",Sunski_000
50,Hospitality at its best!,"Tracy, Fred, and their staff are friendly, warm, and knowledgable about wines. They have a good selection of boutique wines that are not widely known, and they are able to obtain these wines before they become popular. This is a great place to pop-in for a glass before or after dinner, or to share a bottle with friends while relaxing.",tartare
10,The owner Tracy is rude and will treat you terribly unless you buy several bottl,"We go wine tasting all the time, go to wine tasting bars all over Los Angeles and wineries all over California, Italy, and Greece. Have been to Friends of the vine a few times and never been very impressed. If you buy a bottle of wine from them, there is a $9 corkage fee on top of the cost of the bottle of wine. This last time we were treated horribly by the owner Tracy. It was appalling. We were there with a group, got a lot of appetizers, wine flights, she was very friendly to begin with. In the end did not end up ordering any extra bottles due to the $9 extra corkage fee (decided to go eat elsewhere). When we asked for our bill, it was as if a switch had been flipped. She went from friendly to outright angry with us for not getting extra wine. She actually angrily grunted at us when we gave her two credit cards to pay the bill, and literally yanked them from our hands. When the bills were brought back to our table my friend had his hand out to take them from her and she actually threw the bills at us on the table (They skipped across the table) and she snapped at us ""is anyone going to take these???"" as his hand was still out to take them. It was outrageous that I actually said something to her she then seemed quite embarrassed but not enough to rectify the situation. We will never go back there or take our friends and we are wine lovers and this is the closest wine tasting bar to us. That woman was appalling for no reason. Our group was quiet, polite, and friendly and spent quite a bit of money already. She was appalling. This is not the place for a friendly, relaxing, nice glass of wine.",drnkwine1
