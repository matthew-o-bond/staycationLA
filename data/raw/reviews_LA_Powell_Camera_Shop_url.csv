50,"Powell Camera is absolutely top-notch, reliable, knowledgable and friendly!","We are long-term customers of Powell Camera. They are superb! Mark, Win and their team are always ahead of the curve on the latest technology so they guided us from film cameras, to digital to iPhones (Yes, we've known them that long!). They rescued precious family photos from old slides, restored and reprinted very old damaged black and white photos and digitized photos as well. Any questions, any issue, any technology, any supplies, Powell Camera is the go-to source. You can't go wrong with Powell Camera. And not least of all, everyone is so nice and friendly. It is always a lovely experience to visit Powell Camera. We've moved out of the area but remember them so fondly.",N3GHD
