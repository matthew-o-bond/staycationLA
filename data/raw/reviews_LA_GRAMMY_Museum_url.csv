50,You just have to go here,"This was one of the main attractions we had on our list of must do things in LA. I love the Grammys' and could not miss this opportunity.When we visited they were doing some restoration work so we managed to buy discounted tickets online. Its not a huge museum and wont take you long to walk around but do not rush. Some great pieces of historic memorabilia from some of our greatest artists including Michael Jackson, Whitney and Johnny CashThe surrounding area is nice and, as with the Hollywood stars there are plaques in the pavement detailing best artist, best song etc.The kids loved the instruments and the video production as you first entered,Music fans just have to visit here its a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonotDreamJustTravel
50,grmmy Excellent,i loved it so did my kids and so did my husben we would defently go again love it so much LOVE IT SO MUCH,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HIHIHIHIHILOVE
50,Must see when in LA,"Our visit was a lot more than we expected. We thought we would be in and out, but spent the better part of 3 hours there. A must see in Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dssjinny
30,Free tickets and so...,"Our visit to the museum was complimentary as we were staying at a nearby hotel. While I did find the history interesting, I must say I felt short-changed. There are so many other artists to explore. If you are not into the featured artists., you will likely feel that this is not time well-spent. I was in and out in under an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyy298
30,You have to be into the history of music to really enjoy it,It’s a cheap place to visit but you really have to want to see the current exhibition and also be into the history of music. At the time we were there it wasn’t very busy - during the week late afternoon - gets very busy when there’s an event on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaM646
50,An inspiring visit,"We decided on the spur of the moment to go into the museum and it didn't disappoint. The museum has 3 floors of musical history, from the first few ""grammys"" to how they were made, a interactive display on the history of music and genres to examples of musical stars famous outfits. the top 2 floor have large screens showing reels of great moments in the awards history and its great to spend time watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763MelissaP
30,Make sure to see the movie before you start your tour,Watch the movie before you start your tour from the 4th floor down. It's really cool to see the clothes that the performers wore during their Grammy performance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crunch6
50,Great experience,Well laid out and informative. Well worth the stop on a visit to LA to check out the history of the grammys.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8979JVryanc
30,Expected much more,"As true music lovers, we were a bit disappointed with the quantity of information and the number of music stars included and available for visitors. There were so many amazing achievements and so many great musicians in history, it is shame that you could not see at least a small tribute for many of them. However, those that are included have a nice tribute and you might find some really interesting facts. It is a small museum, it will not provide entertainment for more than 60 -90 minutes. Not even close to how big Grammy's were in our eyes. The outside of the museum is interesting as well, so do walk around the building",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
50,Wow if you like music you will love this!,"We very much enjoyed the displays, music videos and participating with instruments. The variety of music was great. I loved the fashion they shared. The floor that was all about Amy Winehouse was interesting and heart breaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenisforus
40,So Much to Take In,"This covers the GRAMMY from the beginning, and all of the music categories. I was especially fascinated with the various outfits on display: Michael Jackson's beaded military-style jackets, celebrity gowns and tuxedos they wore to the GRAMMY with corresponding photos. The history of the GRAMMY was extremely fascinating. The Beyond Black The Style of Amy Winehouse was interesting. I found all of the galleries very informative. It is quite obvious that celebrities, or their estates, donate the designer outfits worn on the red carpet to this museum. Come with your best outfit. There is a red carpet photo opportunity for you too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phavored1
30,Small but Interesting,"Did this museum in about one hour. It is a small museum. I came with my children who found the interactive exhibits most interesting. If you are in LA and have time, this is an interesting for music lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleDi2
40,Hall of Fame Museums better,"The Grammy Museum is a lot smaller than I would expect for something covering ALL genres of music. It took us only 90 minutes to do the whole thing. It’s worth a visit if you have time but should not be thought of as a must see. Current exhibits feature focus on The Ventures, Cyndi Lauper and Photo Reflections (pictures of artists and discussion on up to 4 songs that influenced them).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrdhist
50,Great tribute to music in America,"Wonderful photos and video clips of musicians and their acts in genre after genre - r&b, gospel, country, pop, blues and others— all Grammy worthy and Grammy winners. Then there are the costumes and paraphernalia and musical instruments. Really a fun trip back in time as well as a tribute to the diversity in American music. It is a small museum, easily done in a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/encantadasb
30,Not a lot to see here,It's quite nicely done little museum but the fact is that there is not a lot to see or do here. It could be some much more!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Great Little Museum,Really enjoyed this museum. It's the perfect size with lots of interactive exhibits so you don't feel like you're reading too much. Learnt lots of fun facts. Would definitely recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieJ70
50,Grammy,Went to the museum early on a Saturday morning. What was open was interesting but the 3rd floor was closed and a theater within the museum was also closed. They did say that our entry fee was reduced because of the limited areas that were viewable. I would advise travelers to call ahead and see what is open when you make your plans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orangebowl2014
20,Disappointing,"As others have said, the 2nd floor is under renovation so what little there is to see on the remaining 2 floors goes by quickly. I would recommend anyone considering to visit to wait until the 2nd floor reopens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F6620FXdanielg
20,Little to see or experience,"One of the floors of this museum is currently under renovation, but even so, the material inside was mostly memorabilia and terribly light on interesting information. Lackluster and disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momo-colorado
50,A must for music lovers.,"From the moment you leave the lift on the fourth floor you are grated by two huge screens depicting some of the greatest Grammy moments of all time. For fans of the Grammy awards this is incredible.Moving through the rest of the floor there are displays and exhibits dedicated to music through the years, music and baseball and how they interact and a wonderful display of memrobilia from Michael Jackson, Witney Houston and many more.Move down to an exhibition about how people react to music taken and a video on how the pictures were put together, that person's chosen piece or pieces and their interactions with the Grammys.Yes the whole third floor is closed and yes it's a bit frustrating but it's very well advertised and we went anyway as the other floors are open. A great afternoon, well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwanderaroundtown
20,Disappointing-Best wait until most of it reopens.,"The fourth floor was the only real museum. Being World Series time, a lot of it was dedicated to music and baseball, The displays were quite interesting and informative. The rest of it was more ho hum, but still interesting enough. The third floor is closed for renovations, no date for reopening. The second floor consists of a head shot photo gallery of musicians listening to their favorite music, and closed 2 hours early at that. I am not kidding.Went with a friend visiting from Canada expecting to spend an afternoon there, only to leave after an hour and a half, both very disappointed with the place.Other reviews suggest this is normally a good museum, but not just now. I would check to see what (or if) areas are open before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterH629
20,Yawn!!!...Grandma museum,A museum should move the guest in a new and informative way to learn more.This museum moves you out the door.Nothing to sink your teeth into...or ears into for this music themed audience.A few interactive sound booths on the top floor and a portrait essay of not so famous performers on the next floor....that's it?!!The largest section was a tribute to Jerry Weintraub... A rich recording exec.Not even a performer.Did he pay to have this excuse of a museum be a living mausoleum?Skip the 45 minutes of boredomand $12 entranceEnjoy one of the other amazing museums Los Angeles has to offer.Sorry Jerry and gang 😣,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sneezenwheez
40,Grammy Museum!,"This little museum in the heart of LA Live is worth the effort. We went on a Saturday night, before dinner at a downtown restaurant, and enjoyed a nearly empty museum. It's full of photos, displays, and recordings that you listen to wearing individual headphones. The most spectacular and gripping display is the video of historical Grammy Award winners -- a must see. An hour and a half is enough time to feel as if you've fully explored the museum. They are currently renovating the third floor of the museum and are offering discounted tickets. So now is the time togo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanmZ7724RV
40,Good times at the Grammy Museum,"This is a museum was better than expected. I did go on a free day, I am not sure I would pay the $12 admission fee. The exhibits were very interactive and informative but there were only two of the three floors open. If all three floors were open the admission might be worth it. Parking is a fee and a bit confusing. Overall, if you love music I would say go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
30,Expected slightly more,"We are big fans of music so we had big expectations, but no wow factor for us. Best part was exhibitiion dedicated Live Aid concert and We Are The World song. Whole visit took us no more than one hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
10,"Avoid - really poor value, small and not that interesting!",When I found out there was a Grammy Museum I was really excited - sounded great. I was wrong. The museum is actually quite small and lacks interesting content and therefore does not justify even half of the admission fee. It's a real shame but it's just not one to visit.I would 100% recommend saving your money and skipping the Grammy Museum - you'll get more entertainment watching old clips on YouTube!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phil_B_UK83
40,I liked it,It is not large but that’s a plus. The best part is the top floor with the awards. Start with the top floor( take the elevator up to 4th floor) and visit floor one by one going down . Small gift shop on the bottom. I believe the entry fee is between $5-7. It was something I did to kill time I had extra between meetings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
20,Maybe at half the price,"Great potential but the Grammy Museum does't offer that much to justify the admission price. There are three floors, excluding the first floor gift shop, and when we went one of the floors was closed for a change of exhibition. One floor was dedicated to baseball, with some history of song in general, and the other was solely for the Backstreet Boys. I think those are both revolving exhibits and the BSB was primarily photos and costumes. The rest of the museum contains a handful of Grammys on display and some memorabilia. There was an interesting exhibit on Weintraub but that was in a little corner. The theater was also closed. It seems as if they are trying to emulate the rock and roll hall of fame, but they come up way short of that. Maybe if they added more exhibits on the history of the Grammy, behind the scenes of the show, sets, something. If they aim to be a museum on music, that's different, but when they label it the Grammy museum they really should have more about Grammys. If you want to just pass some time it's fine for that, but I feel the price doesn't justify the stroll as it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanM191
30,An OK Museum,"As a long-time music fan, I was deeply disappointed in the Grammy Museum. The only floor dedicated to the actual Grammy Award was the third floor, which had an exhibit that featured a timeline of Grammy Award ceremony.The top floor was dedicated to baseball and music and other music exhibits; the 2nd floor was dedicated to the Backstreet Boys. It was pretty sad.This should be named a music museum - not a Grammy Museum. Where were the videos of iconic Grammy performances?And the gift shop - woefully small and terribly overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricWTraveler
30,The Thrill is Gone,"Things have changed quite a bit since the last visit, not the least of which is the pathetic gift shop. The exhibits are not as good and the experience was actually somewhat boring. We were in and out in under an hour, and truthfully that was more time than it really deserved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Su25bag
30,"Nice, but a bit boring","Probably the quickest tour I've done.. Not because there was nothing to see or do. I love music, but I didn't find the tour to have a huge wow factor. It was cool seeing previous iconic performers outfits framed like Beyonce. Shook that there was a whole floor dedicated to Backstreet Boys...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivewahh
30,No Grammy for the Grammy Museum,"As a long time music fan, I was looking forward to my visit. But this museum is just strange. Its more of a music museum than a Grammy museum.The 4th floor had a major exhibit on baseball and music. It was interesting.The 3rd floor focused on the Grammys and Latin Grammys. There were photos from the Grammys and a timeline for Best Album winners. I didn't see any videos of Grammy performances.The 2nd floor was focused on the Backstreet Boys. What a waste. There were some BSB costumes and a weird AR experience, but an entire wall was dedicated to fan photos of BSB.The 1st floor has the gift shop (which doesnt even sell Grammy Museum hats).Pet peeve #1: there was no signage on how to get from one floor to the next.Pet peeve #2: Im a Grammy Museum member (to support music education) but no mention when we got our tickets.We were in and out within an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentFlier725652
50,Surprisingly great museum,"We visited the GRAMMY Museum on 26th July, initially out of interest for the Backstreet Boys exhibit, but were pleasantly surprised with the rest of the exhibits in this museum. There was so much interactivity (our favourite was the “instruments”), and many very cool outfits, grammy awards, and instruments to view in the museum. The Backstreet Boys exhibit also did not disappoint, and the interactive photo aspect was great. Would definitely recommend this museum for anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maroonmol
30,Disappointing,"I'm a huge music fan and musician so I was excied about seeing this museum. We bought the GO pass and this was included. I'm glad we didn't pay for entrance and I was glad we had a car so we didn't spend extra money on an UBER or taxi. The only really interesting thing that caught my attention was a bass that Jimi Hendrix played. There was a HUGE display, an entire floor, for The Backstreet boys?!?! There was also a large portion dedicated to Cheech and Chong and how they helped influence the US with the drug culture - personally, I have nothing against weed, It just seemed out of place. If you already in the downtown area of LA and have a GO card, you may want to stop in. If you are visiting, I would say put this low on your list of things to do. Just don't expect too much - unless you love the Backstreet Boys",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jabawaki
40,Nice Museum for anyone interested in Music,"We visited this museum because my son is a musician, but all members of my family enjoyed it. They have interactive displays, a video montage of grammy performances and acceptance speeches, and a nice collection of Grammy memorabilia. My only suggestion is to try and time the visit so you don't share it with numerous schools on field trips. The Museum is not large enough for multiple schools and visitors to adequately enjoy the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1994CHlisaw
30,Disappointing,"Not what we were expecting from this place. Maybe our expectations were too high, but we didn't find it all that interesting. My husband is big into music, which is why I'd booked to come to the Grammy museum, but we were both disappointed. The main attraction is Michael Jackson's red jacket from the Thriller video. A large part of the exhibitions were closed when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pathfinder627418
40,Music History,"For any music and arts lovers, this a MUST place to visit. The museum is well organized. The collections of interesting Grammy artist memorabilias is amazing. The artist costumes are fantastic. Lots of stuff from various eras of music. There are interactive displays as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
40,Neat slice of music history,We enjoyed our time here learning about so many musicians and their journeys. There's an audio history of rock and roll on the top floor that is really worth taking the time to listen to the decades and the influences of the times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
40,I'd Give it an Award!,"I'm surprised at how interesting and in depth the Grammy museum is. It's a great celebration of the awards and traditions, and also of the artists and music. It's very enjoyable and not too exhaustive and is in a convenient location in DTLA.Backstreet Boys fans definitely shouldn't miss the Grammy museum. I wasn't too familiar with the band but the tasteful celebration of the group endeared me, and the music and video snippets and activities certainly brought me back to the 90s!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
50,Wide variety of exhibits with deep opportunities for details,"Starting on the fourth floor, you'll find multiple venues to learn about the Grammy as an award and tool for musical education. Every possible musical genre is represented and vast numbers of artists can be found on display, on recordings, in videos and in the archives that go deep into the history of music around the world. Rotating exhibits make this more than a one and done museum. This place is worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redrosesue
50,Could spend a few hours there,"Fabulous little place , not expensive to get in. Great gift shop, lots of interactive things to do and fantastic memorabilia to see. If you like music and movies its definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coops41
40,Enjoyable,"It is a lot smaller than I had hoped, but was interesting. We took about an hour or so to go through it. There’s lots of stuff there from various eras of music. There was a large display of Dolly Parton clothing and other memorabilia. I didn’t even realize the Grammy trophy itself had changed over the years but they had a display of each one.There were other interactive stations there where you could, for example, play an instrument, take a picture of you walking the red carpet, etc.They also have a small but nice gift shop.The location is downtown LA in a sectioned off entertainment area. We found street parking fairly easily. Pay attention to the hours as it not open every day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,You really need a day to check it all out,This place was amazing. I'm almost didn't go but i'm very glad that I did. Tons of interactive exhibits and wasn't too crowded when i went. Definitely recommend starting from the 4th floor and working your way down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyN516
40,"Small, yet interesting","I was particularly interested in The Prison Concerts exhibit. I was disappointed how small the exhibit was, but still glad I took the time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leftseatlady
40,Artist memorabilia,I was happily surprised but the Grammy Museum. They had tons of different artist memorabilia. They also had some interactive sound booths and listening stations. Its a great museum for all ages. The exhibits change regularly so its a place you'll be able to return to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
50,A Museum that Even Kids Like,"We had to kill some time in downtime LA and stumbled onto the Grammy Museum. It was beyond relaxing being in a museum where a small child could run around without much chance for breaking anything. The adults in our group had a blast exploring music memorabilia and videos from the past to present, and the little one loved the numerous interactive exhibits. He was over it in about two hours, but for the price, I would say it was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IntrepidTravelTribe
40,Still in its infancy the museum leaves a lot to be desired.,This museum is nothing compared to The Rock Hall of Fame or The Country Music Hall of Fame. It barely touches the tip of American music. It’s town hall program with Dolly Parton and Linda Perry in The Clive Davis theater made this a five star experience for us. But for the average Joe trying to get tickets for an event in this small intimate theater that only seats around 200 is near impossible. The current Dolly Parton and Michael Jackson exhibits make it a must for music lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ky_traveler2010
40,Should be a 6* place....,".....on a scale of 5. It’s the Grammy’s for crying out loud, easy home run. They dropped the ball. It starts off nice, historical video covering old to new, Grammy’s on display. But afterwards, the place felt disjointed, lacked flow. Why would Ray Charles or Beyoncé clothes be next to a display about Grunge Rock? Individual items are great, but place them in a more orderly arrangement. Johnny Cash exhibit was very good.Overall I expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plz2meatu
30,Intresting,My daughter who's 10 enjoyed this visit. It's 4 floor's of Grammy history which is interesting. It shows you a lot about what goes on with the Grammy's. The staff wasn't that friendly nor did they give a lot of information about the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redan08
30,Not exciting,"Caveat: I am not a Grammy aficionado, nor do I watch the Grammy's. So perhaps I never should have come here. But, there I was, so here's my take:You start with an educational movie and then proceed through the museum. Lots of displays, many interactive (where you can even record yourself singing). Amusing, some of it interesting, but not worth the time to get here, visit, and get back out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2TravelFarNWide
50,Excellent trip down memory lane....,"My daughter and I needed to kill a couple of hours while the rest of our family went shopping. We selected this museum due to the lack of a line to get in. The museum greatly exceeded my expectations. It is relatively compact and the exhibits are found on three floors. They have a rotating exhibits from some legends like Johnny Cash and Jermaine Dupri. There was a lot of interesting artifacts, song lyrics, and some sound booths you could play around with. There was a very good distribution of old & new, pop, country, R&B, and jazz. The exhibits on the Latin Grammys I knew less well, but enjoyed. An excellent way to spend two hours while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scott_koetke
30,Nice space with lots of room for improvement,"We went to this museum specifically to see the Cash photography exhibit. It was a very nice, though small exhibit.We then toured through the rest of the museum. There were some fun interactive exhibits and some interesting photos and information. But overall offers an average experience with lots of potential for growth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellewug
50,The Grammy Museum is a wonderful historical and interactive experience,The Grammy Museum is a wonderful historical and interactive experience for anyone who is into music and/or wants to introduce others to music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsieu
50,Grammy,"The Grammy Museum in Cleveland, Mississippi is a great place for all age groups. It is filled with great history of all kinds of music. It also shows you how to produce music, places to sing and play instruments. It also has a place for dancing. This place is so awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weight54
20,Disappointing,"4 of us (baby boomers) visited on a weekday afternoon. The first (4th) floor on the tour had a wide variety of music types represented. Music was playing from many locations which resulted in an unpleasant cacophony, except for a couple small listening rooms. Exhibits contained some hand written music or lyrics, clothing examples, and photos. Except for Michael Jackson and a few others, the clothes looked like what anyone wore at the time. Many of the interactive exhibits were not working, and there was no evidence that anyone in charge even knew they did not work. If you are really interested in the history of the Grammys, this is for you; maybe not as much for general music lovers. Entrance was $15, parking $10 if you leave within 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbmb310
40,Worth the Visit,"My husband and I were DTLA on a Monday and as both of us are huge music fans, we decided to check this place out (it’s great that it’s open on mondays as many museums are not). The exhibits are great and cover the music spectrum; some are interactive and others passive. There is also some great music memorabilia. Good way to spend a few hours at LA LIVE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magsweb
40,Worth the trip,"We’ve seen many museums of this type and find the Grammy Museum to be worth the visit. There are some interactive attractions and video walls that are very unique. I wish the gift shop was bigger and had more to offer. But otherwise, a great venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmcglashen
30,Check the web site for current exhibits. One floor was being renovated in Sept 2018. Enjoyed Michael Jackson exhibit.,"I didn't have my hopes too high for the Grammy Museum, as reviews seemed 'so-so'. I tend to agree with those reviews, however being a music lover and someone who enjoys watching the Grammys on TV, this museum had been on my list a while and I'm glad I went.Having visited the ABBA museum in Stockholm -- a fabulous music oriented museum -- I felt the Grammy museum was somewhat dull and lacking, however while we were visiting they were renovating one floor, so perhaps it will soon improve.Generally, the museum felt a little dated, rinky-dink and unfortunately for me, many of the current exhibits really didn't interest me. (Cheech and Chong, John Coltrane, Jermaine Dupri and So So Def, Carlos Vives...) I would recommend checking the web site before you go to see what the exhibits are on display as this could make or break your Grammy Museum experience.If you found this review useful, please click the 'thank' button. :)There was a LOT to read, with some interactive 'listening' through headphones, sound booths, costumes from the stars like Daft Punk, Elvis, Whitney and Michael Jackson. You can also try your hand at some musical instruments like the drums, which was fun. One thing that was causing a lot of attraction was a large screen with past Grammy shows being aired. I did enjoy the historic timeline on one of the walls, seeing Grammy awards through the years and reading about the Grammy telecast.Outside on the street they have 'Record of the Year' plaques on the pavement, one of them being 'Rehab' by Amy Whinehouse. (They are a similar to the stars on Hollywood Blvd).Along with the check-in desk on the first (ground) floor, there is a small gift shop and a 1-stall restroom. Expect to pass your bags through security.We went on a Thursday morning and it was pleasantly quiet.NEARBY ATTRACTIONSThe staff were helpful when we asked about nearby lunch places, although they generally seemed a bit bored. (FYI, there is a small mall and eateries a few blocks away at 7th and Fig).While in the area, we also visited the 'FIDM Museum and Galleries' and walked around the nearby area, passing the Staples Center and the Microsoft Museum.PARKINGWe parked in an outdoor public lot about a 10 min walk away at Figueroa and Cameron. I'd read about a lot of cheap lots but couldn't find one. I think we paid $15 and had to be out of the lot by 4:30pm.If you're visiting L.A. for a limited time, this museum may not be at the top of your list unless you're an absolutely die-hard music lover, but as Southern Californians, we're getting the chance to 'dig a little deeper' in the community and made a weekend of seeing some L.A. sites along with this museum. Again, I would recommend checking the web site before you go to see what the exhibits are on display as this could make or break your Grammy Museum experience.If you found this review useful, please click the 'thank' button. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfr
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"OMG. This place is amazing.So much music history is here.Every Grammy Award winner is showcased, so you will see your favorite.I was moved at seeing the name of Elvis Presley.This museum is a history lesson in music.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
20,Off Key,The Grammy Museum is an interesting concept poorly executed. The displays and exhibits are poorly displayed in the most uncreative way possible. It almost feels like they were filling extra space that they can rent out for events! The average Hard Rock Cafe does a mcuh better job!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTravelerRadio

40,Music lovers unite at the Grammy Museum,"If you love music of all kinds, this museum is for you. There are three levels of exhibits, cool hands-on exhibits where you can record music, listen to tracks of music, watch interviews and videos, etc. This was an unexpected stop for us on an afternoon in LA and for the price, we enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenned17
40,The Beat Goes On!,"The exhibits were a bit scanty, but I particularly enjoyed the National Guitars and video and Pete Seeger display. It was a chance to appreciate all the great music over the years and find many a fond musical memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1dudley
30,Combine visit with other activities at LA Live,"Check to see what exhibits are on to make sure there is something you'll find interesting. A lot of it involves watching video clips on monitors, or listening to music on headsets. If there is a talk/lecture activity taking place, these are usually very good. The parking at this location is very expensive, so plan to make a half day or day of it to amortize the high cost of parking across visiting the museum, having a meal, or going to a movie at AMC theaters down the street. If you can do shared ride hail cars and spend less than $25 roundtrip, do this to save on parking fees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highlandbride
50,Unexpected gem,"I attended as part of a large convention , not previously aware this existed. The exhibits, were well planned and displays, with several hand-on areas- make-your-own recordings or editing, and features of the ups and downs of the music industry. Good for all ages and moods, including the serious history of the Cal. music scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arcee_CO
50,Amazing,"This is a must visit when in LA. Not trashy, no hype selling crap, just a complete education in music and all genres. The price of a ticket is between ten and twelve bucks and you could spend the day having fun and learning. There are a number of interactive activities like playing the Drums, Piano, Guitar. Experience a mixing of music lesson. Hear the life of some of the greats in various music rooms. The Beatles, Elvis, John Coltrane and yes Rap too.Your ticket allows you to come and go, so you could have lunch at the nearby Yardhouse....plenty of restaurants to chose from.Four levels of activity including the Clive Davis Theatre, Cheek & Chong Still Rollin, Carlos Vives plus Soul and Funk.A lovely time at the Grammy Museum is assured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverSurfMan
20,Time killer,Small most inter active exhibits were not working it's simply a time killer about an hour for music lovers in the area only,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsenteno
50,Perfect For Lovers of all Types of Music,"Located Downtown, almost adjacent to the Staples Center is The Grammy Museum. It features all types of music such as jazz, pop, rock and roll, country and western folk, hip hop and so much more. Many of the exhibits are interactive. Current exhibits feature such diverse artists as Michael Jackson, Cheech and Chong, Pete Seeger, and Carlos Vives. Wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. Admission is $15 for adults, $11.95 for seniors, and $10.95 for children 6-17 years old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/springpa
40,Neat spot,"I really did not expect much, but if you love music this is a great spot. There were experimental areas where you could learn about the history of music and actually play music. The organizers did a great job creating this space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel4funwc
30,Not Bad.,"I think the price of admission could be a little cheaper, but it was decent. I'm a big MJ fan so seeing a case for him with tidbits was pretty awesome. I think the highlight of the place was playing with the instruments on the third floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
40,Interesting exhibits full of history. Also multiple interactive exhibits.,"I visited The Grammy Museum in May 2018 and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed myself. There is a lot of music history conveyed through the exhibits. The interactive exhibits are fun (such as listening to music from many different genres and pretending to record in a music studio). If you are the type of person to read every placard and try every interactive exhibit, you'll probably need a little more than an hour. If you plan to stroll through a little more casually, you shouldn't need any more than an hour. This probably is not a good option for children or young teens. I expect they would get bored, unless they are really into music history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hcool207
20,Disappointing,"Pretty disappointing. Quite a few of the video presentations were nonfunctional, and their main theater attraction was hosting a private group, so was closed. No one told us that when we bought our tickets. Other exhibits were just OK. We wondered why the tickets were not very expensive, and now we know. The R&R Hall of Fame in Cleveland is light years better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765judyd
50,Every music lovers dream museum!,"Walking by and seen and instantly had to go in. With a minimal cost to enter, toured the museum. By recommendation started on the 4th floor and worked our ways down. It was crazy to see all the celebrity memorabilia that has been donated to the museum. If you love music, this should definitely be a must see. Plus you never know who you may bump into there ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514joshuat
30,only if you are in the area,not really worth traveling across town for but if you are near by then not the worst way to spend an hour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasHall1
20,Disappointing,"This was extremely disappointing. It is very small and there is not that much on all of the floors. The only interesting things we seen there was the Michael Jackson section where they have the real Thriller jacket and his glove and also Beyonce's dress. Other than that, there is not much to see and it is a waste of money. I would've loved to have seen more Grammy's and had a photo opportunity to hold one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paigemcfarland21
40,Good for music fans,"We went with adult friends & one teenager & enjoyed it. The teen seemed a bit bored & I don't think younger kids would enjoy it. There is a mock stage with instruments & headphones. We all had fun pretending we were SOMEBODY! The exhibits were nice & enjoyed seeing the Michael Jackson memorabilia. There is probably something for everyone to reminisce over. The prices are reasonable, especially for L.A. Of course, parking makes up for that.No one in our group saw any signs regarding NO Pictures & no one told us not to take pics. I'm sort of embarrassed @ this now, but not embarrassed enough not to post.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redundantecho
30,Just Okay,We had the Los Angeles Go City Pass and this was included. It had quite a bit of information and history on the artist. There was an interactive area where my family looked like they were in a band. However nothing that really moved me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lezmi89
50,It's all about music,"Music Mecca in the heart of Los Angeles. Museum was extremely informative with well-maintained exhibits. They have accumulated quite a large collection of precious, authentic memorabilia from music industry (including famous outfits worn by artists on different occasions). Museum is focused on American music industry and Grammy Awards winners but still it represents large piece of music history. Museum is well organized. They have different floors dedicated to different celebrities and music genres. Exhibits are full of interactive features. You can sing, play different musical instruments or just listen to music samples. They also have a large section that is dedicated to the Latin Grammys and their history. The Grammy Museum was a pleasant surprise in LA. Time well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acidov
50,Great For Music Lovers,"Really love the Grammy Museum! It is a little small given the Grammy’s history, but what they have is quality. I had no idea sound recordings were originally made on cylinders before circular records similar to what we know today were made! I only had an hour to spare so I had to rush the second and third floors. Would love to come back and spend more time here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habualtin
40,Good to visit if in the area,We were between events so spent an hour at the Grammy Museum. It features some costumes and in-depth info on the Grammy winners. It is fun to listen to hits from previous decades.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clamflat
50,Music History,A cool place right in the heart of LA LIVE. When we were there the gal said no photos as did the sign but clearly there are photos of inside taken and posted. I just took outside photos.As a music fan since early childhood this is a great place to see and absorb all the musical greats presented here.There is also a small gift shop. An elevator for those who don’t use stairs is there for this 3 story museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
40,fun stuff,"the permanent exhibits are great, and they have floating exhibits so check the schedules. lots of interactive stuff, and interest for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
40,Music Fans,"This is not your typical museum with antiques and the like as it is a slightly more interactive museum with newer and interesting items such as handwritten drafts of songs and a set up for a pop/rock band where you can rock out. There is a wall dedicated to the King of Pop, Michael Jackson and smaller displays for clothing/costumes donned by music artists.It is accessible for less mobile patrons and within walking distance of 7th St/Metro station if trying to avoid having to park in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DABSMO
50,So much fun,"My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by how fun, creative and interesting this museum was! There are many interactive features that are fantastic, as well as new information about artists you wouldn’t have known otherwise! Definitely recommend if you have a love for music! Which let’s face it, who doesn’t?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roundtheworld104
50,Interesting and evocative,"We went on a whim while in downtown. It’s not a huge collection, but I learned a lot about music production. You need to spend some time to listen to the exhibits, but it was very well done. Parking is a typical pain, but it’s next door to the Staples center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob_lxl
40,Definitely Worth a Visit if you are a music fan!,"When I'm near L.A. Live I always make time to visit this wonderful museum. My favorite special exhibits were about the artists from Laurel Canyon and the one on Ringo Starr. One very special advantage about this museum is that it is interactive. I played drums listening to music by the Beatles and attempted to follow along. You can remix songs and sing too in a small recording ""studio."" You can touch screens to explore history and facts about specific songs.The musical artists outfits are in glass cases which are fascinating. Seeing the original songs hand written in cabinet displays is awesome. The artifacts bring more life to the songs. I only am giving 4 stars for two reasons. One is that they do not allow photography. It's very annoying not being allowed to take a photo of a long article displayed that I want to read at my leisure later in the day. Also, the parking is very expensive so I now walk a few blocks away and pay much less. They have discounts for seniors so I appreciate that. A few days a year it's free. I do recommend a visit if you are in the downtown section of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hildmat
30,Good for a short visit,"One of the 3 floors of exhibit space was unavailable since they were finishing up a new installation. However, we enjoyed the other 2 floors. The teens were not familiar with most of the featured artists, but there was enough to keep them interested for about 90 minutes. If you have time and are in the area, stop in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMath5516
50,"Great Museum, Wonderful Music Venue","Just walking around the museum is a thrill. You can do it in an hour or three hours, it's up to you, but if you are a music fan you will be stopped time and again by the exhibits. If you're taking your family to the Staples Center, or the Nokia Theater, then stop in here and check it out. They have some great programming that requires you to buy tickets, but the theater, which seat maybe 300, has great sound. They book some legends, so check their website and do it all....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulart99
50,Grammy Museum,Do not miss the museum downtown LA.....Great presentation for music lovers and cheap to get in.....You can walk to it from 7th street center station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350jimmyn
30,Ok if downtown,"I certainly wouldn’t make a special trip, but it was interesting to walk around once I was already downtown. It is small. Some of the clips and history were interesting, as well as the teenagers saying that is “old school pop”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaminDC
50,"Very interactive, loved it",If you like music definitely check this out. We almost skipped the Grammy but glad we didn't. Lots of interactive stuff to do like play in a sound booth and play some instruments. Not crowded at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladybug198425
50,"If you like music, history, and awards, check this out!","Located at the Staples Center/LA Live complex, our family spent the better part of an afternoon exploring the Grammy Museum. This is an interactive museum, offering music selections with headphones, opportunities for sound booth recordings, percussion displays you can play, and looping video tracks of various historical moments and gala events. It was lots of fun, and offered a view of a broad spectrum of music genres. Plan on spending 2-3 hours to take it all in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgep839
50,A Cleveland Gem,"This is quite a new addition to the Blues Trail in the state of Mississippi and one which needs to be visited! It is related to the Grammy Museum on the west coast and does feature some of the musicians of this area.The opening video of past Grammy winners is excellent as are all the displays. When we went this past February, there was a special retrospective illustrating the life and music of John Lee Hooker. There are many musical instruments, storyboards, and artifacts in a chronological overview. You could spend several hours here. There is a charge for entrance and quite a nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IdaIllinois
40,Top 2 floors were best,"Arrived on Monday at 1pm, which was also a holiday. No waiting. Got discount tix thru AAA, which was nice.Enjoyed the top floor most, with it's variety. Nice to see costumes, artifacts from singers like Michael Jackson, etc. Nice display to let you sample music from virtually every genre. Liked watching a film on how a National guitar is made. Timeline of Grammy's was also interesting.Third floor was fun for my 6 year old son, able to play some instruments like drums and electric guitar, and to try out a mixing machine.Wasn't interested in the 2nd floor exhibit, it was about a punk rock band. Hope this exhibit rotates. The film on the floor was also about the band, and it had a weird music video.If you're visiting LA Live and have an extra hour of time, it is worth stopping by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,High quality niche,"As you might expect, the museum - located on four floors in the building - has high quality, interesting exhibits specific to the Grammys and music in general. Lots of music to listen to on headphones, fun videos, and really like the large video screens. You start on the fourth floor and work your way down. Given the scale of each floor, most are dedicated to one or two exhibits, somewhat limiting larger exposure to more aspects of Grammy musicians, history, and physical exhibits. I have to say, I left really wanting to see and experience more... but it was what it was. Still, very unique and different type of museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
50,Grammy Day!,My family and I went to the Grammy Museum on Grammy day this year. There were wonderful displays of every type of musician and their stories. It was great to see the costumes of great performances and read the background stories of how they got started. Very friendly staff. Had a great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladybug62
50,"Great for Music Lovers, History and Events","The Grammy Museum is an easy, breezy, slice of music history heaven. With rotating exhibits and events, a music lover could spend a good few hours enjoying her favorites here. They have frequent special events, evenings featuring movers, shakers, artists, and relevant and interesting presentations in a beautiful little auditorium. If you're exploring downtown, this is a good stop on your itinerary, with nice restaurants all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eboosler
50,Grammy Museum trip down memory lane,"Visited the Grammy Museum on a whim. Short walk from the Ace Hotel. Tickets were inexpensive $10 or $12. $th floor, where you start was the best. My wife loved the large display and video of Michael Jackson. I enjoyed the decade themed (50's, 60's 70's) videos of music history. Interesting displays of old instruments and recording equipment. Made for a pleasant afternoon. It was not crowded on a Tuesday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1130KMpaulm

50,Always an interesting exhibit and the location is fun to observe LA LIVE,"I've visited the GRAMMY Museum on many occasions and the most recent one toattend a FREE screening of a documentary film on ""X"" was as good as anyi've seen . You also got to look at the EXHIBIT of the ""X"" files, so to speakthat is a very fine and comprehensive survey of ""X"" and it's contribution tothe LA and punk Music Scene. (Actually X goes beyond PUNK in y'opinion.The Museum offers a lot of things for purchase, though not inexpensivebut some may be unique to whatever exhibit is offered. You can alsohang out around the area, look at the people visiting STAPLES center,find something to eat, from the trendy to the 'old fashioned.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
50,For Fans of Music. Or the Awards.,"As a fan, I feel like I got into music surprisingly late in age. I had my favorites growing up, sure, but the variety I listened to was quite miniscule. It wasn't till my mid-20s that my tastes expanded and my love for sound took off. The Grammy Museum reaffirmed the affection I have for music, and walking in, I had rediscovered music again. This is a place you could easily waste a day on. It's surprising just how much history is packed into the exhibits. You can explore the genres, see costumes, instruments, documentaries. You want to see the paper that Woody Guthrie wrote This Land Is Your Land on? It's there. You want a deeper understanding of the songwriting process, or engineering? There's booths for both. Regardless of where you look, there's something you will be interested in. If music is something you're into, whether you're young or old, do yourself a favor. Get a ticket and go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenmM3894XX
40,Surprisingly fascinating,"My music taste don’t tend to focus heavily on the top 40, so I wasn’t sure what I would think of this place. I was pleasantly surprised. The museum is historically interesting and very nostalgic. It is also aesthetically well organized and it’s fun to walk through. Lots of great facts and memorabilia. Highly recommended to any music fan or history lover!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatElena

30,A few interesting exhibits,"The museum had a lot of interesting costumes from Elvis, Michael Jackson and Katy Perry. I enjoyed the Grammy wall where they showed all the winners for best song since origin of the awards. But many exhibits were of performers I was unfamiliar with and too many headphones with recordings of acceptance speeches. That held no interest to me, personally. I don’t feel it was worth a visit but perhaps true music lovers would enjoy it. They have exhibits where you can record a song or play instruments. Some people would like that. My friend and I were done in an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingCAgal
40,Pretty Interesting Museum,"I came to check out the exhibit about the band X. It's cool that the Grammy museum were honoring the band considering as far as I can remember they've never been nominated for a Grammy. Maybe they have, but I don't think they have. Anyway, the X exhibit (X-hibit?) was set up well, with old items donated by the band. Each band member got highlighted in their own section which was cool. The museum starts on the 4th floor and you work you're way down. There are some interactive displays and a room to jam on instruments. It's all pretty cool especially for such a stuffy organization as the Grammys. Parking nearby was only $5 for 2 hours. 2 hours is probably plenty of time to go through the entire museum. Ya might need a little longer if you really want to delve into all of the interactive displays. Admission was about $13 for adults. Nice way to spend few hours especially if they are highlighting a band you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,It does not get better than Clive Davis.,"This iconic space is near LA Live and not to be missed if you love every genre of music. Interactive exhibits abound as one can listen to whatever you fancy.Memorabilia from Katy Perry, Michael Jackson, Stars Wars are there with all the stories. Clive Davis' doc on The Soundtrack of your Life is in the excellent gift shop so learn about the superstars he managed from Janis to Whitney.The man still kicks it!

40,Great for serious music lovers,"I am a big music person, almost all genres. I liked this museum very much. I enjoyed the interactive exhibit which showed the influences of one genre on another. Also loved the special exhibits on Kris Kristofferson and Ella Fitzgerald. Liked that there were lots of places to sit and get an overview of genres, and glad they included classical and jazz. Enjoyed sitting and seeing some of the great performances over the years. Gift shop, lackluster. I would allow 3 hrs if you are a big music fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfitz695

20,Not my cup of tea........,"Had there been some Jack Daniels in my cup...it might have made a bit of a difference, but overall it was kind of boring. The Michael Jackson exhibits was fun to see, but otherwise this place if a hodge-podge of music related stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname
50,"Awesome , interactive Museum","This is a 4 story, small museum with amazing focused areas on various types of music, both contemporary and historical. The sound systems, visual displays are well thought out and give you a real sense of that time in music history. On my visit there was an Ella Fitzgerald show that was inspiring. The shows are changed often so repeat visits will give you different experiences. The theater video shows seasoned musicians sharing their knowledge with current day music students and blending the past music with the current live, using an on site recording studio. I sat with a group of high schoolers and they were so engaged in the video as they learned about some of the history behind today's sounds. This is a museum to be enjoyed by all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcyoung2
50,Music Hall of Fame,"This great little 4-story museum will have music lovers enthralled. There are special exhibits paying tribute to selected artists which they change up every few months (when I visited they had odes to John Denver, Ella Fitzgerald & Kris Kristofferson) and the memorabilia on display is out of this world (Michael Jackson's original red 'Thriller' jacket, anyone?). Some of the sections were closed off when I visited due to renos & new displays being put together but even then there was enough on display to kill well over an hour. The place is vibrant too with interesting lighting and use of colour and video & multimedia exhibits to keep you entertained. If you're in Downtown LA, make a point of checking the place out. Entry is USD 10-13 depending on which sections are open at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7

Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291ronniec
30,It was okay. They need to add more features to the museum,"Went with hubby to the Grammy Museum in downtown LA. It was okay but I would not revisit unless they aded some new features. To listen to music you had to use the shared headphone thay had, NOT!!!! That is disgustting with germs. They need to allow where you can use your own headsphone. So I did not listen to any of the music features. It was boring, not enough to see. Not enough Album displays or artist displays. The same clips keep playing when you first get in on the 4th floor and work your way down. We were done in 1 hour tops. Somewhat disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738shamils
40,Interesting collection for all.,"Chanced upon the Grammy Museum on my only day in LA and thoroughly enjoyed a couple of hours wandering all the exhibits and listening to music.

40,Great stop for music fans,"We greatly enjoyed our afternoon at The Grammy Museum. We spent about 2 1/2 hours there. It is located near the Staples Center. It is not a big museum, but it had varied exhibits. A good variety of videos, hands-on activities & artifacts. We really enjoyed the booth where you could hear how a recording of a song (we picked Need You Now by Lady Antebellum) would sounded on the different formats from the 1800's to today. The temporary exhibits on John Denver & others were good. Really like their Michael Jackson artifacts.We enjoyed it more than the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolec881

30,Very small version of Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,"My husband and I went there while in LA. We are from Cleveland, so maybe with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame we aren't going to be super impressed by anything less. It isn't a bad museum, just a very small collection. Maybe their collection will grow over time. Would like to see more about history of Grammy's; like the history of the Mercer Songwriter's Hall of Fame, which was quite interesting. The special/temporary exhibit was nice, so hopefully they will do more of these. Location was very easy to find, park and get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claudel2653

Have been there to see exhibits as varied as the Ramones, Bob Dylan, Tupac Shakur, Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra. Learned something each time I went and had a better appreciation for music after I left. They have a cool gift store too. Evening interviews and performances may also be available on a first come first serve basis. If you like music, you'll have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onoman
50,Fun with lots of music history,"My husband and I went here on our anniversary trip to L.A. We found tickets for much less on Groupon. The final total of our tickets after the discount came to $6 per ticket which was cheaper than purchasing tickets directly from the Grammy Museum. The tickets directly to the Grammy Museum are $12.95 per adult ($11.95 college students), kids ages 6-17 are $10.95 per ticket. Children under 6 are free. There are also military rates ($10.95 per person). Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our entire visit. Everyone was friendly from start to finish. I really enjoyed the Otis Redding exhibit the most because I grew up listening to his music. There is a variety artists from different music genres including gospel. We got to hear music from different artists, see some of their outfits on display, and see past live performances on television screens. There was also a lot of interactive stuff to do live record yourself singing and play it back. We were there for a little over two hours. It felt like we stepped back in ""music"" time. There is also a souvenir shop at the end which has reasonably priced items. I would love to go again in the future when more exhibits are added. Nevertheless, it is best to allot 2 hours to fully enjoy the museum. There are 4 floors of exhibits and etc. It is handicap accessible (there are elevators and stairs to take to each floor). The museum opens at 10:30 and from my experience, you have more space to roam because it's not crowded if you get there early. Be prepared to pay to park (parking won't be validated). The best place to park is in the L.A. Live West Garage (Lot W, Gates E or F) (it is handicap accessible). The parking cost $5 for 2 hours and anything after 2 hours is charged at $5 in 30 minute increments. If you patronize some of the restaurants or the movie theaters at L.A. Live, they will validate your parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cenalestravel
20,unfilling museum,"I was excited to come to the museum, thinking it would be filled with different mementos and stories about the artists experiences. the museum was extremely underwhelming. It claims it is 4 stories of information, however the ground floor is the exit of the building, and the first floor is filled mostly with the gift shop. therefore, only two floors are the actual exhibit. Most of the exhibits were costumes/ outfits from artists days on tour/ shooting a music video. Other than this, there isn't much else to see. There aren't stories of the history behind the grammys, or unusual events at the show, or what it is like to give a Grammys speech. I think this museum with all its history could've performed much better (no pun intended).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpond
50,Awesome experience,"We had the BEST time visiting the Grammy Awards Museum. So much to see and do, so much history. Wow! Loved it. Glad I was able to give my daughters this experience and teach them about the history of music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanng659
50,Nice Museum,This was an enjoyable and engaging museum and a great way to spend some time while in downtown LA. I would recommend checking it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merl_Thomas
50,Interactive & very enjoyable,"We spent 3 hours at the museum & loved every minute of it. I thought it was just going to have a lot of grammy statues & pictures, but I was so wrong. It was interactive & you could go into small sound studios, view different costumes from famous artists like Michael Jackson, Beyonce & John Denver just to name a few. It is for all music lovers for all genres. We were definately not disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaZZaManaZZa12
50,A great interactive historical overview of music!,"An amazingly diverse curated assemblage of costumes, instruments, lyric sheets, photographs, video selections and interactive booths! It's all here; you can play drums, mix music, see Grammys as well as numerous other awards from the artists' featured (when we were there, Kris Kristofferson, John Denver and Ella Fitzgerald) This museum has gorgeous metal guitars and other stringed instruments from the 20's- to those played by Johnny Cash and Jimi Hendrix. Whatever your musical interest, it's all here, a beautifully assembled museum dedicated to the history of music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsPlant
40,Liked what I saw of it!,"I visited the Grammy Museum one evening during a “networking” event as part of a conference I was attending at the convention center, which is close by. I can’t review the entire museum as we were allowed only on the roof, which appears to be just for special events like ours, and on the fourth floor, the latter where the Ella Fitzgerald, John Denver and Kris Kristofferson exhibits are currently located, among others. I found what I did see fascinating and very educational (in a pop culture way).The current entry fee ($12.95) seems very reasonable for what you will see inside, given that there are three other floors I didn’t get to see. Of course, I didn’t pay the entry fee (I actually paid a lot more but that included food and drink and the chance to “network”, ha ha). If I had had any spare time during the convention I would have gladly returned to see the entire place. But alas I did not. I’ll have to make a point of it on a future visit to downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerelyATourist
40,Good value for music fans,"A fun place to visit for music fans. Lots of places to put on headphones and listen to all types of music and interviews. Some good videos. Enjoyed the displays of clothing, guitars, handwritten lyrics, etc.Our teenage sons enjoyed the section where you could play various instruments, including the electronic drums.Tickets were relatively inexpensive (I think we paid more for parking in the LA Live deck) and really a good value overall. It's not quite the Rock and Roll HOF, but worth a visit if you are in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennism433
40,A nice place to visit,"The museum has four floors and each one has a diffrent style. You can see the clothes and musical insturments of the legend singers and song writers. The best part of the museum was the Michael Jackson section but of course this is my belief. All in all, this a nice place to visit if you are in los angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaraAygen
40,Music Lovers,"If you are a lover of music you'll enjoy this museum. Very informative and i love the fact that they have hand written lyrics of hit songs by various artist in some of the display cases. Very interactive museum, allows you to be hands on in some areas. The videos that were being played were good as well. Not a bad deal for 13.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCNJGIRLZ
40,GRAMMY MUSEUM,"I knew I wanted to go to the GRAMMY Museum, but I wasn't quite sure what to expect. You enter on the first floor and immediately take an elevator to the 4th floor. From there, you walk out into a rectangle room, where they projected clips from the most recent Grammy Awards, and had 5 or 6 Grammys on display, one for each of the designs. (It's been redesigned a few times over the years apparently.) They had different areas dedicated to different genres. There were a few memorabilia type deals- clothes, sheet music, photos, that kind of thing. To be completely honest, I didn't know a lot of the artists so I couldn't fully appreciate the memorabilia. I forgot how wide-ranging the awards are.There were five special exhibits while we were there, one dedicated to John Denver, one to Ella Fitzgerald, one to Mary Stuart, one to Kris Kristofferson, and one to Monterey International Pop Festival. They were pretty small though. In fact, I didn't even distinguish the Kris Kristofferson or Monterrey International Pop exhibit from the permanent collection. Since 2011, there's also been a Micheal Jackson exhibit, but it was closed for cleaning while we were there. My favorite part of the museum was seeing the handwritten lyrics from various stars, and playing some electronic instruments they had out. Those were great because they were real instruments and mixing tools that you could try out. All in all, it was fun and interesting for sure, but maybe not a must see, unless they have a special exhibit that has really piqued your interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pingin505
50,Don't Miss This Museum,"A history of music and grammy winning artists with first class displays such as the Beatles instruments, etc. Some nights feature artist showcases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billegee123
50,Fun...Interactive and a trip down memory lane.,Just go along and enjoy the fun. It's a good place for everyone to enjoy. Music spans all generations and is interwoven thru all cultures. So much great stuff to just play with and/or sit and enjoy.Cost of an adult ticket is $13. And worth it. The exhibits change from time to time so there is always something of interest to see and listen to.There are cool souvenirs for sale on-site as well.Take the family or go alone...but go and see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tereza09
40,Takes you down the memory lane in terms of some musical greats,"You arrive at this museum you encounter the history of Grammies, speeches made by some of the past winners and their speeches, some of which were comical and some hilarious. There was a group that won and made their speech without their trousers on. I had a very close encounter with Michael Jackson's famous jacket and gloves. You get to see some of the handwritten music notes or compositions at the museum. You can also listen to some of the great tunes of the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajei2000
50,So Very Interesting!!,"I love music if various genres and I must say I totally enjoyed this museum. I love reading about and seeing some of the clothing and handwritten lyrics of different musicians. I thoroughly enjoy the interactive singing booth where you can actually record yourself and play it back. From Michael Jackson's iconic white suit worn for the cover of ""Off the Walk"" to John Denver's custom outfits with bell bottoms..it was great. Do not overlook this attraction. We were able to get parking in a nearby surface lot for $7 for the entire day and we visited the Staples Center which was just up the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
50,Super fun even for people who aren’t “music lovers”,"I wasn’t totally sure if coming to the Grammy Museum at LA Live would be something I would enjoy since I don’t really consider myself a fan of popular music. I was also short on time. I only had a few hours between meetings at the Los Angeles Convention Centre. I am so glad I went. Even if you’re not a “fan” if you’re human you’ve likely heard of most of the artists showcased in the museum and you’ll find yourself singing along to the different music being piped through the exhibits. It took me less than two hours to go through the whole thing and while I didn’t read every word of every display I feel like I took in most of it. There is something for everyone too. From “pop” music (and the definition of what that even is) to country, soul, rock n’ roll, and classical. It’s a well done museum and I recommend taking the time to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agent713
40,Perfect stop for a music fan,"We visited as part of our GO LA passes. We only spent about an hour and didn't see everything. You could easily stay a few hours if you watched all of the videos, read all the signs, and played on all of the interactive features. We enjoyed the pictures and movies from older artists and the new ones as well. There is something here for every music lover. It is easy to park in the LA Live parking area and take the escalators up to the breezeway. There are other places - restaurants and bowling- in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFowler
50,Music lovers heaven,"I could have spent days in this place. So much to see. Some amazing artefacts from music history, a feast for the eyes and ears, if you are a music fan this is a must do and so cheap! $25 for two!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gibbo1969

50,Outstanding Music Perspective and Special Shows,"The Grammie Museum is worth a long visit for music lovers, 4 hours in our case, to see both the regular exhibits and the special one-time shows. The highlight for me was the in depth special shows for Ella Fitzgerald and John Denver featuring both their music, interviews and commentaries. The interactive audio visual exhibits with sound byte examples of the wide range of music styles, heavy metal to classical, were entertaining and educational. I will return on a future LA visit to see new shows as well as exhibits I had to skip due to not enought time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerfN
50,Surprise Favourite,"Only went to kill some time before NBA game at Staples Centre next door and ended up having a great time. Surprisingly good museum. Great memorabilia collection, loved the interactive recording studio experiences. The history of music in America through a huge map pinpointing all the big music centres was outstanding. My wife was introduced to many music legends she was unaware of. Recommend it to music lovers. Go early on a Saturday and you'll nearly have it to yourself. Came out for the basketball 2 hours later and crowds were forming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
40,Music through Exhibits,Nice memorabilia. Listening to the music itself heightened the experience. The ongoing John Denver Exhibit was delightful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C_C_M_V2014
40,Musical History and Educational,"If you like your music and you want an interactive way to learn more then this place is excellent - loads of different ways to learn about music and the history of the Grammies.There are exhibits you can touch to take you on journeys of history of all kinds of genres of music, short films to watch about different music throughout the years, musical instruments to play (fortunately with headphones), exhibits of clothes worn by different stars such as Michael Jackson, loads of great things to play with and learn.Only criticism is its vey American focussed so the Beatles hardly get a mention and David Bowie doesn't even feature, other than on the rock and roll hall of fame.Still, you are in LA and everything is America-centric, but for $12 you can easily lose a few hours here if you wish...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damspost

50,Wonderful place to visit,I went to the Grammy Museum for the second time last night. They have amazing events there and the exhibitions are always changing. They are so friendly and helpful there. It makes it a great way to see some great music history. Also many restaurants around and the parking is close but a little pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K0OXmariel
50,Definitely worth a visit if you are in LA and love music.,"On a recent visit to LA, my husband and I visited the Grammy Museum. It is worth it, particularly if you are a music lover and enjoy a multi media musical experience. All forms of music are represented from classical to rap. We particularly loved the areas dedicated to jazz and classic rock. ""Ella at 100"", the video of the Monterey International Pop Festival and the area dedicated to the late John Denver were particularly interesting to us. Regardless of your musical interests, you will find lots to do, see, and listen to at The Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irish_Harry

50,Cool venue for an intimate small-audience concert performance,"won tickets from our local PBS station for a performance by Chloe Agnew and Eamonn Mccrystal at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. Both performers had been part of the Celtic groups from Ireland. This was the first stop on their concert tour, so we got to see all of the preparations they were testing and refining for future performances. Both singers were very friendly, and we were able to takes pictures during the performance, and actually TALK with them before the concert started. This was a really comfortable and private little performance hall, on the upper level of the museum. Hope we get the chance to visit there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecurbeertbarc

Only disappointment was that shop had no Jim Marshall merchandise (main travelling exhibition).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2020Heather
50,Outstanding Musical Venue for All Ages.,"We visited the Grammy Museum with friends who had not been there either - on the recommendation of another friend. She was spot on when she said it was a 'must see'.That is is. Upon entry (you take an elevator to get to the first floor of the exhibit), you are immediately caught up in a flashing series of multiple grammy acceptance speeches by musical luminaries.After being torn away from this, I/we were free to roam around the floor which is loaded with interactive auditory songs from different musical genres (e.g., classical or pop). Headphones are provided where appropriate.When we were there there was an exhibit of Count Basie, replete with telegrams from Frank Sinatra and other singers of note. The music of John Denver was there as well, along with choosing your decade to listen to any number of musical songs.There is also a giant grammy with an explanation of where the name originated from (a contest was held to name the award). No spoilers here though on the person who anointed the prize.It was really a terrific morning activity, lasting about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryh659
40,Exhibition was the best part!,"The museum is pretty small, but has lots of interactive exhibits. I would estimate 2 hours at the most for a good visit. We were a little disappointed until we got to the rotating exhibit hall, and it made up for the rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1860QPmarkf
40,Enjoyable and reasonably priced,Spent some time at the Museum and enjoyed it! Construction on one of the floors meant a decrease in ticket price which was a nice gesture. They had a lot of interactive activities and music of all genres. I'm glad we went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEH2965
40,Interesting... but short.,My husband and I used go LA cards on our trip and this was one of the places we could visit on them. (Totally recommend the go pa cards to anyone. Saved us loads of money!)The museum is in downtown LA which to be honest was very rough. Let's just say I wouldn't be happy to walk the streets on my own!We found the museum very interesting. I particularly enjoyed seeing the clothes and costumes that were on display.The whole museum taken at a leisurely pace took us less that an hour to do.Whilst I enjoyed it I don't feel like I would need to see it again. But it was a nice break from the sun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSmith5
40,Excellent Experience,We booked this visit while in Los Angeles.Excellent experience and pleasantly suprised by the content and varied entertainers on show.Great value for money and definitely worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdcs4
50,Huge amount of History,"This is a must see if you are a Music Lover, they have every type of Genre from the 1900's right up until 2017. They had just about every Popular Musician, their Costumes, Outfits, Instruments, songs and Sound Booths to listen to their music. They even had instruments you could pose with for pictures and showed who got what Grammy, Best Song, Best Song Writer for many years. There is 4 floors of stuff to look at with Lots of information and a Store to buy Memorabilia on the 2nd floor. This was a Great way to fill in time and enjoy before going to a Great Hockey game or if your just in the area. Very informative and full of History, loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShereenB50
50,Pleasantly surprised!,"We stumbled upon the museum and enjoyed our visit a great deal. The tickets were about $10 each and well worth the cost. There are 4 floors of interactive activities. Lots of music to listen to from all genres so there is something for everyone. There was a stellar John Denver tribute, complete with a movie about the many things other than music that he was part of. The Smoky Robinson and the Miracles tribute was also very informative. The Ramones were the featured exhibition at the time I was there, and it was complete with a recording studio to record yourself singing a Ramones song, memorabilia and a full length concert movie from 1977 in London. We could have easily spent much more time at the museum and hope to stop back next time we are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoolBeanMe
30,"Small spot, some good stuff, expensive parking","This place is smaller than it looks from the outside. But if it contains specific exhibits that fit your musical taste, then check it out. My favorite part is a waist-high, eight foot long, permanent interactive display that shows how every genre of music is related to every other genre of music from hip hop to country to classical. Visitors pout on headphones, pick a snippet of music, and delve into it's musical family tree to see how everything is related to everything else. Very cool. But we only stayed a couple of hours tops and the parking at LA Live is criminally expensive -- $30. Park elsewhere or use Uber/Lyft.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivanabhip

40,Cursory but satisfying look at the history of the music industry through the Grammy lens,"My partner was really angling for us to visit the Grammy Museum when we were in L.A. last month, and with the 2017 Grammys just awarded tonight, I was brought back to our visit which turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, the one with no expectations about it. Rather I'm the one anxiously anticipating the overdue opening of the Academy Museum in 2018 to celebrate the motion picture industry. But Jamie's passion is music, so we were there right at 10:30AM when they open and paid our $12.95 tickets to enter.Overall the museum could be more than it is, but what they have is satisfying for music lovers. We were guided to the fourth floor where we were surrounded by perpetual clips of the Grammy Awards ceremonies through the years capped by the Grammy Award itself as it evolved over the years. This was followed by an expansive area featuring sensitive touch-screens in which we could view photos and listen to music of all genres including the true trendsetters from Elvis to 50 Cent. My partner really liked the sound-proof recording booths where various performers and producers provide guidance on the different stages of producing commercial soundtracks.The third floor was my favorite because it featured the famous outfits worn by Grammy Award-winning musicians like Michael Jackson in his iconic videos from ""Thriller"". There were all sorts of interactive stations where you could play instruments like electronic conga drums to follow your own beat. The second floor primarily featured a temporary exhibit celebrating The Ramones, as well as an intimate 200-seat auditorium for special live performances. I was bummed I missed by a week an opportunity to watch a conversation with Barbra Streisand, but alas, that's how the rugelach crumbles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed_Uyeshima

40,Great Surprise!,"Went with a group of adults for a late afternoon outing to the museum and dinner downtown and had a great time. The museum and all of its interactive exhibits was fun, informative and very reasonably priced. We each moved at our own pace and spent about 2 hours total. Friends I was with had been there before and said the displays changed each time which made it a good place for repeat visits. The temporary Ramones exhibit was really fun (especially singing along and recording one of their songs).Note: we went the night before the Grammys so reliving some of the past shows was particularly timely and fun.Bonus: discount with AAA card. Great value and well worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarapY4092PU
50,I met Phillip Phillips here,We went just for something to do and ended up meeting Phillip Phillips.Great time loved seeing the collections and the history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown

Learn how to record a record in the various recording booths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
30,Could have Been Much Better,"I am a big fan of pop music and the Grammies, but this museum disappointed. The head phones did not work well most of the time, with very poor sound quality and lots of ambient noise. And isn't to all about the incredible music? Some of the exhibits were interesting and thorough, others boring and superficial. A big contrast to the Rock `n Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland where there is high quality. They missed the boat of not mining the depth of Grammy quirks and history, breakthroughs and landmarks. Too general and superficial. Still fun, and I had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Nothing crazy,"Bought tix at the box office, couldn't find any online deals for 2 people.The museum was pretty empty. It's 4 floors and you start out at the top. Seeing the old Grammy statues is pretty cool. I liked the interactive exhibit of all different music genres flying by on the table, and being able to listen and get a brief history on each genre. Other than that, the information here is pretty generic, along with the exhibits. Outside of a few MJ jackets I didn't see anything too unique. Then again, I have never been to another music museum before. Nothing too exciting here. Worth the money if you are in the area and have time to kill, but there are much better museums in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8983VPtimothym
40,"Wow, a muesum! Oh...it's a Grammy","We had a rainy day in LA and decided to drive down to the Grammy Museum. I was a little skeptical due to influence of the Simpsons and because Jethro Tull won a Hard Rock Grammy. One we got in, I was pleasantly surprised. You take an elevator to the top floor and work your way down. There is some memorabilia, but the best part is all the hands on stuff you can play with. Whether it's playing drums, making beats on a pad, or even mixing a song, you can play with it all and more. I also really liked the 'speaker room' where you could see what music sounded like on a phonograph then the evolution through time to modern day surround sound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helmsdeep18

30,See Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' jacket!!,"For $12.95 explore 2-3 floors of various costumes, memorabilia, and artifacts from some of the most famous musicians over the years. Take the elevator up to start the tour on the floor where you will see past clips of Grammy moments. Within this room take a look at an original Grammy award and how the design has changed over the years. As you walk through this are, you will enter into an open space that covers artists ranging from Blues to Country to Pop and Hip Hop. Some of the items on display were dresses worn by Beyoncé and Whitney Houston, and costumes worn by Draft Punk during a Kanye performance at the Grammys. The section on the evolution of hip hop allows you to put on headphones and listen to how hip hop changed the music industry. On the next floor take your chance and playing guitar, the drums, singing into a mic, or working on a sound mixer like those used in recording studios. As you continue around the corner, there is a large display of clothing worn by artists at various Grammy awards in the past. Some of the clothing was worn by Anoushka Shankar, Adele, and perhaps most famous...Michael Jackson. His famous red ""thriller' jacket is on display along with a few other iconic sequined jackets and gloves. There is even a section on latin artists. The final floor displayed items by punk rockers. Overall some interesting aspects, but I expected to see more artists covered. I don't follow punk music so really the first 2 floors were the best. I'd like to see more clothing on display. If you are in downtown, it is interesting to check out but there are many more attractions in LA to see than this. Since they close early evening, I rushed around to see it within a little over an hour. If you like reading all the facts and interested in all the interactive media, perhaps plan on 2-2.5 hours. I went on a Friday night and it was not busy at all. Located next to the bustling L.A. Live section of downtown, you can enjoy a nice meal in the area after the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4GTravels
50,Really good attraction!!!!!!!,"This was something that wasn't planned, it just happen to be I was in the area and saw this and decided to visit. It was really good. There was lots of different sections with plenty to read. I really enjoyed it. I did feel a bit rushed as I did get there about 45 minutes before closing and was aware of that as I was walking around so next time I'm in LA I would defiantly go back but go in the morning time as you need a lot of time just to be able to read everything at your own pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharmaynes2016

This museum is interactive plus it has its own theatre. While we were there it was a tribute to the Ramones punk band. The theatre was dedicated to their works. This is a must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlainac2015
40,we paid $25 to park,"Following GPS,we drove past the Grammy Museum twice. Then entered the parking garage for the LA Live complex,where the Staples Center is located. Following signs to the museum,we still had to ask someone to help us. On our way out,we noticed the Grammy stars on the sidewalk.I AM a music lover and I DID enjoy this museum. All different genres,lots of history and fun interactive stations. ""Hey Ho,let's go!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uesnna
50,David Bromberg Interview and Serenade,I recently visited the Grammy Museum's Clive Davis Theater to listen to an interview with David Bromberg and then a short set of solo music. It is a very intimate theater with only 200 seats. Great place to see music or an event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeTheHighRoad
50,Not enough time...UNLESS YOU TAKE A DAY,"If you only judge by the outside, you are doing yourself a disservice. Depending on how much you like music and the history of the music will determine your appreciation. ALSO it depends on the special exhibits there how much MORE time it takes. I live in PA but have had the good fortune of being there to see the Laurel Canyon and Ramones exhibits. LOVED THEM! Entrance fee- very resonable! CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO LA AGAIN AND SEE THE NEXT EXHIBIT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiZ_13
40,Only seen the outside,Went to go see the Grammy Museum and it wasn't opened for the day yet so we walked the outside n seen the Grammy Stars. Wasn't as many as I was anticipating but they had some good ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e

50,Great interactive museum!,"Definitely worth a visit! Inexpensive admission. Very informative , with plenty of interactive displays.

40,Great museum,"Loved the interactive exhibits & in depth insights into specific musicians. The Ramones exhibit was very informative, even though I'm not a massive fan, it was engaging!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckerroob
50,Quaint and personal concert venue,"We were Grammy Museum members a few years ago and then got out of the habit but have started attending their concerts/personal up close music artist interviews again recently. The theatre is very quaint (250 seats) and you not only get to hear some known as well as unsung music but you get an in-depth and personal look at many, many artists lives and careers through the years. The membership is not necessary but it does provide early notifications and access to tickets to those hard to get artist appearances. Its not expensive either. Give it a try. Its a wonderful evening out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giname2016
50,"Relatively Inexpensive, Interactive 'Museum'","Good experience, went with my wife and infant son, we all had a great time. The Grammy Museum has a great balance of educational musical history of many/all genres, and has plenty of interactive exhibits - music making, instrument playing, short videos about the history of different artists, producers, genres, etc. Was very enjoyable, and would definitely recommend as a relaxed way to spend an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mk1826
50,Entertains and educates,"Jazz, blues, rock and roll, and pop is all covered. It includes a lot of history and also the mechanics behind making the music.It could be visited often during the year and you would learn something new each time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brukar
50,Really fun,"Took our 3 year old before nap time maybe not the best idea, but... Price is right just 12.95 for adults and kids under 5 free. Really upbeat with great music, pictures and costumes, all time frames and music styles covered, we stayed just 1 hour and 15, but could have stayed 4 hours. Museum is 4 floors, the interactive part on level 3 was really enjoyable, you can play guitar, keyboards, drums, piano and sing, somehow running through Roland professional equipment even amateurs sound like Pro's would go again 😄",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444alinas

40,Nice Artifacts,"There are 3 floors or videos and artifacts of well-known artists. In light of all the artists across all genres, I was surprised the exhibits were not more robust. But you will see some cool things and see how music is so universal through the interactive exhibit. AAA memberships will save a couple dollars for entry. Give yourself about 1.5 hours to view everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttaylor2u2
50,Not to be missed,Anyone into music should visit this museum. Filled with fabulous memorabilia and interactive experiences. The special exhibits are always a treat. Cute gift shop complements a fun time. Since the attraction is located at LA Live a lot of dining options are close at hand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Su25bag

40,Interesting,"Not very expensive $24 for two and we were pleasantly surprised. It is not a very large place and touches on a few but misses many of the greats! It still is very worth going. Being from Detroit, I was disappointed to see so many of Motown's greatest missing from the display. My 13 year old absolutely loved playing with all the hands on instruments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryBM53
30,Grammy Museum Sadly Not Enough History or Memorabilia,For the Home to the Grammy Museum located in the heart of Los Angeles this was sadly lacking. How about a whole section in Memory of those that passed? NO PRINCE? Nothing Big for Quincy Jones? Where is all the History and Artifacts of the Greatest Musicians in the World? Very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickberd
50,"If You're Ever in The Los Angeles Area, You Must Visit The Grammy Museum","Whenever I visit the Los Angeles area, I love going to one of my favorite places which is The Grammy Museum. I can honestly say that this museum is so unique and amazing! In fact, anyone who loves any genre of music will fall in love with this spot. In particular, I love how it focuses on the evolution of music over the past 100 years. Keep in mind, if you decide to visit this place, please give yourself at least a minimum of 3 hours to fully enjoy and take advantage of all the interactive musical activities and sound rooms. My favorite section is the one which allows you to listen to how certain genres of music have evolved over the years such as Rap, Country, R&B, and Rock and Roll. The display allows you to listen to music from the origin to the present. The Grammy Museum is also known to feature certain artists during certain times of the year. For example, they featured Whitney Houston following her passing. This demonstration included all of the beautiful gowns Whitney Houston wore during her Grammy performances. They also featured a display of Frank Sinatra's memorabilia. In fact, they even had a dance area for visitors to dance to his music which was packed the last time I visited. My favorite display was the one featuring The Beach Boys. I fell in love with this one because they had a letter written Brian Wilson when he was a Senior in high school. He wrote how he wanted to be a great singer and a loyal husband one day. So awesome! I have to admit that I go to The Grammy Museum at least twice a year and always discover something new each and every time. If you visit this attraction, please remember to show your AAA card for a discount on your ticket. Also, make sure you visit the souvenir shop which includes some unique items you normally wouldn't find anywhere else. In fact, this is where I buy souvenirs for my friends. I like it event better because they always have a sales rack with great items 50% off or more. I can say with confidence that you will come to love this place as much as I do after your first visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camrenettra
50,Another great piece of LA history.,The first time I came here I saw the history of Bob Marley.... It was amazing. I think this is a must to visit and well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905iana
50,Educational & Very Interesting,"I can totally recommend the Grammy Museum. Absolutely marvelous information, artifacts and interactive things. Yo8u can spend hapf a day there easily. Just make sure you take a sweater as the aircon is quite cold. Reasonable price, about $12 each. ts a fun place, and a must see for music lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewhunt
50,Home to the artists that feed your soul,"This was a very informative and entertaining tour. I particularly enjoyed the Otis Redding tribute/display. It was also interesting to see the revolution of the Grammy Award and all the clothes that the artists wore to the Grammys. I loved the history of each genre piece and got to find out where each genre originated from and who were the pioneers who drove the genre. It's also interesting to see/hear music in a timeline, you are able to really hear how music evolves through the years.Had a proud South African moment when I saw the Mafikizolo and Miriam Makeba displays. The only regret I have was not budgeting more time for it and I feel I cheated myself out of a once in a lifetime experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpho3105
40,Takes you back,If you are a music fan it gives you a clear history of the GrammiesIt is presented well. I only wish there would have been more music. But I found it interesting and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paortho
30,Might have set bar too high before visiting,"We were a bit disappointed in the displays. It is a small museum so took only 40 minutes to complete. You can spend longer by listening to various tracks. However, while we were there a 3yr old & 5yr old were given the ""run"" of the place by their parents. No one from staff chose to let this family know they were keeping others from enjoyment of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allegany
50,Fantastic Exhibits,"What a FANTASTIC place to spend a couple hours. The exhibits very well displayed and the museum was spotless. I was a bit hesitant on what I was going to see and do, but once I got there, I was blown away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophergG4299AE
20,Not what we thought it would be.....,This will be short and sweet - the tour was not at all what we thought it would be. It was self guided and I don't believe worth the money. We were in and out of there in 20 minutes. Wouldn't recommend unless you're just looking for time to kill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AandMColes
40,Nice museum,"We (2 adults) took about 1.5 hours to tour on a Sunday afternoon without viewing the special display on floor 2 for the Ramones.  It was a blast especially playing the instruments and listening with headphones.  There was plenty of interactive media, not just looking at music artifacts.  We used it as a time filler before an event at the Staples Center.  The gift shop was small and disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534KH534
40,Nice interactive museum,"Located in Downtown L.A., in the heart of the LA Live center, it is a museum Worth visiting. With interactive exhibitions (you can play various instruments) and historical objects, you will step back in time to explore music and artists of the Grammy Awards world. Temporary exhibitions and a little gift shop at the end of the visit. I only found that the entrance of the Museum is not very ideal, but otherwise a nice time visiting it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FFD1
20,Disappointment,"This was the biggest waste of time during my west coast trip. Lots of interactive things didn't work. Michael Jackson's exhibition is just one small glass showcase, only a small choice of Grammy performances... really disappointed. And it was FREEZING COLD everywhere (AC) :-(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weetek
40,Very Interactive,"I expected this place to be a typical museum housing pictures, costumes and other typical memorabilia. Surprisingly, this part of it is very minimal. What I didn't expect was all the permanent interactive exhibits. The Grammy Museum is really more of a learning center. I left with a better understanding of how all the roles of music work - songwriting, producing, singing, instrumental support, etc. My favorite exhibit by far was the evolution of sound. In the soundproof booth, you select one of four GRAMMY performances and experience the progression of sound. Start with a phonograph and end with enhanced surround sound. There is even a shoutout to the iPod of the 80s - the Walkman. Amazing how far we have come. Very cool effects.Entire museum is very small, but allow two hours to do everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveFunTravels
50,Hidden gem,Great museum with great exhibits. A must see when you visit LA. Something for every age group. It only takes about a couple hours to walk the entire museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brwneyed1
40,Absorb Yourself In The Music Scene,"This is a four story music museum (as you may have guessed) dedicated to the Grammy awards and associated concerns. Many multi-media displays and opportunities to listen to some of your favorites. Various displays will tell the history of pop music and even delve into a bit of the classics. If you've never seen the Grammies, you get a pretty good video review here. Usually there's a special exhibition going on and the 2nd floor auditorium may be used for associated films and videos, including concert performances. There's also a space where you can play simple muffled band instruments along with pre-recorded songs. School kids with annual passes come here after school to play the modified instruments. Or you can try mixing, or singing along in a sound booth. There's also a section for viewing the Grammy institution's previous educational programs - in their entirety. I watched Marty Balin and the Beach Boys being interviewed and performing. Took up almost half of my 4 hours. I recommend coming alone so you can pay attention to things you like and spend time. If you come with someone you're likely to walk right through like you were gazing at Botticelli's or someone like that. That's not what this place is. It's intensely interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
40,Musical Mashup Looking for its Identity,"I had high hopes for the Grammy Museum, and I'd have to say the 4 floors of music memorabilia and various interactive exhibits falls short of what is possible with the power of music.The only music museums I can compare it to is the MIM Music Instrument Museum in Phoenix, AZ (much better) and the Experience Music Project in Seattle. Both have a much better defined mission, and the Grammy Museum doesn't know what it wants to be. A celebration of recorded music would be the obvious choice, but they actually have very little that pertains to the history of recorded music, especially from the technical side of things. You'd think they'd have a big recording studio exhibit, or an amazing listening room so people can hear music as it is intended to be heard. They have neither.Instead it is a mishmash of records, costumes, and a few hands on displays to dink around with creating your own music.The good news is that they are priced right… $12 admission is fair considering the fact that you don't really get a powerful experience in any respect, which is sad because it could be a celebration of recorded music.They completely dismiss the reality of the music industry with the wholesale conversion to downloaded and streaming music which is both an undeniable threat and a huge issue for recording artists. I think they have a moral obligation to encourage people to PAY for their music, and also educate people that CDs sound far superior to MP3s and XM. But they don't even go there, instead showing costumes of MJ and concert posters of artists.Sadly, it would appear that NARAS is a big of a dinosaur in the world of ITunes and YouTube, and I think they have missed the mark over what a powerful and effective marketing tool this museum could be.That being said, $12 bucks and a couple of hours is well spent to check out what they have….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akamaikai
50,The best museum in town,"If you like music, any kind of music, this is the best place you can visit in LA.It has so much information, and all of the floors have interactive stations, you can litterally play instruments. Is not a place that gets crowded easily, so you can walk around and try everything.Dont miss The Ramones exhibit!!!It is really the best thing. I will be back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lafilledesmoulins
50,worth it,"we were already by the Staple center so we decided to go walk to this place. the host explains everything, this place has a few floor you move by elevator. you see a lot of costumes or musical instrument autographed by the artist. also you can hear the Wikipedia or story from a lot of pop culture biggest artist. my favorite section was the one with musical instruments, i enjoyed playing with those.I recommend this place, they have a gift shop inside as well. you pay to enter the museum it's not expensive though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariovU1536HV
50,The Grammy Museum Rocks!,This museum isn't just about the Grammy's -- it's about the American music scene. Really great exhibits and hands on stuff. Loved playing the drum kit! I spent about three hours there. Learned a lot about the music that has been the soundtrack of my life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieDoo
40,A Trip Through The Music,"The featured exhibits were The Ramones, National Guitars, Smokey Robinson and the Kingston Trio. Especially if you're not familiar with these artists/instruments you will enjoy and learn from taking them in. Each contributes to the overall story of music and defines a time and place. In addition, the permanent exhibits and interactive studios are great.On the downside, it is a smaller museum than I expected it to be and it is in downtown L.A. That always presents parking issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnnymoondog
40,Musichistory all the way,"This museum was on our 'to do ' list. It told not only about the Grammy, but about the history of music in the USA. Wirh great old tv and moviepieces. Some of the interactive screens didn't work, but the Roland exhibition made up for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsnoeck
30,Wish it was more than it is...,"Visited the Grammy Museum today, and while I had a good idea going in what it would be like, I still left with a feeling that it could be so much more than what it is. First of all the admission price is pretty reasonable, and once you get inside you'll see why. There are a few Michael Jackson outfits, a few outfits from other musicians, a decent Ramones exhibit, but that's about it. An hour is all you'll be able to spend here given the small size and lack of content. The Grammys have such a great history, it's a shame this museum doesn't quite do it justice. Good way to kill and hour, but don't go out of your way if you're not going to be in the area anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinDaveHead
40,Hey ho! Let's go!!!,"We took a trip to LA just for this exhibit. I loved it, the boyfriend thought the museum in Berlin was better.So many good things to check out if you are a diehard of the band. Joey's report cards, Dee Dee's buckwheat t-shirt, Marky's black chuck Taylor's, Johnny's statue being inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame, original promo posters from the bands CBGB days, a concert video from New Years 1977- it's awesome!Trip advisor lists their opening time as 11:30, we got in at 10:30. We also got parking on the street which was really convenient.I loved the exhibit. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the band.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragiansanti34

40,Enjoyable Visit,"If you love music, this is a great museum to visit. Good presentation of the history of popular music. The content of exhibits however is limited to size of the facility and the fact that there is so much content that they cannot possible showcase all of it. Plan on 2 hours to walk through, unless you are one that reads everything. Great interactive areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mellingson

50,The Beatles & Otis Redding - Yeah!,"For those of you who have read my previous reviews, you know I shoot straight from the hip: no nonsense – just the facts.I had no idea what to expect when we went to the Grammy Museum – boy was it fantastic! The man who took our tickets suggested me start on the top floor and work our way down. When we got there, there was a continuous feed of past Grammy moments – it’s like the greatest highlights and what a way to start the venture!I most enjoyed the interactive features of the museum: you could touch a screen and choose musical genera and see and hear samples (Opera, Soul, Blues, Funk, Rap, etc.) The cool part is – it showed how each genera was related – for example: gospel music – spirituals – blues, etc. There were also booths where you could experience how music was put together (edited).There were two exhibits: the Beatles and Otis Redding – both were wonderful and filled with film clips of performances, clothing, etc. This was a wonderful museum……. On some levels it reminded me of the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame – but better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbB1744WF
50,Chock full of rock!,"Not as big as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but equally as good. We saw the special Beatles exhibit which was very cool. You could sit behind one of Ringo's layer drum sets and take a lesson from him. They had original instruments from all 4 of the Beatlrs as well as much memorabilia from their touring years starting at the Cavern Club.They had an Otis Redding exhibit as well as the Miracles. A larger exhibit of folk music history was also up while we were there.If you are a music lover, you should stop here when you are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkR734
40,"Great for those who love music... and, their kids","I took my grandson who was 12 at the time. We've had lots of musicians in our family, so he enjoyed seeing thing that related to stories he'd heard. But, mostly he loved the interactive exhibits. One exhibit lets you hear the same song played on old phonographs through history to digital. Others have instruments you can play, or sound booths for recording. Lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalzev

20,"Small, dissapointing museum","The Grammy Museum would seem to be an ideal attraction in the great music center of Los Angeles. However, the experience was disappointing for me and my wife. Parking in the area is expensive and the museum is a bit pricey for the small exhibition space located on four floors near LA Live in downtown. There were a few overview exhibits about different musicians and musical eras, with lots of memorabilia and some musical instruments. There was some of the wardrobe worn by various musical artists and overviews of their careers and lives. They had a few very small listening booths and rooms. But the overall feel just scratched the surface of the vast history and styles of music that could have been covered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615edwards

The videos of the Grammy's were also very good. Bring a sweater. The AC in spots is chill. I actually got tickets in order to see the Beatles show which was not as much fun as the permanent exhibits.

Well laid out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fcpal425
30,"was OK, but not a must see","While staying at the JW Marriott at LA live, I decided to visit the Grammy Museum one afternoon. I wouldn't call myself a music aficionado, so this probably wasn't a good choice for me. I was disappointed by the minimal attention paid to Elvis and some other industry greats (Rolling Stones, U2, Prince, Madonna, but maybe I just missed it). There was an exhibit about the Beatles, although it was pretty superficial.Overall, I was underwhelmed by the museum. if you just need something to do to kill an hour or you're a true music devotee, it might be worth the $12.95 but otherwise I'd skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurensaunt

50,A must!,"I was very impressed with the Grammy museum and was proud and surprised to see a small exhibit of a group that my late cousin helped to found, The 5 Blind Boys of Alabama.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniigirll
50,Both interesting and fun,"We loved visiting this museum. It's amazingly interesting, we learned so much in every exhibit and room of this touristic attraction. We visited while the Taylor Swift exhibit was taking place and we really enjoyed the Karaoke Booth and the dancing station. Would totally recommend to first time travelers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaelysb2016
40,A pleasant surprise,"We went to see the Beatle display without expecting much more. We were wrong. Great displays on American folk music, Motown, blues, etc. On display were many clothes, instruments, hand-written music and lyrics of well-known performers. We spent a couple of hours. There are many restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpmc47
30,Very small museum,I would not recommend visiting the museum unless you are REALLY enthusiastic about music. The museum is very small and if it were not for the Beatles exposition I would be outside within half an hour. If you could get a good deal maybe take the gamble but it is definitely not worth the full prize.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
50,The Grammy Museum,Perfect place for music lovers. All kind of information of your favorite music star can be found. There are some interactive stations for your use and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosBodra
40,"Museum was fun, but was only good for an hour to an hour and a half","The museum had some great exhibits, mostly of the costumes worn by famous musical stars over the years, but the Beatles exhibit made it all worthwhile. That part of this museum was superb and fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudeA654
50,Fun Interactive & Musical Museum!,"We loved the Grammy Museum. The price usually is $12 per person, but because part of one of the floors was closed off due to updating an exhibit, they lowered the price to only $10 per person. The museum is located in the middle of downtown LA right next to the Staples Center. It is difficult to find parking, but we eventually found parking on the street and paid the meter. There are several public parking, but I would recommend to just do the street meter parking as that is the least expensive. It is comprised of a few floors as you start at the top and work your way down. It is informative, interactive, and fascinating. You can play instruments, watch videos, and mix music like a DJ, while offering different exhibits at various times. While we were there, ""The Miracles"" exhibit was currently featured and they were putting in the Beatles exhibit to open up soon. They also show videos on how music has changed over time from decade to decade. We also saw Taylor Swift's original paper she wrote the lyrics to her ""22"" song. If you love music this is a great place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurelsan
50,Take Your Time,I wish we had planned more time to spend here. There's so much to see and hear at the museum. I really enjoyed listening to artist talk about their music and seeing the memorabilia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MommaGiiGii
50,Enjoyable History of American Music,"The Grammy Museum is three levels of everything Grammy's. While we were there, there was a special Beatles exhibit, which included tons of memorabilia about the Fab Four. There are examples of the award trophies and how they have changed over the years, and you can even listen to some of the songs that have won awards. It's a pleasant 1-2 hour stop, and a great destination on a Sunday when there is far less traffic downtown. Admissions is about $13 for adults, less for seniors and kids. I recommend parking Lot E, which is underground and right there. After our visit, we walked around to see some of the buildings downtown, such as City Hall and the Disney Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
50,Interactive and musical!,"Location is not good, nothing to do around, and parking is veery expensive, but the entrance fee is cheap and the museum is soooo cool!!!You get to listen to different songs, play instruments, create your own remixes, and watch really cool videos. There is a session for the Latin Grammy, and one cabin to experience how the sound improved from the old gramophone to the actual surround, it is impressive!Now there is a Beatles exhibit, lots of instruments, photos, outfits and of course, you get to sing Yellow Submarine and have drums ""lessons"". My 10 year old daughter loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtbaraujo
50,Fantastic,"This Museum is fantastic in terms of covering different aspects of American music history. The museum includes interactive areas like mini glass studios that allow you to produce your own music and little audio and film histories of different artists and genres.Located in Downtown LA, the museum is close to Public transport and other tourist areas like the Staples Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73natashaa
50,A great place for music buffs and awards show lovers: Music Icons & More!,"This is a great place to beat the heat, see some amazing photos, and learn some great history about the Grammys and some of the best all time Music Legends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahw118
50,Should be fun for all ages and all fans of all genres,"I had low expectations prior to going to the Grammy Museum, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are exhibits, installations, performing costumes and interactive stations that relate to musical artists from every genre.My favorite area was the one where there were 5-6 sound booths that you could go in. Each one dealt with a different aspect of the recording process. You could lay your own tracks and do your own remixes etc.If you like music, it's almost like a science center or children's museum can be for kids. The average museum is a look and don't touch exercise, but the Grammy Museum is a great hands on for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ObjectiveWords
50,Membership is worth it!,Fantastic displays at the Grammy Museum. Membership is worth the price and the perks. Clive Davis theater is awesome to see intimate setting with many icons and famous musicians.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmdigi
40,Good to go to for special exhibits,I went for the Sinatra Exhibit. I really enjoyed it. I also spent some time looking at the exhibits they have all year round. I would come again for a special exhibit. Parking is expensive. I recommend parking a few blocks away. It will save you $10-$20.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeisatraveler
40,"If you love music, you will love this museum.","Bring your memories and bring your children or grandchildren. This is a walk through popular music's best times, with really interesting displays and hands-on activities. We loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96ralphd
40,If you like music you can't go wrong!,"Fun, interactive. Young or old everyone is singing and dancing to music. Groupon worthy. If you do not have a coupon make sure you check out what's being shown and displayed. I loved the Otis Reading and saw old tapes of him singing. What really exciting is to see your favorite artists in short videos singing and dancing. 1-2 hours should do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcd931
40,Open on Mondays...,"We went to the Grammy Museum on a whim after going to the Griffith ~ what a surprise, it is a hidden gem at LA Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyV296
50,Entertaining and Educational - Something for Everyone,"The museum celebrates American music and the Grammy Awards. The performers, composers, writers, producers and those behind the scenes of the many genres through history are represented through videos, recordings, unique artifacts and interactive displays. There's opportunities to play instruments (creating music that only you can hear) and try your hand at mixing. It was more fun than we expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabchidester
40,Music Lovers Delight,"Was on the hop on hop off bus and got off at the Grammy Museum to take a look around, very glad we did. If you love music there is nothing not to like about this place. Four floors of interesting and interactive exhibits. At the time we went there was a big exhibit of Taylor Swift, which to be honest we were not especially interested in, but it was still a wonderful display. We spent about two and half hours there and ended up taking a cab back to Hollywood, which is another story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Docsports
30,Not very much on display,"I expected a lot more Grammy related items to be seen here but was quite disappointed. There were only two floors with some actual items, one floor just had photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sychan987
50,Interactive and Informative,"We really enjoyed this place, especially the interactive exhibits like recording a song, mixing a song, making beats, and playing instruments. It was fun. We went through it in under an hour, so that was a minus, but overall, it was still worth the $24 for 4 tickets we got on Groupon. If you're a music lover, you should definitely visit this place. If you've got kids or if you're an adult just hanging around LA, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theTRE
40,Amazing collection of music history,"Spent almost 2 hours, and thoroughly enjoyed the displays of different genres of music, coupled with headphones for listening as well as audio booths to watch videos of artistes. A wonderful collection of memorabilia with costumes and letters from Michael Jackson to Otis Redding to Wynton Marsalis to Gustavo Dudamel. We were enchanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaNewportBch
40,Nice Exibit,For the music lovers this is an awesome thing to check out. They have some very cool exhibits and things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonJ657
40,A great place to visit for any music lover,"I found it on Groupon so I figured for less then 15 dollars for two its worth a shot, I wasn't disappointed in the visit :) You take a elevator to the top floor then work your way down the exhibits, the lower level is a temporary exhibit I'm assuming is usually dedicated to one artist at a time (Taylor Swift was the artist when I went) I would recommend this to families with kids older then 12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353greggl
40,Unexpected treat,"Unexpected treat if you like memorabilia. Getting to play some interactive music and sound. Looking at history of the musicians. Looking at the costumes of some of the notable musicians of our time. Elvis, Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Billie Holiday, The Supremes, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, and a whole section dedicated to Latin music and so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrilx
50,Come one come all,"If you love music and who doesn't this place is very educational. The Grammy Museum has an archival of all their interviews such as Seal, America, David Foster and many more. This gem provides a lot of history into the music industry. Becoming a member is even better because you get full access to interviews before the public. A must visit if you are in the heart of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisapF1459DM
50,Love It,"Music is well presented.Some of 'em with interactive device so it's making the experience more enjoyable.My fav part is Tupac Shakur, a beautiful poem of his is on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f_soemawidjaja
50,Super historic,The exhibits and videos in this museum are excellent and we loved all the interactive exhibits.They feature different artists on a rotating basis but have lots of grammy history about all artists and music and songwriters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38Sharon_P
40,Economic and Interactive,"For less than $15 bucks we got to explore four floors of Grammy Award history. My favorite part of the museum was the Bob Dylan photo gallery. My least favorite part was the tiny little corner devoted to the Latin Grammys. That's it? I figured since Latin America's contribution to the Grammys was big enough to get their own award show, they would definitely have more than just a small corner hidden way next to the staircase. The interactive exhibit offered hands on experience with keytars, synthesizers and drum set. There are also edit bays with guided lessons from music producers on how to work with audio. Very Cool. Definitely worth it if you are into pop music and music memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessidrpepper
40,For music lovers,"They are currently renovating one of the floors and as a result tickets are $10. I started on 4th floor and to my surprise I was the only one there, not even an employee around, that's a bit weird. I like the way they have the video screens showing past winners & their speeches, makes you feel like you're there.Lots to read & see.I loved the 3rd floor, lots of interaction stuff, from playing musical instruments and recording a track...They have a Bruce Springsteen photography exhibition in June 2016.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HandyMannyLondon
40,Only for music fans.,"Quite unusual and interesting museum. You can hear, you can watch music masterpieces. There are also such artefacts as guitars, scenic suits, and so on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skytruck
40,Expectations will determine enjoyment,"I didn't go out of the way to visit as the museum was around the corner from my hotel. The entrance price of $12.95 was reasonable as you could spend hours here if you read everything, listened to everything, played in or on all the interactive exhibits and watched everything. If you come here expecting to learn about the history of music forget it! all the music history is American and only American, I guess it is to be expected as this is the Grammy museum, the Sex Pistols got a brief mention in the history of 1970s music. The history of the Grammys didn't dominate and what was there was interesting and informative with great historic clips from past award shows. The interactive exhibits were fun and a great way to learn more about the recording process. There was an Otis Redding exhibit - the archival videos of him performing were excellent. The exhibit itself was probably interesting but badly put together with minimal information so nothing was learnt. I would not recommend people go out of their way to visit but if in the area or staying downtown then definitely take a couple of hours to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rdnkh
40,Very cool,The Grammy Museum is kind of a different place. They do have a lot of very cool artifacts but the size of the museum is so small I don't think they can display a fair amount of what they have. When we went they had a number of items on loan from Ringo Starr so that was extremely cool. Lots of drum sets and Beatles related items. They rotate their displays pretty frequently so a visit to their website is recommended. Located at LA Live so there are plenty of places to eat after your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3718XOchrisb
50,Excellent moments from musical history,"Like many have said, I could have spent much longer here. There is so much to explore, thanks to some excellent interactive exhibits. We visited on a Thursday afternoon in April and practically had the place to ourselves, so no waiting to play with the exhibits.They recommend you start on the fourth floor and work your way down. Good idea, but I went through the fourth floor more quickly than I should have because I was anxious to see what was on the other floors. The fourth floor is the best. Take all the time you want. Especially the exhibit that explores how the different genres of music are inter-related with audio examples. Fascinating! I could have played with that all day!Don't miss Rob Thomas' explanation of why he wrote his song 3:00AM in the Hal David Songwriters Award display. (And his very moving ""unplugged"" version on piano.) Never knew this, and I will never hear the song the same way I did before. Moved me to tears.Lots of special moments in this museum that bring home how much of an impact music has in our lives.P.S. Within an easy walk of Metro Center (at 7th/Figueroa), so take public transportation or Uber/Lyft to avoid parking hassles. Great bars and restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaR379
40,Nice museum for music,"The museum is extensive and educational dealing with all sorts of music. Since I am not a musician, it was simply educational for me. Worth taking the time while in the LA Live! area to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmontesa877
30,"Musical history, quite genre focused.","We spent about an hour there, and it was plenty. Similar to Seattle's EMP, but on a much smaller scale and really focused on select stars of the music industry. Features some cool items from the very famous (Michael Jackson, Elvis, etc.), and looks like the displays rotate periodically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimwD4482MH
50,A great place to learn about music.,"In addition to learning about Grammy winners and about the Grammy Awards, you can also learn about the history of different forms of music and performers, as well as how to put together a recording via hands on exhibits and visual exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dottyk362
30,Just worth the visit,"The Grammy Museum isn't the kind of experience that you'll cherish for the rest of your life, but it has just enough interesting exhibits to be worth your time, if you are deeply fanatic about music history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakingQuarters
50,Interesting and informative,"A wide range of information presented in an interesting variety of ways which should mean that everyone finds several things of interest to them no matter what their interests are.The ""mini exhibitions"" were particularly good eg Supremes fashion and Bob Dylan photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9938HFjohnp
50,Great place to kill time,"Went during the week in the afternoon and it was not busy at all. Not allowed to take pictures but people were doing so anyway with their phones... Wonderful displays and videos throughout... Super informative and even interactive (in the ""sound"" area there are private ""booths"", kinda fun). Rotating displays- on this occasion Otis Redding, the Supremes, and Bob Dylan had special displays. Absolutely wonderful. A must for music lovers and Grammy watchers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizeryztool
50,Surprising how so little can pack so much,Its doesn't give off the feel of a big museum but it sure does pack in a lot of information and fun. There were so many interactive experiences it was hard to choose my favorite. As i said I was surprised by how much was there and how ther was to do. I was sorry I didn't allot more time to spend here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1HudsonLvr
40,Fun indoor activity with tween,"Interactive exhibits let you become the rock star, producer or rapper. Fun to see the dresses and suits worn by Supremes, Otis Redding, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. The highlight for my ten year old: Handwritten Taylor Swift lyrics! Memorable and more fun than anticipated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniemI8283CQ
40,Great couple of hours,Last Saturday was one of the very few times it rains in Los Angeles. Since we couldn't go to the beach we decided to walk to the Grammy Museum. We spent about two and a half hours there. It was enough to see everything there that we were interested in. We enjoyed our visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marievh
40,Enjoyable visit,My teenage boys love music and they really enjoyed this stop. There are a lot of hands on exhibits and something for every genre of music. We spent a couple of hours here and could have spent longer if we didn't have other things planned for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
50,Wow!,The Grammy Museum is the California answer to the awesome Rock N Roll hall of fame. If you love music - Go! Fabulous special exhibits - we saw Otis Redding & Ravi Shankar - great archives and even a stage to pretend you're a rock star. Great listening booths and a theater - we saw archived film footage of Bob Dylan .Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joang82
50,Surprisingly nice visit,"We took a quiet Sunday to visit and our teens especially loved it. (after a stroll to the nearby Staples Center). It's not expansive, but the sampling is excellent and video and audio clips were cool for both teens and parents to see. Parking was the only drawback -- we spent a lot in a city lot of this downtown entertainment/eating district and probably didn't have to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amesman96
40,Worth a Visit & Lunch,"We spent about 2.5 hours at the Grammy Museum. The exhibits are very fun if you are into music. The location of the museum is next to the Staples Center, and L. A. Live, with numerous restaurants in which to have lunch, dinner, or drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaT503
40,For music buffs,We went to the museum and enjoyed the various exhibits. Not sure if we got value for money but as it was near Staples Centre and LA Live we decided to have look anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rykony
50,Great for kids and their adults,We came to the Grammy Museum with two little ones in tow and we all had a blast! We loved the costumes and videos. The kiddos enjoyed playing the instruments. The sound room was super interesting where we got to listen to recordings on different mediums. We've since recommended the museum to others who are planning trips to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammimarie
20,"More exhibits of clothes, then music","I was excited to see the Grammy Music was located across from our hotel. My coworkers and I were a little surprised at the high price of the ticket. There were more exhibits of Grammy gowns, then actual music artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seiderjps
40,Interesting way to spend a couple of hours,"For people who have been into popular music for at least 20 years, it’s a great place to see costumes, learn history, experience sights and sounds and also play with interactive music making equipment and processes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/machofairy
50,Wonderful museum,"I really enjoyed this museum, wasn't sure what to expect but l just loved it. We spent almost 3 hours exploring the museum. The exhibits were very interactive which enhanced the experience. What a great way to spend an afternoon, would recommend for any lover if music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beadsrule
30,It'sinteresting,"Once was enough for me. The exhibits are so=so, but there is some interactive programs available. If you are a fan of current music, you'd like it a lot more than I did. We went for a special Sinatra exhibit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfandbeach
40,Interesting and interactive,"Easy to get to from the Subway (Metro) in Downtown L.A, fine to take photos.Lots of musical history here in various forms such as videos, sound booths, costumes, photos, etc. Really good fun if you're into music of course.They do have a gift shop and also a mini ""Walk of Fame"" on the sidewalk outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellm691
50,Great museum,"I've been a member since they opened, they have great rotating exhibits and small intimate performances for members only. I've seen Jerry Lee Lewis, The Beach Boys and others in a setting like being in your living room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wingdam
50,Worthwhile Visit,This multi-story museum is dedicated to everything related to Grammy and is very interesting. There are exhibits and items that are originals and cannot be seen anywhere else. They also use technology to make some exhibits interactive and entertaining. Highly recommended for music lovers of all genres.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SgtBuffy
40,Fascinating hand on exhibits along with the information about famous musicians,"Less typical museum because of its set up. Yes, there is a drum set from a favorite rock group and other memorabilia; in addition, however, there are exhibits that are hands on - so more engaging. Young people and adults will enjoy this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl103
30,The Sinatra visit was worth it...other than that,"We primarily went to see the Sinatra exhibit which was very well done and very well put together. What a great retrospective of his career and life.If it was not for that I wouldn't say the museum was worth a visit. I guess I expected more from the Grammy museum. It literally pales in comparison to the MIM in Scottsdale. The Grammy museum only seemed to focus on the last 10 years or so really, it seems like they could have delved so much deeper into the history of the Grammys.They did have some fun interactive booths, where you could mix or record a song, but for being in one of the epicenters of the music industry with so much history and technology at their disposal I expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zuza11
50,Loved the museum needed more time,This is a great place to relive your concert experience. There is no end to the music and learning experience. The interactive booths allow you to experience how the industry goes about creating an album. The variety of music on the music database board kept me going back to see the origins of music styles. If you're able take public transportation to the area though parking can be found it can be expensive. There are plenty of restaurants surrounding to museum so make it a day and evening event. Great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msterjedi
50,Wow!,"We kept seeing banners in town about the Sinatra 100 years celebration, and found it here! Incredible displays, history, and music venue! Worth the admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbB2000
50,"The ""Sinatra: American Icon"" exhibit was phenominal!","I got to visit this museum, and more specifically the exhibit celebrating Frank Sinatra's Centennial, as a special gift from my Valentine. As a life-long Sinatra It did not disappoint. It was quite something to be inches away from his awards and personal memorabilia while reminiscing on stories I have read about for years. The recording booth where one could sing along with ""Ole' Blue Eyes"" was tons of fun, especially as it was to my favorite song ""That's Life."" Other highlights include a second interactive option to send a photo gram of your self in various Sinatra outfits placed in different locales, or playing a juke box completely devoted to the singer's tunes. One doesn't see that every day, if ever in my generation of punk & 80's glam rock! I loved it. Seeing his pieces face to face, rather than in art books, was a unique experience I never thought possible also. Many times I was almost brought to tears at the thought of what I was experiencing. My favorite item, one that took me aback, was the microphone from an early radio show the performer competed on. This item, pictured with this review, ""The Major Bowes Radio Amateur Hour"" mic, that actually turned out to be a replica, but quite stirring nonetheless, showcased the pivotal moments in some of Frank's earliest recorded history. I loved every second on this floor of the Grammy museum, and want to thank the family for letting his adoring public experience these views. Thanks to the families of the other featured artists for sharing their memorabilia shown in, to name a few, ""The Otis Redding Respect"" exhibit, as well as the fascinating instrument and paraphernalia shown in Ravi Shankar's display. Other highlights include a temporary exhibit with many of the gorgeous costumes of The Supremes' own Mary Wilson, as well as the interactive drumming area in the Latin Grammy section. There was also a spoken word section dedicated to the late great George Carlin. Fun & informative excursion all around. And afterward, out back, when done working up an appetite walking around the Grammy objects, check out the food court type atmosphere at L.A. Live behind the building, almost adjacent to The Staples Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffMateas
40,Highlight of museum are the Interactive displays,"The museum has 3 floors of amazing memorabilia from all types of music. Costumes, handwritten lyrics, etc. Very interesting. The layout is a bit strange and it's easy to miss some of the displays. The area with the ""studios"" for music production were the highlight of this museum. Each booth gave you an overview of each of the stages required to produce a record. Who knew that so much had to be done after an artist records a track? Also, the digital MIDI display with instruments that you actually were able to try out was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/menderle
40,Great History of Music in just a few hours,"I went during the Taylor Swift Experience exhibit, which colors my review a bit because the Taylor Swift exhibit was AMAZING. Overall, it's a great overview of the history of the Grammy and music in the 20th century. Don't make a special trip just to see this (unless the Taylor exhibit is still there), but definitely add it as a stop if you're in the Downtown area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audreys435
40,Love the costumes,"Nice little museum for anyone who likes music. Informative and fun, with some interactive exhibits. Close to,Staples center and Microsoft Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smspo
50,Joyful & Thorough - Feel the Beat!,"-Unexpectedly well done museum! Lots of interactive exhibits to allow you to both see, hear, and learn. Small, booth-type areas allow museum-goers to experience music history, music types, and technical aspects in an approachable and interactive way. Plus, outifits from the Supremes, Michael Jackson, and others. A real delight.Small enough to be done in an afternoon, not overly expansive but well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eggplan91106
40,Fun Interactive Music Museum,"If you are a fan of the history of music, when you are in downtown LA, it is worth checking out. When we visited on one of the floors they had a Frank Sinatra tribute going on. They also have a floor where you can watch videos and listen by headphones. We enjoyed visiting the Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452RobertG452
40,Frank Sinatra Exhibit is Excellent,"We went here because of the Sinatra 100th Birthday exhibit, but I was surprised at everything else that there is to do. You start at the top of the building and work your way down. I feel more educated about rappers, since I've been there.It's quite interactive and you can go into booths and sing, or listen to other people sing. There were some amazing stage costumes including some from The Supremes.There were a lot of Grammy's to look at too.The Frank Sinatra exhibit had a free Jukebox with all of his records on, it also had a booth you could sing along with him in and a recording of a recording session, with his chat in between records. It also had lots of memorabilia, we went in December and it was quiet on a Monday perfect for having a go on everything, I could imagine it being very busy at weekends.We parked in the Staples Center, pretty much only car in there! It was really quiet round the whole area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375sharonr375
40,What a great place for everyone.,"It's very interactive in playing instruments, being in the recording studio, using the knobs for voice/sound modulation, and listening to yourself rap. There are different booths that teach you different steps in recording (ie mixing, voice pans, etc) There is a wall of past Grammy winners for Album of the year since its very first year, music's evolution in different time periods, etc. There is so much to do here and so many things to learn. Also, visit the Clive Davis theatre and learn a thing or two more about music.Although, I would pass on the Grammy store. Things are too overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
50,Hidden Gem!!,"This place is a hidden gem that is not touristy at all. We went to the Broad in the morning and walked down to The Grammy Museum. It was only a 15 minute walk. We arrived around 2.30pm and there were maybe 6 other people there. The museum isn't big, but it is filled with such history and information. If you enjoy music you will love this place, especially if you want to get away from the huge crowds too. We visited the Tupac and Frank Sinatra exhibitions that were on. You can also try your hand at being a sound engineer a recording artist, as they have these sound booths that you can go in. I really enjoyed the booth where you could select a track and you could experience the sound on a Gramophone, Vinyl, Cassette and in Hi Definition. There was a jukebox where you could hear old Frank Sinatra records. We spent a good 2 hours in there. Crowd free, fun and not too expensive. Would highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leeya_uk
50,A must for music lovers!,"We spent more than 2 hours going thru the 3 rooms full of exhibits: Michael jackson, The Supremes, Frank Sinatra, Ravi Shankar, Tupac and we were not disappointed!The exhibits are very detailed and pretty cool. This is a great attaction for music lovers, even my teenage son had a great time!Do not miss it if you are in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaMagdalena
50,Must see for lovers of all genres of music,"We could have spent more than the 2 1/2 hours we had free, exploring this great museum. There was a great tribute to the Supremes, Frank Sinatra and Ravi Shankar during our visit. The museum was easy to navigate and the staff was helpful. We will recommend a visit to the museum to our family and friends that may be visiting the area in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stitchin'goddess
50,JUST GO. TRUST ME.,"What a perfect gem of a museum! Even cranky pre-teens and edgy adolescents love this place. Why not? IT IS THE GRAMMY MUSEUM!!! All music, all the time. Not too big, nicely signed, terrific permanent exhibits. Yes, Ella Fitzgerald is there. And the Beatles. Really, don't miss this place. Trust me, I'm a librarian.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankellen178
30,Add a rataing if you like the rotating exhibit artist,This museum in downtown LA is relatively new and fairly small. 3 floors of music paraphernalia and rotating exhibits. The highlight is definitely the “In the Studio” interactive display on level 3. 8 booths take you through a recording process and let you control certain inputs – very interesting and the interactive aspect is lots of fun. The rotating exhibit was Frank Sinatra which was very detailed but as I am not a fan I could not appreciate it. Definitely check in advance on the rotating exhibit and your rating will go up accordingly. A nice place to spend an hour for 13 bucks – and I learnt a few things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dupetersentravel
50,Amazing place if you are a music industry follower,"This museum has a lot of good information regarding the recording and music industry.If you are into recording music, then please take the time to experience the cabins regarding mixing, re-mixing, mastering, etc, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilianoZM
50,loved the Taylor Swift experience,"This place is great for adults and kids who are into music, they can learn about their favourite artists, see videos, play games, see costumes and play instruments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alfajorefi
50,"Wow, who knew?","What a great, great museum! If you like music at all, this place was terrific. We caught a Tupac Shakur exhibit, and having known almost nothing about him (and really not caring much), we learned so much and really found a new appreciation for his work. That was balanced with a Frank Sinatra exhibit, more our speed, and it was amazing. Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebinPhilly
50,Loved it!,"If you're interested in Grammy's and music in general, visit the museum! I loved all the interactive stations where you could try what it's like to be a musician, a producer and what-not. The equipment were all very high quality too. There's a lot of information available, so make sure to reserve some time for the visit to make the best of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summeri94
40,Worth the stop,"We were staying in the area and had a little extra time. We didn't see many people going in and out of the museum and the price $15/person made us wonder if it was going to be worth it.The museum is 4 stories high. The tour begins at the top and there are many interesting, interactive music-related activities on the 4th floor. We very much enjoyed it.The third floor is similar, with mixing booths you can learn about some of the production process in. Quite a few videos you can listed to of different artists. There were different instruments that you can play with, which was quite fun! We learned about the Grammy award process as well.The second floor is dedicated to the special exhibit. The special exhibit during our visit was ""Fran Sinatra"", who we aren't huge fans of so that wasn't of much interest to us. The first floor is simply where you begin so there isn't anything to see there.It took us a couple of hours to move through the exhibits, and we enjoyed it. We were glad we had gone. There is a very small gift shop, but most of the museum is truly museum exhibits - which is nice, as it isn't a ""tourist trap"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818BB
50,Beautiful museum,"Very inexpensive tickets for what you see - the displays are interactive and interesting. Not just walk up and read, there are photos, memorabilia, notebooks of the artists writings, clothing owned and worn by artists. Pick up headphones and hear interviews, music, etc. Grammy highlights to watch - very entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travilgurl
50,Worth going out of your way to see,"This is undoubtedly one of the best museums we have ever seen. It is a bit out of the way at Staples Center/LA live and for those of us (like me) who aren't historians of pop music, you might think that it wouldn't be of interest. However, it is full of history, hands on exhibits that are working, interactive, and stunning. You can sing along with Frank Sinatra, you can record your own tracks, you can see interconnections of music styles going back to classical and how they are connected to contemporary styles while hearing multiple examples of each. You can, of course, see some actual grammies and how they have changed over the years. There are many wonderful videos with stunning sound tracks. There is even a room where the history of recording can take you from an Edison cylinder to Dolby surround sound. The museum is wonderfully laid out, easy to navigate and understand, and can easily occupy an entire day of your time during which you will be incredibly entertained and educated. Very well worth the admission price and near good public transportation--which most of LA is not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatthehellisthat
40,Great for Sinatra fans,Four floors of grammy winning singers and song writers. My favorite was the whole floor they had dedicated to Frank Sinatra to celebrate his 100 birthday. If your a Sinatra fan its a must see absolutely worth the 12 bucks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4355DUsteves
50,Informative!,"The Museum: Located at LA Live plaza. The museum entrance is facing Figueroa. 3 stories museum. 2nd floor is ALL about Sinatra. Many display about the music legends. Very informative!The Clive Davis Theater: Small but intimate theater. Every seat is good seat. We were there for ""Ukulele Beatles with KoAloha"" performance. Two young super talented musician - Ryan Imamura and Ryo Montgomery are FANTASTIC. They are both in their early 20's and they play absolutely amazing ukulele!! Both of them are self-taught too.Not only they play great music but also have great sense of humor. The whole evening is indeed entertaining! Thanks KoAloha Ukulele for bringing this great performance to LA!! We hope to see you again next year~The Parking: LA Live parking structure (East side), can be pricey . There are private parking lots on Olympics charging flat rate, cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
40,So much fun,If you like music of any kind this is a place to go for a fun experience. When we arrived the person at the ticket desk said it would take about an hour and a half. After more than two hours we realized that we had to come another time to see and experience everything. We went to see the George Carlin exhibit but there was so much more. Several floors of music and audio and video clips and exhibits. We plan to go back next time we're in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnSanFran_12
50,Music at its best!,"How would you like to go to several concerts under one roof and hear music from the whole genre? The Grammy Museum is a small museum which can take up to 2-3 hours to really appreciate it. The Frank Sinatra exhibit with one of his concerts showing in the Clive Davis theatre was outstanding. Watching snippets of Grammy award singers singing from the Grammy awards throughout the years was like going down memory lane. Looking at the lyrics and notes from Tupac sent goose bumps down my arm as his music was playing overhead! So much talent and way ahead of his time. Looking at the costumes that the singers wore and listening to the music and the history of it all is well worth a visit for any age. The museum is divided into 4 floors of history. Starting from the 4th floor and working your way down made it easy to follow along in time. If you are military connected or a student you will receive a discount off the reasonably priced tickets. Nestled next to LA Live you are steps away from restaurants, Staple Center and the Microsoft Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141
50,Loved the Sinatra exhibition!,"Let me preface this with....I'm jaded. My father played on all the Sinatra recordings, so the Chairman of the Board was a revered fixture in our home. When I went to the exhibit with a good friend, I wasn't disappointed. Yes, I saw my father on film as I had hoped. But the exhibit displayed a good timeline--from Sinatra's early days in New Jersey to his later years in recording. Great photos --even a mug shot from when he got arrested. I'll leave it at that. If you're a Sinatra fan, I think the exhibit will bring a smile to your heart. He did it his way....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Towanda4Snix
40,"Nice couple,of hours",Went begrudgingly with a couple of friends and enjoyed myself more than I expected. Very interesting and for music fans it would be fascinating. Spread over four floors. You start at the top and work you're way down. Lots of outfits to see and things to listen to. Lots of Frank Sinatra and even Tu Pac. It covers the range. There is also a walk of stars on the pavement nearby.Thoroughly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesF14
20,Meh,"Not that great. Looked for rock and roll artifacts, but only patting themselves on the back for handing out their awards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_r_S550
50,Excellent,"I went with my wife, mainly to see the Frank Sinatra exhibition which was superb. That said, the other material was really interesting - all kinds of everything. We really enjoyed the section dedicated to The Supremes !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinGLondon
50,Fantastic Experience,"We didn't know too much about the Grammy Museum until we went to L.A. for a visit to the Fabric District nearby. The Museum is filled with information on all genres of music throughout many years. We could have stayed for more hours to experience this music museum. Plenty of parking nearby, near Staples Center downtown. We'll be back. Price of admission well worth it (it's low).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1rialta
50,Great Little Museum,"we love the Grammy Museum, there is so much to see and learn about the music and the entertainers. The exhibits are always awesome and though it is small, it hold lots of memobilia, love this place, If you are looking for something different to do, then check out the Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiel534
50,What a collection!,"You must go see the collection of Grammy musicians and awards. They had a cool display of Michael Jackson, which was my highlight. But, so much is there, that I would hate to spoil it for anyone. YOU GOTTA GO! It's affordable and awesome. Hope you like it as much as I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbyW649
50,What a fun museum!,"This is a must-do while visiting Los Angeles. I was lucky enough to go while they had the Taylor Swift experience, but the rest of the museum is great too! If you like music and pop culture-for sure go. It was also really cool to see the students that they brought in to do an educational program.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deltawanderer61
50,Unexpected gem,"This museum was not something we were planning to visit, but I'm glad we did. It is well curated, and the exhibits were very interesting. The layout of the museum is logical, and the interactive exhibits were fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noonles
50,So much modern history in one building,"I wasn't hoping for too much when i first read about this in my tour book, but i was pleasantly surprised....On a hot day it nice to get away from the direct sun for a few hours and you really can spent hours here....It opened my eyes to taylor Swift who has a whole floor dedicated to herself.... i never realised she worked so hard.If you're a music fan, then please visit here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
50,Highly recommended visit!,"It might hold true that one must come when there is an interesting exhibit, but we definitely lucked out during our visit here. We spent more time than we thought going through the floors of the museum. The various film clips, interactive instrument display, photographs, etc. piqued our interest at all levels. While we were there they celebrated Sinatra (10/21/15-02/15/2016), the Supremes (06/25/2015-Spring 2016), and Tupac Shakur (extended through 01/10/2016). Each exhibit was nicely presented with audio clips of their music. A definite must-see during your trip to Los Angles! Parking is expensive at the Staples Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepperNewJersey
30,Enjoyed the musical instruments,"The Grammy Museum appears to be in its infancy and has a lot of room for growth. In fact, they were redoing most of the second floor during our visit so the Clive Davis Theater was closed as well as several exhibits so they reduced the entry fee and disclosed the situation upfront (which was nice.) We enjoyed what we saw, and the section with musical instruments (you play with headphones on so you can hear the music) was fun, especially for older children. It is nice to visit if you happen to be in the area or are staying at LA Live. I wouldn't make the effort otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzieraesmom
50,An Excellent Exhibition,You could actually spend hours in this place. There is just so much to see and so many facts to take in. There is also an interactive area where you can play instruments and compose music. Wow we were blown away with this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westysquest2015
50,"Didn't know this existed, but it was very interesting.","I found this because it was on the street between my hotel and the Convention Center. They were doing a Sinatra tribute when I visited which did not interest me, but the other 2 floors were fascinating. They also had some booths devoted to various aspects of the recording process. I was a bit pressed for time so I could not take in all of those, but I enjoyed the one I saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pstacy
40,Music memorabilia!,"We spent an enjoyable few hours at the museum to see personal effects, including costumes, of some of music's greats: Michael Jackson, the Supremes, Elvis, Whitney, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Beyoncé, Jimi Hendricks, Frank Sinatra, BB King, and many more. They offer special exhibits periodically, so check their website to see what they're showing when you'll be there. Most items are clearly marked with interesting information, it's wheelchair accessible with an elevator for three floors, there are sound booths to listen to various recordings, and there is paid parking underground. They don't validate so watch your time - it can add up to several $$$ if you also dine in one of the restaurants in the complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
50,Music Lovers must visit...,"I was glad that I made the time to head over to the Grammy Museum for a visit. I was able to see most in @ an hour, however, there is quite a few videos to watch and things you can do so wished I had planned for 2 hours. Definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LOVEtoTRAVEL55555
30,Neat place with a Groupon,"My husband and I had a Groupon that we needed to use up by the end of October, so we visited this museum last weekend.The museum nicely presented the pop memorabilia and it was fun to look at everything. There was a rather large exhibit on Ravi Shankar, I thought this was bigger than necessary since he wasn't a mainstream icon.My husband LOVED playing around in the music mixing booths and with the instruments.I would say you need about 2 hours at this museum to really see it all. Try to get a Groupon if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
40,Interesting...,"While visiting friends they suggested the Grammy Museum and that turned out to be a great suggestion.The entry fee was $10 for seniors. Not too bad these days.You enter on the ground floor and take an elevator to the topmost floor and wind your way down through the different displays on each floor. The museum is nicely arranged and the displays are informative. One of our favorites was a George Carlin video from the Johnny Carson Show. The four of us seniors stood there watching and laughing while several much younger visitors walked on by giving us puzzled looks. Another interesting display, among many, was the Sound Room. It is tucked into a corner and easy to miss and it gives an audio tour of recording history. It starts by playing the sound from an old cylinder recording through to today’s latest and greatest multi speaker sound systems. A great comparison of how sound has changed over the years.The themes and displays change from time to time. The current “star” was The Supremes and the next will be Frank Sinatra. A running video of the Grammy winners from 1980 to the present was very entertaining. It showed clips from all music genres.All in all it was a great way to spend a couple of hours. I’d say the Grammy Museum is a “don’t miss”. It is small enough to enjoy easily and interesting enough to spend your money on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelertoo2
50,Rock your way through time. A great place to visit,"If you love music and musicians, come experience it at this Museum. The pictures, decor and hands on experience of you playing instruments is a Nirvana experince.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,A Must in L.A.,"Just at the corner of L.A. Live, the museum was quiet on a Sunday morning. Excellent exhibition on the Grammy history and the music in general. Special floor and movie theater on the Taylor Swift Experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryL549
30,"Fun, but wait till interesting exhibit is there","The Grammy Museum displayed some Grammy statues, famous singers' costumes, and had lots of music available to hear. The compilation films the museum put together of exceptional awards programs were really good, but weren't for sale.If I lived in the Los Angeles area, I would wait until there was a special exhibit of interest to visit. The Museum was installing an exhibit about Frank Sinatra while we were there so ticket prices were slightly reduced.One note, parking is a nightmare in the area. Be prepared to pay big bucks to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panpanda
50,A Great Small Museum,"This is a great small museum if you love popular music. The exhibits only take up two small floors at LA Live, but they are very interactive. You should take your time, experience it all and even this smallish museum will take at least a couple of hours.We particularly liked the booths that explained many aspects of how a song gets from sheet music to a finished record. Fun and interesting. When we were here there were special exhibits about theSupremes, Tupac, and Ravi Shankar. Pretty eclectic.The only downside I can think of is the rather pathetic gift shop. Given the subject matter this should be one of the best gift shops in town. Oh well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhopelain
40,Why Not? For Grammy-holics ......,It's OK to endulge in your fantisties & visit the Grammy Museum. Lots of items & memorabilia galore. You'll surely get you fill. This is magic tinsel town after all ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Something For Everyone,"Something to appeal to everyone, I suppose, although not everything will appeal to any one person. We went here for a private concert, and it was a very good and intimate venue for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
30,Depends on Featured Artists,The interactive displays at the start are good. We'd have liked a few more famous artefacts from some of the stars and less clips of the Grammy ceremony. You can get that on YouTube.One thing that will change your enjoyment is the rotating exhibits. An entire floor devoted to Taylor Swift does nothing for us. Shame the George Carlin exhibit isn't opened yet.Check out who is featured before you decide when to come.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/changingworship
50,Great interview,Recently went there to see the Steven Van Zandt interview. Very nice small setting for a live interview.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcapps111
40,And the award goes to.....,Really enjoyed the visit here. There are different exhibits running at different times so check the schedule before you go but even if it isn't a full exhibit for the artist of your choice I am positive that if they are renowned there will be some sort of small display with some of their memorabilia. Really enjoyed the Tupac exhibit but in the souvenir store the selection didn't match the exhibit which was disheartening. You can see and view the 4 floors within a 2 hour visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess123182
40,A nice past time,"We had a free day while spending time in LA and decided to visit the museum. We both love music and never miss th Grammy awards. The fee is very low by LA standards. We wandered around for approx 2 hours and enjoyed ourselves. One small annoying thing is everywhere states NO pictures, so we didn't take any (even though I wanted to). However we noticed that many people were taking pictures while the staff watched them and said nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachcouple57
50,Worth a Visit,Great memorabilia pieces here. And entrance fee was very reasonable. Plan to spend a couple of hours here at least.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sher056

50,Taylor Swift Exhibit was wicked awesome!,"We went here for the special Taylor Swift Exhibit and it was amazing to see her instruments, costumes, awards and childhood possessions on display! My friend's painting that she gave her was also there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swanny13
50,"Real fun, worth it","Engertainig museum with original clothing of the stars. You can try different instruments and mixing. Everyone loves music so don't miss it. There are dedicated sections to Indian music and 2Pac.Hint: next to Staples Center. They have reduced entries after 8, however 2 hours are needed to completely enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becseyz
50,"If you love Music, you'll love this!","My first visit and I was very impressed. Very interesting place and very well put together. This is a must do in LA if you love music, or indeed want to learn a load more about it. Packed with information all around and lots of interesting exhibits. Loads of public parking, reasonably priced within just a few minutes walk and loads of nice places to eat nearby too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alij293
40,Fascinating stuff,"We visited on our last day in LA and really glad we did, as two huge music fans this was fascinating stuff.The exhibits of outfits and lyrics were great, but what I really loved was the map linking the music scenes and the US maps showing the mini scenes geographically!Now, it wasn't as good or as big as the country music hall of fame is Nashville, but definitely worth going, will easily fill 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kerrypanda
40,Entertaining and informative,"We could easily have stayed for twice the two hours we spent at the museum, just listening to all of the music and learning more about genres and history. We especially enjoyed the Taylor Swift Experience because we learned something about her as an artist and cultural figure. And it was fun to share the recording booth with her! Another highlight was the chance to hear favorite recording artists on different kinds of media, as if they had been recorded on old-style gramophones compared to MP3s with earbuds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cranberries0928
40,Good way to spend a couple of hours,We spent an enjoyable 3 hours playing on all the inter active exhibits and viewing the collection of memorabilia from stars of today and yesterday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillericayEngland
50,Selections of Music Cultures on Review,"Music on review from the top level where you start the tour down thru the subsequent levels with changing displays of music instruments, photographs, personal artifacts, etc., ending with an exit thru the Gift Shoppe featuring unique limited edition items curated from articles on display. Family friendly, stroller and wheelchair accessible. A really nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celya723
20,Skyler Stone,"This was a comedy event in the Clive Davis Theatre. The Grammy Museum, as always, is absolutely wonderful! Skyler Stone, however, is not particularly amusing and is just plain obnoxious with his hyper ramblings and erratic behavior as if he is jacked up on cocaine, despite claiming to be sober. Bill Burr, who is normally quite funny, was rude to the audience and the museum... not part of a joke, just rude. The surprise unnamed guest was hilarious from beginning to end; sorry, wish I knew his name. Jim Jefferies was very funny, but not at his finest. Gene Simmons seemed distracted and uncomfortable in the free-form format of the evening, mostly giving shout-outs to his family. Of note, he was served with a search warrant shortly thereafter... perhaps that is why he was distracted. Overall, a disappointing event that should have left us sore from laughing and wanting more but instead had us wanting to walk out almost as soon as it started.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoundingMember
50,Impressively well done,"I'm not a music guy, but I loved the Grammy museum. It's new on the scene, but it's here to stay. The concert/lecture series room is a legend in the making. I saw Childish Gambino and there were only 200 people in the room. I felt like it was my living room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleV174
40,Very informative trip,"Had a great time visiting the Grammy museum, especially the Tupac exhibit.Interactive things for everyone, including kids.Could have done without the Taylor Swift experience though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RVD26
40,Interesting,"I visited with my 16 year old son and wasn't quite sure what to expect. It turned out to be very interesting and educative - there's enough to keep most people occupied for a couple of hours. The Taylor Swift exhibition was impressive, even for an oldie like me who is not a fan! I particularly enjoyed the recording studio booths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOGLEWALK
40,Great value for an interesting few hours,"I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. It was only $10 entry (because we couldn't access the top level due to a private function) and we spent about 2hrs looking around.It's not a big museum but there is plenty of really cool and interesting memorabilia. There are sections for Joan Rivers and Michael Jackson, beautiful clothing and instruments and a whole floor of Taylor Swift at the moment (which was awesome!).It's located in LA Live so there is also plenty to see/do and restaurants and bars around the area too. It was a great afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBs_gone_wild
50,Unexpected fun,"This museum was a last-minute decision, and it ended up being one of the favorite parts of my 13-year-old's vacation (impressive considering we were in California for two weeks). Well the Taylor swift exhibit was cool, and we enjoyed it, we spent far longer in all the recording booth and listening stations. You could do this museum in the two hours where your parking is cheaper, but when I go back I'm going for far longer. There is so much more to do!! I was also pleased when they let me in for free after showing my teacher ID. Make sure you tell them you an educator. Also, children five and younger are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderingAB
40,Unexpected fun!,Our 16 year old daughter wanted to visit as a part of our L.A. Trip. The whole family including our 12 year old son had fun and found something they liked. Taylor Swift floor was very cool and Tupac exhibition was interesting even though was not a fan. Some great interactive games for everyone and it was very quiet midweek!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1896NXtimm
50,Lovely although small museum,"Set aside about 2.5 hours and that should be plenty of time for this museum - Although small there was heaps of interesting exibits! I particularly enjoyed the 2pac exzhibit that had original copies of 2pacs notepads with some of his poems and songs written. Also, for the taylor swift exzhibit it was great to be able to mix levels on one of her songs and see all of the different outfits she has worn. Other highlights were the music throughout the years section about how rap and pop music have changed and been influenced by other genres through time and I also enjoyed some of the michael jackson costumes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukeNickels
40,"Has your favourite artists been nominated or won a Grammy, the history of Grammys is a good visit!","If you are into music and music history and the history of the Grammy awards it is worth a visit. Had a private party, the room and service was good and included access to the complete museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCMS
50,Well worth a visit,"As music fans we really enjoyed looking around the museum, there are lots of interactive exhibits so you aren't just reading and looking at things. The Taylor Swift exhibit was there when we visited, which was an added bonus we weren't expecting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647davep
40,Teenagers LOVED the Taylor Swift Exhibit; Mom loved all of it!,This is a great museum for music lovers of all ages! Loved the songwriters award section - and the retrospective on the Supremes! And the real draw was the Taylor Swift exhibit which my teenagers thought was heaven .... complete with singing in the sound booth! Great collection of memorabilia; clothing; home video(s); etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCKi
50,Taylor Swift Experience!!!,Went only to check out the taylor swift experience as a die hard swiftie and had an incredible time and was engrossed in everything else they had on display! the staff were so lovely around the whole museum. Interactive and a great way to spend a few hours. Loved that the two girls working in the taylor swift experience offered to take my photo infront of the entrance without me having to ask which was amazing. best customer service and over-all a must do for anyone who goes to LA. Plus some amazing restaurants just next door too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363maddiek
40,Fun afternoon!,"My husband and I live in LA but have only been here a year and often look to Tripadvisor for things to do here. We spent about 2.5 hours at The Grammy Museum today (and found a Groupon so it cost only $12 for the two of us to go). We both had a great time - learning about the history of music, learning about how it is put together (mixed, remixed, etc.). A lot of it is interactive. Even if you aren't a Taylor Swift fan, the Taylor Swift Experience was really fun. I would recommend this to museum to anyone interested in music and culture (as a lot of music reflects political movements, etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugsick
50,Great time!,"I had a great time at the Grammy Museum. I spent about 2 hours here because I was rushed, but I wish that I had more hours to spend. Many of the exhibits are interactive and you can play multiple artists as you learn about different musical styles. I was blown away by the elevator landing with it's bigger than life replays of Grammy performances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkkwong415
50,Well worth a visit,"What an amazing experience from start to finish.. We visited with friends who live in LA and wanted to visit the Taylor Swift Experience. I loved every minute! So interesting and at times surreal, 'The Writings of Tupac Shakur' was a personal highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8900BHjoes
50,Well worth a trip downtown,Any music lover will be completely satisfied with this museum. It has plenty of interactive elements and exhibits from music icons past and present.Well worth the trip downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonh297
50,Great for popular music lovers.,Lucked on to this in my last few hours in LA. Spent over an hour there which was nowhere near enough. Wonderful to have so much music and the different genres available. Fantastic value for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451kay
40,Appealed to all of us,"We were travelling as a family with 18 and 23 year olds. This was a great choice as it appealed to all of us. Loved playing the instruments. Very user friendly. Only suggestion, I would take a look at how New York annex of Rock n Roll Hall of Fame had individual headsets that came on as approached exhibits. It was great but had to wait to use headsets a lot. Great job though and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/red_9960
50,WOW!,"What an amazing experience, I went to the grammy museum with my mom during spring break. We happened to come just as the Taylor Swift exhibit was there and it was very neat! I enjoy music a lot and loved this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614rachaeln
40,It's a good option in LA,"It's a very good Museum, you would love it more if you like Taylor Swift. The organization is excellent. Also you can walk around in the street and watch the grammy awards year by year. It was a good plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/945pilarm
40,Something for every music lover,"Three floors packed with wonderful artifacts and historical elements of some of music's most iconic talent.We loved seeing Ravi Shankar's special presentation, as well as Toupac's.The kids enjoyed sitting down at the ready-to-play band setup.Plan to spend 1-2 hours. It moves along pretty fast.I don't know that an entire floor dedicated to Taylor Swift was necessary, but I get it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429renec
40,Taylor Swift Exhibit,"Hidden Gem and well worth the admision fee. we went in with no expectation and were pleasantly suprised. A wide range of music histroy for all fans and some really neat memorabilia. Joan Rivers, The Supremes, Michael Jackson and then Taylor Swift Experience. A great way to spend an afternoon if your near the Staples Center",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanL514
40,"Our family enjoyed, and they are open on Monday. Doing things right!","Our 2 adult daughters and we thoroughly enjoyed our day yesterday at the Grammy Museum. If you love various genres of music this would be a great stop for your family too. It is just north of the Staples Center on Figueroa in LA. Lots of food options around the museum, allowing us to pop out of the museum for about an hour and grab lunch just a short walk away.No photo's allowed so, leave yours in your trunk or glove box. Getting our parking validated at a food establishment saved us $15.We arrived at noon and left at 5 with a lunch break and did not see the whole thing. I have visited both the EMP in Seattle and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and think that the interactive displays and exhibits at the Grammy Museum were far superior than the others!We ended up there because the other 2 museums we were considering were closed on Mondays...their loss, our gain!The current display on Tupak Shakur was excellent. I am almost 60 and an not a fan of RAP, never had actually listened to his body of work before, but I was quite impressed with his poetry and his story.I spent a great deal of time listening to interviews that were on the 3rd floor.I was a bit disappointed in their recently opened display on the Supremes. I never made it to the Taylor Swift display but my family did and said it was nice and was crowded with many teenaged girls and their moms!Might have been nice to have the occasional docent around but not a big deal.So glad we went!Use AAA if you have it, saved us $2 each!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandJ18
50,More than I expected,"The Grammy Museum offered more than I expected and is a great place for any music lover to spend a couple hours. I thoroughly enjoyed the Grammy history, ability to listen to different genres/winners, videos, costumes, and exhibits. BTW, AAA members get a discounted entrance fee, so make sure you have your card along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyCS777
50,An LA Must See!,"So much fun! Interactive, fascinating, historical, noteworthy, surprises all rolled up into one attraction. If you love music and you're a bit of a history buff this is the perfect experience for you. Buy your tickets online and they'll let you in a few minutes earlier than the regular crowd that has to buy their tickets at the box office. If you have to wait in line for tickets, have someone wait for your party and you can stroll up and down the street and look at the museum's own walk of fame. Each year's big winners are memorialized in a placque. Get your cameras ready. The big Grammy award upstairs changes colors so wait for it to change to the color you want!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickieW302
50,Interesting,"We had the LA Go Card so we decided to visit The Grammy Museum since we were in DTLA anyways. The guard at the front desk was so nice and friendly. We started on the 4th floor and worked our way down. Don't miss the recording room in the back corner on the 4th floor, it shows you how the same song would sound on different pieces of equipment. The Taylor Swift exhibit was really good even for a 60 year old. Just do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinsU4081OY
50,Lots of fun facts,This museum was a nice adventure for our first day in L.A. The Taylor Swift Exhibit was amazing along with all of the others. I highly recommend for all music lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veneciafoster
50,Well Worth it!,"We were lucky enough to get dragged into a free concert. Bebe Rexha is absolutely amazing. We got autographs and a free Luc Robitaille signed PUK which is the ice hockey"" ball."" The museum collections are amazing to see. The price you pay to get in is very,very reasonable. Don't miss it. Right opposite The Staples Centre. Catch a game as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertaandharryz
50,Very Impressive,"If you are interested in the history of the Grammy Awards and highlights of some of the artists, this is the place to go. Currently there is a big Taylor Swift exhibit (with a list of all her past and current tour dates), which did not really interest me, but the Tupac Shakur exhibit was fascinating and very insightful. There are a few listening rooms where you can listen to performances and interviews, and many exhibits have their own headphones so you can listen to the artist featured. Beautifully appointed and incredibly fascinating, they cover every genre and each decade of music going back to the 50's. If you are into the history of music, this is a great place to spend an afternoon. The neighborhood downtown has been beautifully renovated and lots of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollymuse
30,Not that Impressive,"First, I felt that the museum was disorganized. The layout could have a better structure. They have head phones to learn history on different types of music. I did use them, but was wondering if they are sanitized. They have the different years 60, 70's etc. At one point, I almost missed the Gospel movie segment. They also had a Taylor Swift exhibit if you are a fan of country music. It's hard to recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
50,For any music lover,"Visited the museum during a quick trip to LA. I was able to use my Ohio student ID for a discounted ticket which was nice, although the museum wasn't over priced to start with. Loved watching The Grammy's through the years montage. I was really impressed with how hands on the museum is (touch screen music players, entering a recording studio, opportunities to play guitars, drums and keyboards) We were able to attend during the Taylor Swift exhibit and I wasn't a huge Taylor fan going into this museum but I definitely appreciate her work a lot more now. It was a very well done and interactive exhibit. I highly recommend making this a staple on any LA trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyowens30
30,OK Music Museum,"I've traveled to cities just for their music museums-Seattle, Cleveland, Memphis. Not so for LA and it's a good thing. The Grammy museum had three floors of exhibits.The third floor was the best with a history of music from about the 40s to the present, showcasing various performers and genres, with a sprinkling of social and cultural happenings. The second floor was mostly about the most recent Grammy winners, with costumes and music sampling. The first floor was dedicated exclusively to one artist and if you have no interest in the featured artist, it's a bust. Taylor Swift is the current artist, which is great if you're a 14-year-old girl. Small gift shop with nothing particularly exciting. Figure 1 1/2 hours to tour the whole thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddblue33
40,Interesting but not Earth Shattering,"I took a group to the museum. Its in a great location with plenty to do nearby. Some of the exhibits are very cool and there is a lot to see. Artifacts are well shown. That said, not sure I would do it again unless there was something I personally wanted to see very much. There was nothing earth shattering about the experience. There is certainly room for improvement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zootarts
40,Enjoyable,Visited during our stay in Los Angeles as it was close to our hotel it was nice to walk around see the clothes and instruments used by various artistes including the guitar used by Jimi Hendrix a large area was devoted to Taylor Swift of whom I am not really a fan but obviously a lot of people are overall a good place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Volpetervo
40,A great music stop!,"This museum has history on all sorts of genres. Learn about the goings on in a recording booth, and all sorts of interactive touch screens to take you through the years in music. All the winners of the Grammys are represented here. I love the attention to the song writers because without the writer…you have no song.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharyln2014
30,Average at best,"Parts of it were enjoyable. Interesting history for what they had, but there wasn't really that much.And do we need an entire floor dedicated to Taylor Swift? No. No one in our group enjoyed that part of it. A complete waste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccullars
40,Tupac Shakur and more,"The exhibits were very cool, but the Tupac Shakur experience was amazing! I loved the music table where you could choose a genre of music and listen and/or sing along to. The whole experience I would recommend again, but the Taylor Swift floor had me running for the door!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5090BSmichellek
40,Great way to spend an afternoon,"This museum was so close to the hotel, had to walk over and visit. Several great guest exhibits, very nice set-up of in-house exhibits. Thought there would be more Grammy's 'on-loan' to see. It was worth the $12 admission price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieLeigh44
50,As Good as Rock & Roll HOF but on a smaller scale,"Located in the LA Live complex, this was an attraction that sounded good from the guide books but was far better than we imagined. This is a must-see for music lovers and ages 25 to 70.Get there when it opens and plan to spend the full day looking at the many videos, displays, and interactive exhibits. We went on a Wednesday in early May and it was not crowded at all so we could take our time and enjoy each exhibit to its fullest. I don’t know what it would be like if it was crowded but for us this was an ideal day. We loved the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and were worried that this place might pale by comparison. Nonsense! It was wonderful. This should be a top attraction in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinSeniorTraveler
50,Satisfying Taylor Swift Experience!,"THANK YOU GRAMMY MUSEUM FOR THE FUN EXPERIENCE OF TAYLOR. I am a swiftie myself so I was so eager coming here and it did not disappoint.Unfortunately I only managed to arrive at 6PM and it closed at 8PM. So, better gear up early for those who are keen to be there longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinnaMargaretha
50,Worth the money,"If you are a music fan, this is the place for you. The Taylor Swift exhibit was worth the money spent. Would definitely go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daisyforyou
50,Musical memories.,The displays of musical memorabilia are very well done and they bring back memories of that musical era whether it was the 70's or last year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandMAdelaide
50,Very Interesting,For anyone with an interest in music a visit to the museum is an absolute must. The exhibits are tastefully displayed with lots of seating areas for tired legs. Covering 4 floors in a very modern setting with lifts to every level there is an opportunity to interact and handle instruments and even make a recording if you are prone to sing which allows the children to let off steam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidequeen
50,If you love Music you will love this,The museum was just wonderful and the history of the Grammy's just blew my mind. They had a Tupac Exhibit that just shed so much light on him and his character.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sassyme1971
50,A must see,This museum was not on my list of places to visit .. But my teen insisted she had to see the Taylor Swift exhibit so we went . I left this for the last day and only allocated 1 hour for the visit .. I regret not staying longer .. This place is fabulous !! A must see !!!! A great place to visit !!! I only wished I had stayed longer but I had a flight to catch .. Every exhibit has so much rich history and it's actually interactive and fun ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bustios
40,"If you love music, this is the place to be!","There's so much to see! So many amazing things from the history of music! Would recommend it to anyone who loves music, or has an interest in the recording and production process. The Taylor swift experience was particularly awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonh377
30,was kinda boring,i expected more interactive displays. was kind of boring for me. was a bit pricey as well. even the review system is lame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmydiamond420
30,For music lovers!,"A little hard to find. Went on a Monday so plenty of parking available. Lots to read, see and listen. The Taylor Swift Experience was interesting. Fair gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Machela567
40,No pics?,Was very cool place but no pics were permitted to be taken! Overall experience was excellent. Well worth the money but look for a coupon if you have time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyt977
40,Brilliant museum...we enjoyed it!,We visited the Grammy Museum and really enjoyed it. We feel they could make it ten times bigger though but really enjoyed what was there.Loved the Tupac Shakur exhibit and also Taylor Swift Experience!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaStorey
40,Taylor Swift exhibit was awesome.,"Our whole family enjoyed this experience. From mixing tracks with Slash, seeing Michael Jacksons' costumes it was fun for the whole family. The Taylor Swift experience was well worth the $10! Ask for a aaa discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sob29
40,Good museum,Nice place costs 12.50 worth it if you like different types of music..museum has 4 floors of exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raodets
40,A must see!,"What a wonderful tribute to the grammy winners. You can listen to music, see costumes, memorabilia, and great special exhibits. It took me back to great years of music. It was reasonably priced. Don't forget to ask for AAA discount! Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacknval97
50,Great Museum,This is a great interactive museum for all ages! Many different exhibits with hands on availability. Currently there is a Taylor Swift exhibit complete with costumes and a music documentary in the theater to view.Micheal Jackson costumes as well as Donna Summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UpstateNY621
50,Fun Place,"There were things to do, see and play. A great place for adults and teens. There are many hands on exhibits that draw you in. Sound booths were really fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323carolh
40,Good interactive museum,"We enjoyed our afternoon at the museum, but it's not geared toward teens with short attention spans despite the interactive exhibits. Really more for adults. However, we went for the Taylor Swift exhibit which was awesome and enjoyed by all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parisa63
40,Enjoyable Muscial Experience,"My wife and I visited the Grammy Museum on Wednesday afternoon February 11, 2015. We were going to attend the Clippers/Rockets game at 7:30pm, so we arrived at the Staples Center at 12:30pm, planning to eat lunch, then tour the museum.PARKING. We parked in a surface lot on Figueroa St. southwest of and across the street from the Staples Center. $10 to park all afternoon and through the Clippers game. Arriving this early allowed us to park right at the lot entrance and position our car for a quick exit after the Clippers game. The large lot directly south of the Staples Center is fenced off and no longer available for parking. A construction worker told us that two large high-rise condominiums are under construction there, and the lot we parked in will also become a high-rise condo later on. There are also parking garages all around the Staples Center.GRAMMY MUSEUM - 1st FLOOR. We arrived at the museum at around 1:30 pm. Admission was $13 for adults $12 for over 65. The first floor is just a lobby with a display case that contained items from Taylor Swift's Red Tour. Her red piano was also in the lobby. This was just the beginning of a whole lot of Taylor Swift. We then took the elevator to the fourth floor as directed by the lobby host.4th FLOOR. The first room was showing Grammy acceptance speeches by various artists on large HD screens. We didn't wait to see all of them, but watched a dozen or so. In the middle of the room are small scale models of the Grammy award, which is an old-time phonograph player, and showing the evolution of its design over the years. There are rest rooms just to the left of the entrance to this room, which were attractively decorated and very clean. Rest rooms are on floors 2, 3 and 4,Next, we encountered a large waist-high electronic display table of almost every kind of music genre there is. You pick up a set of headphones, press on a music genre from many that are passing by on the display table and the display shows an artist of that genre and you hear that music in the headphones. Press the arrow and a second artist is displayed and you hear a second song. Press the arrow and a third artist is displayed. There are three representative artists for every genre. You can press ""more"" and a brief history and description of the genre is displayed. You can go back to the main menu at any time. To us, this was one of the most enjoyable features of the museum. We spent about 15 minutes listening to various genres initially. But after visiting floors 3 and 2, we returned to this display and listened to many more genres for about another half hour. The museum wasn't that busy, so we weren't hogging the headphones..The 4th floor also has some video displays on the back wall of music in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s, etc. Again you put on headphones and listen to a narrator describe the predominant music of that decade, while viewing photos and videos of that decade. I listened to and watched the 50s and 60s. They were very informational and entertaining. If you want to know the history of rock and roll, view the 1950s decade. There are also some open sound booths of selected music genres that show photos and play music from that genre. The three booths we visited were: sacred, country and jazz/classical. We spend about 45-50 minutes on the 4th floor.THIRD FLOOR. The 3rd floor was a lot of history of the Grammys. It had a viewing area with seating that continuously played video of a recent Grammy Awards show. It included many displays of Latino music genre and a special room/display dedicated to Donna Summers. We spent about 15-20 minutes on this floor.SECOND FLOOR. The entire second floor was the ""Taylor Swift Experience."" It included videos of Taylor from birth through her rise to mega-stardom. Though we were not rabid Taylor Swift fans, we found her story to be interesting and entertaining. On one of the videos, a disc jockey interviewing Taylor as a teenager asks how she writes songs. He asks her on the spot to do a song about ""traffic."" Amazingly, she composes a short song in her head about traffic and sings it while accompanying herself on the guitar. It is clever and funny... ""traffic, I hate traffic."" She had no idea at the time how apropos that song would be for LA-area freeway travelers listening to it several year later. This floor also contains a gift shop with Grammy souvenirs and plenty of Taylor Swift stuff to purchase. We spent about an hour on this floor and came away genuinely impressed with Taylor Swift in both talent and likeability. The Taylor Swift experience runs through May 10, 2015.Our total time at the museum was about three hours. If not a music fan, the museum is doable in 1-2 hours. If you are a music fan, and have the time, 3-4 hours should do it. If you are a devoted Taylor Swift fan, you may spend a couple hours on the second floor alone. Overall, we thought it was a very good experience, worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpringfieldGuy
30,This could be so much better,"Some very interesting displays for sure. Especially enjoyed the costumes and handwritten items from music history. Also some great old film footage in kiosks on particular genres like gospel. The current exhibitions on Tupac Shakur and Donna Summer were good. Then, oddly enough there is an entire floor dedicated to Taylor Swift including many outfits, some of which were her everyday clothes I saw reviewed on the Fashion Police a few moths ago. I did not get this as costumes worn in videos or concerts work, everyday clothing...not so much. My overall feeling is that this museum should be much better curated and more comprehensive to the Grammy history and artists. It felt like just a sliver of what could be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46MK
40,Worth a look if you're into music,I would probably have rated this 3.5 stars if I could have but chose 4 stars rather than 3. We took our teenage daughters to this and they loved the Taylor Swift floor however the other areas were not so interesting to them. My husband and I enjoyed it. There is quite a bit of music to listen to through headphones and clothes some of the musicians wore (including Michael Jackson's). It's quite interactive and we spent about 2 hours there I guess.Afterwards you can eat at the Yard House which is right next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZubyD
30,"If you have time, sure, if not you're not missing much.","I came to this museum without much knowledge of what was held inside- paid for the ticket and then walked in. Upon entering you see the different type of Grammy Awards presented to artists, pretty cool. From thereafter, it becomes a bit anti-climatic. There's a lot of history on music genres on the topmost floor, third floor featured the more interesting interactive exhibits where you can learn about mixing, recording vocals and play with instruments. Second floor showcased their special exhibits gallery, which when I went was devoted to Taylor Swift who I don't have much interest for. That pretty much sums it all up.Pros:(1) Interesting to see the costumes that artists have previously worn, especially Michael Jackson.(2) Very cool to see the awards up-close.(3) Quite fun to learn about the studio process.Cons:(1) Overall really small. You can finish the museum within an hour. That of which, if you are driving in, I think it's ok to find street parking with the two hour time limits. That's fairly ample time for a casual music lover.(2) No photography is allowed. However, it doesn't seemed to be enforced.(3) The museum shop doesn't have interesting things to purchase.Overall, for the price, I think it's acceptable. I don't really find it to be a must see museum, but if there's extra time in your itinerary... it could be kind of interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekinstory
50,Visit the Grammy Museum.,"The place is worth a visit, though photography is forbidden, maybe because of copyright. But who could seriously fake something as iconic as Michael Jackson’s jackets from the Thriller video !? !? The only photography allowed was in the lobby by Thelonious Monk’s piano. The other artefacts, exhibits, information and the temporary exhibition to Stevie Ray Vaughan, (Nov 2014), were good. There’s an interactive part on how samples work in songs along with keyboards and a drum kit. Also were listening posts with various songwriters talking about their craft.The gift shop had a good selection, its only big let down was by the girl who was serving, (Jacquelynn Dygert), who chose to watch you as though you were a thief ! ! ! !Bar that it’s worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nodnoltravel
30,Visit after 6pm,Not what you might expect. Missing tributes to many famous artists. You can easily breeze through in less than an hour. Save some cash and visit after 6pm for half price admission. Overall I was not impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityHopper1010
30,Grammy museum,"The Grammy Museum was okay, nothing really special, Highlights was the Michael Jackson exhibits worth the money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjp704
40,Great place to visit in downtown,"Interesting place, lots of videos of Grammy winners and performance and some artifacts like costumes. Presently it is also having an exhibit on Taylor Swift and we are fans of hers so it is just more bang for our buck. They sell some Taylor swift merchandise now too so for all her fans, it will be a nice time to visit the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceSin
40,What a great surprise,"Took our company employees there (100) to tour the museum and have dinner and drinks on the patio. What a blast, everyone enjoyed it. The Taylor Swift exhibit was fun and informative along with the Disco Era and Donna Summer. Exhibits were interactive, educational, the exhibits on the 60s, 70s were especially fun given the very different sounds. I especially like the listening room where the same music was played back on different technology to show the improvement. Food was excellent and the views were breath taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617stevev
50,Really impressed,"The museum was not just about the Grammys as I suspected, but about the development of the many forms of popular music. Really informative for an music lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2608IEmarkm
40,A good site to see,"The Grammy Museum is located at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles. LA Live is a bit of a plaza of shops, dining, a club and the Nokia/Staples Center. The Grammy Museum is in a nice location and easy to find on foot. It was four floors and some really nice selections to look at. They have some Michael Jackson outfits, and some really nice history and fun things to look at and play with. You can kill a good 3 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carnationnation
40,Taylor Swift overload,"The museum has a great interactive video showing the roots of all modern music including grunge, country, blues, pop, heavy metal etc. Visually, the museum is beautiful. The videos are great.Now onto Taylor Swift, there is a whole floor dedicated to her. From her wardrobe to her album. If you have a child that's a Taylor Swift fan this is a must.Instead, it would have been nice to see more history of 60s music. As a reminder this is not the rock and roll hall of fame so more diverse music is covered.Also showing are Michael Jackson clothes. There is also a nice Latino music section.Tip: AAA members save $3.00 per ticket.Tip: because it is close to the Staples Center, parking can be hefty. A few blocks away there is metered parking.Tip: they have nice bathrooms on each floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
50,Go to this museum!,"If you have a Taylor Swift fan in your life, now is the time to go to this museum in Downtown LA!They have a great exhibit currently up that includes many interviews of Taylor, her clothes she has worn at the Grammy's and all her mementos. But this place has a great extensive interactive exhibits for every genre and fan. Blues, gospel, rock, latin, and folk, lots of types for all kinds of music lovers. It teaches lots of interesting aspects to recording if you have time to do all the pieces they offer.Take any music lover if you are in Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelticGirlLA
40,Interactive and Interesting,"I didn't engage in many interactive exhibits (for example, they have a booth where you can ""mix"" a recording), but I always watched the Grammys growing up (and usually tune in now just for the music) and really enjoyed the exhibits. It didn't feel like a ""historical"" museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95lisass
50,Red hat tour,Ahh. The group loved the different music presented..Easy to use the elevator and not to difficult to park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssticco
50,Better than your imagination could imagine it!,"Really! Just go. Worth the ticket price worth a day of your vacation time. Worth every step up and down the stairs and isles filled with music, art, history, memorabilia and so much more. It's part museum, part shrine, part history lesson, part music theory class and all parts fun fun fun! So go go go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jzarunner
40,Loved it but...,We came for the last day of the Laurel Canyon exhibit. Glad we did.Lots of stuff to see and learn about. Exhibit was really cool and good.Really about the history of grammy's and less about musician personalities. (If that's what you want--go to a hard rock.)Museum is quick and easy---then a short 20 minute walk to grand central market.

50,A wonderful museum for music lovers,This is a unique museum for the Los Angeles area. They have exhibits that will satisfy everyone's music tastes. The 2nd floor have exhibits that change periodically. Sign up for email notices of their upcoming exhibits and special events on the museum's website. The Clive Davis theater is a small venue onsite that offers special talks and musical events with industry performers and experts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan661
10,Waste of money!!!!!,"We traveled 3600 miles JUST for the Donna Summer exhibit. After paying our money and proceeded inside the museum, we were told there is NO PHOTOGRAPHY or video allowed!!! What???? It's dresses and you can't make pics???? The museum is only 4 floors and the floors are NOT big at all!!!! I was shocked that some Mexican singer named Pepe had more on display than ANY other artist. Michael Jackson display was only a couple of outfits. Total waste of time and money!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTipp
50,Music,Enjoyed learning more about music and the artist and what or how they were inspired! Wonderfu learning experience for me. Great for all type of music lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hey1257
50,Great location and Worth the Cost,"I was killing time here, and it was a really neat experience. The museum had the old and new, and covered pretty much every genre. The fashion section was especially cool (Beyonce's dress was amazing in real life), and the Laurel Canyon exhibit was worth the cost by itself. Some of it is a bit overwhelming-- so much noise and so much to read-- but if you take your time, it's enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hilaryr2017
40,"Great Variety, Decent Value","It was fun to enter and be surrounded by screens showing acceptance speeches of former Grammy winners. The collection is diverse in terms of genres so there is probably something that appeals to everyone here.Maybe it was just me, but since it's rather dark inside it wasn't immediately obvious where to find the stairs to travel down from floor to floor. Also, it wasn't until we had left that we noticed (printed on our tickets!) that no photography is allowed. However, 2 out of the 3 of our party took several photos and no one intervened.I also enjoyed looking for my favorite artists on the sidewalk plaques in the area outside the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAnotherJourney
40,Worth doing if using GoLA card,"So many great pieces from various artists and genre's and a very impressive collection overall. Disappointing they do not allow photos but that was the only thing slightly bad about this visit. I have been to the mini museum they have in Kansas City Missouri at the Sprint Center and wanted to see the big one here in L.A. so I used my GoLA card (which is worth it if you are going to be in California for at least a week). Fairly easy to find in Downtown L.A. I parked about a block away with ease-and btw make sure you look at the sidewalk that surrounds the museum because it shows each Grammy winner of every year just like the Hollywood Walk of Fame but instead of stars there are circles with the Grammy Logo. There are 4 floors of items, the people working there are polite and very informative. This is a great place to take kids so they can learn about the music greats from past to present. I especially liked the Whitney Houston tribute, items from the most recent Grammy's and the variety of things to see. I would have liked to have seen a nod to P!nk especially after her 2010 performance that people are still talking about. She is an incredibly talented artist who does not get enough recognition for what she does. Great place to visit and worth a stop in for any music lover. I would def. come again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
50,A real treat,"Really can't understand some of the reviews that said there was not much to see in here. We spent about 2 hours and could easliy have been longer but for our parking restriction. Its interative, there are instruments you can play with...we loved it! My Husband and I are in our early 40's and we particularly the Donna Summer exhibit, though I understand that some of these ""special exhibits"" are for limited periods so will change from time to time. The outfits worn by the likes of Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston are now real pieces of music History and this is an ideal place for them to be seen. Going through the list of Grammy wininy albums over the last 30 years and seeing how many we owned. The only downside was not being able to take photos as I would have loved to have a visual memory to keep. Worth the entry fee......absolutely yes! or don't call yourself a music fan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyofLeeds
50,Great for music buffs,"I really enjoyed the Grammy Museum.Conveniently located in the L.A. Live complex which includes the Staples Center, Nokia Theater and ESPN LA SportsZone, it is easily accessible by the Metro Silver or Blue Line transit lines.The museum was built with one side in glass so there is lots of sunny, natural light to illuminate a lot of the exhibits.The way to view it is to start on the top floor (4th) and to work your way down. You start off in a hall by watching a continuous loop of famous Grammy moments/acceptance speeches and seeing the evolution of the actual award which is displayed under glass.There are exhibits about different genres and all-time greats and interactive timelines where you can listen to representative songs through earphones.One of the best floors is the one where there is a technical walk-through of the history of transmitting sound from phonographs to record players to CDs and digital music today. There are sound-proof rooms where you can try selecting beats to create your own tracks.You can also try your hand at electronic keyboards, percussion and guitars.There is also a nod to the Latino influence and their contributions to music with a special Latin Grammys section.Best of all is the Archives where you can basically access a digital encyclopedia of winners, albums and songs of past Grammy winners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmfronds
30,I was expecting much more,"I happened to be in town on Stevie Ray Vaughan's birthday and decided to stop at the museum because they have a travelling SRV exhibit and they were celebrating his birthday with free admission. I'm I huge SRV fan and would have gladly gone out of my way and pay the $12.95 admission just to see his ""Number One"" Stratocaster. Aside from that, however, the museum left me a little flat. There's a lot of information to be had via pictures and placards, but I was disappointed in the lack of memorabilia. I've seen better in a Hard Rock Cafe.I can't recommend making a concerted effort to get there and drop $12.95 on admission, but If you're in the area and admission is free, sure, it's worth stopping in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunburnt_curt
40,"Interesting , but could be so much better.","The entryway with former Grammy winner video loops was good. We did come to see the stars who have won Grammy's , after all. The rest of the displays-costumes, photos & memorabilia were nice but the collection was not as extensive as we thought it would be. The recording & sound room booths, etc were interesting in a sort of kids science museum sort of way. But the table with touch screen access to various music was not explained well and ALL the displays with sound used shared headphones. That was not so nice. (I've been to other music oriented museums where one has private sanitized headphones turned in after use.) The other thing we were surprised by was that there were so few items to shop for at the gift shop. We loved seeing the Stevie Ray Vaughn display for example , and would have liked to be able to buy CDs , books or other items pertaining to him or some of the other Grammy honorees . There was really very little there and most of it rather generic and expensive. A Grammy Museum logo drinking glass for $16.99. Sorry. All in all - I give it a B-. OK, but could be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindissima14
50,Great few hours at this museum,"The Grammy Museum is located right by L.A. Live and is only $12.95 per person for adults. I wasn't told otherwise, so I took tons of inside pictures of the museum. I won't post any here though just in case. I enjoyed how current the museum was, with items even from last year's Grammy awards. There were many musical and video elements to the museum as well. There are interactive recording booths where you can ""work with the stars"" to lay down tracks. I also enjoyed the sound booth room that let you hear how music would sound from the oldest musical technology to the technology of today. My husband and I very much enjoyed the music history. We are fans of Michael Jackson and were pleased to see that he had two sizeable display cases with some of his most well-known articles of clothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissLenore
40,Music Museum hit a Sour Note with me,"I don't really understand any of the rave reviews of this museum. I went on a day when the admission was free (regular admission is $12.95), and I still feel like I lost money. To me a museum should have items that are unique and not available on the internet. I would say that at least 80% of the exhibits were just photos (not original ones) and video clips that I could have just Googled. The photos of the musicians next to their clothing weren't even of that item of clothing. I would only suggest going here under 2 conditions: 1) you get free admission, and 2) you have nothing better to do at LA Live and need to waste some time before a show. There is no photography allowed - probably because that would show people just how little there actually is to see. VERY disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevew11
50,Loved it!,I enjoyed every part of the Grammy Museum. They had a special photo exhibit of Laurel Canyon musical artist...so very interesting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeCN
50,We loved it.,"We had coupons for this museum, so it was a bit cheaper for it.We had 2 and a half hours. I wish we would have had 4. Contrary to many here, we loved it! I went with my daughters recently turned 7 and 16.It's the only museum in their lifes where I had to pull them away from exhibits.They loved to listen to the different types of music. They loved to watch the videos. They loved to see the Michael Jackson and recent grammy awards dresses. They liked playing with the computers in the archives room. And they loved to musical instruments they could play. The exhibit Laurel Canyon was neat too.It's too bad we couldn't take pictures. In this day and age, I find it too bad. There is no staff on the floors, so you cannot ask questions. The theater was closed when we went and I would have like to see it; and the boutique doesn't have much from the museum. I'd suggest more postcards.Otherwise, it was a great museum, interactive, merging culture and technology.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936
40,Fun,It's located in downtown L.A and we bought our tickets on Groupon. 2 adult tickets for $13. We spent about an hour in here and it's filled with music memorabilia including outfits which have been worn to the Grammy ceremonies and furniture which belonged to rock stars.. I enjoyed Michael Jackson's costumes from his album covers and videos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014
30,Not for kids,"This was something on the top of my 'to do' list during my visit to LA last year. My ten yr old daughter would say it was on the bottom of hers. She did not enjoy herself except in the area where you can pretend to be part of the band. That area in general created quite a scene with me, my 71yr old mother and 10yr old daughter all playing various instruments. Overall, a nice stop with lots to read and see. Place was quiet and not the least bit crowded when we went. Hope they get more business or it may not stay open for much longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurtzb
40,Cool and worth the trip,"The museum is four stories and has a lot of displays including clothing, instruments, photos, videos and more. Although we didn't know a lot of the artists featured, we were really glad we went. You could spend an hour or all day here, depending on how much you want to learn. On one level, you can play a bunch of different instruments on a mini stage. Kids may not be as interested in the rest of it, but that section they would really enjoy. The museum is really clean and well maintained and not expensive. We had a groupon for half off so if you watch for a deal it's even less costly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenK56
30,Average - not amazing but worth a visit,"We visited here on a pre-planned visit from Ireland. The Grammy Museum is good and has a good selection of history from various genres and artists, but lacked ""something"".My favourite part was the interactive screens where you can listen to different genres of music and the main artists and bands from those genres.Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DieselIE
50,Visit the Grammy Museum!,"If you are in LA and enjoy any type of music, this is a MUST. It displays entertainers performance costumes, some outfits from award winners that they wore when accepting their Grammy, changing displays on various performers/genres and many listening rooms as well as headphones throughout the museum. There is even a drum set for you to work out on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reac2014
40,Interesting and informative,"I really enjoyed our visit here - we took about 3 hours to see and do everything. My son is studying studio recording, so it was nice to learn what he is doing. Obviously they don't go into the nuts and bolts, but it did give me an idea of what 'mixing' and so forth is. Lots of hands on stuff to do and see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nekolover
40,Really enjoyed this museum,"My husband heard about this museum and wanted to try it on our trip to LA. We were not sure what to expect but we all really enjoyed it. We have 2 teenage daughters and they enjoyed it as well. Lots of music history. We had a blast recording ourselves in the sound booths. And I learned that I have no future as a rapper. The displays were interesting and informative. We really enjoyed seeing the outifts from performances and Grammy award shows. We also liked playing the instruments and listening to the different music. We spent about 3 hours here. Overall, we were very pleasantly surprised by this museum and were happy that we went. One hint - they gave a great discount for AAA members so remember to bring your card and ask for the discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel43_11
50,such a surprise,We had never heard of the museum until we walked past on our way back to hotel but so glad we went in. We ended up spending 5 hours in there...had to take a short break for lunch but returned and loved it all. It is not just about the Grammies but much more about music history. There is so much information in there. While there they had a special exhibition on Laurel Canyon - so impressive. Staff there were also great...so enthusiastic about the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sassafras99
40,Mixed but generally worth a short excursion,"Pricing wise they are right on the borderline, where if they increased the price it wouldn't be worth it. Not allowing pictures to be taken was never really explained except i guess if you saw the exhibits on peoples pictures maybe you wouldn't have a reason to go. the interactive booths and headphones everywhere were interesting to a point but for a music fan, much of that could of been done at home. Interactive instruments were fun for a bit. Went mostly for the Laurel Canyon exhibit but it was a bit disappointing, except for a few items the one's shown were limited, although a few were worth it. The ""movie"" being shown was actually a channel 7 local LA tv program with awful sound throughout, even if a few interviews were interesting, it could of been better done.So yes by all means go it's worth a few hours or was to me, right now they also have a great Stevie Ray Vaughn display. Not sure how often people would be returning here though, depends on exhibits i would gather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk
50,"Fun, fun, fun!",Very hands on with great exhibits and great history. If you are a music buff this is a gray place. Well laid out. You can take your time or move fairly quickly depending on your interests.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kagardner
40,So much fun!,Last time I was here was just after MJ's passing. It made the experience even more meaningful when thinking about all our great musicians and the goodness they brought to our lives.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuziReckless
50,Great fun for the whole family,"Not sure I've ever watched a single Grammy Awards show but this was where my 18 year old daughter wanted to go. It was very interesting and lots of fun. We all learned a lot and there was something for everyone in our family(ages 10-44). They had quite a few hands on exhibits for the kids to keep them entertained and learning in a fun, engaging way. This was definitely worth the money and if you are a lover of music even more so. My husband and I loved exposing the kids to ""our"" music but they definitely have music for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperTxMom
50,Worthwhile excursion,"I enjoyed this well laid out and fun museum. My 13 year old son did not find it interesting, as he didn't know most of the performers that were discussed. There are a lot of interactive exhibits. Visually and acoustically stimulating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay64
40,Laurel Canyon Exhibition and Museum Visit,"Recommend for anyone who loves music. Loads of nostalgia. My kids really enjoyed playing on the instruments and trying out the recording studios, so did I !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleslsegal
40,Music lovers must see!,My husband and children loved this museum. They learned a great deal about music history and was not busy at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minofam
30,Less than extensive collection,"That's the memorabilia, not the music library. You could spend years in there with headphones on. Very nicely laid out museum for it's size, just not that big. The rent is probably pretty high per square foot at LA Live. They did a really good job showcasing all the Grammy winners from day one to present, not just the well known, best sellers. If you have the time and motivation to take advantage of all the sound booths, interactive fun, music clips and instruments, a true musician could enjoy an entire day. Park under LA Live, $5 for first 2 hours, $5 per half hour after that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruzz2112
50,Great afternoon in downtown Los Angeles,"I had two 13 yo girls and two 15 yo boys to entertain on a very hot Los Angeles day. We read the reviews about the Grammy Museum and were not disappointed. It is a wonderful interactive and creative space that we all enjoyed. They have sound rooms to mix your own music, instruments to play and interactive screens to listen to fantastic artists. We were there about two hours. I cannot wait to bring my husband back next time--it is great for teens and adultsWe finished off a great time with tasty deli sandwiches at Langers Deli--about a 10 min drive. We live LA and sometimes it is fun to act like a tourist to see all the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyAN
50,Wonderful Place !,"Our granddaughter (11) really wanted to visit this attraction. So while on vacation we took her and her brother (13). I wasn't too thrilled at going, but that changed. This is a really nice place. It has lots of music related things to do in addition to information about the grammys. The California Dreaming section was really great. Surprisingly, the grandkids really enjoyed working in the sound rooms mixing and changing music and making songs. We had to leave a bit too soon for them. We all would like to go back if we ever get the chance. Everything here seems first class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IverJohnson
50,Fun for Teens and Tweens,"The four adolescent boys in our group had a great time at this museum -- interactive and educational all at once. I'd recommend planning to spend a couple of hours (if not more) playing in the sound booths, trying the instruments, listening to the music clips, and just soaking it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilboydStudge
50,"Wow, Cool Stuff!","When you first walk in, there is a huge floor to ceiling screen showing clips of past Grammy award shows. It makes you feel like 'you are there'! There are 4 floors, but it isn't too large of a place or overwhelming. Plan about 2 hours to go slow and see everything. They had a new display about the Laurel Canyon era when I was there.....Eagles, Neil Young, CSN, etc....awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilovellamas
40,If you love music - do go!,My first impression of the Grammy Museum was that it was quite small - but do not be deceived there is lots to see and listen to.I loved the general concept of presenting different 'pop' music genres in a way that made them accessible and coherent. Headphones are used to great effect both to put the music into context and to give examples of each type. There is lots of detail there if you want it.I also liked the interactive' studio' exhibits were you really could get a better understanding of what goes on 'behind the scenes' and actually try some things out for yourself.Certainly a must-see attraction in LA.And here's a tip: i had a 'band' T-shirt on which earned me a discount on entry!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rexbarker
50,Planning a Return,"Attended a book signing event at the museum and had a little time to wonder around. The scope of the music scene seemed endless. Wonderful displays of artifacts, interactive displays and overall classy experiences just left us wanting more. A must see if you are truly a music person, a great experience for those who are just curious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodC929
50,Great Exhibit - California Dreamin' the Sounds of Laurel Canyon,"I was pleasantly surprised to have been able to enjoy the special exhibit ""California Dreamin' the Sounds of Laurel Canyon that was being shown at the museum when I went. This exhibit was the highlight of the museum experience. It is not a large museum so doesn't take long to experience. I would recommend they put up more signage showing the way to get from the top floor down, a little confusing for most. I would definitely recommend this when in the downtown LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB-NSB
10,Call before you go,"This is a great museum, if you get to see all of it. Because I had seen the museum before, we brought a large group here from Dallas, with an advance reservation, and were greeted with the news that the main exhibit floor was closed for a private event. Don't get caught by the same problem. If you can't see the fourth floor, it's not worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkWing
50,"for everyone, but especially music lovers!","There is so much for people to see. You have clothing to sound to writing to production and how they do lots of it! There is a LOT of history. You could get through here quickly in a couple hours, but if you LOVE all facets of music I could see how a person could spend a full day in there. I wanted to spend a lot more time in the sound booths and in the history area, but my family was bored after a couple hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bowlbound
50,Fun for music lovers!,"We enjoyed visiting here on our recent trip to LA. Both my husband and I are big music lovers so we found lots to do here--just didn't leave enough time.The exhibit on the music of Laurel Canyon was very interesting, and the movie they had was fantastic--if anything, it was a bit long as I wanted to spend more time at the exhibits.My husband, a musician, enjoyed trying out the interactive booths.I try to watch the Grammys in recent years. so I enjoyed the timeline they have of the special moments and seing the gowns/outfits worn by the winners.Ask for the AAA discount if you have AAA. Parking can be expensive right nearby--if you can, try to park a bit further and walk in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesmama11
40,Better than I thought!,Wife and I decided to kill some time before the Beyonce concert at Staples Center. So we decided to head into here. Worth your $. See what the stars wore and catch some Grammy history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakerman83
50,Well Done!,"This museum is perfect for music lovers of all ages and times! This museum included real grammy awards, reward winner profiles and songs, and even some design your own songs stations. Enjoyed it a lot. I would recommend this museum for people who like any type of rock, country, pop, etc. music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710maximiliang
50,Great for music lovers of all types!,This was a terrific museum which really covered many music genres. The exhibits were great and interactive. The listening booths were fun. Appeals to all ages since many different types of music are celebrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ticoalra
50,Out having fun,This place was a great choice to go and hang out with family and learn about music the artist and their bands. This museum was great it covered from the vintage to now with lots of artists memories and memorabilia very good job specifically with all the on hand displays and instruments so the people could be a small part of what it would be like to be the star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guzman831
30,Moving in the Right Direction,"The Grammy Museum has the unenviable job of trying to represent a ton of great (award-winning) music and artists. What they cover, they generally cover well. I felt there were so many missing pieces that it was hit or miss (mostly miss) with respect to what you actually see (or hear). A huge Cheap Trick exhibit was well-done. As much as I like Cheap Trick it seemed a bit overboard. I personally prefer something with more focus and authentic like Memphis' Sun Studio.That said, I'd probably go back next time I'm in the area. If you are music lover it is definitely worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobTangeman
40,A Great Visit,"I went there twice recently - once for a visit with my music-loving nephew, and the other time to hear the legendary Graham Nash speak and promote his new autobiography. There is so much to see and do. Many interactive exhibits... and we saw the wonderful exhibit dedicated to Beatle Ringo Starr. So interesting and fun to see. I highly recommend this museum if you like any sort of music from the last 60 years....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feiden
40,"Very good, but not as good as rock hall of fame","This is a very good museum for lovers of popular music as well as other forms of music. Most of it is dedicated to rock and pop music (Grammy winners, duh). But there are some interesting displays on jazz too. The Ringo exhibit was awesome (I even took a virtual drum lesson from him), but I think that exhibit ended in April. The interactive sound booth displays are really great. You get to mix music as a producer and engineer do. The sound booth explaining recording equipment over the years was also really good. This museum isn't nearly as good as the rock hall in Cleveland, but it still is worth a visit for any serious music fan. Also, its location next to LA live and the Staples center is great, as there are good restaurants and events going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booknook9121
50,Very Cool!,"If you have a AAA membership, you'll get a $2 discount! It was very cool to see some of the outfits that have been worn, the history of music and to also be able to try to be your own musician. We were lucky enough to see the Ringo Star exhibit which was really incredible! Definitely a must see if you like music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellel936
40,"Great 2 visit, but MJs exhibit was taken down","A bit sad, since the MJs exhibit was down for maintenance when we where there in mid April. But we enjoyed in anyways. THE Beatles exhibit was an interesting feature with karaoke, sing, record and playback; yellow submarine. Well worth a visit. I think it was 4 floors in total. Take your time and enjoy. Make sure to drop by the Staples area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/covenant786
50,"If you're a music lover, this is a must see","You can spend all day here exploring all the exhibits on each floor. The location is great as it's part of the LA Live entertainment area in downtown Los Angeles so there are lots of restaurants you can go to after your visit to the museum. You could spend all day and night here especially if you have tickets to a concert or a game at Staples Center or Nokia. This museum has regular exhibits here all year and traveling exhibits. I believe right now the Ringo Starr exhibit is here until April 27th. Some of it is interactive, which kids love. There are film clips of concerts, etc. Pretty fascinating and informative not to mention fun. Parking is available all around the Grammy Museum for a charge. The venue can also be rented for special events such as weddings-there's a killer view from the 5th floor of the museum, you can see all of downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847georgeb
30,"Interesting if you like music, especially rock and pop","It's not the largest museum, and definitely emphasizes modern music, but I still enjoyed the opportunity to hear various rock and pop songs from my youth and afterwards. A few interesting displays about jazz and country, costumes, etc. I passed on the stations that supposedly gave you an opportunity to mix music tracks, etc. The changing exhibit-- items from Ringo Starr, including photographs-- was okay.At $12.50, I felt I got my money's worth. I wouldn't return, but am glad I went. Certainly not the city's best museum (I wouldn't suggest passing up on the Getty to go here), but still somewhat interesting. Good idea to take advantage of being downtown to see some historic sights, including the Millennium Biltmore Hotel (where the Academy Awards were handed out in the 30s), Bradbury Building, Grand Central Market, Angels Flights, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sutter
50,Great experience for music lovers of all levels,"Impressive museum, permanent as well as temporary exhibits so each time you go to LA there is a reason to go back. We caught Ringo Starr and the Beatles as well as Creedence Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty. You could easily spend an entire day there watching and listening to current clips as well as historical video. Even Beyonce's white gown from the Grammy's that happened the week prior to our visit. You can learn how to ""mix"" music and so much more. Definitely 5 stars all the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gocathyl
50,Must go for music lovers!,"I love all kind of music and have my own band. When I visit this museum, it made me exciting. It talk about all kind of music, let you know the history for them; you can experience lot of different music instrument : guitar, drum, and even electronic music instrument!All music lovers must go!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citytraveldreamer
50,Interactive Pleasure,"Sound booths where you learn how to mix and participate in the final result were great. And who wouldn't enjoy donning headphones to sing along with Cheap trick? The Ringo Starr exhibit had us in a soundbooth singing Yellow Submarine with Ringo and then we got to listen. Don't worry--if you can't stand the sound of your own voice--there's a ""make it stop"" button on the touch screen!So much fun and reminiscing! Philharmonic, opera, pop, jazz, Latino, creole, folk--music for every ear. Costumes and grammy award shorts. So glad we went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VermontWoman
40,Nicely Done,"My son and arrived early for an LA Clippers basketball game and spent two hours browsing through the museum. The four story showcase is nicely laid out and they have both permanent (Grammy items such as clothing, awards trophies, etc.) and temporary displays. The history of recorded music is very interesting, showing everything in date order from Grammaphones to mp3 players. There are many interactive sound rooms in the museum, where one can get a deeper feel of what goes into recording music.On our vistit, one area was devoted to Cheap Trick, displaying guitars, clothing, contracts, etc., particularly from their highly poplular Japanese tours. Another area was devoted to Placido Domingo, with many of his opera wardrobes on display along with a large screen showing highlights from his performances. Still another area focused on John Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival. Lots of liner notes, contracts, etc.When we were there (3/10/14) an entire floor was devoted to Ringo Starr. REALLY cool stuff on display from both Ringo and The Beatles. His drum set used on Ed Sullivan Show, the pink outfit he wore on cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club album, etc. VERY nicely done.Allow yourself two hours to do it right. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to visit the museum for that specific purpose, but if you have plans for the evening to attend Staples Center for a sporitng event or concert, or plan on going to LA Live to eat, etc., it's a nice thing to do if you want to arrive early and miss the event's traffic. Discount tickets are available online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveR286
30,Disappointed,"We expected a much broader display of grammy artists but found a very large display for cheap trick and john fogerty. The changing display was all about Ringo Starr - not someone we found very interesting. The interactive displays where you can mix and record were not as well done as we expected. In general, the museum did not engage us (even though we had musicians in our group)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/varipaul
50,No better place to learn about music's history and connections,"Part of the reimagined Skid Row section, now LA Live (with the Staples Arena). Starting on the 4th floor, several highly interactive visits let you read, see, and hear about music's evolution and its important role in history. I could have played all day with the touch screen program showing how different genres are related and what makes each unique. You'll leave wanting to buy 100s of albums. The rest of the museum is devoted to the Grammys, with memorabilia from the first (Hendrix guitar) to the most recent (ex. Daft Punk's outfits). When I went, there was a special exhibit on John Fogerty and a floor dedicated to Ringo Starr, which included his Sgt. Pepper outfit, original drum kit, and tons more. Would love to come back with my family-- no matter what music you like, there's something here to fascinate. And in the blocks around the museum, Hollywood-style markers of each year's winners are set in the sidewalks. One drawback: no photos! Leave only with memories and maybe overpriced items from the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natty64
50,Great little museum,"We took advantage of a Groupon offer to visit the Grammy Museum. We were a little wary of how much we would enjoy it - after the 1970's our knowledge of music is minimal. But, it is a museum. There was a John Fogerty exhibit that provide lots of information re: his plagiarism lawsuit. Can you imagine being sued because the new songs you wrote sounded similar to the older songs you wrote. But enough of that. The hands on exhibits allow you to listen to the songs from your favorite decades, sing along with ""Yellow Submarie"" and other fun things. Strongly recommend that you plan a visit to the Grammy Museum when you visit Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4511QZmarys
50,Really fun,This was way more fun than we expected. It's quite interactive. You can try to play various instruments and sing along with Ringo! The museum is compact but does give viewers an excellent snapshot of various styles of musics. The presentations about specific artists are also very well done. You can easily spend 2 hours there. Liked the Museum's little boutique.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilviaD949
50,Loved it!,"The museum is really fun!There is place in a museum for every gener so everyone will find something interesting.It is also suitable for kids, they would have a lot of fun (especially playing different instruments).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sp3la
40,Fun Museum,Great to see the people who are in the Grammys and to listen to there music that won a Grammy and hear the speech of the Grammy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyinus
40,Great place!,Very interesting and fun! Saw the Ringo Starr exhibits. Cool place. Bring the kids. After we walked LA Live. Lots to do! Went to eat at Farms. Then bowling at Lucky Strikes. Drink at the Marriott. Dancing at the Conga room. 12 hour date. Wow!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393charlesr
50,A Gem Nearby the Hotel,"This is a fun place to visit if you have 2-3 hours to go through it. Many memories for both my husband and me of ""idols"" we enjoyed when we were young. Ringo Starr was featured, along with Elvis and original songs written on 8-1/2 x 11 yellow-dog. Fogarty has lots of memorabilia. Worth your time! Recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristeneR
50,A trip down Memory Lane with a Beatle,"Ringo Starr has his Beatle exhibit Peace and Love showing at the Grammy Museum till March 2014. I was amazed on what he has saved through the years. His Beatle drum sets from 1965 and the Let it Be set were in a glass case to view. His Beatle cloths were there, along with Beatle photos that I have never seen before. It was a great experience to view all these things, since it will be 50 years ago the Beatles hit our shores. I highly recommend this exhibit to anyone who is a Beatle fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nutmagnet101
40,"A young, evolving museum","The Grammy Museum first opened in late 2008. It explores the legacies (and legends) of many genres of music and is devoted to the history and winners of Grammy awards. There are many musical artifacts from clothes to musical instruments to handwritten lyrics. The interactive displays make learning about the musical genres presented more interesting. We also learned a little more about the Michael Jackson display from someone involved in originally opening the museum.There are 4 floors to the museum. It's a little confusing on how they are laid out because they don't seem to be in a particular chronologic order, but it was recommended that we start from the top floor and go down so that's what we did. We spent about 60 minutes there, and you really need more time to see everything, but we didn't have more time.If you are looking for something different to do in L.A., and you have any curiosity about the history of the Grammys, I would recommend coming to see this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3-SLB
40,Enjoyable place to visit,"Make sure you look for Groupons. I don't know if I would have wanted to pay full price, but $13.25 for two people was a bargain. We spent about 2 1/2 hours there because my husband is very into music so we took our time. We tried about 6 of the practice booths (practice mixing, doing vocals etc in recording booths.) The VJs walk you through the assignments, some of which take about 12 minutes if you want the training videos. But that's part of the fun and learning experience. Love the artifacts and different places to listen to music over headsets. Fun if you fold this into a ""downtown field trip"" kind of day. It's not enough to go into downtown by itself. Maybe mix with the free Disney Concert Hall tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikki777
50,Experience,"You can try to sing in the recording booth and to be DJ! PLUS I could know the history about all of music category and of course I could watch the successive speech that got Grammy award. It was really impressed and so much fun time!! If you love music, you would like here!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayaaan131
40,21 year old son was impressed,Low- priced fun for the entire family!I was so happy that my 21-year-old son asked to visit this museum after seeing an ad about the Ringo exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingpineapples
40,Fascinating artefacts,"Get close to artefacts from some of the greatest musicians..covers all genres. Reasonably priced, allow 2hr is more than enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamJulian
50,Something different,"It is slightly hidden, but your landmark would be the Staples in Los Angeles. We went on Dec 27, we were able to park on the street. Got the tickets from Groupon so it was a very good deal like $25 for 4 people. My 8 year old son loved playing the drums on display, I think it was Ringo's of the Beatles. He was also very impressed with the mixer. I think Ringo exhibit was not a permanent one, you can check the website.It is a 3 or 4 story museum. Very well maintained, the people working there were all very nice. If you like music or the Grammy, try to see the place if you are visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kate2010
40,Nice,The tour of the Musuem takes about 2 hours. The tickets are decently priced. There are four floors to cover and lots of interactive instruments and music stations where once can listen to their favorite music. There is also an audio visual room which explains the quality of sound of music from inception till date. There is also a small booth where one can sing on karaoke. For music lovers its good place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenobiak2016
50,Really enjoyed!,"We were pleasantly surprised with our visit here. I don't think youngsters will enjoy this as much, but for those of us that are 40+, I think you will really enjoy what you see!One small negative comment is that I was surprised at the need to take stairs down each floor - if there were elevators available, I did not notice them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deemc99
40,Great Introduction to the World of Music,"We went here yesterday, during Christmas break. Traffic was not bad at all. Parking is located within the LA Live complex and it was about a 5 minute walk to the museum. It was a nice stroll.We were greeted by the person in front and was advised to check out the fourth floor first and then go down to each level... There was a great display and interactive exhibits in each floor. Different genres were visible, country, rap, latin, pop, opera, etc. It is good for all ages. I brought my two kids, 6 and 12 yrs old...and they loved it. Enjoyed the Micheal Jackson display and the Beatles!!! The kids enjoyed the interactive exhibits especially the drums and guitar, and the singing booth... Would have given it a 5 star if not for the expensive magnet I bought... $15 for a small one... but overall it's all good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
30,Go on a weekend,"Our visit, on a Thursday afternoon, was spoiled by a large group of middle-school aged schoolchildren, apparently on a field trip, but unsupervised by anybody we could see. When we could work our way around them, we did enjoy the exhibits but didn't stay very long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LavanRose
50,Visit it the Grammy Awards Museum,"This is our 2nd visit to the Grammy Museum. Anyone who is into all types of music, this is the place. Three floors dedicated to different genres. Something for everyone. The 2nd fl is reserved for special exhibits. Currently Ringo Starr is showcased. Even the kids will enjoy this trip to a museum. I couldn't get my wife off the interactive drums. $26 fir admission is a bit steep for adults, but I did find a half price Groupon deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888WalterH
50,Music lover's dream come true,The Grammy Museum is a music lover's dream come true! Currently you can go and see the Ringo Starr curated exhibit and be blown away be the amazing items that are part of rock history. The events and exhibits I have seen over the past years always bring back sweet memories and it warms my heart to know that every dollar I spend there goes to music education for those children that might never receive it in their school. I am blessed to be able to pay it forward... The walls and floors are crammed with amazing gems for you to explore...go go GO!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506cathyg
50,Everyone would enjoy this place,"First of all, the admission price is very affordable -- under $13 for an adult! We thoroughly enjoyed this place - so interesting. There are displays and informative interactive experiences for every type of music. Don't be fooled thinking it is only for popular music. It has every genre. There is also an area of information showing the beginning of recorded sound. There are displays of technology for the science-minded and displays of costumes worn by famous people. I think there are 3 floors of displays and the lowest (next to the first floor where you enter) is a large display of Ringo Starr's entire career from before the Beatle's to the present. There is also a gift shop on that floor.The Grammy Museum is located in the large area of the Staple's Center downtown Los Angeles so there are other things to see and do in the area. Many restaurants so we had lunch after walking around the museum. It was perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritBorn
40,Inspiration,From the very start of the museum to the end you leave with a sense of inspiration from what Grammy winners have accomplished. I think more can be done however with the interactive area (see EMF Museum in Seattle).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641dwighth
50,Fantastic Ringo Starr exhibition. A must for all Beatles fans.,We visited from the U.K. primarily to see the Ringo Starr exhibition and were not disappointed. There is loads of original Beatles memorabilia on display and a Beatles fan needs 3 or 4 hours to take it all in. The rest of the museum is very U.S. music focused as you would expect and there are some great interactive booths were you can make your own music etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davehChester_England
50,Unexpected four hour joy!!,"One our last day in LA, found this museum listed in a travel guide. Decided to ""stop in"" on our way to Calle Olvera, LA's old town. Wow!! We stayed for almost four hours, the museum offered so much rich and interactive information. We viewed old clips of musicians, history of music style, and memorabilia. We played instruments, entered sound booths and recorded, mixed and produced our own music. What fun!! A definite stop in LA, put it at the top of your list if you like music of any kind- jazz, blues, country, big band, rock, rap....it has it all. Kid friendly and ADA accessible. And affordable, where else in LA could you get four hours of musical entertainment for $12?! Glad we found it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondrad
40,Really good but can't take photos,This would have had 5 stars if you could have took photos'. This was a real let down for me!! Other than that this was awesome! Very interactive and informative. Could have spent all day in here! Not expensive either. Well worth the $12 entry fee!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonk752
40,"Beatles Fans, this is it!!","Held a work conference at the GRAMMY Museum, I didn't know it existed until this event.This is a great place, wonderful Beatles memorabilia, with the area I looked through focused on Ringo Starr. Amazing bits of historical Beatles stuff, postcards, tickets stubs, photos, costumes and drum sets, which I believe are the original.Don't do what I did, and that is rush through this place, take your time, really absorb it. You will like it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/km24800
30,"INTERESTING AND EDUCATIONAL BUT LACKING ""WOW'","Caught the temporary Ringo Starr exhibit on its last day and enjoyed a vivid walk down memory lane but didn't find much else to excite me enough to want to deal with the hassles of traffic and parking plus expense to get there. There were lots of technical, hands-on exhibits--several of which weren't working and some areas had too many sound tracks running in close proximity which made for an auditory nightmare. Teen boys seemed to enjoy ""playing"" the various instruments--so much that it was impossible for anyone else to have a go. The shop had nothing unique or even desirable and all of it over-priced. The Jenny Rivera tribute area was quite popular with the Latin visitors and it was fascinating to see several iconic MJ jackets up close as the workmanship was amazing. I had bought a membership online before I went thinking I might like to go back but unless they have a really interesting special exhibit I'd rather spend my time and $$ re-visiting the permanent collections at one of the Gettys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zildana
50,"A fun time for music lovers--and educational, too","We're Beatles fans who visited in order to see the Ringo Starr exhibit on the second floor, one of the rotating non-permanent exhibits. There was enough to see and experience that we could have spent much more time there. Music videos, costume and drum set displays, and lots of interactive experiences. We could play the drums, record our voices singing along to ""Yellow Submarine,"" put on earphones and mix sound, or just sit on a couch and watch the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show on a TV set--not to mention shopping at a gift-shop area. We also enjoyed the third floor, where there was a history of sound exhibit, featuring a miniature gramophone that we could record our voices on, many more costume exhibits, and a chance to play the bongos and steel-drums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaSandy
40,Very Interesting,Enjoyed seeing the evolution of music through the years. Loved the costumes and the way it is set up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plymouthtraveler10
30,"Head to Cleveland, if you can","Maybe it's not fair to compare the Grammy Museum to the Rock and Roll hall of Fame. Certainly, if you have never been to Cleveland, heading to the Grammy Museum is nice. Very touching was the behind-the-scenes film about the Grammy Show that aired after Whitney Houston's death. It brought a tear to everyone's eyes.There are some cool things there as well. The evolution of the Grammy award is interesting as you can see the changes to the award.On the other hand, The Rock and Roll hall of Fame is the place to visit. I can't say enough good things about the size and displays at the HOF.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBrozo
50,"Very ""hands on""...fun and educational","The museum is geared to both musical enjoyment and learning. It is FUN!! Visitors can see, hear, play along, and do things to get involved in the music experience. It is not a huge place and it is well arranged by floors....makes good use of space. One could spend hours there OR just tour through and get a good feel of the times and artists that have been part of the music scene. Kudos to the museum director and his staff!! This museum is a ""gem.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legendstennis

40,More fun than I thought,My fiancé purchased a groupon while we were vacationing in LA for this museum. He is a music connoisseur and I dreaded being stuck in here for longer then I wanted to be. Surprisingly I was the one who ended up having all the fun. Many different areas with short films about different artists or grammy award performances or ways to listen to a variety of music whether your testing music from different areas to producing beats in a recording studio. The Latin music area was my favorite because you could try a variety of instruments. Locally there is a few restaurants and a shopping area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaC1984
40,Worthwhile day trip.,"Received complimentary tickets, admission is about $12.95 . Definitely worthwhile you will see lots of cool items and learn a little something too. Has four floors, on the small side, but worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23vacationtime

50,Our second visit and I'm not a huge music fan - or am I?,"I asked to come back to see more of the Grammy museum on this trip to LA as we only had a few hours the first time...you could spend hours in this place. I found out I was much more of a music fan than I thought - music from all eras is represented - they have wonderful fun interactive exhibits - you can hear yourself play on drums or on a keyboard, lip-sync with the Yellow Submarine, listen to all kinds of music from many time frames. The special exhibit when we went two years ago was Yoko Ono and John Lennon, this time it was Ringo Starr. Very interesting. The Grammy costumes are amazing that they have on display. I would think even children would like this museum, well worth a trip when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILuvEngland

40,Pretty Fun Museum,"Right in the middle of Los Angeles's ""L.A. Live"" complex is the Grammy Museum. This multi-floor facility gives visitors a walk through the history of the Grammy's by showing various memorabilia of winners, videos of performances and interesting tidbits about the show. You can even see Grammy awards up close. There is also currently a video tribute to Whitney Houston, who won 7 Grammy's and was nominated 26 times. Most will probably spend an hour here, but you can spend a few hours if you really want to experience every thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GNRMatt
50,"Interactive, Educational & Inspiring","As an avid music fan I wasreally excited to visit the Grammy Museum on my trip to LA and made it my first point of call to visit as soon as I got there.Conveniently, the museum is a stop on a Hop On Hop Off bus tour route.I was expecting just to see a few Grammys from over the years in display and not too much else, but was so excited to walk into a room full of fantastic displays of records, costumes and other items from some of the worlds most loved musicians and songwriters across every genre of music.There were rooms showing videos on different artists and music styles, headphones located at lots of the displays so you could hear the music of a particular band/artist as you read about them and interactive computers where you could listen to genres of music learning about its origins and artists.There is one room dedicated to songwriters and even gives you the opportunity to collaborate in a song writing project.The Grammy Museum is a great place to visit for any music fan and an exciting place to take the kids!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethiejacko
50,Allow At Lease 3 Hours to Visit Here!,"Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating museum. The exhibits were all exceptionally well done, with interesting captions, histories, etc. You could spend a day here, but allow at least three hours to see everything. Our children (10 & 12) LOVED the interactive musical instruments, especially the drums! They also enjoyed the various recording booths, where they could sing and mix music. The Ringo Exhibit was fascinating and perfectly done; brought back lots of memories for this Baby Boomer! Don't miss this place, if you're near downtown LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scribe765
50,Great for music lovers,"Really enjoyed the museum. Loved seeing all the different outfits from various singers. They had stations where you could sing a song, master a track etc. Lots of good memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cay2004
40,A Must See,"Being a huge music fan, I was looking forward to visiting the Grammy Museum.Started off well; staff were very polite and helpful (as everyone is in California) and the first exhibit had me hooked! Then a large youth/school group arrived. They took ownership of all the interactive exhibits, decided to take photos of every single item in the museum no matter if someone was viewing it (you were pushed out of the way) and run amoke throughout the museum. An angry looking staff member come out to survey what was happening but nothing was said. So I ended up skipping the entire 4th floor to lose the group.From then on the museum was a fun and informative experience. Didn't disappoint one bit. I wanted to stay longer and thoroughly enjoy what was on offer and would have gone back if I had more time in LA. Should have immediately left and complained to see if they would have give me a ticket for any other time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwigirlabroad
40,"Great Museum, Educational and Surprisingly Fun!","When I last visited L.A., one of our party desperately wanted to check out a Museum and the discussion continued for over a day when we finally relented and went to the Grammy Museum. We had been disappointed at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and were expecting much of the same - not at all! This is a true music lover's museum. With the opportunity to sample all types of music and to learn a great deal about your favorite and not-so-favorite artists, it was definitely worth the trip. The booths where you can learn about singing, re-mixing, rapping, are the absolute best and I could have spent my entire day in them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesLynx
50,Wonderful Museum,"My wife and I very much enjoyed our visit to this museum. We spent over two hours interacting with the exhibits, watching videos and the like. A real plus is that you can leave for a lunch break and come back - easy in and out access. Much more interesting that I had anticipated. Another plus is that we got half price tickets on Groupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikerDave2
50,A fabulous find for any kind of music lover,"I recently went to this museum for the first time with a friend who has lived in West Los Angeles for over 25 years. She had never even heard of it. There is a great new exhibit on Ringo Starr and the Beatles. Visitors get lots of chances to put earphones on and listen to great music, with opportunities to sit at various instruments and become the soloist yourself. We really enjoyed seeing all the historical exhibits and learning new things about popular musicians. This is a fascinating place to spend time in Los Angeles....we did not allot ourselves enough time and already have other people interested in going with us when we return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtogo09

50,Spring Break 2013 - Fun for all age groups,"We visited the Grammy Museum with our family, ages 12 to 43, and everyone had a great time. We went especially for the Whitney Houston exhibit. It was informational and interactive. I enjoyed that it covered multiple decades and genres of music. The kids enjoyed the hands on, and technologically up to date exhibits. Give yourself at least 2.5 hours to enjoy the entire museum.At the time of our visit, there was a AAA discounted price for admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFields2010
50,Music lovers haven,"If you have music lovers in the family, this is a great place to take them. Most of the exhibits are interactive with headphones so you can listen to performances and interviews with hundreds of artists. The Ringo Starr exhibit is the current featured one and is very thorough. The whole family including teenagers thoroughly enjoyed this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treehugger_12
50,Great museum for all ages,"Location is in the financial district downtown LA (not close to Hollywood), traffic was heavy getting there so if you are coming from another area, give yourself time as the highway traffic was heavy. Parking on the other side of Olympia is better than paying more for a closer place. Each floor of the museum has interesting memorabilia and history. My 9 year old son had fun playing the drums and guitar and learning to rap (a lot of interactive activities). My 19 year old daughter loved watching past Grammy award winners and presentations. We were there for 1.5 hours but could have spent more time there if we could. It closes at 7:30 pm on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel5
50,Always Enjoyable,"My second visit to The Grammy Museum. This time I went for the Ringo exhibit. I enjoyed every bit of it, especially the interviews with other drummers. As someone who grew up during the sixties, music has always been a big part of my life. Even though I don't always agree with ""and the Grammy goes to"", I can always find something I agree with at The Grammy Museum. A must for anyone who enjoys music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonC56

50,Fun trip down Memory Lane,"Really enjoyed my experience here. Great to relive the music of my youth. The Ringo exhibit was great, but the rest of it was cool too. We spent about 2 hours there and saw just about everything. The price is reasonable for LA ($12, I think) and parking was easy. We parked in a lot about a block away for $8 for the whole day, which gave us time to explore a little and had breakfast at the Original Pantry Cafe, also a block away. GREAT breakfast, by the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Galvagirl

40,"Good, but it's not like the rock and roll hall of fame.","It was a good Father's Day trip. Neat exhibits. Loved the Ringo star exhibit. It's a great thing to do at LA Live. I loved how they had all these creative very hands on exhibits. It was super interactive. But two things sort of bothered me.1) The videos of the previous Grammy awards both when you walk in on the 4th floor and on the 3rd when they are showing the greatest performances had bad speakers. I mean this is music. You want to hear things... the visual of the performances is good, but the sound should be amazing.2) there were tons of really cool interactive displays which had headsets to listen. But most only had one headset. It would have been great to have a min of 2 and sometimes more so as your learning about something your group can hear along with you. I was splitting my head set with my daughter on the grunge history....All in all if you love music and you want to see how it all gets tied together this is a great way to spend the afternoon. It's not the rock and roll hall of fame (and i am pretty sure it's not trying to be) but its a great display of how music works filled with displays and interactive exhibits. Very cool.... Maybe not for kids under 8 mine were bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pklfam5

40,"Great Value and Fun for What it Is, Limited Coverage Notwithstanding","This is a great museum and an incredible value for anyone interested in any form of music. The displays are top-notch, the equipment/listening rooms are of great quality, and if you're an audiophile, it will not disappoint at all.Also, it's part of L.A. Live in Downtown L.A., so it's easy accessible and has plenty of dining options right next to it for anyone to easily spend a half day in the area. (Check the parking rates at the L.A. Live website)That said, I do wish it had more global diversity in the artists, music, and musical instruments it showcases. But then, the Grammys in general have had a hard time keeping up with that (in my humble opinion).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
50,Musssiccc,"What a great place for everyone. It's very interactive in playing instruments, being in the recording studio, using the knobs for voice/sound modulation, and listening to yourself rap. There are different booths that teach you different steps in recording (ie mixing, voice pans, etc) There is a wall of past Grammy winners for Album of the year since its very first year, music's evolution in different time periods, etc. There is so much to do here and so many things to learn. Also, visit the Clive Davis theatre and learn a thing or two more about music.Although, I would pass on the Grammy store. Things are too overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
40,Cool music museum in the heart of downtown,"Cool music museum in the heart of downtown. Went with teen son and it was pretty cool. Lots of hands on stuff and very diverse in the variety of music represented. Had some special limited time displays for Whitney Houston, wasn't too big into that being that she is known for her drug abuse as much as she is for her music contributions. Nice modern building though, very well done all the way thru.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucep460
40,Interactive fun!,"This is a really great museum. We didn't plan on going to see it but stumbled upon it and thought 'why not?'. We were really glad we ended up going, it was one of the best things we did in LA. It is a very interactive museum and has something for lovers of all genres. I learnt a lot and had a great time.Note; there is no photography in the museum so there's no need to bring along heavy cameras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok
40,Fun and entertaining,"We went there to see the Michael Jackson exhibit. We were bummed there weren't more personal items to look at in his exhibit but overall the museum was nice. The history of music, playing musical instruments, and the music studio rooms were a lot of fun and the kids really enjoyed that. The entrance fee was fair. Took only about 1 hr to go through the floors but that was because we didn't stop to read all the exhibits. The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and Whitney Houston exhibit areas were very good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneS61760745
50,Fabulous interactive exhibits,"The Grammy Museum offers a fantastic experience, as most of its exhibits are interactive, allowing you to listen, read about and even play and write music in whatever genres interest you. The first exhibit you encounter (on the top floor) is a long table where projected images scroll by. Use your finger to select any of the multitude of music genres scrolling by, then hear samples of the music, read about the history of the genre, and access related genres. You can spend quite a while at this exhibit, but there is much more. Another favorite is a sound room in which you select one of 5 modern performance songs, then get to hear what the song would have sounded like on various playback equipment through the ages, beginning in the 1800's. Whether you like to listen, read, play or write or watch, you will find numerous interactive options to keep you entertained. Plan on spending at least 2 hours here, more if you can. Not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECrowther
50,great visit!,"If you're a music lover, you will enjoy this! Quite a bit of memorabilia and interactive activities on three floors. Also, if you have AAA, you can use your card for a savings of $3pp, making the entry fee only $10pp!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenflady
50,A lot of fun...even for casual music fans,"We took a trip on Saturday to the museum because my wife and daughter are big music fans. I have only been to one concert in my life, so for me, I must be considered a casual fan. Two plus hours later we were all talking about how cool this place was. All the kids enjoyed the many hands-on demonstrations around the museum. What's great is that it is relatively new, so everything is working! The studios on the third floor, where you can mix, sing, arrange, are a lot of fun. It is really a cool experience for everyone...even my 8 year old found lots of things to do.If you are a music fanatic, this place will take 4 hours to go through. This is certainly worth the time and effort if you want to enjoy a thorough history of music. A must see for any fan...even casual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ-Traveler85253
40,Music history,"This is a great place to visit! It is interactive. Lots of headphones for listening. High tech equipment and interactive displays for creating music. When you first walk in on the 4th floor, there is a wonderful display to listen to music from various types of music and various periods. There are sound booths on the second floor for mixing, remixing, etc. There is also a rotating exhibit. Check the Internet for coupons on the entry price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triptravelCA
50,So much fun!,"I had an offer from Travelzoo for this museum for $13 for 2 people. It's usually only $13 per person anyway which I think is very good value. I went with a friend and we thought an hour or two would be plenty of time but I could have spend hours here, we had so much fun listening to all different genres of music and discovering how music has evolved through the years. Lots of interactive exhibitions, costumes and grammys to look at over 4 floors. We were so pleasantly surprised by this museum, I can't wait to go back and spend more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shell_80
40,Kids even enjoyed it,"I was looking for a way to kill a couple of hours in downtown with my 3 boys, ages 14 and 10. Decided to check out the Grammy museum. Didn't really know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. Many cool exhibits to look at but also, more importantly with 3 boys, many interactive exhibits. My 10 year old twins really enjoyed the large interactive table where you could listen to many different types of music. They also enjoyed the small sound rooms where you could try your hand at mixing a track. My older son plays two instruments. He and I got more out of the artist exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairef246
50,Essential for music lovers,"The Grammy Museum is simply stunning. I had not heard of it till a friend mentioned the Whitney Houston display. I was so impressed! There is so much to see, and great interactive displays, with something for every taste. A great price too. Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
50,For the Music Lover in all of Us,Spent several hours at the Grammy Museum. They were spot-lighting the Beach Boys at the time. Wonderful memorabilia from the group. There was also a tribute to Whitney Houston that was very well done. Lots of interactive displays and exhibits from different musical era's. I think everyone would find something to love about this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaMtnmomma
50,"So much for the music lover, plus special shows!","I went the other night because I won tickets to a special documentary screening and live performance by Jim Lauderdale. It was great – and myself as well as many others had no idea the Museum did these kinds of up-close and very personal things with entertainers. Also, the Grammy Museum archives are not open and available, so you can see and hear all programs such as this one. This just recently became available. It is a great place and I don’t know why more people don’t check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
50,"Fantastic interactive informative museum, for the whole family","The Grammy Museum is really well put together, extremely informative. I could have spent 5 - 6 hours there. Very interactive, including ""An Evening With..."" exhibit to view previous events held in the Clive Davis Theatre. Each month there is a spotlight on a band -- when I was there it was the Beach Boys, complete with handwritten lyrics, yearbooks, even an essay written by Brian Wilson when he was a student. Interesting exhibit on Epicenters of Music through the years narrated by Dave Alvin; you can help write a song at the songwriter exhibit; you can accompany a band on the drums or conga; learn the steps of a recording session; see the history of Columbia records. I was amazed at the amount of information and surprised at what a good time I had. Good for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiflalawi-Adventures
40,Interactive museum suitable for all,"Went here with my mum as we were on our way to Staples Center and had a few hours to spare. We are not really big music fans but still we spent a good two hours here. A music lover would probably spent longer here though! There were three levels of exhibits and they were all really informative and interactive. Some even allowed you to co-write a song, play some instruments and sing along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chunlian
30,Not much of Michael Jackson..what's up with that?,"We had some down time and decided to visit the Grammy museum which we enjoyed,however...so surprised to find out that MJ did not have a bigger exhibit...He is the king of Pop and was very upset to see the lack of info about MJ...It was cool to see Some of his custom jackets especially the jacket he wore in thriller...It's definitely worth the trip..but they need more of Michael!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScileppiM
50,Star in your own band,"This is a very interactive museum. The tour begins on the fourth floor. At the time I went, the Whitney Houston exhibit was on display. A great chronological display. Her outfits are on display and it was awe inspiring to see up close the outfits only seen in print or television. The fourth floor provides history of the grammy award along with exhibits of the Beach Boys, classical, gospel, jazz and America's music history just to name a few. There's a rock and roll exhibit. The interactive instruments include drums, a keyboard and a guitar. You could spend hours on the instruments alone. Of course, I went late in the day 5:30 and pretty much had the place to myself until closing There are recording rooms to hear what it sounds like to record a song. Too many exhibits to mention. I feel all music genres were covered including a songwriters exhibit. All ages will find something of interest and benches are provided for those who want to sit a spell.I will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanDwalkerCali
50,The place to go for music lovers,"The exhibits are fantastic, you feel like you are a part of music history. Interactive booths are amazing, going through what is involved in the recording process. Learn about what came before mp3's and CD's....does anyone remember vinyl records, cassettes? If you love music, and music history, you must visit the Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD813
40,Great way to spend an hour or two,"This review is a bit late, I haven't been in a year, but I had a lot of fun! Went with my boyfriend who is a music major so he was really excited about the exhibits. You can get through the museum in two hours if you are going at a leisurely pace, or one if you're in a hurry.However, I would say there are a few prerequisites in coming here:1. You are really into music (or someone in your group is). You might find it a bit dry otherwiseAND/OR2. You are in the neighborhood. The museum is at LA Live, which has a movie theater, great restaurants, the Staples and Nokia Center (basketball games, concerts, etc), and an ice skating rink that is set up around Thanksgiving! So you could do the museum during the day and then an activity at night. You are also close to USC and downtown.So if either of these apply to you, I would definitely recommend going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zbosherow
20,Disappointing Heavy Metal exhibition,"I made the specific journey from West Hollywood to Downtown just to see the Heavy Metal exhibit within the Grammy Museum. I had seen about 4 or 5 pics online and was very interested in seeing it for myself. It turned out the pics I had seen was the entire exhibit. There's a couple of videos on loop (Marilyn Manson and one about thrash metal) and an almost Rock Band or Guitar Hero part where you can play simulated instruments, but I left very disappointed. It's only $10 so not a huge expense, just an hour travel each way for me was the killer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaronV373
50,Reception held at the Museum,"Clive Davis world of successes, grammys, and historical memories.If you have some down time, I suggest you visit the museum. If you are lucky, perhaps you can attend an event there.Not the reception I attended was catered by Wolkgang Puck Yum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammyD171
50,Didn't Want Our Visit to End,"My husband and I loved our visit to the Grammy Museum. We began with the Whitney Houston special exhibit on the second floor. Such wonderful artifacts - including a detailed letter written by Clive Davis to Whitney full of detailed constructive criticism when she was a young artist. So much music, all of her music videos, costumes, influences, performances, and videos of performances. We loved it. The gift shop on the second floor was great too with a large selection of special collections.We then went to the third floor and enjoyed seeing Michael Jackson's costumes and especially enjoyed the booths to learn more about sound mixing and engineering. The fourth floor was a real surprise with footage of Grammy awards, cultural influences and political history of music, and a wonderful exhibit about Woody Guthrie. Just so much to see and learn about. We loved it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walkinggirl1234
20,Disappointing!,"I was really looking forward to this museum as I am a huge music fan, however myself and my family were left very disappointed. There doesnt seem to be a lot of order to the museum so you could easily miss something, however there were some good videos about various musical genres. There didnt seem to be much information about music outside of pop, rock and roll and soul. If you were walking round the museum you wouldnt know that any artists outside of americans had won a grammy which was very disappointing! Overall its not worth the money you pay to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7812STjoanner
50,Nice collection of memorabilia,"Educational, reflective and fun! The museum covers four floors filled with memorabila from every genre of music. Exhibits are very well laid out and really take you on a stroll down memory lane. The highlight for me was the Whitney Houston exhibit (which is temporary). There is also a theater within the museum, but the temperature within the theater was sooooo cold that I walked in and immediately walked out, so had to mss the showing. Otherwise a good museum and I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajj976
40,Lots of fun,"Many memories , great history, great music. This museum needs several hours to really get the historical appreciation of music from several generations. We traveled with our 2-13 year olds and had lots of fun. We also returned later in the day for a program with Daniel Bennington in the Davis auditorium....it was great with talking, singing and dancing...could have stayed for more but the program needed to end...it was already one hour overtime. Make an effort to visit this museum if you have enjoyed music in your life.Grammy Sharon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grammysharon
50,It ROCKED,"Tons to learn and see- cool interactive exhibits! Really liked being able to try and play the instruments. TIP- check which exhibit is showing, will make a huge difference if you like that artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkynSea4me
30,"Ok, and worth a look if downtown","I wouldn't make a trip downtown just to see the museum, it is really kind of small considering the years of the Grammy's and it takes up 4 flours. There are some good exhibits and it tries to showcase many genres of music, but I did not walk away with a sense of the history of the Grammy's like I expected I would.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jbradly
50,Best kept secret...Must do if staying at LA Live!,"I had read other positive reviews for this museum, so when I checked into the LA Live JW Marriott with a hungry 9 yr old boy just 1 hour from closing...I went ahead and bought 2 tickets and entered!It was mid July and the museum had a special exhibit on rock and heavy metal. Being a single dad who was raised in the 80s...and has influenced my son...this was perfect!But the museum is so much more than that. It is very much a multi-media experience. There are sound booths for singing, interactive instruments, wardrobes, album covers, and of course the most memorable scenes from Grammy's!I wish we had had another hour! If your anywhere near downtown this is a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bherrmann72
50,Awesome doesn't even come close to describe this museum!,"It was fabulous! We loved it. I was supposed to see other places that day, but had no interest to leave the museum because it was so fantastic. We couldn't get enough of all the experiences we were able to try there. I loved the sound arranging on the songs the best, and seeing THE BEATLES there. The Love exhibit was nice, and it was nice to see the Beatles had impacted so many others as you go thru the exhibits and hear their names mentioned by other artists. They showed Barbara Streisand and Neil Diamond singing, ""You Dont Send Me Flowers"" and it was so touching. I cried thru much of the exhibits. LOVED IT JUST LOVED IT. My daughter loved the Arcade Fire awards mentioned/which I dont blame her. Was great fun, wish I had even more time to spend there that day! Go, you wont be sorry, especially if you are a music lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marybeatles

30,It's OK,"It is something to see, but wouldn't necessarily run back to go again. There are some fun interactive things to do and I understand certain exhibits change regularly, but it was just OK to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigIndianWells_CA
20,A disappointment,"The Grammy Museum is located at the LA Live Area near Staples Center, just south of Downtown LA. The admission to get in is really not worth it. There are some interesting exhibits; however, I think people except more to it then it really is. There are many different levels to the museum and disabled people may not find it very user friendly. Much of the equipment such as head phones that you can listen to were not working while I was there. Most of the items they sell in their gift shop are geared to teens and young adults. To me, at least it was a disappointment and personally, I would not recommend it; I felt frankly, it was a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
50,Must see if you're in LA,"This was my second time visiting the Grammy Museum in the past couple of years, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time! There is so much to see in this place that I feel like I could (and want) to spend all day in there! The exhibits are very thorough in that they cover the history of sound, how music gets made, history and samples of every genre of music you can think of, history of the Grammys and lots of memorabilia. In addition to the standing exhibits, they have special exhibits as well as opportunities for museum goers to get interactive. Love this place! I can't wait to go back :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
20,Lack of focus makes a visit unsatisfying,"The Grammy Museum is located in the LA Live complex, near Staples Center and the Nokia Club and Theater in downtown LA. It's a frustrating place to visit -- parking is only $5 for the first two hours combines, but after that it goes up steeply, and as it's in a complex with lots else going on (restaurants, bowling alley, etc.), the cost can go up fast. If you go during the day you can take the metro, which will also get you $3 off your admission to the museum.The museum can't seem to decide whether it is a general music museum, a museum about recording, or one about the Grammy awards themselves. It's a hodgepodge of memorabilia, dry, technical info, a small trivia section, photos, and some electronic instruments to play and some booths that take you through the recording process, although the two aren't combined together, so you can't mix or play with what you create. Volume adjustments are sometimes non-existent or non-functioning, so these interactive displays are not as cool as they might have been. When I was there, there was a section devoted to the Las Vegas show ""Love"", which seemed nothing more than advertising, and a section of Michael Jackson that referred vaguely to controversy at the end of his life and his death from a heart attack. Guess the family wouldn't donate anything unless the facts were swept under the rug. Not exactly what you expect from a ""museum.""The space is rather small, and the gift shop an uninspiring mix of t-shirts,3D posters and books, with a few generic shot glasses thrown in.A fun thing to do if you have some time before a show, but not worth a separate trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934LindaP
40,Nice little slice of history for music lovers,This was very informative and entertaining. There were interactive displays. The one disappointing things is that you are not able to take pictures inside. I was not aware of this until after we had bought the tickets and were standing inside. Also make sure the theater inside is running. It was not running while we were there. That was also a bit disappointing and we were not told upon purchasing the ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LonnieB661
40,Decent museum,"This was a very interesting place, especially for music fans. Lots of interactive exhibits and some great nostalgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeedgar
50,Birthday for Grammy at the Grammy Museum,"Though there are rotating special shows highlighting various artists and we saw the Beatles, the best part is the display on counter tops that show the roots of one kind of music into another. You press various places on the display glass and different music plays in your ears. I could have stayed there all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latrvlr
50,Loved the Heavy Metal Exhibit,"OK, museums in general are tough with a 10 and 5-year old in tow, but my kids and husband and I loved the grammy museum. I just wish they allowed picture-taking because the Michael Jackson exhibit (whether your are a fan or not) is just amazing. So was the exhibit on Metal ...worth the trip and then some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wordsmithgirl

50,Grammy Museum---Mecca for Music Lovers,I LOVED all of the interactive displays that really go in debt on the history of musical styles and how so many of them interconnect and influence each other. This is really something for adults that love music and history and it's too sophisticated for younger kids. But teenagers that have been bitten by the music bug might really appreciate learning more about it from a historical perspective.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindeeClaire
50,lovely museum enjoy the music,This is something what I really love. I love a music so if you are also like me you have to go here. So much interesting to see and enjoying everything around you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianoL69
50,A MUST SEE,"Fantastic place! My husband and I spend a good 3 hours here in the Grammy Museum.There is so much to see and do.You can play instruments, listen to so much varied music. Great to see so many people with headphones jigging to the music they have chosen!There are outfits worn by the famous to various Grammy Awards Ceremonies.Don't miss it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillianA432
30,Interesting for music lovers,We went and discovered tt was a free day and it was too busy to really enjoy. I would have preferred to pay so I could've really enjoyed the exhibits without being shoved away.Otherwise the museum is a great way to spend an hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-JH1
50,If you are a music lover you have to see this,"If you love music this is a must see. They have interactive instruments, clothing worn by the performers and great pictures. Leave a lot of time in that there is a lot to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelB53
50,"Wow, this was so cool",Really fun. I spent a lot of time here. Many interactive exhibits and interesting collections are on display. I loved the sound exhibit where you experience what music sounded like on various recording/playback devices. Highly recommend checking this out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DepartingDuo
40,Pretty Cool place,It was a pretty cool museum if you love music and enjoy learning its history. Some parts were interactive which was cool. it was a bit on the pricey side but i believe after a certain time there may be a discount. Def check out the website about that and save yourself some money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephlino
40,A few hours well spent for music enthusiasts,"This compact four-storey museum in the heart of the L.A. Live complex has plenty of both information and hand-on interactive displays that explore nearly every type of music - and those who performed it the best. There are numerous retrospective exhibits and timeline histories for all genres of music that help show each genre's origins and how they have interacted over the years. Of course there are timelines, winner lists, lots of costumes, and a process description of both the regular and Latin Grammy awards. I was particularly pleased at the attention played to music from the 30'2- 50's and older patrons will be gratified to see recognition given to the legends of jazz and blues (Dizzy Gillespie, Louie Armstrong, Charlie Parker, etc). The layout is best experienced by starting at the top (4th) floor and working down (to the inevitable gift shop). All the exhibits are well-designed and despite the overall noise level, the visitor should be able to take it all in without distractions- some exhibits are headphones (including an early recording from the 1890's), others are large screen videos, others are touch panel displays, etc. There are also listening booths and actually guitars and drum sets that young people can play. Anyway, spend a few hours here and you will not be bored but instead are guaranteed to learn many new things about music and why it is such an important part of popular culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveLicata
40,Allow enough time so you can really take advantage of all the museum offers.,"We had no idea how much time to plan to explore this museum so allowed two hours - after all the website suggested parking in Lot E which is two hour parking for only $5 and a lot more money if you go beyond the two hour limit. There are a lot of videos and audios to listen to as well as exhibits to see. We would have listened to every one as they were all very interesting but it would have taken at least 4 - 5 hours. Each part of the exhibit is centered around a theme and then you see and hear music from the era, how it was reflecting society at the time, and what lasting impression that music had on society. You can also see actual clothing worn by artists when they attended the most recent Grammy Awards Ceremony.The exhibit is spaced over 4 floors. You start at the top and work your way down.. The top floor is a special exhibit area - currently ""Trouble in Paradise"" about how music from the 50s - 80s affected society - as well as some regular exhibits such Crossroads where you can explore 160 genres of music. The third floor is where you will learn how music recordings are produced, how computers have changed the music world, and have a chance to create some music of your own (if you have time, which we did not.) The second floor is about 1/3 gift shop and the remainder a theater as well as an exhibit - currently The History of Heavy Metal.I would definitely say this is not a museum for young children as they would be bored. It would be easy to get older children to focus (say age 10 and up) if the museum created a little handout/worksheet with a scavenger hunt on it. If you are planning to go, maybe if you go online you could get enough info to create one for your own family? Obviously, a lot of care and thought went into what would be presented and how it would be presented to bring it to life. The first floor is simply a reception area where you buy your tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivian_03
50,Fun and interactive,"I spent nearly 4 hours there, listening and learning. It's a great place for music lovers. Definitely not a destination to miss when you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDemands
50,Excellent for Teens or anyone involved in Music,"We visited the Grammy Museum with our group as part of of Music Educational Trip.We had a private tour of the museum before the doors actually opened and got to interact with the exibits, visit the different floors and view a private show in the Clive Davis Theatre.The staff are friendly and our guide was fantastic. No photos or videos are allowed to be taken at any point however which I feel is disappointing to not be able to look back at anything.There is plenty to do for all ages, including recording things, listening to music across all eras, playing on interactive musical instruments, viewing costumes, awards across the eras.Has a small shop to buy merchandise of which I had to buy a couple of things...pity there were no fake Grammy's to sell!A highly enjoyable experience and a must do for any Music Fan touring the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jinxyoz
40,Music lovers will enjoy,"There's a lot of history packed into this museum, We spent 1 hour, which was not enough time to really enjoy the exhibits.

20,Disappointing,"Located in LA Live next to Staple Center, this was kind of a boring place. Some of the interactive music exhibits were fun, like the drum sets and the George Harrison exhibit was interesting for Beatles fans, but other than those, it's a lot of outfits worn at the awards. 60-90 minutes at most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busytraveler1116
50,Fun history,"This museum was so much fun. There are SO many interactive things you can do. Play music, write songs, remix songs as well as so much music history. If you love music, you'll love it here. They also have the actual clothing celebrities wore to the Grammy's. It's a self guided tour. I love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdcutie01
50,fabulous place for music lovers,This is a great museum for music lovers. It has a lot of interactive exhibits. You can sing and play on the drums. They have a lot of memorabilia and cool costumes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCGK
50,A music lover's playground,"If you're traveling to Los Angeles and want something cool and fun to do, check out the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live. Not only do they have amazing exhibitions throughout the year, but the museum is filled with hands-on activities for you and your kids. Ever wondered what it's like to be in a recording studio? You can experience that for yourself at the museum. Have enough family members or friends to create your own band? You can do that, too! Of course there is also the educational aspect of music history that the museum also provides. It's an interesting, informative, and fun place for music lovers of all ages.Live in the Los Angeles area? Consider becoming a member of the Grammy Museum. Your membership dollars help to bring underprivileged, inner-city youth to the museum so they can learn for free! Plus, as a member, you'll be the first to know about their great events which take place in their intimate 200-seat theater. I've been a member for three years and have had the opportunity to see artists like Lady GaGa, George Benson, Harry Connick, Jr., Glen Campbell and Kenny Chesney, just to name a few.Whether a visitor or a resident of our wonderful city, do yourself a favor and visit the Grammy Museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaO22
40,Very Cool,"This is a must for any music lover. There were so many things to look at. There was even an area for recording which is my husbands thing. Not only did it have recognizable costumes and dresses worn by different artists (like JLO's famous green lowcut dress) but also many original works and notebooks by different artists such as Taylor Swift, Roy Orbison and even John Lennon. When we went there was a special Bob Marley exhibit which was awesome. Any musician would appreciate this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachperfect
30,for music buffs,"Went to see the George Harrison exhibit on its last day. They had plenty of pictures, memorabilia and music playing overhead. The other floors had fun exhibits too including different designs of the grammy awards through the years, different costumes and outfits including Michael Jackson's and the cast of the Beatles LOVE show. They also had headphones wo listen to different songs, unique car seats for watching shows and videos. The museum is small enough that an hour or so is enough to go through most items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVigilante
50,Grammy Museum ROCKS!,"Located in the LA Live center, right next to Staples Center is the Grammy Museum. This four-story attraction has something for everyone. From interactive computer touch screens, to large video screens, to costumes of musical performers, and even special guest performances in an amazing little 200 seat theatre. We've become members and visit with friends regularly to see the special exhibits (recent ones included John Lennon, Michael Jackson, George Harrison, Bob Marley and Roy Orbison--soon there will be a Heavy Metal exhibit). The museum doesn't focus on one type of music, rather fans of everything from classical to jazz to pop to Latin will find something (many things!) that appeals to them. There's so much to touch and do here make sure you have enough time--or buy the yearly membership and come back again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,A Musical Extravaganza,I am sure the last reviewer visited a different museum to the one we saw ! Maybe he wasn't a musician!We came here to see the Michael Jackson exhibit which was excellent but only had a couple of hours to see all that was on display. Shame I could have spent all day here listening & looking at the wonderful depth of musical history they have assembled.The shop attached has CD's etc that I have not seen elswhere.Don't miss this place if you have any interest in music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackhor
40,Cool exhibits with interactive displays,"I had heard about this museum before my family left for vacation and being into popular music, I wanted to visit it. It was close to Staples Center and fairly easy to access from the Metro system. The museum did have a fee of around $13.00 per adult which for non-enthusiasts may be a turn off.I am a big Taylor Swift fan, and I enjoyed viewing her various clothing and handwritten lyrics but was disappointed that I could not take photos. I also liked seeing other artist's instruments and props, and reading the different signs in the exhibits. There was a George Harrison section downstairs showcasing clothing, letters and handwritten lyrics. I am not a Beatles fan but I recommend it for those who are. I really enjoyed the interactive drum kit and playing on random instruments for fun.At the end, we looked in the gift shop and bought a few souvenirs, however I was confused when I saw many accessories and clothes to do with artists hardly mentioned in the museum (Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber), but none for those mentioned prominently (Taylor Swift), although I admit I have a biased opinion because of my personal preferences.Overall, a cool museum to go to. Good for pop music fans of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epicplatypus
10,"George Harrison exhibit was as positive as it got. Otherwise, NEVER AGAIN","I am not into music at all, which is part of the reason why I thought this museum was bad, but I think this is probably the worst museum I have ever been into. I was dragged into this museum even though I had not wanted to go in, because someone else wanted to do it.We headed up an elevator to the top floor which when you come out, there are a bunch of the trophies on display that had been grown bigger over the years, but they still seemed rather small. Beyond there is an open area with unfamiliar music playing throughout and some instruments on display. We were briefly disoriented on how to get down as we thought we had to use the elevator but there was no button for level 3. It was not until we came back out to find a door off to the right that brought us to the stairs you have to go down.On level 3, an interactive drum playing thing which would probably be interesting to those who like doing this. Nearby, another open room with some Michael Jackson stuff. Adjacent to that area: big white plastic model of the trophy placed in the middle of another open room that seemed a bit out of place as it seemed more like something that should have been put at the entrance of the museum or somewhere like that. Also a bunch of dud outfits as well. By far the worst part of the museum. It was far more interesting watching the traffic on Figueroa street through the big windows outside.On level 2, finally a positive exhibit on George Harrison with familiar music. There are some of his instruments as well as his handwritten lyrics of some of his songs.But this exhibit is only 10% of the entire museum which is 90% negative. Not one part even was updated to reflect the 2012 event which had happened more than a month ago. I was finally relieved to get out of the museum, but I would never go back. Also as a final note to this museum, YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR ""NO PHOTOGRAHY"" POLICY TO ""NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY""!!!!!!!!!!!! The Hollywood Museum has already learned it better this way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
40,Interesting,Enjoyed the displays of some of the great artists. particularly Michael Jackson,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyTraveler1959
40,Very Interactictve,"This is really worth the visit if you are a music buff. This museum has 3 levels which contain various exhibits. There is a theatre where you can view different moments from the Grammys. There are several sound booths and many other things such as guitars, drums and keyboards where you can ""play"" along with a track. There are various items of clothing which have been worn to the Grammy's by past attendees. There are also many old instruments belonging to famous musicians. You really could spend several hours here if you were to engage in the various things they have available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moby21
50,Music-fan Must,"If you are a music-lover, you have to go! Wonderful time spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoannaB618
50,Great Interactive Museum,"Spent the day at the Grammy Museum because it had so much to offer. Arrived at 11:30 a.m. opening on a Friday and left at 3:30 p.m.--eat before you go in because there is no place to purchase food. Video and audio displays were well done & informative. All genres of music are researchable or simply played for enjoyment. Costumes and video of past Grammy shows are on exhibit. In the Clive Davis theater (2nd floor), be sure to see the preparation and presentation of Tina Turner and Beyonce's rendition of Proud Mary. On the 2nd floor you can play a variety of instruments and listen to their playback. Soundproof rooms offer the opportunity to learn about and experience arranging a piece of music and many other skills as presented by well-known names in the music field. Be sure to use at least one of these soundproof rooms--takes about 10 minutes per room. Don't go to the Grammy Museum unless you have several hours--and be sure to take a jacket as the museum is kept quite cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII
40,Very interesting,Good place to spend some time and check some old pieces that they have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Rod
30,Good if you really like music,"It was VERY interactive. If you don't want to so a whole lot of interaction plan on about 1 1/2 hours. But if you want to listen to many recordings plan on it going up from there. They had some exhibits of grammy coustumes which were interesting, a nice Beattles exhibit too. My friend and I really liked the interactive piano/drums/guitars about 2/3 of the way through; I probably could have spent longer there, especially because I have some piano training. One thing we didn't love was that in order to listen to the many many recordings you had to use community headsets which didn't seem super sanitary. There was no option to use your own so if you are a germaphope it might not be for you. We parked in a lot across the street (off Figueroa) for $10/day. The entrance is off Figueroa in the LA Live complex. It's on the 2-4th floors, not super large. You take an elevator to the top and work your way down via stairs. The 15 min movie was interesting; we started mid way and wanted to stay to see the beginning but as the group before us warned us it has a glitch and starts, goes for maybe 2 mins than backtracks and starts all over. We mentioned this in the gift shop and they apparently know about the problem but said they ""can't"" fix it. I find it very hard to believe that Grammy sound engineers can't fix (splice) a movie. I thought it pointed to low quality. I would suggest calling ahead to see the hours, the day we went they were closing early for a special event. If you are done early you can check out one of teh restaurants at LA Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbles911
50,I could spend all day here,You need at least 4 hours get take all of this in. Being a member of the recording academy and a music produced I found it to be almost like going to school again. All of the interactive exhibits and displays are top notch and seeing George Harrison's Gretch guitar even better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeepForceOne
40,Good way to spend some time in Downtown LA,"Went to the Grammy museum in LA while attending a conference at the Westin a few blocks away. Its a ok walk from the downtown hotels to the museum and right in the middle of LA live with pleanty of resturants and things to do. The museum is reasonably priced I think 12.50 for adults to get in. We went on a Monday night and there was only a few others in the museum. It did have several great music history pieces and some interactive music that you could play with including drums and guitars. The sound rooms were good as they played videos explaining musical genere history. The George Harrison exhibit was interesting although I was not a big fan and didnt follow him, it was good stuff. It seems there was very little about rock and roll or alternative music, a lot of 60-70's and a lot of current Pop music was shown and displayed. All in All it was a great way to spend a couple of hours and see some interesting music memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cougar729
40,Small museum for music lovers,"I enjoyed my visit to the Grammy museum. The museum is small, so allow an hour or two to see everything. The George Harrison special exhibit was amazing. I also enjoyed seeing the actual handwritten lyrics by some famous, historic song writers (Woodie Guthrie, Bob Dylan). LA Live has parking ramps, but you can save money by parking in a surface lot across the street ($5 for the day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mingo05

50,Amazing exhibit - Well worth the drive!,"Not getting to LA often from my home in Orange County since it's an hour or more drive depending on the very unpredictable traffic, my friends talked me into taking them to the Grammy museum last weekend. I was reluctant since I thought it was just going to be stuffed with a pile of grammy statues and walls of pictures. Boy was I wrong! There are 4 levels and all of them are incredibly interactive. My favorite was a large touch sensitive screen that had relationships between all the different kinds of music and then as you touched one of the points everything moved around it and up pops up some representative musicians of that style plus played their music (there are headphones all over the place for most of the exhibits). There were special sections showing a bunch of James Brown's clothes, music, and even a handwritten set list on the back of a Holiday Inn envelope! Other featured musicians with clothes and instruments and other memorabilia were on hand for Michael Jackson, George Harrison, Elvis and many many more. One thing struck me was how small most of those guys were (from the size of their stage clothes and jackets). They all looked bigger than life on stage or TV! Anyway, plan on spending several hours there. The parking is easy underground and there a about 6 Great restaurants on the same block. Just don't go when there's a concert or game at Staples Center since it's right across the street and everything will be a mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3268GHmarkb

It helps you get to know the artist on a personal level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FayRayInlandEmpire
50,Great Memorabilia,The museum is a wonderful representation of the music business. I loved the videos at the beginning of the tour from the Grammy's.

40,Lots of Music History,"The Grammy Museum is a great place to visit to get a good in-depth history lesson of music and the musicians. They have several floors of exhibits, interactive exhibits and videos. For those who have a chance, go to one of the intimate concerts they have when they show case a musician. They talk with them about their history and then most of the time they play a couple of songs. The auditorium on site holds about 250 people so no seat is a bad seat. If you join the museum, you get first chance at those concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyOxnard
40,It's All About Music,A small but very interesting museum attached to the L.A. Live area of DTLA. There is the permanent exhibit and then usually a revolving exhibit. Parking can be a bit pricey as it's close to L.A. Live. If possible go mid day during the week when you can get a flat parking rate of $7-8,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
50,Very interesting for music lovers,"The exhibitions are very interactive so you can spend a lot a time trying everything. You can learn on the history of music, you can learn how is a music recording done and all sort of other things. Right now, they also have a temporary exhibit on Georges Harrison wich is a must for every Beatles fan. You can see film footage, interviews, his guitar collections (I'm still drooling), etc.I spent three hours at the Grammy Museum and I could have spend more time if I had the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinL698
30,Mediocre Muesum,"I was a bit disappointed with The Grammy Museum. The price was reasonable at $12.50 a person; however, the museum consisted of 4 floors of less than quality exhibits. Scattered around a few costumes of Michael Jackson and a few dance programs were a few hands-on exhibits without clear directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calitripgirl

50,Great Memorabilia and Some Fun Interactive Exhibits,"Wife and I stopped into the Grammy Museum on a lark, mainly because (a) she has one and (b) they had an exhibit on George Harrison. What a blast!You start on the fourth floor, which has historic exhibits and booths where you can trace the roots of various genres of music. Also some fun exhibits of artists' gear, as well as exhibits dedicated to individual artists -- currently James Brown and Andrea Bochelli.Go down to the third floor, and you have an interactive area where you can play around with a Stratocaster to see how various electronic effects (distortion, reverb, phaser, flanger) affect the sound. You also have booths where you can sample various parts of the recording and mixing process (and do your own mixing of a pre-recorded set of loops).Down on two you currently have the George Harrison exhibit, including some of his guitars, outfits, original lyrics. (I didn't know ""While my Guitar Gently Weeps"" started out with different lyrics.) There is also a gift shop there.If you buy anything, consider a membership. For $50 ($75/couple) you will get your ticket price refunded, a discount on merchandise, and discounts at most of the businesses in the LA Live complex. We got our $75 back just from that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2travl003

50,Worth Seeing on your trip to LA,The George Harrison display was a once in a life time experience. Seeing his guitars that he used during his life as a Beatle and solo career is something I will never forget. The price for admission was not expensive and there was no time limit on how long you could stay to enjoy the museum. The staff there were friendly and helpful if you had any questions about anything. I would go back to the museum again on my next trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nutmagnet101
50,A trip down memory lane,So very enjoyable to follow music over the years. Exhibits are very well done and lots of music to listen to.

We went on a recent Saturday afternoon, and found our way to the museum after parking nearby.Just about everything said on the other reviews is accurate, from the interactive displays to the fascinating memorabilia. I was very impressed with the George Harrison exhibit, as well as the short film about Tina Turner and Beyonce rehearsing for a recent show.In all, the Grammy Museum is well worth a visit, by out-of-towners and locals alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markholt

40,A Great Musical Museum Experience,"Enjoyed the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. Went for a specific exhibit (George Harrison), which was excellent. Stayed to enjoy the other video clips, photos, and exhibits, ranging from American Roots music, to contemp sounds (all kinds of music, although I was tempted to call it ""Rock Hall West"", after the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland!). Also have some interactive exhibits (songwriting & rock band). Easy parking across from the Staples Center. 3 great restaurants in the same block (can get a wristband to leave the Grammy Museum & return after lunch). Also don't miss the ice cream shop a few doors down. Tons of fun for a small price ($13 adult, but ask for AAA discount).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanaVentura

You could easily spend more time. The John Lennon display and the Michael Jackson display which I have seen in the past were wonderful. And I learned a lot.Next door is a deluxe bowling place where you can rent shoes, eat and bowl. Nice complex for other eating experiences right next to the convention center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birdieca
50,A Must See,I was taking my daughter to music school which made this a top attraction for us. I had never heard of it until I was searching tripadvisor for things to do in LA.

You won't be disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjd65
50,George Harrison Exhibit!,"I'm a big Beatles fan and the Harrison exhibit was amazing. The holy grails of guitar are there--his Gretsch and Rickenbacker from the Beatles days as well as his psychedelic Fender strat. If you are a guitar person, you will love this exhibit. The rest of the museum is worth a look too. Give yourself plenty of time as we did not allot enough and had to rush towards the end. This museum does not get a lot of publicity and is usually pretty quiet, so tell someone you know about it and spread the love.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TandemBikeRider

40,What a wonderful surprise!,"I had never been to the Grammy museum, but recently went specifically to see the special George Harrison exhibit. Thought I would be there for an hour, but ended up spending the entire afternoon. What a wonderful surprise! The museum has a fantastic range of memorabilia and interactive displays, covering a wide spectrum of music from classical to folk to Rock and Roll. The George Harrison exhibit did not disappoint, with an incredible collection of his guitars, costumes, and hand written lyrics, many of which have never been displayed before! But that proved to just be the tip of the iceberg - watching films, listening to music, playing with the interactive displays, I could easily have spent many more hours at the Grammy Museum and plan to go back soon. One tip for LA locals - if you are a KCRW subscriber, your membership card gets you a 20% discount on admission which was quite a savings for our party of 4.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoWheelExplorer
40,Check site for what's on view,"Enticed by Roy Orbison collection on view for short time; other rotating specials may be just as well done for your favorite artists. George Harrison was featured in a way never again likely to be found at the time. Otherwise somewhat technically like Museum of Making Music in Carlsbad CA combined with Grammy Award materials and history. Left-wing anti-Americanism may be off-putting (history of phonograph included their hero V. Lenin--not exactly a famous recording artist, Joe Hill and other early terrorist suicide bombers as ""freedom song writers, etc. Did you know country song ""Okie from Muskogee"" was a satirical parody of Middle America in their view?) )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smarteconomist

50,Enjoyed the Grammy Museum,"The Grammy Museum is tucked away in the LA Live entertainment complex, with the small entrance on Figueroa Avenue. While not a large museum, it is packed with many exhibits and interactive displays that give a history of the Grammy Awards. In a sense it is a mini Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but it also covers a wide variety of different types of music- classical, country, soul, world music, and jazz, just to name a few. When we visited there were major exhibits on Bob Marley, James Brown, and Roy Orbison. There was also a display on Michael Jackson, including many of his performing outfits. Because of touch screen technology and computers, the new generation of museums can display a wealth of information in smaller physical space. If you went through all of the interactive displays, you could spend quite a bit of time at the museum, It was fun to see excerpts from old grammy telecasts. Also of interest were some of the technical exhibits on sound recording. After all, the Grammys do honor achievements in recording. In all, it was a lot of fun, and a trip down memory lane. Definitely worth a few hours of your time .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IraP
50,Grammy Goes High Tech,This is a fantastic place for any type of music lover. They currently have a special exhibit of George Harrison's music and don't miss the Godfather of Soul - James Brown section.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanCarlosGuy
40,Wonderful little museum,"I never even knew the Grammy Museum existed until I read about a George Harrison exhibit that recently opened there. The area where the museum is located is near the Staples Center, a bustling area of hotels, restaurants and cafes and music venues. Parking on the street is possible but hard to find, but there were many parking lots in the area charging anywhere from $5 per hour to $5 per day.The Grammy Museum is a small museum with 4 floors and lots of memorabilia like clothing worn by musicians, musical instruments and Grammys. The James Brown exhibit was fairly extensive with a dance floor where you could learn to make the right dance moves. There were many interactive displays, from listening to every style of music possible to remixing and recording booths. There was music throughout the museum, from hard rock to Latin music and gospel.I was a little disappointed with the George Harrison exhibit, as I think they could have done a lot more interesting display rather than just photographs and a few artifacts.I would say that the museum had something for old and young, baby boomers and teens. A great find! I'll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElleLaJolla
50,Music Lover's Delight,"The Grammy Museum was fabulous. Very affordable. Lots of history about music and The Grammy Awards, incredible pictures and ""hands on"" experience. Make this a definite visit if you are a music lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapandus
40,Much Better Than I'd Expected,"Definitely worth the stop for any music lovers. Tons of neat historical music stuff from over the years and also a history behind the Grammy's, whether you watch them or not, the Museum is really neat for music lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tho0505
40,A dream was ruined,When much younger I wanted to be John Bonham but without so much beer (for younger readers you may have to google this reference) but never achieved that objective. Then I visited this very interactive museum and learnt I couldn't drum to save my life. My wife was right I have no sense of rythym.This is quite an interactive museum and could have easily spent more time there. Yes it is only over 4 floors and is not the largest museum but we enjoyed and it wasn't expensive - hence the rating.Bearing in mind this is America the shop was quite limited in stock but I found the obligatory T shirt.One bad point parking is not cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JibbaSouthampton
40,"MUST SEE for music lovers! very interactive, no photos inside though :(","when we visited the grammy museum at L.A live we were just in time for a john lennon and bob marley exhibit! so right on!very interactive, great for any music lover!1 & ONLY DOWNSIDE: no photography was allowed except for in the main lobby near the front entrance... :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriachristinaxo
50,So much fun,This museum was the place my boyfriend and I had the most fun. Not sure if it's always like this but there weren't many people when we visited so we were able to enjoy almost every interactive stations. All the interactive stations were working (not broken) and informative.I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimjin14
40,A hidden gem!,"The grammy museum reminded us a lot of the rock and roll hall of fame in cleveland. We enjoyed our visit and loved all the outfits, both from the past and present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jannrasp
50,"Great attraction, a gem of a find at LA Live!","I didn't even know this place was here...we arrived at LA Live early for a show at Staples Center and decided to check out the Grammy Museum. What a pleasant surprise! For only $12 regular adult admission!3 floors - spent most of our time on the top floor (where you begin). A decent variety of memorabillia, really enjoyed the interactive displays. I could spend hours there!The other floors are smaller, a changing feature, this week it was Bob Marley. Also a small theater, looks to have good acts and probably a great place to see a show in a small venue.Definitely worth the time and admission...I'll visit again when in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferRose8
40,Interesting - glad we went,It is a smaller museum - but had several interesting and interactive exhibits. I recommend it for most people (adults) interested in music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/signinsareapain
50,Hard to get the Teen out the door.,Went for our music loving teen but the whole family loved it. Had a special exhibit on hip hop and we stayed for hours. Great interactive exhibits. Park in lots across the street to save some cash. Good food choices nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chitownbigcityfan
40,Better than expected -- fun as well as informative,"We went because we were looking for things that might appeal to both adults and teens, and this hit the spot. We were there 3 1/2 hours and were very happy. The museum covers pop music, with an emphasis on Grammy-related performances. But it does a lot more than that. It has excellent historical material about how one type of music influenced another; I learned a lot, as well enjoyed hearing great recordings of favorite songs and some unfamiliar stuff. The museum is very interactive, whether by letting you select songs or by giving you the chance to ""mix"" songs or ""sample"" beats like a hip-hop artist. Actually, the hip-hop stuff is probably the strongest part of the museum (if it's all permanent exhibit stuff).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allen1000
40,This is a very interesting place - better than I had expected,"My son and I were attending an afternoon sporting event at Staples Center in Los Angeles. We decided to go to the Grammy Museum before the game and allowed ourselves an hour to go through. Well, we completely underestimated the time required as we found ourselves hurrying more than we wanted to just so that we could get to the on time. However, the volunteer at the door fitted us with return-entry bracelets so that we could return when the game ended. We spent another 1 1/2 hours in there afterward and found the museum fascinating. The exhibits and artifacts spanned decades of musical history, with hand written lyrics, musical instruments, movies, original costumes and outfits worn by musicians, and of coarse music.I was surprised at how interesting this place was and would recommend it to anyone visiting downtown LA, especially if you are a person who watches the Emmy Awards. It's sure to be an enjoyable visit and evoke musical memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moldey
50,"If you like music, you'll love this","Anyone with even a moderate interest in music of any style will find something to love here. An entire floor is devoted to the history of American music, with some of the coolest interactive displays ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkWing
40,Entertaining!,"Visited the Grammy Museum to keep busy on a rainy day in LA but throughly enjoyed our visit. Spent over 2 hours and the time speed by. Great variety of artist. John Lennon, Janis Joplin, Jimmi Hendrick. Having been tgo Woodstock it was a nice blast from the past. All types of music are represented so anyone will enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annedr
50,Unbelievable!,The review above is ridiculous or by someone who is not a music person. Cause thisMuseum is terrific! It's more than a Grammy Museum...it is a music museum. It is very interactive and caters to all ages. I live in Los Angeles and have been 4 times in the past 6 months. Each time I go it gets better and better. I even became a member!DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cannoli_10
30,Just OK,"I thought this would be so much better, but it's very average. Very geared to middle-of-the-road tastes, as the Grammys generally are. When we visited there was a special area honoring Michael Jackson and Neil Diamond. There was a really cool interactive touch screen where you could touch any musical genre word and it launches into a history (very detailed) and images and sounds depicting that genre and how it relates to other genres. There are also about 9 soundbooths walking a visitor through the whole recording process (tracking, mixing, etc.) but each booth takes almost 10 min a piece and we found it tiresome after awhile. Young kids might like the interactive screens, but will be bored with all the clothing and info displays. We've gone this one time; would never go back unless they had a very special exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DollyWong
