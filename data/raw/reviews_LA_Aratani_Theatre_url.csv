40,Mid size gem of a theater,This intimate venue is a gem located in the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center. Seats are clean and comfortable. Parking available in adjacent parking structure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanettey2018
50,"""An Presentation By Doris Kearns Goodwin!""","Had the chance, last night, to hear Doris Goodwin (Presidential Historian) explain her latest literary work, Leadership. She gave an exhilarating, 45 minute interview to a very captive audience. Immediately afterwards, she was gracious enough to engage in a Q & A session with the audience. This was my first time inside the Aratani and I look forward to going back there soon. The venue is both small enough and large enough for this type of event. Every seat was positioned so that they had a clear vantage point of the stage and everyone could hear clearly. If you get there early enough, you are just south of all of the great Japanese restaurants, in Little Tokyo, that you could grab a bite to eat. I sat in the last back row, in the balcony, and I felt as though I had the best seat in the house because of the great view I had. Hope this helps. See you there. Thanks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2MARY9
50,"Aratani Theatre Has Great Acoustics, Comfortable and Good Seating Layout","We were able to see ""Allegiance"" with George Takei in this beautiful theatre which was also celebrating its 35th Anniversary as the largest Asian Pacific American performing arts venue. Our seats were in the mezzanine area so it was great to see the emotion clearly on the actor's faces. Seats were comfortable, spacing to cross over seated guests, bathrooms and drinks available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flsouri
40,Mid size theater,"The Theater: Mid-size theater. I was sitting on the mezzanine, still good view. They do sell drinks (including alcohol but can't bring into the theater)The Show: ""Allegiance"" is AWESOME!! George Takei is fantastic. He is really in the show from the beginning to the end. The story is amazing... I got really emotional at the last scene. Highly recommended!!!The Parking: Parking structure with theater validation pre-paid $9. Street metered parking (some side streets, free after 6pm)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Beautiful Theatre and staff!,"The orchestra and stage sets were so artistic and beautiful for George Takei's show Allegiance. The Director gave a perfect intro for such a moving story of our Japanese American's incarceration during WWII. I was able to see the musical on Broadway but this was still great, especially the sounds of the wonderful actors and actresses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tustintripper
40,"Excellent, Modern Venue - Be Careful Parking!","We attended to see Tim Ferris interview Terry Crews. The theater is very clean and new with modern restroom facilities. The lower level seats are appropriately sloped and angled toward the stage such that visibility is very good. We didn't sit in the upper level, but it appeared to be equally well designed. One word of caution, if at all possible, do not park in either of the two parking structures located adjacent to the theater. When the showed ended, many cars attempted to executed at the same time and we will in the parking lot for 75 minutes. Good theater, maddening parking situation. Next time, we will park a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricG141
40,Perfect Place for Film Festival,"We went to see the documentary ""Tyrus"" at the Aratani Theatre. It has over 800 seats and I think all were filled. We were happy with everything, but the air conditioning--it got very warm in there. This is a great place to hold a film festival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dyanne2014
50,Intimate venue,This was the perfect venue to see Keiko Matsui perform acoustically. Would attend again to see any performer that I desire to see in a more intimate and up close setting. Also found good eats right across the street in the plaza before the show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsWise1
40,Hidden gem,"If you want to immerse yourself in the Japanese culture, the events, plays and films shown at the Aratani Theatre in LA's Little Tokyo center is the place to do it. Off a small interior plaza, next to many shops and small restaurants, is this expansive theatre where every seat is a good one ( these are kind of narrow seats, and your arm rests seem closer in than usual...sit up straight!) Everything from films about the roles of japanese American soldiers in WW II to original Samurai plays ( in English), the offerings are ever changing and diverse. The central courtyard offers food truck(s) and small tables and a boulders and brick climb-on platform, and the second floor balcony on the theatre affords view of the courtyard and lights of the city skyline in the background. There is a parking structure adjacent, as well as metered street parking, and the Metro is a few blocks away. Plenty of places to eat and get dessert afterwards ( Pinkberry! Green tea frozen yogurt is a must try)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
