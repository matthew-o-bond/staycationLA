50,Bad Boys 3,Great theater. I take my grandkids here to movies 2xs month for family outings. We ride Lyft and itâ€™s easy pick up and access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelva5777
40,STILL GOOD!,"Went to see the new Avengers movie and even though it was a last minute decision, we managed to get good seats. Nice and comfortable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3678JOHN
40,that is not correct,There is no parking fee and if you were charged then it is a mistake on your side. I have been going to AMC Norwalk for years and I also know several other people who have gone there. Why is it that no one has ever been charged till you?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801keni
40,Snowman,The theater is great. Nice big recliner seats. The movie not so great. They even bring food to your seat. Order ahead,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373alicias
10,PARKING FEE!! BEWARE!!!,"We saw a movie Foreigner today, bought the ticket and the employee didn't remind us about the parking fee. Spent 3.5 hrs. and I thought less than 4 hrs is free. We were charged $16.00 I called AMC and manager Miguel told me its not their responsibility to remind their guest about the parking validation.This is not a place to have a good time with your family!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115nemp
40,Our Go To Movie Theater,"AMC has recently (2016/2017) updated this theater. It now has recliner seats, IMAX, a bar and more. It is kept up nicely and it is clean. The one downside is that in switching to recliner seats they decreased the theater capacities. I recommend buying tickets in advance either on AMC's site or through Fandango because the smaller theaters fill up and if you show up at the box office, you might not get a seat. You reserve seats in advance when you buy your ticket. Fandango will link your STUBS reward card and waive the service fee. The STUBS rewards program is very generous if you are a frequent movie goer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimoClark
50,Loved it,Love this movie theatre I always go here with my husband and my kids. It is very comfortable the seats recline and that makes the experience so much greater. There food and drinks are always good and the service is always fast. I always recommend this theatre to my family and friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reisha2cute
40,A Very Nice Theater,I don't live very far from this AMC theater. They have reclining seats to sit in. This is the nicest theater that I have ever been in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78DONNAP78
50,Upscale theater with all the trimmings,"We stayed at the DoubleTree hotel across the street so this was a convenient place to catch a show and we were very surprised at the excellence from the food/bar to the reclining seats. Very high end. If you are coming from afar, there is a parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
30,Beat the Heat!,"AMC Norwalk has more to offer than a movie (We just saw Jason Bourne) . A full bar, repeat, a full bar. Comfortable recliner seats. A snack bar that caters to your sweet tooth, serve yourself sodas & Icees. Convenient kiosks for quick tickets. Two draw backs - one was the line to buy tickets was confusing- two lines- one for AMC card holders & one for non members. And second - I could've used a sweater- the AC was cranked up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naninofro
50,awesome,good service here at AMC 20 in Norwalk and have great workers and clean theatre and most of all good movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniesscortez
50,So comfortable and spacious,"They recently renovated the place back in December 2016, now the seats are reserved and all reclinable, love that there is a wall behind every seat to separate the rows makes the place feel safer. One of the things i love about this AMC is that the first row of seats is still a decent distance from the screen not super close like other theaters. Having the AMC rewards card is worth it, I rack up the points and use it for just about everything from movie tickets to food oh and it automatically waves the 1.5 fee for onli9ne purchases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vulcanlore
