40,TRAINS,"The trains are amazing , you are able to climb on them touch them and enjoy all the trains. a little hard to find but well worth the trip.you can even visit when th LA fair is going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wpf736
50,Terrific Family Outting,"My son, 16 yo, is a rail enthusiast. We try to find rail museums to explore whenever we take a family trip. This time, we chose Rail Giants. We are from the west coast, but now live on the east coast and this is something my son has been wanting to see for years now. We finally made it to Rail Giants and he had a wonderful time exploring the cabs of the diesel and steam engines there. I won't go deep into lingo because I'm sure I'd mess some terms up! But, my son knows so much about these retired steam engines and really enjoy exchanging information with people who know what they are talking about. We were disappointed that Big Boy 4014 was not there, but how awesome that it's been restored and is chugging away in Cheyenne, WY with an expected return visit in October. We had fun signaling with the train whistle and ringing the bells. We had a great time learning about the history of each engine and it really was a highlight of our trip. We also met many other train enthusiasts there who were just as tickled as we were to be there. Even though Pomona is a little off the beaten path if you are in the San Diego, Carlsbad, or LA areas, it was worth the drive! It's not the largest museum, but the volunteers there are knowledgeable and kind. You can easily spend a couple of hours there if you want to learn about each engine's history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAPermanentVacation

50,LA County Fair 8-3-2018,Got an opportunity to see the trains and the Train Museum for the very first time. Neverseen the trains until my friend Karen and her mom took me to the fair. Definitely want to go back and spend some more time checking out the trains . The railroad museum is great also. Take the whole family out to see the old trains and read the history on each engine. Have fun!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119yvonnej
50,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE !,"Situated in the edge of the huge parking area, you too can relive, for a short while , the days gone !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1404VYstevenr
40,A great collection of trains,Rail Giants is in the middle of the Fairplex complex. It is free to visit (although on the day I visited I was charged $10 to park as it wasn't a normal opening day. You enter through the main gate 17 and drive down to where the trains are. The locomotives are basically in two lines. They have a wonderful collection and you can get up and see the cabs of several of them. A caboose was also open for display. It really is a good collection from early steam to a couple of more modern diesels. There is also a shop selling souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
50,Big Trains,"This is an incredible walk from the rides at Fairplex, but well worth the visit. Next to the Sacramento train museum you won't see another exhibit Like this of rail stock anywhere in California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csimmamps
50,A great train museum for ALL ages,"We visit this museum every year while attending the L.A. County Fair. The museum is also open when the fair is not running. It has been here for decades and is always fun to see again and again. One of their main attractions, the ""Big Boy"" locomotive is leaving this year for good. It is being moved out of the Pomona Fairgrounds and taken by rail to Cheyenne, Wyoming to be completely restored. It will take 5 years and when completed, it will return to the Pomona Fairgrounds as part of a national tour in which people will have an opportunity to ride it! The crews are readying it for transport and it has drawn a lot of crowds. The other trains in the museum are just as impressive and interesting. Kids and adults can climb stairs in order to walk through the various locomotives and passenger cars. Many of the cabs are accessible in which the loud steam whistles and horns can be pulled. Kids love that! At the entrance, there is a train depot building that serves as a small artifacts museum and gift shop. Many great shirts and souvenirs can be bought for reasonable prices. If you go, don't forget to sign the visitors book. They have even installed some new lights for a cool visual effect on the trains at night. All in all, it is a fun and educational time for both train enthusiasts and casual observers as well as young and old. So, bring the family and see railroad giants from the past and present. Check it out. You'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelrH6268OA
50,Perfect little train museum at the Fairplex.,"I am so glad we finally got a chance to visit this museum. My son is like every 3 year old and into trains. We were lucky to get with a tour group and go inside some of the trains, cars, and pull the whistles and ring the bells. My son had a blast and the staff there I am sure they are all volunteers, they are so kind and friendly. Maybe when my son is a bit older we can volunteer together. I recommend checking the website prior to visiting as we found out the hard way a week prior that they are not always open. Make sure to bring some change for the donation cups through out the park, I told my son next time we will bring one of his piggy banks so we can give money to the trains so that they will always be there for him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
