40,One of our must stops while in CA,"Every time we visit CA, this is one of our must stops. It is a nice little farmers market with a good variety. We usually go on Tuesdays when it is not as busy as the weekend. The variety is always changing. This time we bought dates and glutenfree bakery items.
