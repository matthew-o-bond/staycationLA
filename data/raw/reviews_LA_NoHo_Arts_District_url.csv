10,"NoHo Arts District is a NO NO, Non-existent","On a recent trip to the LA area, we set aside a day to go gallery hopping in No Ho. After looking it up on the internet, we identified a number of galleries, mapped them out, and set out. Of the 5 or 6 we tried to visit, none of the stops could be considered a success. One ""gallery"" was a small gift shop with a few pieces of art. One ""gallery"" was a warehouse for working artists. Upon entry, the front gallery was dimly lit and no-one was there. It appeared that an artist may have been working in a back room, but I felt like an intruder, rather than a customer, so after several minutes I left. The remainder of the addresses were private homes with no-one there. What a waste of time! (It was kind of like going to the Mall in Washington D.C. to go shopping, only to find that there are no stores! LOL)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzysez
50,Need to see!,"NOHO is the neighborhood of young people who are mostly actors, actresses, dancers and musicians. Television Academy, many studios, art schools, and many other art related organizations are here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773isk
50,NOHO LA's Hidden GEM to visit and play in.,"Just 4 miles from west LA, or down town LA, NOHO is a redeveloped, striking area with art, food, and many great stores and things to experience. Add it to your list of places to see while in LA. its also close to Universal City and easy to access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,"Lots of places, little parking","Went to 2 places there, the Federal Bar (great food, poor service) for a pre-show snack and brewski, then to the El Portal Theatre across the side street for a music act (Orchestre Surreal -- look them up!). Closest parking I could find was a 5-minute walk. And I walk fast. And that was on a Thursday evening. Lyft/Uber probably a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5ft17
50,Very nice,"A really nice, quiet area in north hollywood, with dance studios, restaurants, bars, galleries.. if you are into arts and stuff, you have to visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paschaliusz
40,Interesting for the art and galleries,"Didn't come here for the food, enough restaurants anywhere but found the idea of an arts area interesting - lots of galleries and probably more appealing than wandering through the normal tourist traps of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
50,In love with the Noho Arts District,So many good restaurants and perfect for the whole family to visit. This is not really a tourist area but dancers from all over the world do visit the famous dance studios. On Lankershim the streets are rich with historical facts on the light polls so makes walks very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159SelenaP
50,Trendy and Great,"The food and the vibe in the NoHo district are both awesome. We had dinner at a restaurant that I unforgivably cannot find the name of, but from what I've heard, any restaurant would be great. We also strolled around during the day (my granddaughter and I) and felt safe. We were often greeted by people and there are many shops and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinea567
40,The Art District is changing the vibe of downtown,"Even though this is a small area, the place is going through a major renovation with new galleries and restaurants opening all the time. The art scene here is getting a lot of attention and outdoor work when you drive through is very interesting. Take a drive through the neighborhood when you are visiting the city and take time to walk through the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
40,Living in NoHo,"The NoHo Art District is a very trendy town just north of Hollywood. This town has art galleries and great little places to eat. It's also close to the red line metro station that can take you to Universal Studios, Hollywood and the Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634kristinee
50,NY vibe in LA!,"Just when you think LA is too sterile and doesn't have any cool neighborhoods, go to the Arts District. The impressiveness is in the graffiti which is carefully displayed through out the region. This combined with new chef restaurants and trendy local shops makes it a checklist item like Venice or Melrose; with a nice twist of grit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondraw221
50,Street strolling,"While trying to waste some time waiting for my next meeting, I took a stroll down Magnolia and Lankershiem. Everything is really cool and eccentric and I loved it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staceytoy
40,Cool Transformation,This section of North Hollywood had little appeal back in the 90s when I owned an apartment building in what has become NoHo. Not sure if it was the television academy or the metro rail station lured new business. But the proliferation of restaurants and coffee houses has definitely energized the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodhoundBurbank_Ca
50,Love It!,"I'm not a complete stranger to the Noho Arts District. In 1998 I owned a little business there. I've been away for about 15 years. Upon my return and rediscovery, really, I discovered so much more. There are more restaurants, coffee houses ( Bob's Coffee House was really cool with live open Mike poetry and music on Wednesday) it's like it is so much more sophisticated. I went sort of low brow and relaxed and had a cool funky time. So many artists, musicians, actors, and want to bes'. My visit was fun and cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vavoomddd
50,chew on this,"This was a great play/musical. I don't normally go to plays, but this one had me in tears laughing. it's a short run, so if you're there before it's end, you should go see it.... One last little detail, this is my first trip advisor thing, so if it doesn't belong here, I do apologize. One more last thing. The play is about people that love bubble gum music but were shamed for liking it, so they have created a bubble gum anonymous group to help those in need... yes, very funny....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaggerBud
50,History of Martial Arts Musuem,"Located in Burbank. This is the only History of Martial Arts museum in the World. Definitely worth the trip to see it. We went to a screening of James Lew's ""18 Fingers of Death"". Will be back for the Martial Arts museum ceremony and ribbon cutting in August. Check this place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbrgdmn
