40,"A hidden place, waiting to be discovered in your own backyard!","We recently became members at the Leonis Adobe, and as part of your membership, you get a ""Passport 2 History"", which is a listing of over 80 different historical sites and places to visit! I'm always looking for things to do to get my 3 year old out of the house, so we started with the nearby, Andrew Pico Adobe!It is like a small museum with tons of facts and artifacts about the valley. the gentleman (Jerry if I recall correctly) was very nice and gave us a tour. One of the highlights (especially to a toddler... and his Dad...) was the working player piano! I want to go back just to hear more of that!As someone who enjoys antiques, they had quite a lot of interesting things to look at. I particularly enjoyed the toaster (ask to see it as you won't know it's a toaster), the stove demo set, a trunk owned by Tiburcio Vasquez, and the various kitchen items. The ""baby's room"" upstairs is very cool too. If you enjoy vintage women's clothing... they have a whole room FILLED with all kinds of vintage clothing. Even flapper hats from the 20s!There is a Native American room outside with various art and artifacts including an impressive warhead collection. Even the grounds have some interesting things like a train watchman's room. This is a great place to take your toddler on a picnic outside and then explore inside. It is absolutely free!!! Even the tour is free! I don't think you have to do the tour if you don't have time or your toddler won't let you, but Jerry was pretty good at tailoring it towards my toddler's attention span.If nothing else, visit this place because you would NEVER know it existed otherwise! Chances are you've driven by it countless times!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,A Treasure of San Fernando Valley History,"When there is so little known about the history of the San Fernando valley, and when there are so few places where you can find the physical remnants of this history, the Andres Pico Adobe becomes a priceless treasure of a place. When you get to touch walls that have been there since the 1830's and when you see the tools and everyday items that the people who lived here used over a century ago, you can't not appreciate the work of the people who have helped to repair and maintain this place.If you have an interest in history, come here. If you live in the San Fernando valley and wonder what was here before it became a giant suburb, come here. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophera759
40,Adobe near the SF Mission ...,We were told about the Pico Adobe when we visited the Mission San Fernando and made a visit. The Adobe is nicely restored and the folks give an informative tour of the area and its attractions. We liked the Railroad ephemera outside. Lots of neat early LA area history here. Enjoy. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,A Lot of History in a Little House,"The adobe was built about 1834 as a utility building to Mission San Fernando, a short walk away. Andres Pico, an important general in the Mexican-American war and brother to Pio Pico, the last Mexican Governor of California and builder of the Pico House near Olvera Street, improved the building as a home for his son, Romulo and Romulo's wife, Catarina in 1874. Dr. Mark Harrington, curator of the Southwest Museum, bought the house and restored and enlarged it in 1930. Today, the house is the home to the San Fernando Valley Historical Society.There are three main spaces to the house, all filled with historic photographs and artifacts. Outside is the recently restored Lankershim Reading Room, originally from the Lankershim Ranch - Lankershin and Van Nuys once owned the southern half of the San Fernando Valley. Also added this year is a railroad shanty, a tribute to the railroad entering the Valley and connecting Los Angeles to the rest of the state.The entire complex is not large, but a docent tour can take an hour or more. If you are interested in the history of the San Fernando Valley, this is a great place to start.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
