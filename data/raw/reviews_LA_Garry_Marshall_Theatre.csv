50,Wonderful Theater with Parking.,"Just saw Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill. It is a peek into Billie Holiday’s final club performance. This astonishing performance spurred me to comment on the theater itself. It is such a gift to the community. I have attended many fine performances here and even though I now live in La Verne, I will continue.",Judy K
50,I really enjoy the experience of the GMT...,"Wow…seeing Valentine’s Day at GMT during the film series really was what this trip was all about. I never saw it on the big screen, so this was close enough. Sadly, not many people showed up from the production, but I learned things I did not know—like it took nine years to get a green light and the movie made. The theatre is a treasure…I believe there is 130 seats, which makes it a wonderful venue to feel like you are part of what is going on. It really is a gift to a community to have theatre of this caliber and this one is a gem. I hope to visit again in the future.",Sabrina N
50,Small but Mighty,"If you enjoy great and intimate theater, check out the Garry Marshall Theatre, 4252 W Riverside Drive,Burbank.Their first production this fall is Real Women Have Curves about a group of women who work together sewing dresses.They do an exceptional job in their small space. You will be enthralled.",SCSZ41
40,On going Patron since the first season,We have enjoyed this theater since 1999 or 2000 and have enjoyed more than I could count plays of quality. Mr Marshall was very nice and a real people person. He attended many of the plays we attended and had open talk night after the play.The new staff seems nice and friendly but it lacks the personal touch but this was their first season so just feeling their way. The performances were good but only 4 plays per season .,Linda S
50,Have seen four productions -all very entertaining,This theatre holds around 130 so it is small but mighty in talent. A friend of mine travels from Maryland each year with this theatre as her first priority. The box office staff extremely friendly and helpful. Volunteers are your ushers. Adds to the charm. This is where the “locals” go.,NomadiaV
50,"Formerly The Falcon Theatre, now Garry Marshall Theatre","First off, I am a big fan of Garry Marshall, may he rest in peace. I particularly like that he was first and foremost a family man, a hard-working entertainment industry professional, and a nice man. Though my family went to see a Happy Days cast and crew Sunday afternoon softball game back in the 70s, I met Garry once, in 2012. He had the Falcon Theatre enterprise operating for a long time, but even now as the name has changed in the wake of his passing, I had not ever gone to a production or event there. Since I was in Los Angeles on that Monday night October 2018, I choose to go for the first screening of the movie series showing films Mr. Marshall was involved with. I took public transportation from DTLA, so I was a little late in spite of the fact the bus dropped me off basically right in front of the theater. I gave a donation to the workers in the brightly lit lobby (with memorabilia of his days in Hollywood) and found my way in the dark to an empty seat, with the movie already in progress. When the lights came up, I was in awe. The stage is beautiful…I don’t know what kind of wood was used, but it was a stunning backdrop. The audience seating was comfortable and not at all prohibitive with good visuals from every seat. The sound was impeccable. It is predominantly a small, community theatre but because Mr. Marshall was who he was, I imagine there are a lot of industry people that “show up” to the productions to enjoy them, just as I did. The area it’s in is unique, too, as it is near movie and television studios but mostly because it is across the street from one of the last remaining Bob’s Big Boy restaurants. Would I go again? I’m already planning that visit!",Sabrina N
40,Great show!,"The theatre is a nice small venue with easy access off freeway. Lobby is small and has water/sodas and candy for sale. Nice place, will go again.",rshu4you
30,Not That Good,"I’ve been a Falcon Theater season ticket holder for many years and for the first time, I have to say that last night’s performance at was not to my liking. The actresses did a decent job, although I could have done without the excessive vulgarity. The whole thing was very disjointed and the overall script was just plain weird. Oh well, you win some and you lose some. The next four performances should be better.",Robert L
50,Of Course It's Great,"All you have yo know is that this is Gary Marshal's playhouse. Like most things Gary does it's homey, comfortable, and good. The productions are well staged and acted. The house it's self is small but not so little you feel cramped or on top of the stage. It's the perfect place to see good acting, in new and exciting plays, and one person shows.",Michael M
50,This is the best theater experience ever!,"The shows offer a great variety; serious, comedy, one person, modern, historical. The troubies productions which are once or twice a year are not to be missed.You will laugh till you cry . I have been a season subscriber for almost 10 years and I am never disappointed. The theater is small so there are no ""bad "" seats. The staff is so friendly , Gary Marshall is often there to greet guests.The Falcon has a very family , small town feel. Love it !!!",Kathy W
40,A great place to see a play,"This is a wonderful little theatre owned by Gary Marshal. The plays are always fun and it's a pleasure to go there. The theatre is always clean, and the staff are very nice.",happytravels202
50,The Trouble We Come From,"What took us so long to find this great theater!!! Performing Arts enthusiasts would love this small theater with an exceptionally large stage. Parking is easy. We chose to see Scott Caan's new play. Mr. Caan is a talented actor and impressive playwright. It was funny at times, kept our interest, and a relatable topic for many. Kudo's Scott!",whocareswhoiam
50,Scott Caan writes!,"Actor Scott Caan is turning into quite a playwright. This is the second play we've seen of his and we're impressed. ""The Trouble We Come From"" is very insightful, funny, and entertaining. The Falcon is a little gem of a theater without a bad seat in the house. Parking is easy and free, plus there are restaurants within walking distance. Over the years we've attended several plays at the Falcon and enjoyed all of them. (Don't miss the fortune teller from the film ""Big"" in the lobby.)",Linda C
40,"THE FALCON IS INCONSISTENT, BUT USUALLY WORTHWHILE","I've attended several mediocre-at-best shows there, which seems strange considering the theater's pedigree. I've also seen one or two excellent productions over the years. My suggestion: Try to read a reliable review before purchasing tickets.",Kris W
50,Great little theater,We are season subscribers. They do a great job in choosing plays that will entertain and work well in small venues. The theater is small but comfortable with parking available in the rear.,golfandbeach
50,great venue!,"Lovely, cozy theatre space. Very intimate seating, shows are of high quality with beautiful & interesting set design and great actors. Conveniently close to many fine restaurants & coffee shops for a snack before or after a performance. A gem of a space!!",cecyrh
50,Intimate live theater,"We live almost 2 hours away from the LA area, but we make the trip 5 times a year for our season tickets to the Falcon. There are only 7 or 8 rows of seats, about 140 people, so the experience is very intimate. We have seen some amazing works and some less so, but that's part of the excitement of live theater! It's owned by Garry Marshall and we have run into him there several times, and the plays (and audience!) sometimes feature well known actors.The price can't be beat, and the season ticket packages include several perks. They also have a resident comedy/slapstick/musical ensemble called The Troubadors, a multi-Ovation award winning tribe of actors led by genius Matt Walker. Check out www.troubie.com.",Kathie M
