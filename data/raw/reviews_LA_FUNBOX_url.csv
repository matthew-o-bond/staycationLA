20,Not worth it,"We paid about $80 for four of us (2 kids and 2 adults) and the whole experience was done in about 30 minutes or less. My kids were not impressed, and neither were we (the parents). They had good photo opportunities but nothing that special. I think the price should be listed as half then what they charge. And you cannot go back to previous sections visited, you can only move forward. Not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grayc_08
20,Not worth it...,I found that the experience was overpriced & underwhelming for the amount of time you are given to enjoy each room. It felt rushed... not something I would do again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveD2588
40,SUPER GREAT FUN but horrible customer service!!!,"I took my grown kids and we had a REALLY GREAT time minus our first contact with 2 employees at the front door who couldn't even manage to acknowledge our presence right in front of them. This is a patrons first impression of a business, and honestly had the exhibit itself not been as good as it was, my first impression with the 2 staff members would have consumed my feedback and review! Let me tell you it would not have been good!!!!!! I am an elite Yelper so I take reviews and feedback very seriously! It is always in the best interest of a business to teach their employees ""courtesy"" and customer service. This means that you make sure that your customers feel that their needs are met and are happy. More often than not a customer just wants to be heard. Even if a staff member is busy, they should at the very least ACKNOWLEDGE a person standing in front of them with a response of "" I will be with you in a few minutes"" or ""do you mind waiting a few minutes while I finish taking care of ..."". To straight up ignore a customer who is clearly standing right in front of you can ruin a business in the long run.There is nothing more important than your customer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/INTOTRAUMA

50,Funbox Fun,"We loved it. I took my kids and all 3 had fun. Our favorites were the room with all the balloons, the infinity room, and cereal bowl. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. Whether it's a cute date or a family adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriee97
