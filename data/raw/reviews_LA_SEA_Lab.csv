10,SEA Lab Now Closed,"According to their website, their last day of operations was June 22,2019. We will be in Redondo Beach this weekend and were researching things to do. This looked intriguing and when I went to their website, I saw the news and wanted to share it.",Odyssey781646
50,FUN time for adults and the kids!,Redondo's secret! A fun educational day that does cost an arm and a leg! The kids are free to explore and the education is terrific.,Mike C
50,Absolutely worth for this experience,A great educational visit about the local sea animals you can actually see and touch. Great with kids and grownups can learn as well a lot.,gjanzso
30,Interesting spot for kids,"After a full two days of The Aquarium of The Pacific and Universal Studios...I was looking to do something more low key with my 8 year old son. We rented a tandem bike and made a pit stop here to check it out. If you don’t want to listen to whining or questions “when will tour start” call and ask them when their next one is ;)The touch tanks can only be seen/accessed with volunteer guide. Quick, little & educational excursion that was interesting. Interior - there’s not much and facility is a bit dated. Staff were friendly but not that organised. We were waiting for 1pm tour to start...I had to ask one of them at 1:10...if it was still going to happen. Younger kids, I’d say under 10 would enjoy Sea Lab.",Heidi3073
30,the key here is the Tour!,"Others have raved about the Sea Lab and I took my family several times--and I just didnt get it. Its a bit run down and very very tiny. And THEN we took the tour. Pet sharks, anemones, see GIANT sea bass. Its great.",oohlaalaa
40,Be sure to take the tour!,"This is a small aquarium, perfect for youngsters. Touch tank tours only take place AT the hour, so be sure to take the tour.",Lena K
50,Fun and informative hour or two,"We took our two year old grandson and we all enjoyed it. There are displays and some tanks inside and several outside. Be sure to take the tour, we learned a lot about local sea life and we are locals. There are several touch tanks that are fun for everyone.",barbielab
50,Quick and educational,"This is a nice, informative, small educational experience of local marine life. Don’t hedge on the donation. It is an accessible opportunity to see interesting sea creatures. I like visiting the aquarium pools in the back courtyard.",Lisa H
50,The SEA Lab is great!,"Nice place to go to see fish and invertebrates without 5 inches of glass between you and the water! The staff is well trained, so go on a free tour.",Richard K
40,Cool place,Kids loved it! Parking is nice and its small so you are in and out fairly quickly. Right next to the beach!,redondoclark
50,A great experience!,"I will definitely be back with my family! Feed the fish and take the touch tank tour, you won’t be disappointed!",Psi4power
10,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE,"After visiting the aquarium at Camilo Beach, we were excited to check out Sea Lab, another non-profit aquarium dependent on donations to stay open.Alas, there is nothing to see here and if you are not here during the tour times, you are 100% out of luck to check out the touch tanks. If you must visit, check out tour times first.",Larry G
50,Great place for little ones,Our 2 year old granddaughter loves Finding Nemo and was mesmerized by the lab. Great interactive staff that made this very enjoyable for our little one.,Steve M
20,Not much to see.,"We went with our granddaughter to this attraction and were pretty disappointed. It looked dirty, there wasn't much inside to see and the exhibits weren't really up to much. We waited for the tour of the tanks which was much better than everything we saw inside but this feels like a really out of date, underfunded attraction.",John S
40,Ocean Life,This unique attraction is a learning center about local Marine Life. By most standards it’s very small but there is just enough for an afternoon.,BorgHouse
40,"Very hands on, small, great for kids","This is a small hands on aquarium or series of aquariums, and it is not overwhelming like in long beach. It is small, easy to get around, has various tanks inside and out. There are stepping stools for the kids and just a very nice learning environment. If you have small kids it is definitely a place to stop into before or after lunch and going to the beach.",NickellFamilyTravel
40,If you are in Redondo,This is a fast fun stop if you are in Redondo Beach. You and the kids can learn a lot from this stop. We went there just a few weeks ago after not having been here in years and it feels the same.,kraef
50,FUN Adventure for the Grandkids,"What a neat little place to visit. We took our 9 year old grandson and we all learned something new!! We saw many reatures and even got to touch a ""horned shark"". I never had known there was such a thing!! We all had a GREAT time!",melodykulsic
50,Just right for families with kids through elementary school,"This is a small, well maintained sea aquarium with a friendly staff. The outdoor tanks are used for the bigger sea animals, and as touch tanks. Small and big kids will enjoy the tours and exhibits.",gr8fish2017
50,A Local Surprise in Our Own Backyard!,"This is a great place for kids, it is a quick lab, where you can go and learn so much in such little time. Staff is extremely friendly and there is a lot you can do. It's a very clean establishment. You will not be disappointed. I didn't even know this was so close by, and I wouldn't have gone unless my friends who visited from France said they heard it was a great place for kids so we went and they had a fantastic time, even though it was raining.",Cucharina
40,Sea lab fun,"love this place for children. From summer camps to birthday parties to just an afternoon visit, this place is wonderful. Most of the tour guides are amazing and give tons of information about the sea life and environment.",tljdray
40,Knowledge is power,"This place has a larger outside than inside, which we really enjoyed. Even though it was raining we did the walk through the back tanks. What fun, our guide was knowledgeable about the fish, sharks, lobsters etc. I have two knowledgeable teens so we didnt expect much but i was pleasantly surprised at the extensive facts we were hearing. We touched the horned shark and learned some very interesting things about some really cool native to california fish. The inside of this place is small but a great size for a younger crowd and the exhibits were awesome. Teaching people how much we really depend on the ocean is fantastic!! A++ for a great 1 or 2 hours with a great message to help the earth!!",Thedriveagain
50,Fun place to take the kids for close up learning about marine life!,"It only costs a small donation of $4 for a family to visit this fun marine lab and little kids love seeing, touching & learning about the sea life there close up!- INDOOR Tanks include 2 big eels, an octopus, a ""Nemo"" clown fish, tropical fish and jellyfish. Other mini rotating exhibits may include striped shrimp, shark eggs, frogs, etc.- There is also a small classroom for fish and aquatic learning / arts and crafts.OUTDOORS: in the plaza there is a nice rock enclosed tank in the mini-amphitheater. Sometimes sand sharks and Californian orange garibaldi swim in circles to greet you.- About every 30-45 min trained volunteer teenagers will open the roped off area behind the building, exposing a good number of shallow petting/viewing tanks (urchins, snails, stars, slugs, sand sharks) and a few large water silos housing larger fish (look for semi-buried tilapia and schools of super giant fish. See the signs for when the outdoor tank tours are hosted.- Once a day, kids can participate in the outdoor fish feeding for a small fee.",RJ226
50,Great Educational Experience,"The SEA Lab operates on local support and donations only. It was wonderful to learn about local species and to get to touch corn sharks, sea anemones, starfish, and sea cucumbers. I recommend visiting and donating as much as you can afford.",legges502
20,Place was once nicer.,Most of the exhibits were empty. Guess someone broke in and took the Fisk and they never recovered from it. Sad.,djevans376
40,Small Environmental Sea Lab,"Great place to stop while your on a bike ride, walking or just passing by. They have viewing tanks inside and several outside with stations for kids to learn about how they can help protect the ocean.",Sisterutely
50,Great Tour!,"The SEA lab has a lot of animals! We took the outside touch tank tour which was very cool! Inside the building, there were exhibits filled with animals as well!",Jonathan T
50,Wonderful family activity for a a rainy day!,Pleasantly surprised by this FREE activity right near the beach. The complimentary tour on weekdays was great for our one year old daughter and the intern was so knowledgeable and great with children. Highly reccommend checkign this out because they have some really cool fish including a 300 pound sea bass!,wykristen
50,Fun and informative,"Great educational but fun experience for kids, lots of hands on and great for younger ones too. We live walking distance and go often and the kids are never bored (6 years old). Wonderful staff!",jeff M
50,"Big, beautiful fish!","I visited as part of an event with One Surf Fly. I was impressed that something so informative, hands on, and free is in my backyard. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable, and the exhibits were fantastic.",Marshall J
50,great learning environment,"I've taken my 3rd and 4th grade class here, and they have a program where they come to you besides!!! Great learning experience, touch tanks, and knowledgeable people working here.",susanj329
40,"Up close and personal with the eels, rays and barracudas!","Admission is free to the open yard with its large pool of barracudas, eels and rays, and to the indoor displays in the HQ/Admin building. For a very modest fee you can join the guided tours in the 'back lot' where there are a dozen tanks of varying sizes, each with a cross-section of sea-life. Some are open topped and you may touch the fishes.The guide worked to a pre-learned script and struggled to answer some of the questions put to her by visitors. Nevertheless, an interesting visit (our second) and the kids loved it.It's quite a small establishment but well worth an hour of your time and you will learn quite a bit about the local sea life.",Steve M
50,Great staff during tour hours,"The SEA Lab is a rescue/rehad facility for idealize caught in the water intakes for the power plant nearby. Nearly all the creatures there are local. It is small but very up-close and personal and the exhibits are well-done. There are moray eels, sharks, large sea bass, lobsters, and halibut, among others. During the afternoon tours (1:00, 2:00, 3:00), a staff member will open small tanks where you can touch anemones, sharks, and rays. Its a really nice facility, and the best part is, it is FREE (but they do suggest a $2/person donation, no obligation). Stop on by if you're in the area!",DunesMom
50,"Understated, no-pomp; sea-science at its best","You just go in and hang out with the sea life, AND of course with people who KNOW what they're talking about. Great experience",Primo54
50,Packed with surprises and fun,The SEA Lab is small but the behind-the-scenes tour is filled with information and seldom seen wonders. My niece and nephew were blown away when they were allowed to pet the sharks. The staff is helpful and informative. The Sea Lab is a must do!,violincello256
50,Small but educational,"Nice little educational stop between Redondo and Hermosa. Not very big, but free,suggest donation. Programs during summer hours. And holidays. Very nice staff and exhibits",Judpma012
30,Quaint Sea Lab!,"This is a very small sea lab that you can probably go thru in less than an hour. There is not too much to check out inside however outside they have plenty of things to explore. A guide will walk you thru the several areas, with many you can touch, while answering questions and going over facts of the various sea life. My only real complaint are the parents that let their kids just run around. During my visit I had kids bump into me, push me out of the way and splash water on me. I don't think the guides are allowed to say much except for when the kids are mishandling the sea creatures but parents should really teach there kids some manners.",Casi702
50,Get up close and personal with some sealife,"Stopped here on a whim and it was an unexpected surprise. Initially we just went into the smaller aquarium indoors, and noticed there was a tour going on at 1pm. We went to grab a bite and a beer, then came back for the tour. The tour is the highlight. You'll get to touch, anemone, sea stars, sea slugs and even a horned shark. The suggested donation is a pittance for the experience.Some of the animals are rehabilitated from the power plant nearby so it's good to know your money is going to a good purpose.",2Rismo
40,Love the up-close encounters,"I've been here twice, once with my kids and once with my husband. Both times were really good. I love the tanks out back where you can get up close to the critters. The halibut tank is my favorite. They are very cute with just their eyes poking up out of the sand. The people that work there are knowledgeable. I like how they use young people as tour guides.",TurFerg
40,"Nice, local and inexpensive","The Sea Lab is a small, research and educational facility in Redondo Beach. You can pop in and with a tour guide, they have touch tanks where you can learn about various sea creatures and actually get to touch some. They ask for donations, so if you're looking for something to do for about 1 hour and low on cash, I'd take the kids to the Sea Lab! My husband was skeptical and I dragged him along with our 13, 10 and 5 year old. By the middle of the tour he was all into it, touching sea stars and sea slugs and Sharks and sea urchins. I believe the tour guides are volunteers and ours was very informative and friendly. In the end we donated $3 (we didn't have any change and neither do they) and hey, it was a fun little afternoon. Don't expect Aquarium of the Pacific here, but it was low key and not crowded. Also, I think it's a good activity for groups with kids of mixed ages like we had. A sulky teenager will still get a kick out of touching sea life and so will a squirmy 5 year old. Downside is there is no parking, only street metered parking.",Helena C
40,Small but nice experience!,"Took some young visitors there. First Donation, no admission charge, Small but lots to see. Stay for the program if offered. The kids will learn a lot. Clean. Right between Redondo and Hermosa so there are plenty of restaurants close by. Street parking only, can be a little hassle on beach days, as the lab is right next to a popular beach. week days are better for parking. You will spend about 45-60 minutes there, its small. there is another one of these on the Manhattan Beach Pier.",Jud J
50,This place is really a gem!,"A great place to stop by before or after hanging at hermosa beach. It's great for the family, interesting info on the local marine life and it's run by staffers who are dedicated to helping out the community. It's very inexpensive and has great handling tanks. be sure to go for the tour....it only takes about 1hour to see the whole place",frank c
40,Lots of fun after 1 pm,"This place is so cool! And the admission is only a suggested donation to help them with the expenses of staying open. But you can only see the smaller aquarium displays before the tours that start at 1 pm and on the hour, every hour, until they close. Great educational place for the whole family!",Tiffany M
50,A Msut See and Do!,"This is a great experience, especially for children. You get to learn about local marine life and how they are taken care of. This lab takes in rescue fish and releases them back if able after they are healed. They breed local fish that are low in numbers. This is a hands on experience and well worth the couple of hours you can spend there.For a tourist, it is nice to get to know what is in our ocean so you understand and care for the waters better.",Kathi
20,Not open,Dropped past but place was not open. Entrance is not obvious.No entrance indicating hours/days open. Lots of construction in the area inhibiting access.,Dave1xyz
40,Pier Paradise,"Packed with information and helpful staff, great for young kids and the curious of all ages.Easily accessible on foot and a great end to a day at the beach.",Suzie Q
50,Great Education for Such a Small Sea Lab,"My kids and I love to come here and see the latest sea life on display, what they are growing or saving, learning from the hands-on demonstrations, and the over-all presentation.For such small, hidden sea lab, they accomplish a lot!",LivPurple
40,Small and interesting,"We walked past it several times before we realized what it was. After we read about it in a brochure, we stopped in. It is not big but is very interesting.",MJH048
30,"Local, Affordable,Educational - short outing for the kids/family","This place is very close to my home. It is tiny compared to most aquarium type places. I think they do research here or maybe it's just to show the kids. Some days it's pretty open and empty and some days they have school trips etc and it's crowded. So check ahead. It can be seen and done in and hour tops. Some of the staff can answer the questions the kids have and some don't know. I think many are volunteers and still learning.This is a donation only so that is nice but do make a donation so this educational sea lab can stay open. Many times this got me through the hard part of trying to keep a toddler busy. I could walk here easily from my home and the beach is literally right outside the door, the Redondo Beach marina and King Harbor are right there and Hermosa Beach is a short walk on the strand. Manhattan Beach is a longer but nice walk as well. If you have little ones let them do the tour and feed the fish.",JuliK222
20,Admission is free,"This must be the most 'compact' of sea-life centres in the US! To look at all the displays AND read all the captions and information panels takes less than 30 minutes. I asked a staffer a question about a display, she didn't know the answer but would find out. She didn't return!Outside is a small open air rock pool with several large sea fish. For $2 you can buy a cup full of chopped fish to feed them at around mid-day. The kids loved that! Otherwise there is not a lot on offer. Perhaps their work is mainly research work, out of the public view, who knows?",Steve M
40,Great family visit,"Bring the children and enjoy viewing all of the interesting sea creatures at this location. Lots of interesting sea life in tanks and outside pools of fish, sharks, and sting rays. Fun day!!!",Kevin B
50,Love it,I would highly recommend visiting this little place. It has a tour that is about 30 minutes long. Perfect educational piece for the kids and free. It is by donation only.,760kathrynm
50,Careful when touching.,"This was our first time at SEA Lab. We were very impressed with the tanks inside. My daughter loved the fish, seahorse, and even at 4 was able to understand their ecological displays. We arrived in time for the first tour of the afternoon. It will take a full hour. The kids had a wonderful time touching (1 finger please) the different sea creatures and fish. Some of the fish of course were not for touch but were all the more interesting to look at. The guides were so nice and ask all the questions from the kids with patience. The fee is a small donation but fill generous they do wonderful things at SEA Lab.",Sbible
50,The highlight of our 10 day California trip,"When I go on trips the rarest occurrence is when I stumble across something which is entirely new, interesting, un-expected and mentally fulfilling. That is what I came to encounter with Sea Lab. I had accidentally found it on the list of museums for the Los Angeles area on Wikipedia when I was seeking out new and interesting things to see in the L.A area. Knowing of the comments from TripAdvisor I was going to flip a coin whether to visit it or not, as it was in the wrong direction of travel for us. However, my said ""yes"" and off we went. There wasn't much traffic in the Redondo beach area and parking on the street was easy to find. The outside was very colourful, clean and attractive. As noted elsewhere, the main area holds a number of fish tanks and can be viewed in 5mins or less. Outside is a number of large holding tanks for which we were too late to catch most of the short tour and explanation, but it still looked interesting as the kids were able to touch star fish, etc. However, the real highlight of our 10 day vacation was to go on the tour of the water conservation area and test desalination plant of the Sea Lab building. We would almost have missed out on it had we not had another lady say she was starting a short tour with us + another family. The lady giving the tour + overview was very good, patient with us and well trained. It was in the back portion of the building where there are professional exhibits detailing the water conservation efforts of the state as well as how their desanlination plant works. The last 10mins had us put on hard hats and get a short tour, with explanations, of how their test desanlination plant works. Being engineering minded people, this was not something we were expecting to see at all and hence was quite satisfying to us to see and learn about. I'm sure we could have spent another 30mins at Sea Lab had we wanted to wait for the next tour of the holding tanks. All in all it would have been a shame if we had not visited Sea Lab and passed it over - as this was the very first thing we did on our 10 day vacation, we felt that we had accomplished everything on our trip just from this tour alone :-) After the visit, if you walk 30 seconds north of Sea Lab then you can get access to Redondo Beach without having to travel south to the Redondo Beach pier. We felt that our $5 of optional entry fee cost was well worth it.",RCL9
50,"Great family stop, insider secret!","Little research facility is a great place to stop by (be sure to call for hours as varies with volunteer staffing) Little tanks of SOCO sealife to observe...sometimes a ""ray"" petting pool!",musicalroad
40,Small Sea Experience,"We just happened upon this place. There are aquariums throughout and large tanks in which to view sea animals. They ask for a nominal donation, and it was worthwhile. The day we visited, there were few visitors. This is a great place to take young children.",ehartlin
30,Fun for children,My grandson loves the Sea Lab. It is informational and has touching opportunities. it is free but they ask for a donation. I found it crowded and the space tight so it was difficult to move with a stroller. It is worth the visit.,Cwinner
50,Worth visiting for ages 2—102!,"This was a fun attraction for my family. The tour guide you get will make a difference on how good is your experience. Our tour lady was super...I cannot recall her name though. This is a free attraction! There is a suggested donation of $2 per person or $4 per family, but they do not push this AT ALL. We got to pet several sea creatures and got answers to all our questions. There is parking behind The Sea Lab for $1 per hour and it uses honor system.",thesmays
40,"Nice activity, especially for young children","We made a trip to Redondo, but were disappointed with the beach. We were going to leave and return to the resort, but waited for a guided tour of sea lab. We all (inclusive of 2 kids, ages 11 & 13), found the free lecture both interesting and entertaining. Free and not crowded, so can be spontaneous with regards to choosing it. Several lecture times per day.",Michael H
40,Great learning for big and little kids,"really interesting, you don't find things like this very often. Small, accessible, friendly and knowledgeable scientific staff makes it fun.",Av8trx90277
40,Fun for all kids,Fun for the kids and adults too. Interesting displays and hands on touch tanks. Good way to learn about the marine life and the impact we make on the them and the ocean in general. Free too.,ja598
50,Learning center about out Sea live and the importance to preserve it no matter where you live,Great little education center for all. Learn not only about the sea live but the impact the land has in our ocean waters no matter where you live in the world.,BlueWaterFun
50,Great for Children and Adults,FREE.... Did I say FREE.... If you want to donate to there cause you can but not pressured to. Tours of many touch tanks where (you get to touch sea creatures) a guided tour by a knowledgeable staff member. Also a self guided area to look through. This is not a large place and you can get a tour and see everything you want in less then 1.5 hrs.,Shandon S
40,a hidden and small gem,"this place is great... it is small, free, and very educational....the touch tank is great... kids get to see, touch and learn about local sea life.... love it",pkq
