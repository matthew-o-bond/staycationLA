50,“havana place to visit”,"Havana a must to visit when in Cuba ,very informative...lots of historythe people are very nice...the churches.."
50,“Awesome City”,"Old cars, odd taxi's (bicycle, motor, etc) but also old buildings and historic places. Also beautiful buildings, churched, restaurants, bars and friendly people. If you did not visit Habana, then you did not visit Cuba."
50,“A Cuban City with a European Kiss”,"The architecture was simply gorgeous and the music was amazing. Of course, there are a lot of beggars, which can be annoying for some, but keep in mind that they need to make a living. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves history and music."
30,“toilet”,cuba needs to sort out its toilets. Havana was very interesting particularly as it has resisted the urge to demolish its old colonial buildings and is restoring them. More interesting were the more affluent suburbs. to quote -everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.
30,“Old Havana is amazing!”,The old city is like stepping back in time even further than modern Cuba.A number of worthwhile sites including a bar and hotel where Ernest Hemingway spent much of his time in Havana.
40,“Excursion”,Very nice and rich in culture/information excursion. The only sad thing is that we couldn't visit the museum and its cliff which has the panoramic view of the city because Redbull was doing extreme cliff diving at that moment.Watch out for touristic trap (fake cigars) though!
40,“the best”,"everything is nice, the people, the arquitecture,the houses, habana is another world. is a little dirty"
40,“Old and new wonderful toor”,The history the sites are amazing. Be prepared to tip and do not be surprised if your asked for one.. They have to make a living for there family..
40,“Needed More Time”,"I loved Havana- my only regret is not having enough time there! We stayed in Varadero, so Havana was about a 2 to 2.5 hour drive away. We were brought into the city centre and did a tour of the old buildings around there. After that, we went to the garrison, bought cigars and rum and had lunch. The old cars and the crumbling facades of what were once beautiful buildings is really something to see. If I ever go back, I will be staying at least one night there to get a better sense of the city and to see more sights.Before we left, we went to a microbrewery next to the indoor market. I can't remember what it was called, but it was a fantastic experience with great, cheap beer."
40,“Fantastic day in Habana”,"We had a tour through Sunwing, learned a great deal about the history 16th and 17th century... The buildings... the forts... Hemmingways cafe and hotel... So many great sights to see. One thing, is the begging locals. Wow... If I could give one piece of advice, don't feed the bears... If you give to the locals who are begging, it will cause you and the group your with more hardships. We had 2 different people with us that kept giving to the people who were begging, so we had a flock of aggressive locals after our group. Don't do it. But don't miss out on a trip to Habana... You will not regret it."
50,“Amazing Tourist Experience”,"If you're in Cuba and don't go to Havana, then you're missing out. The city is amazing, plain and simple. The history, the architecture, the food, the people.... just go here. That's all you need to know. In fact, don't even go to Cuba unless you plan on visiting Havana. Every other review says it all."
50,“Culture”,"A must see, if you can rent a car, parking is available and you are free to tour at your own leisure"
50,“Amazing old city stuck in 1953”,"I loved the old buildings and the old cars, its like someone stopped the clock back in the 50's. I found the beggars a little pushy and the people trying to get you to buy illegal cigars annoying but they all went away with a firm no thanks"
50,“Must See”,"This was awesome. Real city life, dirty and disgusting in a cool way. Wholly recommend. Ask for Joel at the concierge, you MUST have him take you. Best tour guide ever!"
50,“Four day visit to Havana”,The people were great. the architecture is incredible. We walked everywhere at all hours and were never worried for our safety. Food was yummy.
30,“it wasnt that great”,well it was a nice drive... but nothing that interesting... a few good pictures... and a great pina colada on the way there... but i didnt see much... i expected a little more... all i know is i can say i did it thats it
50,“Trina0210”,We stayed overnight in Havana.So many people everywhere you turn.Seen lots of old buildings.They is lots of old cars to see.Lots of history to learn and see.
40,“A must see!”,"The Old Havana is GORGEOUS! I could have stayed there all day, the town squares, and all the little things to see and do was amazing!"
40,“Interesting”,"We spent a few days in Havana and found it very interesting. It is a third world country and very poor so much of the city is decrepit and dirty and very polluted, but if you can look past that, it is also beautiful and has a lot of fascinating history. The most interesting part of the visit was going to the clubs to listen to music and wondering around Old Havana."
50,“Was the highlight of our trip”,"We spent the night in Havana and it was completely amazing, walked all over old Havana and then spent the evening at the Jazz Café! Loved it!"
30,“Private taxi tour to Havana”,"It was great driving in the old 56 chevy car (but no seat belts) there was a few different groups going on the same day and we all found out they all take you to the same places and restaurants. Hemingway bar for a $6 daiquiri and another cuban restaurant for a $40 lunch, (that wont take visa) so take lots of cash.The cigar factory for a tour $10, very interesting. Cigars are cheaper at the airport or hotel and stored in a controlled room (humidity and temp).The church, old havana and the forts $4, were fabulous and check out the school ground.....they have a dummy hanging from the tree and it appears to be wearing american cloths....it made for an interesting photo.Just beware about where the driver takes you. If I did it again I would tell my driver I want to eat in old Havana, at the square, out on the patio restaurants. Prices were more reasonable and they looked very good too. Plus more cuban style.Taxi ranged from $120-$140 for the day."
40,“Very cool place!”,"Such a cool place! the classic old architecture and interesting history, interesting people, no capitalistic force fed advertising. Be careful talking to, taking pictures of or even looking too long at anyone though because they will expect you to pay up for that and will yell at you or embarrass you if you don't. Photo bugs be warned. I loved how all the street blockade posts were actually old ship canons. I highly recommend visiting this place!"
50,“Worth a day out - no more”,"interesting sights to see, lovely scenary and you wll love the classic cars driing about. Visit the flee market and bartar for a deal. you wil enjoy but do not spend longer than the day here."
50,“Such beautiful architecture”,"It's a bit of a hike to get there from Varadero (about a 2 hour drive) but it is definitely worth it. The buildings and architecture in this city tell a story on their own. When you walk around Havana, it is really like stepping back in time. So much history, so many sweet faces, so much to look at. I loved Havana!"
40,“Stuck in time”,"Paid 50CUC for the day trip to Habana and it was a good experience. You literally go back in time as the city is stuck in the past in terms of architecture.Visited the Piña Colada bar at the top of the highest bridge in Matanzas, it is 3 CUC but it is worth it, very tasty and you get to pour in how much rum you want.They took us to Old Habana which is were you can find La Bodeguita, where Hemingawy used to get his mojitos, the cathedral and the old fort.Then we had lunch at a restaurant which looks like a private home but the food was tasty and loved the rice and beans.We later went to the new Habana, which means that it is stuck in the 1950's, and here you see the Revolution Plaza where Castro used to make his speeches and the capitol and other monuments, you can also find La Floridita, where Hemingway used to get his daiquiri's.Had a great time in this historical city."
50,“Loved the History”,"Had a great overnight tour in Habana. Saw the old part and the new. Ate cuban peanuts, went to a tropical show. Stayed at the original National Hotel where family members stayed back in the 70s so great to reminiscence. Mojitos, cuban libres. Enjoyed the history. Lots of fun."
50,“A must see”,"Loved the old and new Havana...buildings are being restored and it's just pretty and vibrant...don't be taken by those asking or dealing for money..just move on, as it does not happen everywhere....the people are very nice in general!"
50,“Old Havana”,Loved the Market where the Locals shop.The cobble stone streets of old havana was great and the best restaurant in havana where the ladies wear white cowboy outfits including hats.
50,“Amazing city”,"Old Havana is probably the most beautiful city I have ever visited. The architecture is stunning and the 50s american cars are everywhere. Plaza Veja is the best of the squares with restored buildings and the book market is also well worth a visit. I recommend a walk along the Malacon with it's crumbling buildings.Constantly being offered cigars can become a bit tiresome. Everyone is friendly but only 2 of the people we met didn't try to sell us cigars. You can easily get around on foot once you find your bearings. If you are visiting Cuba, you MUST visit Havana, you will not be disappointed."
30,“Cubana Tours - Beautiful Architecture”,"We took the long tour including the Ron and Cigars, old and new Havana tour, 12 hours long. Too much too fast but incredible driver and the finest tour guide ever, she new her history like the back of her hand and so interesting just the best!Street of Habana total kaos, bricks and garbage in a lot of street as they redo the water system. The architecture is magnifique and wish to see it all restore, it would be a magical place.Lots of beggars, very poor young and old people, broke my hearth but still worth the visit, a must see!!"
10,“Tourists rip off!”,"In my last trip to Havana I have noticed how this city has changed in some ways. You can now have better meals in nicer places but the prices have double. The taxi drivers do not use their meters anymore they just charge the price they want to and they seem to have an agreement between them has they seem to have come to a common agreement which is not the right price.The famous “Casas Particulares” have also inflated their prices. Where ever you look in the internet or even in travel books there is a high and a low season, but now they have decided Cuba is a single season, High Season! Is that right in a travel point of view? I don’t think so. We have to remember ourselves where we are traveling to, and I do not find logical to be charge for a room five times the average salary of a Cuban. We all know the situation over there but is it right to have a different currency for tourists? This is the only place in the world where this exist, how fare is that?I found sad that this “money matter” ruined what supposed to be a pleasant and relaxing holiday."
40,“Habana/Havana”,"Tour was to see architecture. Still working on roads and bulidings repairs. Open sewer snmell plus walk on narrow sidewalk as water is full of sewage on roads. Wear good athletic shoes and no flip flops. Hat, sunscreen, bottled water.Camera a must!Worth all of that to see Havana and beware every person wants pesoes for their babies...look and see on their wrist if expensive watch, necklace gold, sunglasses expensive before giving . Old, crippled yes..pesoes to them!Trinidad better kept and better maintained buildings!But Cuba , so Havana a must see!Lila/Bronson"
40,“Great visit - too much Che”,Great visit to Havana - a little too much exploitation of Che everywhere (he was not even Cuban).Nice historic place to visit
50,“Great trip”,"it's a must, if this is you're first time in Cuba. It's a very interesting city, with a rich culture and long history."
40,“Go with a guide!”,"Havana was very very cool to see, but we were thinking about renting a car and going alone... glad we didn't! We hired a Cuban to take us in a rental and show us all the sights. If we would have went alone, we probably would have gotten lost, and wouldn't have seen everything we wanted to see. Not to mention the drivers are crazy!!! I am pretty sure we would have gotten in an accident! It was definatly worth the trip out there though. I don't think I would go again to Havana, but it was so cool to see once. The shopping is cheaper in Varadero as well."
50,“So much to see”,"Do a little research, decide what you want to see and hire a taxi for a tour or book with a small company like Club sCuba Azul"
50,“Take a private taxi to havana”,"Enjoyed seeing the architecture of old havana. New havana is not too exciting but apparently is the place to go for night life. take a private taxi instead of a tour bus and you'll save time and money. You can have a decent lunch at La Casa, or do whatever you want rather that follow the government tour bus schedule. A private taxi from the end of the varadero peninsula costs $150 if you return at 5 PM or $180 if you return after 5. This is for 2 or more people, where as a tour bus costs that much just for one person."
50,“OMG”,You have to make the trip to hanvanna be it solo or on the tour. To get a grasp of what is the most beautiful city in the world this is a must do excursion. My 16th trip and canniot get enough of thid city
50,“Travelling back to the old colonial.”,"Days visiting where Hemmingway once sat to write, and drinking in the atmosphere. There was a very real sense that we where immersed in the romantic remains of a golden era. Plenty of reasonable places to eat and the vibe of the whole place was exquisit. Be on the watch for the usual lookie lookie men but hey you find them everywhere."
50,“Beautiful City”,The good is the old age of the city and the generic look. Alot of scenic views because of the water. Only problem was that the drive was so long from Varadero but it was well worth it. Lady D from our excursion was amazing. Very informative and she forewarned us about patrons trying to sell us and she told us how to handle ourselves with the sellers.
50,“Havana Tour with Air Canada Vacations”,"the Air Canada Vacations Representative was excellent. He told us exactly what the tour would be like. He did not exaggerate. the tour guide was excellent. I believe his name was Frank. He told us lots of history and explained everything we could possibly want to know. He stayed with us through the tour of the city, old and new Havana, and he attended the Tropicana show with us. The show is under the stars and it was exceptional, bar none. They give you a 40 oz of good rum, coke to mix it, and a trey of munchies."
30,“interesting”,"Well worth a visit but only for three or four days. Not able to use credit cards. Very run down in some areas, but with lots of character."
50,“A beautiful city”,I loved Havana and will surely go back. The sections that are being renovated look like a city in Europe with its pastel colors on the houses.
30,“Lovely Architecture”,La Habana is a beautiful building and the square is vibrant with lots going on. You will find people dressed in costumes wanting you to take their picture for a few dollars.
50,“Habana”,Beautiful city not to be missed. If you have a great guide you learn a lot of the history about Cuba and La Habana. The architecture is amazing and we saw people living in homes ravaged by hurricane Ivan. The old fort and cigar store is great as well.
50,"“""Explore Havana""”","My best friend and I travelled to HAvana, Cuba from 15 - 20 July and one of our activities was taking Salsa lessons. This was my first attempt at learning the dance, my friend is really goo, but she booked us with ""Explore Havana"" and we met a couple Julio and Rocio - they were absolutely fabulous!! They had wonderful attitudes, pride and love for their country and for Salsa.They are great teachers, and towards the end of our trip, I fell in love with Salsa!Very inexpensive for 1 1/2 hours in the mornings, located in Vardero. If you're looking for something to do, I will strongly suggest you try Explore Havana! Not only do they teach salsa lessons, they also are tour guides. Very Lovely people! I hope to return soon.See:explorehavana.wordpress.com/about"
50,“amazing!”,"This city of old and new is a sight to behold. Many restorations on going in the old city. You get a real feeling of history. The new city is hub of activity, very fast paced. Overall wish we had more time to spend."
50,“culture”,The tour was excellent with a very knowledgeable guide. Havana is a nice city to see - I will definitely go back and spend a few days there.
40,“A must to see”,"We have been to Havana twice now, and it is definitely something to see. We did different tours , we thought we would hear the same thing second time around, but that wasn't the case. Both were very informative."
50,“A MUST!”,"How can you travel all this way and not see Havana? It's a very busy place, but very beautiful. Be sure to visit a cigar factory and bring chewing gum for the workers to watch their faces light up in a smile."
40,“Havana is worth the trip”,"See it now before Cuba changes forever!! Take a bus or a taxi to the Square outside the Inglaterra Hotel and go for a walk around Old Havaana. Enjoy a coffee in another square, be a tourist--at an exorbitant rate of CUC6 for a drink at Hemingway's bar. It is safe and fun. Enjoy!"
50,“Definitely worth seeing!”,Old Havana and new Havana are both worth seeing....there is some stunning architecture and the old cars are very neat!! The Tropicana show is also very entertaining and well done...if you have time I would recommend an overnight stay as opposed to a day trip so you are able to see and experience more.
30,“Too fast and a long way in bus to appreciate in a one day trip...”,Very exhausting day...Travelling nealry 4 hours in a bus and while in Havana running verywhere in a fast way to see as most of possible. Yes a fun day but it should have been at LEAST a 2 day trip. The dinner offer with the tour was so so and too long...Would have prefer eating hotdogs and spending more time visiting the city.Feel like we were rushed all day to see a limited number of things ...What a day...Look around before choosing your tavelling tour and get the most you can in your visit....
50,“Good value”,"The trip to the flea market is great. Old city is nice, but a lot of stray dogs is sad."
20,“Great Place...BUT BEWARE”,I have been to Havana twice this year to see friends. The 2nd visit was very stressful having 'mislaid' my luggage in Madrid and after having been sold a travelex credit card in Heathrow and was assured that i could use it in Havana....when i got there i found out that this was not the case. A complete nightmare for the first two day. I am still trying to understand the 'Cuban' ways. Every time i went out with my Cuban friends i had to pay....even to the fact that if they gave me a lift in there car i had to pay for the petrol. I have also found them to be very 'money grabbing' but i understand that they earn very little money and so i shouldn't blame them for that. The hotel levels of customer service is not existant......you might find the odd one who will help but they seriously need to improve if they want to encourage tourism. Havana it self is beautiful and romantic but looks tired. It needs a serious amount of money spent on the capital to clean it up but at the same time it needs to hang on tothe mystery that Havana holds. It's a great place to have fun.....but beware of pick pockets and also make sure that when leaving Havana you have your luggage bubble wrapped for extra security as i had just a lock on mine and it got broken in to. Last tip is take cash....a lot of credit cards are not accepted.
40,"“A world Heritage site, a marvellous walking town”","We stayed at Parque Centrale NH near Old Town and walked most places. Havana was clean and safe and with the rare issue of street hucksters peddling cigars etc. it was hassle free. Hemingway scenes are close, so is the water and forts--but the main attractions are the restored buildings and galleries in Old town. We stayed a week and covered alot of it. Tropicana was a cab ride away (20 CUC) and was 2 hrs of the most gorgeous costume and high energy dancing I have ever seen. the hotel had great bars and food, the rooftop pools were an oasis from the street scenes. Alot of Americans there and very welcome too. The dollar buys alot there, the tours were worth it, we booked thru the hotel. The scooter taxis are the most fun. don't miss the cemetary and the fort el Morro but whatever you do, slow down and explore the Old Town area. Hemingway is a popular guy there. See it before the world changes and it loses that classy late 50's look and feel."
40,“Fabulous 2 Weeks!”,"We recently returned from two weeks in a decaying and struggling city that was dire need of financial help and renovation. But it was one of the best 2 weeks holiday I have ever experienced! We had to persuade the scammers that they were wasting time on us. Within a couple of hours we worked that one out. Just tell them you are from Iceland or Norway. A country they will not have knowledge of the language. Then don't understand and walk off. The begging was an issue, but quickly one is able to see which may be people you wish to support, the genuine. That's the bad side.It was safe. We walked the worst streets at night and felt very safe.We experienced real life in a country that was like few others. How nice not to see endless fast food chains. To see little commercial enterprise was a welcome change.Our favourite restaurant was on the bay of Havana, Castropol. In truth food was tasteless, but Castropol was well run, reasonable prices and high quality food. The Manager was a very pleasant man, as was most of the staff. And most spoke good English.We stayed the entire time at the Nacional. The most famous in Cuba. It was billed 5*, but it clearly wasn't. But that wasn't an issue. It was faded splendour, but what an experience to stay where the good and great, plus the gangsters, stayed. The staff were helpful and the food mostly good. Enjoyable buffet breakfast for us poor folk. But beware the 24 hour restaurant. It was dire. We actually must have been gluttons for punishment. 3 times we tried the food and wished we hadn't.The staff were very pleasant. In particular the lady who was at the swimming pool and the lady cleaner in that area who ""cured"" my sunburn with a natural cure and who was forced to accept a small tip. She really didn't want to take it.We left gifts for the poor at a convent about 1km round the bay from the hotel. Father Gregory Walker met us. He and the sisters were wonderful people. I am agnostic but if you have anything or the poor, including medication, these good people are not tarnished with corruption. Amongst the sisters there are 5 qualified doctors. Indeed the hospital is just minutes away.We made several visits to a boxing gym, not far from the railway station. A former 2 x Olympic and 2 x times World Champion, Hector Vinent ran the gym. The boxers were very technical. As expected coaching first rate, but they had nothing. No skipping ropes, so had to pretend they had one. Fertilizer bags as no boxing bags. Ring canvas worn out a decade ago and at the weekend tournment they had to share gumshields. Boxing fans go and take some equipment for them.The transport was interesting. Almost every vehicle would be unroadworthy in the UK, but we never came to harm.It was great. We will go again. It's a must go holiday. Don't toast on the beach in Cuba. Get to meet real Cubans and have the holiday of a lifetime.Brian."
50,"“Havana, a city full of surprises”","After a well rested 5 days in Varadero we were ready to explore Havana. This city has an abandonce of places to see just by walking. Take good walking shoes. If you like to be aquanted with Havana but don't know where to start, take the doubledecker bus T1 or T3 for CUCs5. One takes you to the west and the other to the east side of the city and you are able to hop off/hop on.Visit the lobbies of the renovated hotels as they all have a tale to tell, look into the old delapadated homes and visualize the old beauty. Absorb the Art Deco, Art Nouveau and Baroque of the buildings especially walking along the Malecon.Stop and listen to the music in cafes & restaurants and have a dance with the locals, especially at the Plaza Cathedrale.Stroll through Obispo to Havana Vieja, have your Daquirie at Floridita, lunch or dinner at Los Nardos or just relax in the many parcs to watch the people go by.Take a ride in these amazing old taxis, the drivers speak very good English.Have a good torch for the evenings as there is no street lights.What history, art & beauty this city offers. What wonderful people and one day I will return."
10,“Havana”,"I went in January 2011. I am not impressed. This is a sad, delapitated city. The Cuban people are not motivated enough to keep their homes reasonably maintained. For a city that has summer year round, how come nobody plants a flower or puts a fresh coat paint on their home. The Malecon is not worth seeing, its old, boring and unattractive, a reflection of the whole downtown. I wont be returning to Havana, it actually depressed me."
50,“Exactly What We Hoped Havana Would Be Like”,"We loved Havana and the hotel NH Parque Central has to be the best in the city – perfect location, clean, nice breakfasts and friendly staff plus we were very lucky to get a free upgrade to a suite. I'd emailed the hotel before we went to ask if it was possible to have a room on a higher floor, with a side or front view and we were given a corner suite on the 6th floor ! Lovely views overlooking the small park from the bedroom and we had a balcony in the lounge area that had views up towards the Capitol building. The bed was huge, 6’ 6” wide and very comfortable (and very high). All the toiletries were included plus slippers and robes and upon arrival there was a welcoming note with a plate of cakes and a complimentary bottle of rum, which we would drink whilst sitting on the balcony each evening watching the hustle and bustle of Havana below. We obviously knew about the old cars but didn’t expect there to be so many, it was wonderful to see them still on the roads (even if a 1957 Chevy did have a Toyota dashboard). The mini bar was 3cuc per drink (including small bottles of water) but we bought it from the shop just up the road where it was much cheaper (thanks to the tip on here). Check-in was very quick and welcoming too and soon after we’d arrived we had a phone call from our man in Havana (on behalf of Key2holidays) checking we had arrived ok and asking if there was anything we needed and confirming our transfer times to Varadero a few days later.For our first day I’d arranged for us to have a guide, who had been recommended to us by a friend, and I’m really glad we did as I was a bit nervous about walking around Havana and I was expecting it to be as bad as Egypt (annoying street sellers etc) but after a couple of hours we felt totally at ease. Our guide was excellent. She told us about the history of the country and obviously had a passion for Havana. She took us to places you wouldn’t normally see or know about as a general tourist and we felt totally safe - we were able to go up the back streets (during the day) on our own later without any problems. I’d definitely recommend hiring a guide for your first day. The one we had prefers to get her business through Jorge but we had booked via our friends.Occasionally we were asked if we wanted cigars but a polite ‘No thank you’ was all that was needed. They would often ask if we were English, welcome us to Cuba and then wish us a good holiday and that was it – no hard sell or that annoying ‘in your face’ attitude. We were told that they might pick your pockets for money but they won’t hit you on the head for it.Our first night we went to the hotel bar and got chatting to some of the Virgin Airlines staff from our flight who were also staying at our hotel. We had our first Mojito in Cuba and didn’t think the bar prices were too bad (I can only base the prices by what we pay in the UK and on other holidays to the States and Europe) – 4.50cuc (pronounced kewks) = £3.20. We ate on the rooftop terrace, which was ideal for a snacky type meal (pizza was very nice) .We were impressed at breakfast - we didn’t expect much but there was plenty of choice at the buffet of cereals, breads, cheese, cold meats plus sausages, eggs cooked to order, and other hot items plus fruit juices etc. The dining room is quite large and airy with a nice décor. We would normally be down for breakfast by 8am and it was empty but by 9pm it started to fill up and sometimes the tables weren’t cleared quickly enough.We changed our money up at the bank in the hotel (it’s about the size of a cupboard). We were automatically given a receipt and the right money every time. There was always a security guard at the door and as only one person is allowed in my hubby had to wait outside. After the first visit he would shake hubby’s hand and have a joke with him – in fact we never came across a Cuban without a sense of humour ! There were usually 2 doormen and a security guy at the main doors too and we never saw any prostitutes in the hotel (I was on the lookout after reading some reviews on here).We were located in the ‘old’ building but on all 3 days we were there we found the roof-top pool to be busy and no vacant sun loungers so we went to the ‘new’ building, which is accessed by and underground walkway from just down from the reception, and never found more than about 6 people around the pool. You also get a different view of Havana so it’s worth going up there for those Kodak moments.During our tour we asked the guide to take us to Los Nardos for lunch but we weren’t impressed, it was very dark so had trouble reading the menu or see what we were eating. The service was a bit slow and food ok but wouldn’t go there again. It had been recommended by our friends to have the chickpeas with the pork (very fatty) and sausage but we didn’t like it at all. The shrimps in tomato sauce was ok but felt the whole thing was overrated (but that is our opinion and many people love it). We also had 2 jugs of fruit juice sangria which we realised later was expensive at £9 a jug. The bill for the 3 of us was 72cuc – over £50. We gave them 80cuc and they didn’t come back with our change – they assumed it was their tip. I thought this was out of order and our guide asked for the change, which they didn’t seem happy with her about, so we left a smaller tip in protest.We enjoyed the terrace of the Inglaterra hotel as they had a good band on but often found it much quicker to go to the bar to get a drink as the waiter service was slow. Although they had the staff they would chat among themselves at the entrance and ignore you. We also had a meal on the roof-top terrace of the Inglaterra (check out their interior as the dining area has some lovely tiling). For a set price of about 12cuc per person we had seafood kebabs, salad and a cocktail, plus a band was playing.We also liked the micro brewery in the square – just 2cuc for a large beer (they offer light, like a lager, medium or dark beer). We didn’t think their menu was too expensive either considering the location (12cuc for a bbq pork chop, salad and a beer). One day we went on the open top bus which is very good at 5cuc’s for a 2 hour journey and takes you a bit further afield. There’s also a tatty looking bar on the seafront where the bus terminates which we found to be very cheap although the service was very slow (some people gave up waiting and left). We’d also recommend the art & craft market located in an old warehouse. It’s a nice walk along the seafront and you can’t miss it as there are 2 old train carriages in front of it. There were loads of booths selling the usual pictures and souvenir items but the atmosphere was lively and we had one of our best meals in Havana of bbq chicken, rice, salad and a chunk of bread for 3cuc each in their cafe.We also toured the cigar factory which was very interesting, the museum where there is a scaled down model of Havana (gives you an idea of the layout of the city) and we were taken by our guide to a local supermarket and a tourist one to see the difference. I was amazed in the difference of how the Cubans are treated in comparison to the tourists (the ones with cuc’s) - there’s a big line drawn between the two. In one local shop the only meat on offer were 3 pigs trotters whereas where they accepted cuc the shelves were much better stocked. We visited a family who lived in an apartment that was literally falling down around them. One half of the roof had caved in and the bed was under the part of the roof that was still remaining.. They knew they were going to get a tip but they didn’t make us feel obligated to give and they gave us a genuine welcome Our guide explained that the Cubans could only travel on certain busses and taxis (don’t use cuc) and we’re not allowed. When we returned to the hotel our guide wouldn’t come past the reception area as she said she wasn’t allowed., even with us. BUT, despite all this they are really lovely, happy people.We went to a bar near the hotel called Montserrat. It’s just up the road from La Floridita and great for people watching and is very lively. We also got a good mojito here – considering it’s a ‘national’ drink you can’t always guarantee a good one. We didn’t bother going into any of the ‘Hemmingway’ bars.We took a couple of extra bars of soap and some vitamins but obviously you can’t just hand them out to anyone however every morning we would say hello to the old guy outside the hotel selling newspapers and gave them to him, letting him think we were going home (they may not have much but they are still proud), and he was really pleased. I’d also taken some gloves for the gardeners at the hotel in Varadero but I wish I’d given them to the street cleaner in Havana as they didn’t really seem to want the gloves (we had visions of them opening a cupboard full of gloves and trying to close the door before they all fell out) and they never wore any the whole time we were there.Check-out of the hotel was quick and the taxi to take us to the Sandals Hicacos, Varadero was bang on time...Summary: We loved what we saw of Cuba but personally think that a stay in Havana is a must. It’s exactly what we expected from a Caribbean island; very happy, friendly people with music everywhere. We had a great time and would recommend it."
50,“havana cuba”,"W hat a beautiful city, full of charm and its like stepping back in time, the buliding are dated from the late 15th century till late 19th..I have never seen such beautiful buildings.Un fortunaltly they are in such need for renovation and with the trade embargo with usa it will take many years to achive.Along the seafront going towards malcone they have started to clean all the buildings up and in old havana...Infact anywhere that tourists can go...The cubans that live outside the tourist areas there houses, are in need of repair and goverment dont wish you to see that...they warn you not to go outside the tourist areas but we did on a daily basis and this is where you see the real havana and all its beauty.The people are very warm and police are every 100yards...socialist country ....there are many that will try and scam you but thats the same for most countries...id say if people address you ....hello my friend, where are you from they usually want something ..just dont be flash with your cash , where expensive jewlerly ..infact try not to stick out like a tourist normally does.They are poor people and a chance to get money can overwhelme the nicest of people..visit the churches local sports grounds and local cafes away from the tourist traps and youll be rewarded...havana city is stunning..."
10,“Corrupted Cuba”,"I went to Cuba with my American born niece looking for our roots. We arrived at Jose Marti Airport on 1/14/11. Going to luggage pick up we were asked for a bribe. We gave 10$. At c;ustoms, the lady told us that we should put our luggage together so we should not have to pay extra. We were carrying personal belongings and were not overweight in them. She asked that a gratuity be given to a lady on the other side since she was being monitored. Also she said that I should say we were married. Trying to cash travellers checks was not possible at the airport. My signature did not exactly match my Passport signature. I tried to get someone to override that. After the third attempt at the International Bank in Av Allende, I was fed up with the system, we realized that our roots were ROTTEN. Went to the airport and grabbed a return flight the next morning. The Convent of Santa Brigida was awsome. The sisters were very kind. I would recommed it to anyone who can put up with the corruption."
50,“A brilliant place for music”,"We visited Havanna in November of 2010 and would recomend it for a unforgetable experience, I did my homework and bought the books to visit the sights as we only had 4 nights there. First of all we stayed at the Hotel National de Cuba and it is a must see place. built in the 1930s it still had the charm and elegance even though the only time it got quiet was at 6am in morning . we stayed in a themed room on the second floor which was Eva Gardners room. It had photos on the wall of her and Frank Sinatra and a framed dress of hers which looked realy small. There is a bar on the ground floor which had photos on the wall of all the famous people that have stayed in the hotel . The hotel tour was very interesting. i particulary liked going in the tunnel in the grounds which were used in the missile crisis. I was surprised Havanna was so big so we opted a lot for coco taxis at 5 pesos a time. The walks we did were around Verdado which took in Presidents Avenue and Coppelia ice cream parlour and the beautiful Jose Marti memorial. Presidents Avenue was as it suggests with busts of different people along a tree lined avenue but the architecture on the buildings you pass is divine. Apparently this used to be a wealthy area and you could picture it from times past. Now most of the buildings have been turned into schools and colleges, The Jose Marti Memorial gives you a good panaramic view of the city and there is a meseum on the groung floor.It was air conditioned so a welcome rest from the midday heat. The people were quite friendly but make sure you dont get into deep conversation as they will expect you to give them money for informal tours. We were told before we went to take toiletries and things we take for granted as they are very poor and are very grateful for little gifts. The main square was hussle bustle so watch your bags. We were disappointed not to see inside the Capitol building as they were doing renovations at the time. Two things you must do while there is walk along the Malecon and visit to El Floridita on calle Obispo. Walking along the Malecon with the sea air in your face and stopping to see the young cubanos diving for there food in the deep water is realy exilarating. El Floridita is a restaurant and bar made famous by Ernest Hemingway. we arrived with a live band playing latin tunes and stayed for a daiquiri or two. the atmosphere was lovely. We also visited the Museum of Revolution which sort of turned my stomach seeing photos of dead people displayed in cases. The building is a former palace so some of the rooms are good to see and the exhibits outside which are relics from the struggle are interesting. I particilary liked the wreckage of An American plane shot down and the story of the pilot which the americans refused to aknowledge existed for years. we saw the square in the old part of town with the San Cristobal Cathedral which was beautiful and as with everywhere in Havanna there was a street band playing latin sounds. Dont forget to get your Cuban rum before you leave as it is to die for. I would pleased to give information or maps of the city to who is lucky enough to visit."
50,“The most romantic city I've ever visited.”,"The most romantic city I've ever visited. Plaza Vieja at dusk is magnificent. Gorgeous 17th and 18th century architecture, kids playing soccer, sidewalk cafes and wonderfully friendly people."
50,“Havana a city of music and friendly people”,"Having just returned from Havana , it is great to say that it was everything and more that I had hoped for.The music was incredible with such talented artists in every bar and music resounding from every house. The people were lovely and welcoming and even the Jinterearas or hustlers of which I encountered only one in the week there were happy to accept a firm but polite no!!The food although not very exciting was ample and tasty and the famed Mojito was well made and very cheap!It was sad to see the beautiful buildings decaying and crumbling around you and the living conditions for some were very poor.I think this is a city that everyone should check out before it gets opened up to the ways of the western world as it inevitably will.Most of the museums and monuments are worth a look but unless you read and talk spanish information is not provided. It is well worth swatting up before you head off. Take some bars of soap with you to hand out to the local people as it is expensive and hard for them to get hold of, I also took along some pencils and pens and people were really delighted to recieve them.The open top city tour is worth it for the drive through the city but this provides no insite at all to the city and could do with some informative guides. By far the best experience was in an open top cadilliac and the local driver was full of information about the city and the culture. There has been lots of work in the old town and it is really getting geared up for the tourist trade but the bars associtaed with Hemingway were by far the worst for service excetra every thing you would expect from a tourist trap. The main thing to remember is you are a tourist and although there are two currencies chances are you will only ever encounter the convertible peso."
20,“The reality of Havana”,"After spending the day in Havana we were disappointed to see that in reality Cuba is basically a 3rd world country, dirty, and lots of beggars on the street and the people have nothing."
50,“Well worthy”,"Beautiful Habana. You should go to HAV at least once in your life. Beautiful city, really nice and friendly people, lovely food and fantastic weather.One more thing: La Habana is not in North America, is part of the Caribbean Islands. That is not North America, they wish."
30,“Havana is tale.”,"The old Havana is a beautiful city. Many old biuldings, museums.The main street is Malecon. Many people walking here."
40,"“Do yourself a favour, go and see Havana.”","Let me start by saying that there seems to be a lot of misinformation about Cuba. We just got back after spending a week in Havana with a side-trip to Trinidad and we really enjoyed it. A few points to consider if you are thinking of travelling there:1. the food is fine, remember they are Cuban, not Spanish or French so don't expect anything other than Cuban food and you won't have a problem. One of the joys of travelling is experiencing the people, their customs and their food. Cubans are happy, outgoing people who love their music, their rum, their mojitos and they have food to match. Like you, we have also had some pretty ordinary food in Spain and Italy, the same can happen in Cuba.2. the currency situation is annoying, but you can exchange currencies and use visa cards -just check the restrictions for American or other cards and money, but there is plenty of information about that.3. you will need to organise travel insurance to get in, again, check this thoroughly as there are problems with American insurance companies -but again, you can take out local insurance at the airport when you arrive if you forget.4. there is toilet paper - you don't have to bring it unless you are super-sensitive.So, my advice, go and see for yourself. Sure, there are decayed buildings, basic and damaged infrastructure - and plenty of it, but there are renovated areas which are great - remember, you will see this in many places around the world.Cubans are very open, happy, intelligent people, they are fun. Cuba is a very economical destination -don't just go there for that reason, but go with your eyes open and realise you are the visitor there and enjoy the experience."
50,“Amazing”,"I've been in Havana when we were with friends in Varadero on our holidays.We rent a car and we went to see this city..First thing we saw was Malecon - street on the see side that everyone who saw a Buena Vista Social Club know.Then we left our cars and take the Coco Taxi to go to the center of the city - watch out!!! Becouse the drivers of this ""cars"" are trying to cheat you and they ""don't have change to give you the rest of money""...We get the horse coach tour and it was great...the guide knew English very well, he was funny and knew very many facts about the city :) If you would like to see the city and many interesting places in few hours, I reccomend you this!A city is very old, very many people are there, a lot of strange cars (also renewd by themselfes ).If you will have opportunity to be there, GO! And see this great city :)"
50,"“Fantastic, by far the best holiday to date!”","Arrived in Havana after a great flight with Thomsons and stayed in NH Central Parque, this was by far the best in Old Town Havana.Please be warned, Havana is a massive culture shock, buildings are tired and worn and the locals are hanging around the streets everywhere in abudance. We felt very intimidated and cautious. A massive tip, dress down day and night, definitely not a place to dress up.It took a couple of days to adapt the city and after that there was no stopping us!!! We were now totally in the spirit of Havana and its people. Music, food, atmosphere wow! Made lots of friends in our hotel and had many a great night in local bars.We managed to speak to a few locals, this is not easy, apparently 10 years ago all none tourist working cubans were prohibited from talking to tourists, 2 years ago this was lifted but the effects are still apparent. This then dawned on us why we original felt intimadated. We were told that if the police spotted this kind of socialising then they would be arrested after the tourist had left and questioned for 2hrs believing they have tried to commit an offence, crazy! We then did notice that the police were constantly checking the locals for their identity.Please take any, and I mean any items that you no longer need - from clothes, medication, baby milk, make-up, perfume etc. Next time were going to take a suitcase full. We discreetly tipped lots of people, staff, people in the street etc. You wont believe how the children make makeshift skateboards and toys. We are so very touched by the happiness of the people, even with such little they have a massive family togetherness that many of us have lost.Food, please dont be put off by the appearance of restaurants, we never once had a bad meal, infact the food in havana was of standards and quality better than most top ones in the UK.LOS NARDOS - yes in capitals, this is a must. Directly opposite the Capitol building a very short walk from our hotel. You will easily miss it as its a small door way leading up to stairs, Mostly always a queue but in the week if you get there for 12 you wont have to wait, if you do its so worth it. Los Nardos is the first on the left, entrance very dirty and un-attractive, turn the corner and you'd think you were in Italy, grand Piano playing and candel lit. Try the steak, works out to be about £10, would pay £50 at least at home, a total gem! Dont let anyone tell you its closed, this seems to happen alot. We ate and drank like kings and still only come to about £22 gift! Bus tour is a brilliant and cheap way to see the sights, I didn't fancy the horse & carriage, felt too sorry for the horses!! Cant wait to return."
50,“Casa's in Cuba and Havana on the internet..great site!”,"I just returned from Cuba. We have stayed some days in Havana and traveled around with a rental car.The Casa system is great. I can really advise people not to stay in hotels, but pick out the Casa Particulares. They are relatively cheap and the hospitality is overwhelming most of the time.We booked a casa in Havana in advance when we were still in the Netherlands, because of Cuban custom regulations. I found one a great website that really helped us:http://www.casaparticularcuba.orgLeo, the guy that replies your mails is a good help when you are in the booking process. He also speaks English. He booked our first casa in Havana: Casa Isabellita Balcones. This casa was really clean en really nice located. Isabel is also a very good host and makes nice breakfasts! The location (right next to the Prado) was good as well. Very classy house!The website also has other casa's in other parts of the country. You can get a list when when you are there with all their points of contacts in the whole of Cuba. We used the list to find a casa in Playa Larga, where we stayed at Casa Marieta. This casa is right next to the beach and was a pleasant stay as well. Marieta is so nice, I almost forgot I could not speak Spanish. My friends stayed in a casa next to to hers (Susurro del Mar), we were a party of 4, where we had a fantastic diner! I can recommend to stay in either of these houses. They are on the website as well.If I ever go back to Cuba, I would definitely contact the website again. The service and the casa's are just great!"
10,“The worst excursion we have ever taken”,"We have just returned from a 2 weeks stay in Guardalavaca, Northern Cuba which was excellent. We did however make the BIG BIG mistake of booking a day trip to Havana through First choice and Cuba tours (which is run by the Cuban Government). What a waste of money for an expensive trip it was by far the worst, save your money stay on the beach and enjoy!!!! The guide was more interested on taking the tour to his local tabacconist / rum merchant for his cut (about 15%) than actually conducting the tour which was also cut short for no reason resulting in over 3 hrs in the airport waiting lounge for a domestic fight. reported the problems to our rep at the hotel who was nothing if not dismissive.After several discussions with him the best he could do was speak to the tour guide who disagreed with our report, so we were effectively accused of lying. This was eventually confirmed by another family who had also complained from another hotel and we were given a form to bring back to fight it out in the UK. Guess how far that got !!!!!"
50,“What an experience”,"We have just arrived home, having spent 3 amazing days in Havana. We stayed at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba which I have reviewed separately. We had a brilliant guide named Dania - she was so helpful to us. She brought us on a walking tour of Old Havana on Day 1 and on a wider trip on Day 2 with a private driver. We did all the touristy things which was very informative but what I loved about Dania was - she brought us places we never would have found on our own. For that here services were priceless - from getting us a table at 1pm on Sunday in Los Nardos and interpreting the Spanish menu, bringing us to a local 'supermarket' for water/soft drinks etc. She brought us on local buses and taxis. She sweet talked her way into so many out of the way places - we were cringing - but so grateful in the end. We asked to see a little of local life - we had such an eye opener. Dania brought us down back alleys, up flights of rickety stairs and through corridors barely wide enough to squeeze through. Here we were taken into rooms with no ceilings (in many cases) where whole families lived. It was shocking and sad to say the least. In one of these houses the lady kissed us and the man took off his hat to us. Dania explained they love to meet people espcially tourists. We were so moved. I really dont think I will take anything for granted again. An old cliche - but they had nothing and I mean nothing - yet the greeted us with such warmth.I have reviewed the restaurants/paladres we visited separately.There was a carnival ongoing when we arrived - it was breathtaking to hear the wonderful music and watch thousands of people dancing in the streets. We never once feel threatened of in danger. We knew people were out with family - enjoying life.Dania also brought us to an Art flea market. We bought so many pieces directly fro the artists. Prices varied - but I feel we got such good value for original pieces. They also did souveniers/t shirts, jewellery at good prices.I am harping on so much about the warmth and hospitality we were shown so much through out our holiday - I must be driving people mad!!!! Just a couple of practical examples - our guide - Dania, came to our hotel the night we left with a gift -a CD of Benny More - because I mentioned to her I loved a song I heard playing in a shop one of the days. Our son stepped on a concrete grate on the ground on our last day and it collapsed into what looked like sewage. Needless to say his shoes/clothes and leg was in a terrible mess. He wasnt hurt badly - just shaken and embarrased. People could not do enough for us - they gave us tissues, water and offered to go and get us ice. Amazing genuine concern for complete strangers.People asked us to buy items etc - sometimes we did - but when we said no - they wished us a happy holiday and went on their way.We adored Havana for her wonderful people. We had some great experiences - brilliant sights, fab art work, good music, surprisingly good food and super cocktails. It was however, a city of 2 halves - the rhythm, old grandeur, colour and beauty. There was also the deplorable living conditions - steps away from 5 star luxury and the magnificent architecture - crumbling away in front of our eyes - and we can do nothing to stop it."
50,“Spent a great week in Havana”,"Just got back from a week in Havana. I wanted to pass some things on to other people traveling there. My wife and I stayed mostly in small Band B places. 3 days in one that was actually a complete house, 2 bed bath kitchen with beer wine water already in place. $65 per night, plus for $6 more each the maid came in and cooked us whatever we wanted for breakfast. Another 1 bedroom/bath apt in a Band B that was only $35/night, plus breakfast for $6. These places are certified by Qban government and are clean, friendly, plus the locals can really give great advice. We stayed at the Park View Hotel near Old Havana for $80/ night and found it a bit run down. Breakfast is included but was some leftover spaghetti and meat with some undercooked eggs.Had a great time going to the show at the Havana Club Rum Museum in Old Havana just off the harbor. The show runs nightly and the music was incredible but it was really hot in there so wear something light.Just wondering around Old Havana at night, eating good food, drinking great rum, good beer, and seeing all the old well preserved hotels was nice.If you want to get some really cheap entertainment, buy a bottle rum and hang out on the sea wall on the Malecon until the wee hours just people watching.Change your money at the airport on arrival. You will be using the CUC which is you only get .80. The euro gets about 33% more. The Cuban people are friendly nice energetic people. They really like tourists, treated me as an American very well. Have fun."
20,“Overnight Excursion from Varadero”,"I should say that I have never been to a country like Cuba before, and generally holiday in western countries, so this was an eye opener for me!I didn't particularly enjoy my trip to Havana. I didn't feel that safe when walking around and I thought that it was quite dirty in places.We went as part of an overnight excursion from our main hotel in Varadero, which is about a 2 hour coach drive away. On our first day we were taken around and shown some of the sights of the city which was great, although I felt that after this there wasn't much else to see.In the evening we went to Club Tropicana which was very enjoyable, although we did get rather drunk, but is still well worth a visit!The second day we were left on our own to wander as we wished. We ended up sitting on a roof top bar for most of the day.We visited a small cafe looking for something to eat and only found out after the meal that they had no running water. We were wondering how they were cleaning up!I would say that Havana is worth visiting although I will probably never go back again."
30,“Things you should take to Havana”,"Havana is a fantastic city with immense cultural and political depth. As you are well aware, Cuba's political and economic system has resulted in locals being deprived of minor things such as soap and pencils. Can I suggest that you pass by a dollar store and stock up on small items like soap, cheap watches, toys, pens, pencils, etc etc. Hand them to the locals and make a contribution to the people. The best thing you could ever do is pull out an old GSM phone (unblocked) you have sitting in a back drawer hand them the phone and help them get started with a simple cheap local sim card. This is all above board and ligitimate. Other things you could do to help Cubans is listed on the following internet site desdecuba.com this site will give you a very good idea as to the reality of living in Cuba and how you can make it just that bit better."
40,“Cuban hospitality”,"Cuba is a place Canadians can call their 2nd home. I just want to say I never felt so welcome in another country then when I went to Cuba. Canadian are usually liked anywhere in a forign country unless your in the U.S.A But let me tell you I have never seen any country treat you as well as they do in Cuba. From the minute you get off the Air plane the party begins. You Grab you lugage walk out the door and there's a guy waiting with beer the air port staff guide you to your tour bus and the bus takes you to your motel. Havana is a beautiful old city the people wo live there are amazing. My friend and I took lots of gifts for the children that we baught at the dollar store. The children were so greatfull. We met a Cuban couple who invited to stay at their home so we could see more of havana. Our hotel was in varedero. As little food and material things the cuban people have they are more then happy to share. Never in my life would I walk up to a forign person and ask them to come stay at my home. I don't mean that in a bad way I just mean I would never ask anyone I didn't know to spend the night at my home. The best thing about cuba is everyone looks out for the canadians. We lost money (because we got drunk and gave it away) We didn't have a way to get back to our hotel. So the only thing we could do is hitch hike. I had a sweater with the Canadian flag on it. No word of a lie I held it up less then a minute later a bus pulled over. In broken english the driver said are you Canadian We said SI SENOIR we lost all our money He said no problem hop in. The bus was completely packed with locals 10 of them stood up and offered their seat to us. This was a city bus the driver being so cconcerned about our safty drop us right off at the doors of our hotel, He said I know you have no pesos but can I have a Canadian beso (a kiss) We didn't have to kiss him he was only kidding but we giggles we humored him. Well thats my story of my day trip to havana"
50,“Havana: A Moving Feast”,"Havana: A Moving FeastColonial Treasures, Culture and PeopleBeckon Travelers to World Heritage CityPastor Valle-GaraySenior Scholar, York UniversityHavana is a veritable moving feast. Beautiful, friendly, engaging people. Magnificent modern and colonial buildings. Wonderful restaurants. Superb night life. A busy, busy, busy world-class city. Noisy as all hell. Delightfully noisy. Never annoyingly so but rather noisy with the contagious rhythm of the ever-present palm trees gently swaying to the pulsating beat of Havana's warm Caribbean breeze.Havana moves incessantly. With indescribable passion. Much like her sensuous music. In exhilarating sync with the horns of vintage automobiles. In unison with dancing feet. In absolute harmony with the megawatt smiles of her delightful school children.Founded in 1519 Havana beckons locals and traveler alike. Incessantly. Lovingly. Havana seduces with her eyes. With her gestures. With her stunning sounds. With her astonishing culture. With her predilection for good rum, strong coffee and better cigars.Her love of ballet, jazz, baseball and rock concerts appears everywhere. Life-size bronze statues of famous musicians and personalities such as Mother Theresa, Antonio Gades, John Lennon or Compay Segundo dot the landscape. Theaters, stadiums, plazas and night clubs such as The Tropicana fill to capacity.In June 2010 members with the Canadian Ballet Youth Ensemble traveled to Cuba. Our group included Toronto Star respected art critic and raconteur Michael Crabb and Veronica Tennant, one of the most accomplished Prima Ballerina in the history of the National Ballet of Canada. Now a producer of film documentaries, Veronica directed Vida y Danza Cuba, a winner of international awards featuring Lizt Alfonso's Ballet Cuba.Naturally, our quest to research Havana's cultural offerings for small Canadian groups would take us to the studio of the world-famous Lizt Alfonso Ballet Cuba. We were not prepared however for the surprise that Lizt Alfonso, Ballet Cuba´s founder and choreographer, had for us. After a presentation illustrating the company's history Lizt invited us to watch a private, outstanding performance which combined elements of classic ballet, Spanish flamenco and modern dance. It was a memorable event, a unique showing of Havana's spontaneity and its great love of music at its very best.Later on the group went to Havana's magnificent Gran Teatro, founded in 1838. We attended the premiere of The Legend of Mighty Waters, a ballet inspired by Brazil's Iguazú Falls and brilliantly performed by the Cuban National Ballet, hailed by critics as one the best five ballet companies in the world. Every seat had been sold out for days. No one anticipated our second, mind-blowing surprise in one day: we were about to witness a heart-stopping manifestation of Cuba's raw affection for its living legend. The instant Cuban diva and Prima Ballerina Assoluta Alicia Alonso, the company's 90 years-old founder and artistic director, entered the theater the audience went absolutely wild. Ms. Alonso's presence was greeted with a deafening roar. The standing ovation and sustained applause transformed the evening into a magic journey.This is precisely how Havana brings joy to the eyes, to the ears, to every human sensation, to every human emotion. And Havana does it while coyly displaying her coquetry like nobody's business. She flirts with the ancient elegance of the nearly 500-year-old courtesan she truly is. With the passionate seduction of a modern, wily, bewitching female.Make no mistake about it: Havana is female. The feminine article in La Habana, her full name in Spanish, firmly establishes her gender. Havana is definitely, unapologetically female. Take a good long look at her winding streets. Adorned with exotic trees and brilliant flowers, the streets of Havana bend and twist at will. In sensuous compass. In voluptuous harmony with her colonial buildings. With a hint of a mischievous smile, Havana struts her stuff in deliberate, calculated, enticing abandon until it grabs your attention. Like so many free swinging hips moving rhythmicallyunder the stare of many a suffering mortal male watching the sensuous procession going by. See ... but don't touch, chico.Today Havana is truly a living metaphor of the legendary Phoenix. It proudly rises after years of economic hardship, human neglect and considerable damages by the elements and natural disasters. In 1962 UNESCO designated 444 of its buildings as World Heritage sites, and in 1982 UNESCO confirmed Havana as a World Heritage city. Ever since the city has been engaged in a most ambitious, careful and successful restoration of its treasured landmarks.Visitors may see the progress as they leisurely stroll through Old Havana's living, unparalleled wealth of historical sites. Where else would you find a venerable Rum Museum, an astonishing replica of Washington's Capitol building, built in 1929 and housing today Cuba's National Museum, the imposing 18th century baroque Cathedral of Havana and, just steps down the road, The Floridita and the Bodeguita del Medio, lively bars where American writer Ernest Heminghway held court and immortalized Cuba's daiquiris and mojitos?This is noisy, intoxicating, eternal Havana, a love affair constantly in the making. A city of engaging, friendly people, astonishing cultural sites, art and crafts centers and a treasured trove of architectural wonders best enjoyed when walking.Our group took a strolling tour of the extraordinary sights and sounds of Old Havana. It was an unforgettable day. Without exceptions, all the Canadians -experienced world travelers- were bewitched by Old Havana's colonial beauty. They fell in love with the city. They plan to return. Everyone agreed that charming Havana is worth repeat trips. Everyone agreed that on their next visit they would need sensible, comfortable shoes. Havana is a seductive, walking city but your feet definitely deserve a break."
10,“Travelllers beware”,"Any Travel Insurance you have will be completely cancelled if you go to Cuba. Before and after the fact.Call your provider. Any affiliation with the US, and you're out of luck. They'll even check your credit card report to know where you've spent your money. My claim just got denied because a spent a week there while travelling the Caribbean for 2 months... pretty pissed..."
50,"“Havana, not expected”","Me and my wife were told all the usual horror stories about Havana but chose to ignore them, thank goodness we did.All Cuban's earn 10 Pesos a month, this equates to approx £8.00.All Cuban's have a ration book so are rationed when the food is available.The beggars are not lazy, work shy people, they are struggling as are all Cuban's and tips go a long way to easing the suffering.That said a few rules apply, don't eat out, the toilet will become your best friend, sorry but I am being honest.Agree a total price for everything before getting into a taxi or on a horse drawn carraige, when the driver say's 25 Pesos he means 25 Pesos per hour but will not inform you of this and the carraige ride will last a little over an hour.Take no notice of so called NO GO areas, me and the wife wandered around every night in the so called no go areas and were met with nothing more than enthusiastic people wanting to know what we thought of their country and felt perfectly safe at all times.Havana was a massive culture shock for me, the happy go lucky people on one hand then the empty food shops and housing standards on the other, I will go back and hope that things have changed for such a lovely people."
50,"“The Beautiful City of Havana, Cuba - You must see it !!!”","We live in Nova Scotia, Canada and it has long been a dream to visit the island of Cuba and especially the city of Havana.My sister, my husband and myself just returned from a one week vacation in Veradero where we stayed in one of the many beach resorts.It was great. The weather was wonderful and the sea was a very comfortable +28 C degrees...what more could you ask for? The sunsets at dusk were spectacular.After a few days in the sun we decided we had to see Havana. Over the years I had heard from others that the beautiful city was slowly crumbling and had not been well maintained.Well it came as a complete surprise to me - the city is BEAUTIFUL and work is being carried out on a daily basis. What a wonderful safe city and the people are overly friendly and happy to see you. They all try to speak to you in English. I loved every second roaming the narrow streets of Old Havana. I have to apologize to our wonderful and charming guide Carlos who works for Transtur Tours. While Carlos detailed the history of many of the famous buildings, hotels, statues and churches. I did not listen because I was too busy taking photos. I tried to capture as much as possible in a short time. My six hours in Havana has made me realize that I have to go back. I am already looking on the internet at small hotels in Old Havana and ways to travel to the nearby beaches which are only 15 minutes from the city. I think Havana offers the best of both worlds, the busy city life, the peaceful old city life and beautiful beaches a short drive away.This is the place for me. It is a photographer's dream. So I am sorry to say I cannot tell you too much about the history of Havana but I do know that there are 2.4 million inhabitants living there and it is the largest city in Cuba. The city has a magnificent fortress which is steeped in history and was built hundreds of years ago to keep the city safe from pirates, buccaneers and French corsairs. The Presidential Palace is now a wonderful museum which is closed on Mondays. Near the waterfront there is a huge market selling an interesting variety of handcrafts, sewing, paintings, pottery and jewellery. A wonderful place to buy your souvenirs.When you arrive in Havana you are greeted by a number of beautiful women dressed in typical Caribbean costumes and they are willing to have photos taken for a peso or two. The local people provide wonderful ideas for photos and for me it was a great opportunity and a chance to help the local economy. I am always willing to pay for that ""perfect"" photo. It does not bother me to contribute to the local people which makes their life better and my collection of photos more interesting. Scenery and old buildings are great but it is the people of the country who remain in your memory. I try to capture as many as I can. The Cuban people are very attractive and make wonderful subjects for photos.The tiny shops along the narrow streets in Old Havana are worth exploring and make sure you visit the beautiful churches. Old Havana reminds me of the wonderful Mexican city of Merida in the Yucatan Peninsula and also the Colombian city of Cartagena. All three are Spanish Colonial cities and could very easily be sister cities.My advice is to visit Havana and see for yourself the beauty of the old city as well as the busy new city. Both areas have so much to offer. Relax in the beautiful parks, enjoy a cold beer in the many outside cafes and taste some delicious Cuban food...it is worth it and it will certainly make your trip worthwhile with lots of wonderful memories.Take a day away from the beach and sun and visit Havana you will be nicely surprised. Make sure you go to the roof top bar in the hotel Saint Isabel. The view up there is fantastic, the beer is cold and the staff is great.I am already making plans to go back and this time it will not be so rushed. I plan to spend five or six days exploring every nook and cranny of beautiful Havana. Thanks Carlos for a wonderful day and a great tour. You were super.Adios Amigo"
20,“Havana for Comfortable Yuppies”,"In planning my recent (April 2010) trip to Cuba, I spent a lot of time on these boards, and gleaned a lot of useful information. Many travellers post about the amazing sights and experiences they have in Havana. With this in mind, I looked forward to my trip eagerly, and had a whole list of things I was dying to do.Now I'm home, and feel compelled to take a different tact in my review. Please read on if:1) You are past backpack travel2) You are used to a comfortable life in CanadaA few lines of background: we spent a first week at an all inclusive in Varadero, then on to Havana to stay for four days. My husband and I are both Canadians in our early thirties, with limited Spanish. I have done a fair bit of travelling, albeit in my teens and twenties.We booked a Casa Particular (Casa Valdez, on Habana Street) for our time in the city. When we checked in the room seemed alright; but then noted that we could clearly feel the wood of the bed through the mattress, the air conditioning didn't work, and it was noisy. All night we heard loud arguments, and yelling from the street. I heard a woman screaming. Besides which, the room had mold; by the morning, I was having trouble breathing. We checked out early, and tried to find a hotel. We found out later that, despite booking through a seemingly legit website, this was an illegal Casa. Watch for that, as they aren't regulated the way sanctioned ones are.That night it rained. Walking through the streets later, we noted large pools of open sewage, everywhere. Maybe the rain caused things to overflow.Walking around (now wet and literally poopy) we found that many of the hotels were quite expensive. You can expect to pay between $120 and 300 CUC's per night to stay in downtown Havana, where we were. This was a jump from our $30 peso a night Casa!So, we went for the $120 per night room.The hotel we stayed at was the Plaza Hotel; a quite beautiful, historic building. After checking in, we tried to have a shower; no hot water. We called down, and were advised that they would turn it on for us. So, unless you ask, I guess you don't get hot water?No complaints about the hotel, otherwise; except that a server in the restaurant conned us into double tipping (he added 10% to each item on the receipt, then asked for an additional tip on top), and again the mold. I think it being a warm, humid environment, coupled with the fact that these were very old buildings, makes mold inevitable. We both were having trouble with congestion and breathing, and my eyes were almost swollen shut one morning.But, we're here to make the most of it. On we go, to see the city.A few things struck us. Firstly, everywhere we went, someone was either trying to sell us cigars, or ask us outright for money. We are of course polite Canadians, and tell them that we aren't interested. They follow, and keep asking. At one point we had about five Cubans with us trying to sell cigars. Everywhere you go, ""do you want to buy a cigar..."".Secondly, as a blonde haired young woman, I found the male attention quite trying. I came to resent the fact that I could not go anywhere without my husband. And, like the cigar pushers, they are quite persistant. It was incredible. We thought that if we put a blonde wig on my husband (to go with his 5 o'clock shadow) that he would probably get the same attention. Hey mamasita....Also, as an animal lover, I found the street dogs disturbing. I know I shouldn't have for probably very good reasons, but I would carry buns in my purse to give to them. Most were skin and bones, and many had open, raw lesions.There were a few things we really enjoyed seeing; the Tobacco Factory (recommend it, very interesting) and the Museo de Revolucion (which was creepy to our Can way of thinking, with some wickedly blatant communist brainwashing, hence very cool).Other things on my list, however, we did not do or see because frankly, we didn't feel comfortable venturing too far off the tourist track. You read in travel books that Cuba is one of the safest coutries in the Caribbean, and other travellers post on these forums how safe they felt in Havana. We didn't feel safe. We felt like we had targets on our backs as foreigners; pester us for money, or try to sell us cigars, or yell crassly to me as a woman. Walking a block over from the main tourist square, we had a group of young guys tell us that the area was for Cubans only and that we should leave.I know very well that you don't travel to find things like they are at home. I also know that Cubans have a very different way of life than we have in Canada. I have come to realize that on the surface of it I am very lucky to be Canadian.I write this review in an attempt to balance some of the other postings here. In all, we did enjoy ourselves. Some of the more minor things (like going to a restaurant and trying to order from a two page menu only to be told that they only actually have three things to choose from) were just funny. It wasn't what we expected; perhaps by sharing some of our experience future travellers may make a more informed choices than we did."
50,“Snowbirds in Havana”,"We tried something different this winter. Instead of all the hassle and cold weather of Florida we to Havana for six weeks. What an eye-opener. Free jazz concerts, museums, art exhibitions, plenty of good food and low prices, we couldn't gert enough of it. And what made it really cheap was staying in one of the family owned Casa Particulars. We heard about them on www.suitecuba.com, where they have pictures of the apartments for rent asnd you can e-mail them to get all the details. We booked from Toronto and didn't even have to send a deposit."
30,“What's all the fuss about?”,"Everyone says 'You must visit Cuba before it's too late' in my view it already is. 100 - 150 years of neglect have destroyed a city that must have rivalled the most beautiful in the world during its hayday. Sure there are remnants of the beautiful architecture but most of it has either collapsed or in imminent danger of doing so. The people for the most part look downcast and because of the political regime lack any incentive to work for their greater personal benefit. I saw the same symptoms in Eastern Europe under communism and Cuba is suffering from the same stultifying atmosphere of decay and apathy. Yes, I'm glad I visited but frankly just one day in Havana was sufficient to see what was worth seeing - four days was far too long to hold my interest and I couldn't wait to get out of the place and explore further afield - particularly the countryside which is beautiful. Would I go back to Cuba? Yes, but only for an R&R holiday at one on the beautiful beach locations well away from Varradero!"
40,"“Tropical Breezes, Winding Passageways”","There is no doubt about it. There definitely is a 1950s feel to much of Havana. Not just the ’54 Chevy’s, but also the big concrete block apartments, the furnishings, and the plastic ornaments. One has a sense that change has not been hurried, and indeed has been slow in coming. But this is not necessarily a bad thing, especially when considering the artificial atmosphere in many other popular travel destinations.During our pedestrian tour of the city, my wife and I saw some impressively restored architecture, but also narrow streets and alleyways with dirt splattered concrete walls, faded laundry strung between buildings, and with ragged kids playing soccer anywhere they could find enough room. Some of the confined and dim streets looked like old photographs, from which the color was washing out. Much of old Havana is in a state of elegant decay; its once stately eighteenth and nineteenth century townhouses now biding their time, until funds are available for a facelift.But the enterprising residents of Havana make do. Some, like our hosts, Luis and Fefita, run Casa Particulars, renting out rooms to visitors for a modest price. Others sell pizza or sandwiches, or ice cream to passers by from a window in their home. These businesses are all family run. In fact, that’s the law: no one but the state may hire employees in Cuba. And music is easy to find, in cafes, bars, and even just on street corners.We stayed with Luis and Fefita in their highrise apartment, overlooking Havana harbour. This is a walking city, and we had an ideal location to explore it from, near the corner of the Prado and the Malicon, two major streets in the central part of the old city. For a very reasonable price of 30 CUC per night, we had a room with two beds and an attached bathroom. Breakfast (5CUC) included lots of fresh fruit and bread, and usually a kind of potato omelet, which was very good. Coffee, as one might expect, is generally excellent in Cuba. However, Cubans have not yet been infected by the Starbucks habit, and coffee is served ‘50s style. Small cups for regular coffee, and micro cups for expresso: hardly a tease for North Americans whose body fluids are probably 5% caffeine after all those grande size takeouts.Speaking of takeouts, that is what a lot of Cubans do- take out food from shop windows, or little kiosks in the city. Eating seems to be an unpretentious affair, not something to be made a big fuss over. We tried a few takeouts (less than one CUC each), but also a bit in the way of formal dining. I say a bit, because we suffered a bought of “tourista”, which featured 24 hours of fever and vomiting before the bugs decided they had had enough of our G.I. tracts, and moved on to greener pastures. We are usually pretty wary about these kinds of things, but in Havana just plunged in and decided to drink the tap water. After hearing so much about the Cuban medical system, I thought this would be ok. Later we heard mixed opinions from locals about the wisdom of this.The Restaurante Europa had a limited menu, but what they had was quite nice. We had a chicken dish, washed down with “Crystal”, the local beer (under 10CUC each). We also had a good meal at the Al Medina, a Middle Eastern restaurant run by, as a sign pointed out, Lebanese and Palestinians. The lamb and rice dish was a little small, but the price was very reasonable, and the quantity plenty at that point for our bug insulted stomachs. Despite being trashed by the Lonely Planet, we stopped and had an appetizer at the La Mina, and it was very good. This is an excellent place for people watching as its outdoor seating faces onto the Plaza de Armas. Here you will see Cuban families out for the day, old retirees with their red-starred berets sitting and reminiscing, school kids with their color coded uniforms on outings, working people with briefcases, entrepreneurs selling books and memorabilia, and sweating packs of gringos following tour guides. Unfortunately, you will also find beggars.In a country that seems to try for a level playing field, I was a little surprised by this. The begging took several forms. For some of the elderly and handicapped, it was a straightforward request for money. Others had lines that were hard to ignore (senior, milk for my baby!) Some were oblique, but methodical (hey, you from Canada, you come in here and buy beer!) Others were a little more creative. A man came up to our table while we were eating, and silently extended his arm and opened his hand, palm facing us. On it was written, “Dollars”. It was a request, not an impromptu abstract art show.Cuba, which has tried to eliminate social classes, seems to have fallen back into having them. There are essentially two monetary systems now, the new peso one (the CUC, roughly equivalent to the US dollar), and the old peso one, worth much less. There is a huge disparity between those who make the new currency, and those earning the old. I got the sense that this is causing friction. The gulf is so wide that the few new pesos one might get from tourists can make a huge difference to ones financial well being, and hence is causing some animosity and social disruption.Havana is being gradually restored, but money is and issue. A cut from tourist revenue goes into the project, and grants from other countries make up most of the rest. The government seems to be trying to avoid making the place one big tourist trap. Many locals live in the restored buildings in old Havana. Above or behind the showy restaurants and hotels, you are likely to find a school, old folks home, hospital, or some family’s residence. Housing is assigned or traded in Cuba, so money is not a big issue. The restoration project integrates, and benefits the locals in Havana. I took a tour with the San Cristobol travel agency (10CUC) that looked at some of these projects.Getting around is easy, especially if you like to walk. The historic narrow passageways and streets are ideal for the pedestrian, not to mention the photographer. There is fairly new “hop on, hop off” bus system (5CUC-good for the day) that will take you all around the city, and as far as Playa del Este, the beaches about 18k east of Havana, where you can escape for a swim. Taxis aren’t bad for a short haul at 1 CUC per kilometer. If you are used to driving in the third world, here is a pleasant surprise for you: Cuban drivers seem neither homicidal, nor suicidal. They slow down when there is danger ahead, and stop at crosswalks for pedestrians.One last note: keep an eye on the weather before you go. We had very pleasant weather, about 27-28c during the day, but in mid-winter temperatures can drop to a surprising extent. The week before we arrived they were having lows of 6c (about 43f). They get these cold snaps from time to time."
50,“You cannot go to Cuba without seeing Havana”,"Having never been to Cuba before, I had to make sure to set aside one day of my week long trip to go and see Havana. There are many ways to see Havana, however I chose what I considered to be the safest and greatest value and that was on an organized tour.Many will tell you that you can hire a driver to take you and pick you up at an agreed upon time and save a ton of money, however with a tour, you get a new air conditioned bus, a guide to explain everything and take you to places you may miss on your own. Lunch is also included and there is little risk of getting lost in a foreign city.In the morning we were taken to the Havana Rum Museum on the waterfront and learned about the process of making rum. Be sure to try the rum drinks they make in the atrium of the building. There is an extra cost associated with it but you will never taste anything like it again (not unless someone else will extract the liquid from raw sugar cane for you). The tour itself is interesting and educational and there is a free shot of rum at the end of the tour.From there we began our walking tour of Old Havana. Our tour guide Ray was very knowledgeable and informative. He explained a great deal about the history and details about the city and the Cuban people themselves.The city itself is interesting as it is being reconstructed. On one corner you will see a building dating back to the 1700s, yet fully restored as if it was built yesterday. Across the street there will be a similar building but beginning to crumble. Obviously there is a lot of work still to do to restore the city, however they have done a great job with what has been accomplished so far.Throughout the day you will be approached by people looking for money. As a tourist you will be a target for this (especially when in a tour group). Give or don't give, its up to you. My philosophy is that I will give when I see someone attempting to earn it such as a street performer or musician.I can't emphasize this enough, Ray made sure we saw as much of the city as possible. If I had been on my own, I might have walked past many of the items that Ray pointed out to us never having known to stop and take a look. We were then given an opportunity to do some shopping, buy cigars or rum, etc.Lunch was included in the tour and it was surprisingly good. You know what they say about Cuban food, well I expected a lot worse. The food is a little plain or perhaps bland. When you think Caribbean, you think spicy. Not so in Cuba. They are the opposite where everything tastes like it was simply cooked without any additional flavorings added.In the afternoon Ray had us all get back on the bus to see some parts of newer Havana. Of course one of the interesting things about new Havana is that it was new in 1958. Since then there has been very little added. Certainly nothing from the United States has made it's way here since that time. All the cars are either from Asia or Russia, or they are Classic 50s American cars.We drove by many of the Museums and historical displays that call Havana home. Although we didn't stop we did get to see a glass museum containing the ""Granma"", the boat that Fidel and his crew of revolutionaries crossed over from Mexico to Cuba at the start of the revolution. Outside the glass building are various vehicles from the revolution such as tanks and armored cars. There also is the fragments of an American spy plane that was shot down during the Cuban missile crisis.We next spent some time at ""El Capitolio"" and Parque Central (Central Park). We were given some free time to explore this area on our own and it was very interesting to see the contrasts. El Capitolio is architecturally similar to the Capitol building in Washington D.C.Next we were taken to Plaza de la Revolution (Revolution Square). There we saw Jose Marti monument that is one of the tallest structures in the city, the ministry of the Interior with the famous image of Che Guevara on the outside, similarly an image of Camilo Cienfuegos another important figure in the revolution adorns the Ministry of Informatics and Communications building.In the late afternoon we returned to old Havana to have one last look around and take some additional time to do some shopping. We stopped at Plaza de la Catedral (Cathedral Square). There are a few vendors here and a beautiful Cathedral. A perfect ending to a perfect day."
50,“Havana and Varadero in Cuba with Travelsphere - Fantastic!”,"If you’ve never thought of going to Cuba or been put off by depressing and gloomy comments, think again. For those who enjoy historical tradition at its best, with an under current of intrigue, Havana is a must see destination. We’ve just returned home after a seven night stay arranged by Travelsphere. Highly recommended. With three nights in Havana and four more on the beach at Varadero, a thirty two mile narrow pensular about two hours by coach from Havana, the holiday is designed as a taster and it certainly was.We flew out from London Gatwick with Virgin Atlantic, the only carrier to operate a twice weekly direct flight to Havana. The times were good (arround 11.45 in the morning), the flight was full (always a good sign) and the service excellent. Legroom is a little tight but you can always upgrade for £30 and get a little more space in which to stretch. November or December seemed a good time to go with the Caribbean Hurricane season behind us and we were looking forward to warm sunshine and clear blue skies. We in fact landed in a rain storm and made our way steadily through the chaos of Havana airport to board our coach for the thirty minute transfer to the National Hotel in the city. We did have to queue to pass through the immigration cubicles and the masked Cuban immigration staff were thorough and a little intimidating in their inspection process, each individual taking three or four minutes to pass in to the terminal to collect their bags. There were two separate baggage belts servicing our flight with no clear indication on which bags had been deposited on which belt. On top of this airport staff were unloading bags and piling them on any piece of floor that could be found. Confusion, but exciting in its own way.We spotted Maurine, our Travelsphere tour manager immediately and appreciated her warm and hectic welcome. We checked in with her and she pointed us in the direction of the money exchange desk and we queued to change our sterling cash into Pesos. The Cuban money system is a little confusing. There are convertible Pesos called CUC’s, purchased and used by tourists and Normal Pesos called (CUP’s) which are used by the locals in everyday life. You can only buy your Pesos when you arrive in Cuba, as the currency is not traded within the worlds markets. For a full explanation of the Cuban money check out Trip Advisor. So far so good. Yes a chaotic arrival – yes it was pouring – and yes we did get our bags - and yes we felt terrific. This was what we expected, a hectic arrival in to one of the busiest third world countries you can find on this earth and we got it.We transferred to the National Hotel De Cuba in heavy rain and in almost complete darkness, our headlights picking up shadowy images of locals huddled in a never ending stream under the shelter of roadside trees. There were thirty two of us in our group and there was soon an uncanny quiet, as we drove along unlit roads and junctions towards the hotel. But as soon as we arrived, the welcome was warm and the talk positive. “Don’t worry about the weather”, advised Maurine, as we stepped off the coach in to the rain and then up the covered staircase to the entrance door of the hotel. “The forecast is good for next few days... well not bad” she added as an afterthought and then went on quickly to say that this was the first rain they had had in weeks and we shouldn’t worry. Things change quickly in Cuba and we should be positive.The hotel was majestic and for a first visit to Havana, a truly memorable experience. It’s a grand old building with bags of history some eight floors high, its two towers a landmark for miles around. With its privileged location in the centre of Havana, it stands on a hill just a few meters from the sea, and offers a great view of the Harbour, the sea wall and the city. The entrance lobby is impressive, a long majestic affair scattered with old mahogany woodwork and layered with rich old ceramic floor tiles that reach along its distance and continue under a pair of heavy glass doors in to a fine Al a Carte dining room at the end of the hall. After checking in, the old lifts transferred us up to the third floor where we enjoyed a three night stay on a bed and breakfast basis in relative comfort. The room was large with a partial see view, the bathroom modern and adequate with bath and shower. Besides the Al a Carte Restaurant (a little too expensive for us) there was a buffet dining room serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and a separate cafeteria on the basement floor serving snacks and smaller dishes. The hotel bar was packed with pictures of celebrities of yesteryear with memorabilia and all sorts of fascinating trinkets of interest scattered around for guests to view. Most visitors though found their way to the long outside patio bar to the rear of the hotel where one could sit and sip cocktails in the warm night air listening to live music. If you are looking for western style five star comfort then you might well be a little disappointed, but the National Hotel De Cuba is more than acceptable for a comfortable stay, its old elegance and history continuously tugged at our emotions and added an extra excitement to our stay.Travel sphere had included a tour for our first of two full days in Havana and after a fully included breakfast in the hotel buffet restaurant we were ready for anything. Our first stop was at a cigar factory, located in a bland and aging ‘boxy’ three story building on the outskirts of the city. We crowded in to the Smokey atmosphere and watched as over two hundred ‘rollers’ – each one crammed in to their own tiny work space - were working tirelessly to produce high quality ‘Havana’ cigars. Rock and Cuban rhythm music burst in to the rooms from loud-speakers hung from the ceilings as the workers – mainly women – skilfully rolled their cigars amidst shouted banter and good humour. The leaves are first sorted and trimmed by hand on the ground floor then passed up to the rollers on the second. Finally the finished cigars are packed in boxes ready to travel the world. The only perk if you work there? You can smoke as many cigars as you like whilst you’re rolling. We saw security men with huge ash laden cigars, drifting around the passageways, keeping a close watch for any unauthorised sales.We moved on to Plaza de le Revolucion, a huge square where political rallies are held. A tall and magnificently elegant column , topped with a statue of Jose Marti - who became symbol for Cuba's bid for independence against Spain in the 19th century - stands proudly overlooking the square. Directly opposite him on the other side of the square, there is a large and imposing iron sculpture of Chay Mamara ‘fronting’ an old building. Several large grim blocks of apartments, which were constructed in the nineteen fifties to house military personnel and other loyal workers complete the picture. Oscar’s knowledge of the history of his home city was impressive. He gave us a running commentary from the time we left the hotel until he left us with Maurine in the old town some hours later.We re-boarded our coach and the driver dropped us off near the old city centre - the place to be. We immediately made our way to the Plaza de Armas, Havana’s oldest square and listened most intently to more of Oscar’s interesting chat about the old city, its recent history and its way of life. We strolled along the Calle Obispo which runs from The Plaza de Armes to Parque Central and soaked up the atmosphere. It is now a pedestrianised walkway and according to Maurine is always packed with locals, visitors and tourists and it certainly was when we ambled our way along its length. We spent the next couple hours visiting the Plaza de la Catedral, the Hotel Ambos Mundos (where Hemmingway penned most of 'For whom the bell tolls') and the Museo de la Revolucion as well as many other statues and historical buildings that passed us by as we browsed the city. We would recommend the reader to purchase the Berlitz pocket guide on Cuba as we did before travelling. The little guide gives many more details of places of interest as well as some history and interesting facts.Our included lunch was at the ‘el patio’ on the Plaza de la Catedral and it was excellent. We were served three courses and wine on small groups of eight or ten to a table. The patio was decorated with plants and palms and the clear blue sky formed a perfect ceiling to a perfect lunch. Afterwards we extended our tour by just walking around the old city centre with Maurine and soaking up the atmosphere. We finished up in a small bar sipping Mojitos, one of the locally recommended cocktails, the important ingredients of which are rum, lime juice and fresh mint leaves. After drinks we decided to walk back to the hotel with friends and the four of us strolled through a working part of the town away from the tourist locations. If I’m honest I felt I was walking through a film set, the crumbling facades of the street frontage slightly unreal in the sunshine. But the locals around us didn’t bother us, nor did we feel uneasy, they just got on with their lives and we eventually walked up along the uneven promenade between the wide crumbling main highway and the sea towards the twin towers of the hotel about a mile away.That evening, we went to see the Cha Cha Cha orchestra, a twelve piece band featuring six dancers and guest singers. Due to our late lunch, we skipped dinner and elected instead to grab a quick bite in the downstairs cafeteria before the show started. Our pasta was disappointing, bland, lumpy and sticky, but we discovered later from friends that the Pizza they had chosen was excellent. Oh well you take your choice and win some and lose some! Tickets for the show were 25 CUCs each (without dinner) and drinks were 4 CUCs. The show lasted about an hour a half and was excellent. The next day was free to do as we wished.After breakfast we decided to walk back down to the old town, retracing our steps from the previous evening which had taken us along the old promenade between the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the main sea road. The day was cloudy and windy and we could see ahead enormous volumes of white sea spray crashing over the sea wall on to the promenade. So we turned right into ‘Principe’, a narrow street that seemed to lead us in to the city and using the first class map purchased from the hotel (3 CUCs) we threaded our way through to Neptune, one of the city's main streets which eventually would take us right in to the old town. The street was a fascinating insight in to life in Havana, lined with shops and offices it was bustling with people just going about their business. Old American cars and converted taxis were everywhere, either cruising along the busy two way road or picking up passengers. After an hour or two of just meandering we finally arrived at the Plaza Vieja. (Old Square) and enjoyed another late lunch in one of the pavement restaurants. We made yet another friend of our young waitress and she told us more about living in the city, her work, her family and her life. After lunch we decided to take a taxi back to the hotel and chose a COCO TAXI, a little yellow three wheeled vehicle with the driver stuck out in front of a double seat behind. Just like a motorcycle with two seats at the back. Our driver had to ‘push start’ ours but we were soon on our way. Due to some sort of celebratory march in the city, he had problems getting out of the city centre, so we finished up taking a long route round by the university and enjoyed every minute of our extended trip on this magical ride.During our final evening in Havana we enjoyed a visit to one of the world’s top nightspots, the Tropicana. With pretty girls, lavish colourful costumes and dramatic sets, this stunning show was indeed a spectacle. The show is performed outside on a large stage, set within a semi circle of table seating for about twelve guests per table. The tables are arranged ‘end on’ to the main stage and unless you’re lucky enough to be seated at the front end of the table, it is difficult to see all that’s going on, as there are many heads in front of you. But there are other smaller stages set higher up within the tree line, so there is always something to see. The live band could be glimpsed somewhere in the distance to the rear of the main stage and for me the music lost its ‘live’ feeling; we may well have been listening to ‘canned’ music. The entrance fee was a little expensive I thought at around £55 sterling each (without dinner) but including transport to and from our hotel and a quarter bottle of rum and a small amount of nibbles. After the show we were transported back to the hotel, tired but happy. The next day we were moving on.We left the National Hotel De Cuba during the late morning by coach for a two and a half hour drive to the Sol Palmeras hotel in Varadero for a four night stay on an all inclusive basis.Maurine left us there and returned to Havana, but not after introducing us to our local contact in this modern, comfortable hotel. Our conventionally planed room was situated on the third floor with a large balcony overlooking the pool complex which was hidden in part by dozens of palms and straw roofed parasols, all grouped in typical Caribbean style. We found out later that a narrow pathway meandered down through a small bar and restaurant on the edge of the pool complex and then on through more overhanging palms to the beach. Glorious. We were lucky, our room was sea facing, enjoyed almost all day sun and we were able to keep a close eye on all of the proceedings.Our plan was to chill out and enjoy the hot sunshine, the food and the unlimited supply of wine, beers and cocktails. The sun seemed to have finally arrived in force and for the three full days it was hot and sunny. The buffet style restaurant offered a large and varied range of dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast was manic and for me not a pleasant experience. The food was good though, with lots of choice – hot and cold - with bacon, eggs and sausage on the menu – just help yourself, or asked for freshly cooked. Dinner too spoilt us for choice. With waiter served wine and water (or any other drink you could want) we enjoyed the usual ‘help-yourself’ fish and meat dishes and all manner of wonderfully cooked vegetables and a variety of local dishes. All in all, the food was satisfactory, not the best we have been served but still enjoyable and varied. The hotel also offered other dining experiences, all of which you have to book. An Italian – a Chinese – and a Caribbean restaurant together with a steak house were all there to be enjoyed and they all offered an appetising choice for dinner. They are immensely popular and quite rightly so. We booked for the Caribbean and Italian restaurant for our third and fourth night and for us it was well worth the wait. The 'O Sole Mio' Italian restaurant was quiet and elegant, with personal waiter service and a classical trio of violin, viola and cello playing our own own choice of selected songs. There was a limited choice of three Starters, mains and pudding. My veal in fact was a little tough, but the ambience and quality of the experience more than made up for it. If I were going again, I would dine in one of the Al a Carte restaurants every night. More of an occasion and a chance to escape the rather noisy and frenzied atmosphere of the main dining room.We spent our first morning on the open top bus touring the strip and visiting the small township stretched out along the side of the road about five kilometres from our hotel. You can buy a ticket for the ever circling bus ride (the total journey time is in excess of two hours) and get on and off as you wish. We stopped at the Galleria de Arte but also found the usual collection of tourist shops and art galleries, just outside of which we rested in a tiny beach bar/restaurant for a drink. And there before my very eyes was a six piece band. We sipped cocktails in the shade of the bar and listened to three or four typical Cuban songs beautifully sung and played by this talented collection of musicians, before going back to our hotel for lunch.The rest of our days were spent either on the beach or round the pool (the sun loungers are free and extremely comfortable). This is a noisy hotel in the evenings with live music, impromptu parties and social gatherings spilling out of the several bars with everybody just enjoying themselves. As you would expect, it tends to be one long session of eating drinking swimming and sunning oneself under the relentless rays of the tropical sun. On our eight’th day in Cuba we finally transferred back to Havana airport by coach and took the Virgin Atlantic night flight back to Gatwick in the UK arriving mid morning.All in all the tour was well balanced and well run. We thought at first that we would have preferred more time in Havana but three nights is just enough to get a good taste of this magical city. The two hotels are impressive in their very different ways and we found the people enchanting and helpful. Our tour manager Maurine was excellent and our local guides first-class. We were pleased to board our 'long haul' Virgin flights, even if it was just to get away from the petty, penny pinching euro airlines, who seem to be doing all they can to destroy themselves in the market place. The Virgin staff were excellent and it made such a difference.If you are looking for something just a little different with a mixture of historical culture with world famous overtures of political intrigue (with a certain world trauma thrown in) coupled with a luxurious few days of doing not much at all under the hot tropical sun, then perhaps this holiday is for you. It certainly was for us.Posted by onepalelight.blogspotPhotos at onepalelight.blogspot"
50,“My favorite place in Cuba”,"Havana Cuba a city like no other.We just came back from a wonderful vacation in Cuba .we staid in Havana at Conte De Villaneva Hotel(in Old Havana) for 5 days. The hotel staff is amazing.If you like to visit museums see nice architecture, drink Mojito , smoke cigars and eat seafood, you must spend few days in Havana. It is like nothing like you never seen before, a city very colorful .It is one of the save city that a ever seen it .I must the admit that at the first look doesn’t seem like."
50,“Dynamic and exciting”,"CarsI had assumed it was still a myth that the old Chevvies, Pontiacs and Buicks of the 50’s would be around still but I was pleasantly surprised to see them in evidence albeit most were taxis and some in better condition than others.Now my recognition of car types from the 50’s is relatively limited purely as I wasn’t around, not to appreciate them at my age anyway, Dad never owned one of them and lastly I am not really interested in cars of this era.Of course I can recognize a Lada, as that’s the most common car here and its been spawned across most of eastern Europe.There is a beautiful Buick with purple exterior and white leather interior parked up by revolution square and although at a distance looks perfect closer inspection reveals that its in need of some TLC. What’s also amazing is that you never see the same car twice as there are just so many of them. Where you see a fully restored 50’s American classic there is easily two hundred odd rust heaps held together with Cuban ingenuity. Some of these cars don’t even sport their original axles/wheels as they are either set forward or back depending on where they have been welded on the chassis. Those set back look like cartoon acceleration where the body is moving faster than the wheels. What you do not see is the equivalent of the beige Morris Marina with a purple door. Here the doors get re-cut from sheet metal and banged into shape, in some cases not quite fitting, but at least they match the cars body colour as its subsequently been re-sprayed. The ostentatious hood furniture is extremely alien but here it seems to work although I haven’t a clue what it represents. I am sure an aficionado of hood furniture exists especially with these iconic 50’s classics.Take you life into your own hands and get in one of the mustard coloured tennis balls set on three wheels. Slight weight disadvantage on the left but helped going left for the driver, little tougher on hills and attempting right turns. Once was enough but if there is no other alternative then I guess that’s the best for the occasion.But a ride in a 54 chevvy is a must or rather rust. This one took us from the San Carlos La Cabana back to the hotel. All parts of the car seem to be magically held together and the exterior paint job applied with a wall paper brush; not the highest quality. From the sharp rasp of the engine and the juddering into motion it ticked along at a fair lick. Thunderous echo as we entered the tunnel heading for Malecon. Hill climbs not a speciality and when it came to announcing the cars intention two wires had to be held together for the horn to sound, whilst still steering and changing gear. Needless to say he couldn’t separate them for a few seconds. He was very proud of his fifty five year old car even though he was quick to offer it for sale, “good price”.These classics will be on the streets still in years to come as long as they continue to tinker and repair and not sell them."
50,“We Love CUBA”,"In Havana we didnt stay at La Casa de Ana they were full BUT Ana organized a Casa for us just up the road with Maria and Alberto, it was beautiful. An original 1920s art deco apt lovely and Maria was fantastic. We kind of congragated at Ana & Pepe's place and there was internet access.We took Pepe's walking trip of Habana Veija it was excellent, being a local Pepe is an excellent guide and made sure we saw and did those extra things.In Vedado you can visit the Neocropolis (the local cemetery) it is amazing we spent over 5 hours there, but the toilets are revolting so be prepared and take your own toilet tissue (you should carry loo paper with you all the time) remember it costs to use the toilets.On our return to Habana we stayed at the Hotel Florida for a few days this was great as we were in Old Havana. It was a most beautiful hotel 1890s and we later found out that any profit made goes back to the Historio to continue the restoration of Old Havana. We also took in the Tropicana show it was an over the top extavaganza well worth the money just for the experience.The only down side for us was the food and the way it is cooked (but the mojitos were excellent) even the hotel food was not great there was one exception in Santa Clara Ivonne was a great cook our hostess at the Casa El Castillio. Its strange all the raw ingredients are there its the frying everthing with an inch of its life and the assembly of those ingredients that is the problem, and the cheese coming from a dairy rich country the cheese was not good.But would we go back to Cuba - in a heart beat. It is a long way from New Zealand about 18 hours but that wouldn't deter us we are planning our return with cereal and baked beans in hand."
50,“Havana City”,The city is different than anything you can imagine. Do no expect luxurious hotels or restaurant but do not miss the experience of walking in the street of the Old Havana.Just do not flight with Air Comet to get there. TERRIBLE!!!
50,“Viva Cuba”,"Today I sadly bid farewell to Cuba and miss the spirit, energy and beauty already. I have been in love once before and it was Africa that stole my heart. Cuba is now my beloved.My sister and I have always been intrigued by Cuba and had the opportunity to visit after staying in Jamaica for our Cousins wedding. It has been the most wonderful experience and I would encourage anybody to take the time to visit this magnificent Country. Aside from the amazing street life and architecture the spirit of the populous is really the magic of this island.I am a professional photographer traveling with practically a multi media centre and about $20000 worth of equipment, so at first I was concerned about the safety of this in Cuba. I have to say I have never felt more safe and carefree. I stayed in both 5 star hotels and Casas and walked the streets with a Canon 1DS Mark III in hand for nearly the entire journey. I travelled with a Mac laptop and left this without worry in the casa all day. My sister and I ingratiated ourselves into the world of the Cuban Artists by simply walking into their workshops. We were welcomed with open hearts, minds and spirit and were taken to the Art School where we got to speak with teachers and students and see the workshops in progress.We were taken on the local buses and to the roof top apartment of an architectural professor for the most breathtaking view of Havana. For a people that have very little we were given all that they had, their homes, food, insight and heart.So here are my referrals:HavanaStay in Casas even if you have some reservations about it - you will not regret the decision and you will eat some of the best food you will have the opportunity to experience in Cuba. I stayed at the NH Parque Central Hotel before staying in the Casas and I would much prefer the ambience and cuisine in the Casa. The NH Parque was about $270 US per night and the Casa $30 CUC including breakfast.See http://www.casaparticularcuba.org/http://www.cubaitalia.com/html/cuba/turismo/casa%20particular.htmRead reviews on trip advisor and decide on one. Even if the people you choose can't help you they will always have somewhere close to refer you too.Bear in mind that Internet access in Cuba is expensive and limited, so it is better to call or turn up in person as the Casa owners may not have regular internet access. Some do.In Old Havana we stayed with Olga Lopez Hernandez, Cuba No. 611 Apto. 1, Old Havana. Tel: [--]http://www.cubacasas.net/cities/la_habana/habana_vieja/CasaOlga/The apartment is a second floor apartment that is right across the street from the historic Convento de Santa Clara. There are two air-conditioned rooms and a bathroom with hot water and shower. Olga is gorgeous and so is her home. She has internet access and is happy for you to use it.In Vedado we contactedLa ass de Anawww.anahavana.comanalinacuba@gmail.comCalle 17 e/26 y 28, N 1422Apt 1 Vedado 10400Tel: [--]Ana has internet and responded really promptly and was very helpful. She didn't have rooms available but referred us to:Casa DianaCalle 21 # 1408 esq 28, Vedado C Habana CubaTel: [--]Diana & Tony were wonderful. They are an older couple with a beautiful home. Tony has an amazing life and if he doesn't offer it ask about his time in the police force. He has fantastic photos. We stayed with Tony and Diana but had dinner at Ana's. Ana is very hospitable and speaks excellent english.Just stroll the streets, you could do this for weeks. Homes spill onto the street and the early morning and late afternoon are the most wonderful times to experience the energy of the city. Don't get bogged down by having to do specific things, open yourself and you will find the city opens up to you. When you stroll the streets, move away from the tourist areas, we found it to be safe no matter where we meandered.You must visit the little craft market in Obispo St. It operates on Thurs, Friday and Sunday (from memory). Here you will find Milton R Diaz Perez a truly loving and talented soul. Milton is a qualified Architect who now works as an artist. He sells his photographs, lino cuts and muliti media works for extremely reasonable prices. Milton was so kind to us. He took us everywhere and introduced us to Salsa. He also took us to the most amazing Cuban restaurants where meals range from $2 - 5 CUC. Milton's email is miltondt2006@yahoo.es - His Mobile is [--]. His website is www.galeriacubana.netVisit the Cigar Factory - it is a great tour.Visit the Famous second hand book market - Plaza de Armas; 9am-5pm Mon-Sat near the Castillo the la real Fuerza, it's amazing. Only since the late 1990ties this market was officially allowed as a trading place for books-portraits and other literature - mostly of authors from the revolution period.Everybody raves about the Malecon but I didn't find this area to be of so much interest. I was far more intrigued by old Havana.VinalesWe also spent 3 days in Vinales. Arriving in Vinales can be overwhelming. You can barely get off the bus for the people crowding the door trying to get you to stay in their Casa. I would recommend arranging your accommodation ahead of time unless your prepared for the barrage. Once you are settled in Vinales it's well worth sitting across the street and watching the arrival of the bus each day.Our hosts in Vinales were the most gorgeous family and the food to dye for. They didn't speak much English but it really wasn't necessary. They have family with another Casa Batista just up the road and they do speak English. They will help call ahead for anything you need to book upon your return to Havana.Details are:Villa RosaCarretera al Cementerio No 14Vinales, Pinar del Rio, CubaCodigo Postal 22400Telf: [--]http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jdsdf/rosafr.htmWe were approached by Carlos a Taxi Driver in the main street for tours. It was a fabulous experience and well worth the money to have a personal guide. We were not shuffled around with others or suffering crowds. We had a private experience and Carlos is fantasitc. It is not that much more expensive than the bus and far more flexible and intimate. We met Carlos's family and shared a beer and chat. We did the tour of the tobacco farm/Indian Caves etc one day and the beach on the second day. All well worth it. We also did the horse riding which I wasn't that keen on the idea of but absolutely loved seeing the farm and meeting the farmers. I would do this one even if you have doubts.Carlos – Taxi Driver – VinalesCarlos Madiedo ReyesCalle: Gos Pinos FinalEdif: 104-FarApto: B-2Rpto: Hnos CruzCiudad: Pinar Del RioPais: CubaCode: 20200Tel Work: [--] (with 53 at the beginning)Code for Pinar del Rio is 048Viva Cuba.

50,“Cigar Adventure”,"Had a great trip in August to Havana. The main point of this trip was to buy some cigars , but Havana has so much more than cigars. The city is so alive throughout the night. The weather during August can be unbearable. The accommodations in Havana are descent if staying in a casa particular. Staying at a casa might not be for everyone, but if you do you will enjoy staying around the local people and the local flavor. The food in Havana is descent, not great. Prices in the touristy bars and restaurants can be expensive but in other lesser know areas it can be super cheap. Havana is a Cigar smokers heaven because you can visit the world famous cigar factories. Paratgas being one of the best. Legit Cuban cigars are not cheap so don't expect to pay cheap prices for real cigars. Only real problem getting to Havana is the disorder at the airport getting IN. Leaving was smooth. Although I don't think Havana is for everybody, I think most people that go there are going to love it and want to come back soon."
50,“Cuban Adventures”,"My trip was good although parts of it would have been easier to do things if I'd known more Spanish. (I only just started learning it recently.)I stayed in casas particulares throughout my stay in Cuba. First I stayed with someone whom I'd emailed before arriving. Then when I traveled, she arranged for me to stay with people she knew in casas in other cities. This worked out to be pretty convenient. However, I did end up paying about 5 CUCs more than the cheapest casas, and I think that I would have been able to shop around more if I hadn't mostly been staying with people with whom I'd arranged to go with beforehand. The two times when I stayed with others, in one case it worked out very well: I stayed in a casa that was very reasonable in cost and in which the people were nice and the location was great. In the other case, it worked out well overall, but I hadn't realized until I'd already paid that it was actually an unregistered casa particular, and thus I (and they) would have gotten in big trouble if the police had investigated this. Look for a sign with a blue anchor on it and with words (I forget what they are but all casas particulares are are required to have them, so just look at the door the first time you stay in one and you'll know what it looks like.)Hustlers are more common in Havana than elsewhere in Cuba, and the transportation system within-city can be a little tricky to navigate (between major cities it's easy, though), so it's helpful to ask your host to find someone to act as a guide for you in Havana, at least for a couple days when you're getting oriented. I had a guide for several days in Havana and was definitely glad about this. I didn't have a guide during the rest of my time (several days more) nor within several other cities I was in (Trinidad, Santa Clara and Matanzas) and this seemed okay, too. I think that the key thing is to have someone help you a lot when you first start going around Havana.Overall the trip was amazing. Cuba is fascinating and beautiful. If you head there, be wary of getting caught up only within the ""tourist economy"" and be wary of hustlers but also don't be overly wary: you can meet some wonderful people when wandering around if you're open to that. (I ended up having coffee in someone's house in Trinidad pretty randomly, and that was definitely cool. ;^) I most enjoyed wandering around taking pictures, and I really enjoyed this. There are also a ton of things to check out more from museums to shops to beaches to a ton of cultural things. If you head there, enjoy! And be ready for an adventure, wherever specifically you go and whatever you decide to do.P.S. It is easy to do a bit of Spanish tutoring there if you want to. I did so with someone whom my host contacted for me."
50,“Casa Abel y Aidee Havana”,"Casa Abel y AideeAlthough this side of Havanah may not be your first choice this is an excellent casa. The owners, Abel and Aidee go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and safe. The food is better than any of the restaurants around and you must try the sea food. Abel and Aidee's son, Rico speaks excellent English and always resonds to e mails. Everyone was exceptionally helpful giving insights into Cuba and making viazul bookings. At 20 CUCs a night it is exceptional value. Contact rbarroso@infomed.sld.cuThe address is 111 Blanco Street ( Havana centro ). The room is comfortable and hot water comes from an ingenious Heath Robinson addition to the water flow pipe. AS it was our 1st casa it seemed odd. As we moved around we realised it was a popular way of giving tourists access to a hot shower. Worth looking at their web site which gives a realistic picture of what you can expect.. We had a great4 days. Anywhere in this part of town compares poorly from where you might have come from in the western world but we enjoyed it."
10,“Casa Elsa y Julio Roque Havana Centro a nightmare”,"Casa Particulares Elsa y Julio Roque.A NightmareDespite being recommended by Lonely Planet, a confirmed e mail booking in May, a face to face confirmation when we first arrived in Havana and a phone call the night before we were due to arrive we were bounced from this casa particular when we arrived. It was disappointing considering it came highly revommended by Lonely Planet and Julio is a contributor as the 1st voice of Havana in the guide book.Julio was apologetic saying they were full as someone had stayed on but what was the point of booking if this meant we were told we would have to go elsewhere. So much for research and playing by the rules. Perhaps they have become 'too popular ' following their inclusion in LP.We were taken to others but pulling cases around this part of Havana Centro at 2130 following the bus trip from Trinidad was all we needed. We ended up in a hotel.Everything else in our 18 night stay went well. All the other casas we had booked came good. We wish we had stayed in the casa we booked for the 1st 4 nights of our trip, casa abel y aidee, just a block away. I would recommend you did the same!"
50,“Havana Casa ( Havana Centro)”,"A really good Casa in Havana Centro is Casa Abel y Aidee. It may not be in the best part of town but you will not find a better host and hostess in Havana. We were looked after fantastically by Abel and Aidee who went out of their way to ensure we had a great time. Aidees cooking is great.. The sea food was particularly good. They were really helpful in making arrangements for us including sorting the tickets for the viazul bus.Their son, Rigo speaks excellent English and we were lucky to meet them and get a better understanding of Cuba at this time. Although the area may not seem as good as Havana Veija we were perfectly safe here ( 111 Calle Blanco) Telf. (53) 7 8634033 rbarroso@infomed.sld.cuThis side of the Prado ( now called the paseo di Marti) may not seem the best part of town but we had no trouble heading back tothe casa late at night. People were everywhere and we felt safer for that.Looking out of the window shed light on the less touristy side of Havana.If you want a great value casa book thid one."
40,"“Havana - experience the ""Time Machine""”","June/July 2009: On arrival at the airport we had to complete a Swine 'flu card. When going through Immigration Desk make sure to keep that card as there's another desk inside Immigration/Security collecting those cards.After Immigration there's a security scanner & check similar to the ones we go through when boarding the plane!After getting the luggage there's the Swine 'flu desk and then what appears to be a random check before you exit to the Arrivals area - so lots of checks/desks etc just to get out of the airport!!Stayed in NH Parque Central. Lovely hotel in a great location with a substantial breakfast buffet!. We took a horse & cart tour first morning to orientate ourselves. Our guide also gave us lots of useful information. Most places were walkable from the hotel. Be sure to take a taxi ride (preferably in an old car) along the Malecon to the Hotel Nacional.The number, variety & conditions of those old cars is amazing - far more than I ever expected.Havana has hugely differing sections, from the crumbling poorer areas to the well-appointed suburbs to the nicely renovated old city - see them all to get a true sense of the hugh contrast.We managed to see the Bueno Vista Social Club (with just one of the original group left) play live in the Rum Factory. It wasn't widely advertised - we just happened to hear about it!! Two types of ticket available - 1 with food, 1 without. Based on the food we saw there I'd say it's best to eat beforehand and just go along to the concert.Plenty of people outside the hotel in Havana offering horse & cart rides, taxis, selling papers etc....some just looking for money...but they generally take ""no gracias"" as an answer and don't pursue you. Negotiate everything!!We'd heard about bringing ""gifts"", medicines etc. for the locals but there was no forum for giving people stuff unless you carried it around with you. We just ended up leaving lots of stuff in the hotel room on the last day!Museums are generally closed on Mondays so there are no organised tours (which involve museums) going on Mondays apparently.Everyone expects a tip but nobody is willing to give any change so make sure to get plenty of small bills/coins in hotel.Go see it all for yourself!!!"
50,“One of the most beautiful cities- a hidden jewel”,"What an incredible vibrant city. It offers so much choice for travellers and is very safe. The architecture is breathtaking and the people warm and helpful.See the city via the double decker bus-a one day pass (9am-9pm) allows you to hop on and off all over the city.The museums are well worth exploring as is the Fortress and Revolution Square.Having visited other Islands in The Caribbean this one stands out. It is truely a trip back in time. A helpful suggestion,pack snacks if you pllan to do alot of exploring-and water.Do not miss this at all."
20,“beautiful city (old city)”,"La havana is a beautiful city, the problem is the same meals every day. Some cuban people ( in the El Vedado Hotel) are very rude with the turist. If you have a problem with the reservation in the computer ( is your problem) not yours. All the people in Sta Clara is a wonderful and nice people. The best days that I stay were in Sta Calra and Varadero beach."
30,"“Interesting, but now I've been there, done that.”","I travelled to Havana with my partner at the end of April 2009. We stayed at an all-inclusive resort in Varadero and took a day trip into Havana.First, we didn't realize the bus ride to Havana would be almost three hours long each way. FAR too much time spent on a bus. Second, the history of Cuba is not all that captivating to me, so it was difficult for me to feel interested in the stops we made in Havana.We visited Revolution Square, which just looked like a big parking lot across the street from a large statue and momument. We visited the Capital Building (didn't go in, weren't given the time) but it looked like every other capital building, just dirty and old. We visited a cemetery, which we weren't expecting.Old Havana was where we had the most free time - it was certainly one of the highlights of the trip, but still not all that great. We wandered a few blocks - there is amazing history in Havana - buildings that are hundreds of years old and still standing and functioning. We visited Hemingway's apartment building and his favourite watering hole in Havana. The city is very large and run down - I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so run down and dirty. We also went through the market in Old Havana - but nothing much special there - all the usual tourist items that are mass produced and probably don't reflect real Cuban culture at all.We did take in an evening show at the Tropicana Nightclub - definitely worth it. Beautiful outdoor show theatre, wonderful Cuban music, fabulous costumes (think Las Vegas showgirls). It IS a bit cheesy, but embrace it and have fun. They give you a bottle of rum per four people, so you can have a good time! (Bring some pesos for toilet paper though - you won't find any in the stalls for free!)All in all, I found it a bit of a letdown. Perhaps it was because we were on the typical tourist bus tour, and you never get an authentic experience this way. I am glad I visited Havana and Cuba in general, but I'm not sure I would go back."
40,“Wonderful place - but beware scams!!!”,"Cuba is fabulous. Had great time with Voyages Jules Verne tour (Return to Havana) EXCEPT - you are constantly told that Cuba is safe, safe, safe night and day. We had a different experience. We were staying in the Hotel Parque Central situated in a Havana square where there are 4 or 5 other v v good hotels. Just round the corner from the Hotel Inglaterra is the Bar Nautilus - small, basic bar. One evening we were invited in for a drink - so we went. The staff loaded our bill (3 times as much as our 5 star hotel prices for 7 drinks) and became very very intimidating when we queried the bill. Then THEY LOCKED THE DOOR to prevent us leaving, and staff and Cuban customers stood in front of it. It was v v frightening and only by paying the full bill (approx £60 for 7 drinks!!!!!) was the door unlocked and we were let out. We returned to our Hotel v shaken and reported what had happened to us. We took a trip to the Police Station at our own expense and were met with huge apathy and no English speaking staff. We have reported this incident to VJV and to the Cuba Tourist Board in London, and our VJV was v helpful after the event. Since our happening we have since found that this bar's procedure of preying on 'rich'(!) tourists staying in that particular square is rife. We returned early the next day and quickly took attached photos - SO PLEASE BEWARE!!!!!!!"
50,“Havana Rocks!”,"We spent a week in Havana in December 2008 and had an amazing time. We thought Havana was best explored on foot, and happily spent days wandering the streets. We marveled at the decrepit beauty of the architecture, the dancing and singing of the locals and recommend heading down the backstreets, you never know what you might find! We found it very safe and the locals very friendly. The people watching along the Malecon is fantastic, it's a long walk, but worth it, especially if the waves are crashing over the wall. I shot some video footage of the trip which probably best describes the wonderful things we saw...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC1D4UGbqkAWe stayed at the Hotel Florida and the Nacional, both great for their own reasons. We had our best meal at El Templete (great seafood, it's across the road from the malecon in the old town) and it's definitely worth the trip to Miramar (get a taxi) for the roast chicken at El Aljibe Restaurant.Of course there are things you could complain about, life in Havana is far from perfect, but we had such a good time I don't have a bad word to say, GO!"
50,“The House of Carlos and Neyda was Beautiful & Comfortable”,"The House of Carlos and Neyda, is a horizontal property that completely occupies the second floor of the building located at F Street between the streets 13 and 15 of the modern district of Vedado, parallel to more well-known G Street or Presidents Avenue. A “Casa Particula” as the one of Carlos and Neyda it must take care of thus and does, to the maximum, the details. From the very moment of the reservation, as much Carlos as Neyda take care of and facilitate all the necessary information that you require without interfering for that reason, in your privacy, they are so great & friendly!Your first impression of the House of Carlos and Neyda is the beautiful lobby. The house is decorated with furniture of colonial style, refined to antiques and objects of exquisite taste turning it into unique.The rooms are amazing with huge beds, a nice wardrobe, a minibar and a cozy bathroom with shower, sink and toilet. All of them have windows, from which splendid views of the zone of Vedado can be contemplated. The lingerie is changed daily and the rooms cleaned with skillful cleanliness.The House of Carlos and Neyda is in the middle of everything, which makes planning a walk along the Havana? Strip easy. The house offers services of breakfasts and dinners with the best of the Cuban traditional kitchen as well as the international specialties, in a comfortable atmosphere. All elaborated by Mrs. Neyda and served in the dining room provided of a relaxed and elegant atmosphere.From the terrace you will enjoy unforgettable sunsets accompanied by the wind that simply arrives from the famous Malecon and a very propitious tranquility for the reading or for a pleasant conversation between friends.The corridor of the house that leads to the rooms is decorated with linen cloths and reproductions of national painters as much as international.Our stay was more than comfortable we truly had a great time. Can't wait to get back..... The only bad thing is that you won't want to leave once you get there!!"
10,“Do not stay longer than 1 day!!!”,"I visited Havana for one week in December 2008. The hotel, Hotel Plaza, was fine. One needs to recongnize that it is a third world country and the ""four star"" hotels do not match North American standards. It was clean, but noisey.The City is a dump. Human waste and garbage everywhere. The buildings are crumbling and a walk through the non-touristy streets would make you cry. The poverty in unbelievable.As a male travelling alone, I was constantly harassed by people looking for money. Perhpas once a minute, each day. Seriously. Every restaurant but one tried to rip me off when the bill came.The beggers are epidemic. I did not leave my hotel for the last two days of my seven days there as I couldn't take it anymore.For perspective, I have visited 37 countries on four continents in the last five years and have never felt as uncomfortable on so many levels as I did in Havana.The National Art Gallery is amazing and full of brilliant pieces of art. I went twice. (No beggers!)It is one place a person should visit for the historic value and to witness the oppression - so, spend one day there and get back to the drunk tourists in Varadero.Hope this helps."
30,“The Capital of Communism”,"First of all, Havana in summer is Hot Hot Hot...but do not consider this as a warning, you can cope with the heat. But just so that it is out in the open.Havana was not the best thing about Cuba for me, I am not sure whether I was a bit let down or maybe my expectations were not met. I am not sure. But it was quite, obviously, old...quite dirty and there were a lot a garbage.....some renovation done to some of the houses.And all the hotels charge at least 20% more in the summer than they do in the low season. I suppose summertime is high season. It was more expensive than I thought.And we quickly learnt that everyone wants to exploit you in every way the can and know how to. So, just say ""no"" to begin with. You will meet a lot of people, telling you to buy cigars, or rum...and when you decline, they also have a room for rent:) So make sure, do not say yes to the first and best...But, we found some greats spots off course....a nice more local bar, a couple of blocks from the more famous, El Floridita...local music and better prices. And we also found a Maroccan or Palestine restaurant...in the old part of the city...goood food, and a nice atmosphere (sadly I cannot remember the name).Make sure you speak spanish!:)And...patience patience..you will have to stand in line, as the rest of the Cubans...But, I can recommend you Havana, but only for a day or two..:) At least that is MY experience!"
20,“Havana....not so friendly”,Just arrived after 10 days in Havana...Couple of problems#1..the casa we stayed at...Aleida Ravelo was not what we expected or what advertised...3rd floor not second..40 stairsThe balcony shot was the building next door..rooster that woke you every morning around 6:30...far from friendly service wouldnot recommend...In Havana you won't get killed but there is alot of theivery going on..I got robbed on the second night...ripped my bag right from around my neck...you have to watch your back at all times and count your change and check your bill wherever you go..The architecture in Havana is beautiful..old Havana was fabulous. But avoid this casa and don't carry any bags or anything they can get ahold of...shorts or pants with many pockets recommended..
20,“Havana - overall we were disapointed!”,"We visited Havana for a week, staying in the NH Parque central. This was our first visit to the Caribean however we have travelled extensively within the Asia-Pacific Region, Havana is a good destination in the respect that it has an interesting culture, with majestic crumbly old buildings and huge 1950's cars. Also there are a number of good bars for sipping mojitos, eyeopening places to visit such as the cigar factories and loads of museums. Unfortunately there is a big downside - the poor careless customer service, even in the 5* hotels, coupled with non genuine cubans who constantly try to con tourists and rip them off, left us feeling very disapointed. If you do decide to visit I suggest that you take a good medical kit. The food is bad, very limited and often bland - my husband and I both got sick on our holiday. All in all a disappointing holiday and not what we had expected, leaving us vowing not to return to the Caribean."
50,“Salsa dance school fantastic!”,"My friend and I went to Havana to study Cuban salsa at a school located in Miramar, a district about 10 minutes by taxi, from Old Havana. Miramar is worth a visit as it has many restored mansions now primarily Embassies. The cost by taxi to Old Havana was anywhere from 8 to 10 CUC depending on what kind of taxi you take.If cuban salsa is of interest to you, no matter what level of dancer you are I recommend the school Spratchcaffe. Instructors are fantastic and there are many excursions if you are interested for reasonable rates.La Habana is a magnificent, vibrant, interesting paradox of a place. The city is filled with amazing and diversified architecture. The buildings are incredibly beautiful with so much detail yet so many of the structures are crumbling and in desperate need of repair. Havana is slowly being restored and I can only imagine how breathtaking it will be in time. I was in Paris a few years ago and I can easily see Havana being far more stunning when completed.As in any large city, especially a poor one, be careful and stay in safe districts. I did not find there were any more people asking for money than I do here in Ottawa. The Cuban people for the most part were full of welcome, smiles, hugs and kisses, as always.Not an inexpensive holiday but if you look and ask you can find places to eat outside of your hotel that are reasonable. Go to Casa de la Musica at 5 pm the cost is 10 cuc and beer is 1 cuc. Go later and you pay 15 and 2 cuc for beer.If you visit Havana with a good attitude, open mind and a sense of adventure you won’t be disappointed. If you look for imperfection then that is what you will find."
30,“Ugly and Beautiful”,"We took the one day tour to Havana from our resort in Varadero. It cost 67 CUC each and was worth it. Our tour guide's name was Marvin and he was very friendly and funny. His english was a bit hard to understand at first but after a while I got used to it. He had some cute terms.The pick up time at our resort was supposed to be 8:10 but the bus was about half an hour late which I'v learned is normal with these tours.The one thing that sticks out in my mind about Havana was the stray dogs. Next time I go, I will certainly bring disposable water dishes and extra water and dog treats. I felt so sorry for these poor homeless dogs that always seemed to be trying to attach themselves to humans in some way. It really made me realize how dogs really love humans and really need a home, more than any other animal. I saw 2 dogs limping, 1 dog looked like he was so sad and starving and I saw 1 sad little dog dead at the side of the highway. It really made me sad. Other than that, you just see dogs everywhere, running down the sidewalk, crossing streets (they seemed to obey the laws of the road!?!) and looking like they had somewhere to go.Besides that though, about Havana itself. The city is dirty and ugly (but interesting) in some areas except in Old Havana (Habana Vieja) which is being restored (for the tourists obviously) it is quite beautiful and breathtaking. It reminds me of Europe, in particular Prague. Yes it really is that beautiful. The cobblestoned streets, the stone churches and mansions, the colourful storefronts...I felt safer in Old Havana than I did in the rest of Havana. There were not as many beggers as I had read about. We actually were prepared with toothpaste and shampoo (as someone I worked with told me they prefer that over pesos) but only one lady asked us for something. I wished we had given her everything we had but we thought more would ask us.Havana is full of ""entrepreneurs"" everywhere though, and there were people trying to sell us roasted peanuts, cigars, exchange money for us, colourful ladies wanting to pose in pictures kissing my husband for a peso, people trying to sell us rattles, mini drums, water, etc.The classic cars are really interesting. Some in really good shape. Lots of Ladas, as well as American cars. We drove past a cemetary (not the christopher columbus one) that looked like it could be comparable to the Pere Lachaise cemetary in Paris, but looked dirtier than that. I wished we had stopped to go into it.The most impressive thing I saw (and there were a lot of things) was the Castillo de la Real furza which is a 16th century fort. It had fences around it and our tour guide didn't even mention it so I would have loved to be able to go inside. I took pictures through the fence though.Walking along the Malecon was not as fun as I had read about. Dirty stinky water in some places and I preferred walking down the cobblestone streets.We went to the market which was very cramped and busy and you couldn't stop to tie your shoe without someone trying to sell you something (but we were in a market so what did I expect haha!) We bought sunhat, fridge magnets, cloth grocery bags. There was some beautiful art there as well.anyways, enjoy my pictures and have fun if you go!"
20,“Study up before hand and have an awesome time”,"Havana a was mix of heaven and hell. I had breakfast every morning at the Cafe De Infusiones on Mercaderes at Obispo in Vieja. Decent cappucino, good juices and a sandwich for $4.50. From there I would walk all day long, check out music at Mi Habana in the Plaza De La Revolucion, Callejon De Hamel on Sunday from noon-3, The great jazz club Zorra Y El Cueurvo on La Rampa, or the Casa De Musica Miramar. I'd grab cheap drinks in various bars like Montserrate (don't pay more than $1/$1.50 for a beer or $2-$3 for a mixed drink). The cemetary was beautiful even in the rain, the Maleco is gorgeous and safe and a great way to travese the city from Vieja, through Centro to Vedado and even into Miramar.One restaurant that I found to be worth checking out was El Aljibe in Miramar - this is a nice neighborhood to walk around in - all abandoned ultra-rich mansions now housing embassies. I walked into Che Guevara's old house which now houses a restaurant called Le Select. El Aljibe has a $12 special. Great roast chicken in a bitter orange mojo sauce that's super delicious, served with salad, rice, great black beans, french fries and fried bananas. And it's all you can eat (except for the chicken I suppose).From there it's not too far a walk to Casa De Musica Miramar which has great salsa. There were a few obnoxious hookers that harangued me (I was the only tourist in the joint) and it was mostly an upscale black crowd - great music and a good time.Another great restaurant is Los Nardos - right across the street from the Capitol at 563 Pradod - there's no sign and up a flight of dingy stairs but then you are in a very classy romantic restaurant with a huge wine cellar along an upper wall and a great piano player. The gazpacho was great ($2) and the pineapple chicken sort of sucked but I should have ordered the creole chicken which probably wold have been good. They also are famous for sea food. The drinks and coffee were great and the best service I had in Cuba. Perfect place for a very romantic dinner for couples.Other places that weren't bad were La Rampa Cafetereia in the Habana Libre - $3 for pasta aglio et olio and also Marakas around the corner on a side street off of La Rampa had decent pizza. Copellia ice cream is great also on La Rampa by the Habana Libre.Casa Catante Mi Habana is a great scene. They have matinees and when I went it was an upscale young Cuban crowd - absolutely no hustlers - just really Cubans having a great time listening to music, dancing, drinking and chatting. If you don't understand the deal with money and what not - I think they mainly deal in MN because it's not a real tourist hangout? just fork over some CUCs and eventually they will be happy. I was buying beers for $1 or mixed drinks for $1.50 and then tipping 50 cents and they were weirdly maybe nervous? about taking my CUCs at first but then grew to appreciate it? I was puzzled but whatever. It was still a bargain for me by North American standards even if I may have been spending 30 times more than the Cubans in the club. You could try scoring some MN before going and see if that works out.Zorra Y El Cuervo is a good jazz club - you pay 10 bucks and that includes two drinks. Shows start at 11 or 11:30. The first set is always smoking but the second set usually was half-hearted jazz standards. You might want to just split after the first set unless you're enjoying hanging out.Montserrate is a good drinking hole although you have to be careful to not get ripped off by the bartenders and waiters and firm with the band who want to hustle you a CD or a donation. More often than not their music is garbage - I grew pretty sick of hearing Girl From Ipanema, Gunatanamera and other tired tunes. But the bar has a good vibe and makes makes decent pizza ($2) and really good mojitos.Another good place is Cafe O Reilly in Vieja. Beers are only a $1 there. Avoid the Cafe De Paris - it's a dive and they either don't have cheap beer or just won't sell it to tourists. The most expensive drinks of any place I found in Cuba and really bad attitude and crap service from the staff. I went in there twice and left twice without ordering a drink.Callejon De Hamel is an awesome rumba jam every Sunday but either take NOTHING on your person or have all possession very securely locked down - eg no backpacks on your back, no wallets in your pocket, stay out of the crowd around the band. I saw some thieves circulating in the crowd posiing as beautiful tourist girls with video cameras. They were in league with the CD hustler kids. But the music is AMAZING and it's free.If you want to know what's going on - CHECK OUT H HAVANA magazine on the web. There are ABSOLUTELY NO LISTINGS anywhere in Havana - no papers, no posters, nobody has information fory ou NOTHING. H Havana has great listings for all the hot clubs, galleries and all the arts. Pay for an internet card and check it out - don't be stupid like I was and walk aimlessly to clubs hoping something will be happening. The hours are bizzarre in Havana - lots of shows start at 4pm then other clubs might only start at 11:30. So know before you go!For everything you do in Havana, always check the price on the menu for everything you might want, then verify the price verbally with the bartender, then check your bill for added items and check your change for shortchanging.People will rip you off relentlessly if you let them. You also need to quickly learn how to deal with hustlers - avoid stopping if at all possible, and don't talk to them or look at them - just be rude. If they catch your eyes just gesture ""no"" with your hands. Be friendly but firm.Use a money belt. Do not convert money ANYWHERE other than a bank (there's one on Oficious in Veija - go in and say ULTIMO to figure out who was the last person in line ahead of you) or a CADECO - they are everywhere. The exchange was at 15% when I went. People will try to hustle you money wise everywhere.I had no trouble with crime even though I was walking all over the city at all times of night down sketchy looking and deserted streets etc. Just avoid getting involved in any kind of conversations with hustlers and you should be ok. And don't start fights with them - just be friendly and outwit them to get out of their constant ploys to win your trust etc.Hustlers start by asking you for a light or the time, or what country you are from. If they try to get you to do something - just say that you will maybe check that out another day, thay you are just walking for now. Don't tell them where you are going etc or they may show up there. I screwed up once and told a hustler where I had to go as an excuse then was worried he would show up there - thankfully he didn't.Everyone will try and take you to the ""Compay Segundo Salsa Festival one day only!"" this is absolute nonsense - Compay Segundo wasn't a salsa musician in the first place so you know something's fishy....Once you learn the ropes Havana can be an awesome place for drinks music and walking around soaking up the atmosphere."
40,“My time in Cuba”,"I decided to locate a guide. I was surprised to see men who I thought were just hanging out, to be school teachers who needed to make extra money from tourists by giving them long, tiring and exciting tours of Havana. Miguel took me to La Plaza Cental, Plaza La Armas, everywhere in Old Havana, old shops where people lined up for rations of food. From the courtyard was a long walk through many cobbled and slightly dirty streets with stray dogs, to colorfully painted shops, restaurants with delectable food and absolutely regal buildings with such majesty , it was a shame they were running to ruin.. To get a really authentic great meal, many private citizens have home cooked meals prepared for tourists for a fee. Delectable Cuban food in the privacy and comfort of a Cuban home, incomparable to that at any hotel.. The restaurants outside Old Havana especially served the finest or at the four star hotels outside Havana in the tourist resorts. I wanted to be with the people. Everyone lit up a cigar, was drinking a Mojito or Cuba Libre, (Cuban Rum and coke with lemon), chatting animatedly in Spanish, gesticulating. White Fedora’s dotted the scene. Of course, I bought one and sported it all over Cuba on my way to Vuelto Abajo , one of the finest Tobacco farm in Cuba.The most fascinating thing for me was observing the Santeria women (or obeah women) at work, huge Cuban cigars at the side of their mouths, all kinds of curios and strange things on their tables. Loyal customers lined up outside La Plaza de La Cathedral ( a huge Catholic Cathedral for worship)of all places for advice. Santeria is a mix of African deity worship, catholic worship and prophesy or fortune telling and magic .Just a few yards away a stunning bride was in a carriage with her new husband who displayed a toothy grin of “ownership’ of a prized Cuban beauty off to a new life.New Year’s Eve caught me a top the Hotel Inglaterra Havan Viejo's monument hotel where I stayed), drinking one mojito after another with my American and European friends who lamented the apparent poverty of the place. “.I pondered how the Cuban son and the beautiful women dishing out roses for one Cuban peso would survive; and what if interim President Raul Castro “gave in” to the US, yet the place needed dire restoration and funding. Despite this, there was happiness and revelry in the air on the 60th anniversary of the Revolution. Regardless of the dissidents, Cuba was beloved by the vast majority of Cubans on the island of contradictions. Later that night, I danced the night away with harmonious sonsgters in the many groups that played that night at La Plaza de La Cathedral square, we feted to champagne, Cuban delicacies and Cuba libres and Cuban Ron. Delicioso! Language was no barrier, we danced with everyone and everyone’s partner, taking turns as we dripped in sweat, smelled of cigars and spilled champagne. Havana, is an experience, Cuba is a spirit. It must be experienced to be relished and diarised for posterity.Cuba must sees and do’s:• Vinales, endless tobacco farms - do request cigars.• City of Trinidad, specifically Sancta Spiritus .• Valadero is a huge Cuban beach “spa” with top, modern quality star hotels and all resort areas.• Cabarets (any) ,but the one I enjoyed was at the Hotel Nacionale de Cuba• Cuban Ballet and any cultural performance. Astounding!• Revolution Square, el Capitol• Fine Arts Museums in Havana Viejor and islandwide.• Santiago de Cuba - a very important part of Cuba’s historical life.• Ernest Hemingway’s bedroom• Miramar• Zaparto Marsh and Cayo Coco - for flora and fauna loversRecipes and cigars!:• Do not leave Cuba without a taste of a regular 1 peso Havana Cigar or any of the several they produce. Make sure you buy them from reputable shops or plantations, light up and smoke, chill out!.CubanitoIn an 8oz glass,1/4 oz lemon juice,2 oz white rum,I/4 oz lemon juice salt,3 oz tomato juice,spicy sauce, 1 spoonful of English sauceDelish!Mojito (hey what is Cuba without a mojito?)1 teaspoon sugar½ lemonmix well with a bit of club sodaadd a couple mint leaves (fresh) and crush ( do not damage leaf.2 oz white rumMix and adorn with mint leaves - Do not ever blend this drink!Refreshing and wow! Very sneaky drink!Kimbeware those beggars 0even little kids and scams with pesos, make sure they are from your hotel or the bank."
50,"“havana,city of contrast”","Went to Havana in November 2007.I found it a city of great contrast.Havana is like an old Grande Dame,faded and past her best.Definitley in need of much t.l.c. But,she still delights in ways that no other city I have visited can ever do.I stayed in the Sevilla hotel.5* luxury,Built in 1908 it was the haunt of Al Capone and the like.His room was above mineThe rooms are huge high cielinged and most comfortable.The service was excellent.I hired a vintage car to take my wife and I around the city.Many thanks to Karl our driver and Vivvienne our guide.Not only did they make the tour interesting,but nothing was too much trouble and also they introduced us to the best meal in Cuba.Havana is a city of unbelievable contrasts,from the hotels 5* luxury,Tropicanna's floor show(with a very good dinner) to the old lady in a crumbling tennament 100 yards from my bedroom window washing her clothes on a tiny balcony in a bucket.If I bring one thing from Havana it is the memory of the sheer buzz of the place,the friendliness of the people,and the joy of being able to walk the streets of a capital city feeling safe.To anybody toying with the idea of going to Cuba I would say spend some time in Havana.You will be greatly enriched by the experience of this wonderful city."
40,“GO THERE and take some booty!”,"We didn't really research much about the holiday before we went but we knew it was a place we had on our list of holidays to visit. I think this was better since we didn't have any preconceptions other than a general knowledge of the USA embargo, the troubles they had experienced and the consequential history to explore. The first and overwhelming comment we have is that the people harbour no resentment, anger, blame, or bad feeling for their lot, in fact they are a happy nation.One Canadian traveller put a thorough review on trip advisor and we contacted her about what ""supplies"" to take. We have been to Asia and Africa and know that for a comparatively small outlay in the UK; gifts of stationery (pencils/reporter notepads) and basic toiletries that are scarce there are hugely welcomed. Add to this medicine cabinet type items and half a suitcase was filled for less than £50; a small price for the immense gratitude from those far less fortunate than ourselves.Our first comment is that, like most holiday destinations and especially those unspoilt by commerce, take a good dose of patience - everything happens slower; relax and enjoy the scenery..We stayed at the Hotel Sevilla in Havanna; a grand decorative building, beautifully renovated. It was right beside the Museum of the Revolution (worth a couple of hours and all the information is in English) and walking distance to everything else. We ventured out on our first night and didn't feel at all concerned for our safety. If anything, word has it that no harm will come to tourists as they are very aware that this is precious to their economy. Our room was huge, comfortable and clean although there was no beverage facilities or room service. Their solution to fixing the shower bracket was to move our room; it apparently wasn't possible to get another bracket or bring it from another room to fix ours!Definitely ask reception to arrange a booking for a ""private restaurant"", some residents are allowed to cater in their homes for up to 12 covers providing they meet strict criteria and random inspection visits. We went to Dona Carmela and had a great evening, a lovely host, beautiful surroundings in a decorative garden and a fine meal. Although the taxi will cost you, this unique experience is worth it.Do not bother with dinner at El Patio restaurant; the food is well overpriced and there is a curious contest between the musicians upstairs and downstairs in the square.By all means, sit a while with a beer to admire the spanish cathedral.A Mojito in the Bodeguita del Medio has to be done, and they also serve reasonable food in the bistro behind the bar which is covered in graffiti from Cuban celebrities and visitors alike - take a felt pen and pick your wall space!We wanted a guide for the Capitolo building but having returned after the suggested 2 hours; no-one was available. We did go in alone but it wasn't really satisfying without any explanation; all the notices are in Cuban.Avoid the ""transport museum"", instead go to the rear of the Capitolo to see the unofficial car park for all the 60's cars. Also here is a tobacco factory; the tour staff had been given a week off when we went but I would try again if we return. If you are lucky there is an american guy who works there sometimes who will happily explain the different types and qualities of the famous Havanna cigars.We would not recommend the Tropicana evening unless you are prepared to spend a lot of money to just say ""I was there"" (Taxi $15 each way + $70 - $90 each + $10 dinner; served on paper plates and in the darkness of the show). There is an equally good and much more reasonably priced evening show at Le Parisienne.You will be approached on the streets to buy cigars but the guys are generally friendly and back off when politely rebuffed. Generally no-one begs for stuff but the soap & toiletries were really welcomed by all the people we met. NB if you befriend any staff outside the hotel; go to one of their ""stores"" and pay for something; their rations are insufficient especially for those who have babies or young children. We bought a couple of tins of SMA @ $5 for one of our staff who was only allowed two weeks supply per pm. No-one appears to be hungry or destitute but their diets, minds and enterprise are most definitely ""controlled"".All in all - DO GO and explore this wonderfully unique city.We opted for the private 1/2 day tour instead of our transfer to Varadero (if you ask you may get the costs of the transfer refunded) and since it was just the two of us; we had a jeep and driver to ourselves. We took the chance to ask him to stop off at the non-scheduled tourist sights. We went to a mango famr and ""talked"" with the family who lived there. We weren't able to visit a school as we'd intended as it was a Saturday, so we just called over any village kids along the way and handed out our booty."
50,“Favourite place in Cuba”,"Defnitely the best place we visited in Cuba. Relatively hustler-free for tourists & lots to see and do. Highlights include the chocolate museum (the hot chocolate is heavenly), Revolution museum, area near the Cathedral, Havana Vieja in general is great."
40,“not so safe”,"We went on a tour that included three night in Havana. We were met at the airport by the woman who was to be our tour guide for the next six days. She told us that Havana was safe and there were police on most corners. We sayed at the Habana Libre hotel, which is not the 5min walk from the old town that we were told. Still an ok hotel huge rooms, if a little tired.On our first evening on the way back to the hotel,about 3 streets away I had my bag snatched and they tried to get the camera that my husband had over his head and under his arm. They got away with my liptick and hairbrush!! But it is not a nice experience and my husband had bruises all up his arm.We didnt let it put us off as I do think it can happen anywhere these days.I still think Havana is a beautiful place, it reminds me of Rome, Venice and Malta.The stunning building just falling down. I dont think it has a good overall impression of a pretty place but some parts are great. We loved the bars with the live music and general joy of the dancing, I dare say helped by liberal rum.Cigar factory was worth a visit."
50,“Wonderful Experience”,"We spent 3 wonderful days in Havana in March 07. The Cuban people are enormously proud of their country and visitors are made to feel very welcome. We were told that most Cubans will happily smile and pass foreigners by. Occasionally some will smile, stop and want to practise their English. Occasionally some will smile, stop and their motives are more towards gaining something from you.You may get offered cigars as you are walkiing by. These usually turn out to be 10% tobacco and 90% banana leaf! There are police officers around all the major sites and hotels. We felt safe at all times. And the Cubans do smile all the time.It took us 90 minutes to get through the Immigration and Customs Hall on arrival in Havana. Not sure if this is the norm. Make sure your Visa is filled out correctly. The Immigration Officials are quite fussy regarding this. There is a money exchange in the arrivals hall. The exchange rates in most places seem to be the same. American issued credit cards are not excepted. Take Sterling or Euros. Many places seem to make a charge of 11.24% on any transaction when using a credit card. On departing Cuba make sure you have 25CUC. Cash only. After checking in your bags the Departure Tax Desk is to your leftThe journey from the airport to Havana takes about 30 minutes. We travelled at about 3pm and we got a real glimpse of Cubans going about their daily lifeWe took a guided and informative tour of the city by coach and walking. Organised through our tour company. This included a trip to a rum factory and a tour of the premises. This cost 19CUC. (1.74CUC = £1.00) It was well worth it to gain a perspective of the city. The tour does not take you into any of the sites or museums. It did allow us to get our bearings. The next day we revisited all the sites and spent time in them. Also the coach takes you to Revolution Sq. 20CUC return in a taxi. Generally speaking you will pay to get into all museums and a little extra if you want to take photos.From the Capitol building, most of Old Havana can be reached within a 15 minute walk. The Partagas cigar factory is right behind The Capitol. Tours are every 15 minutes, 10CUC and no photography allowed. Also China Town (There are very few Chinese) is through an arch to the left of the cigar factory. From Parque Central, The Floridita Bar (Hemmingway) is located on Obispo Street. A stroll down this street takes you passed many shops and leads into O’ Reilly, another street. Close buy you will find many other attractions including Museo Ciudad, Plaza de Armas, more bars visisted by Hemmingway (not sure how he found the time to write anything) and the watrefront. This area is in better condition than a lot of Havana. Back towards Parque Central, The Museum of The Revolution is a fascinating insight into the development of the country and not to be missed.The weather was very hot, 31* and walking all day can be draining. Bottled water and soft drinks are readily available in shops. There is still rationing in the country. We found that there was a lack of variety of food, but chicken and rice, sandwiches, pizza etc could always be found. We packed snacks with us from England to make sure we had enough.As beautiful as Havana is, the years of neglect are evident. Many buildings are crumbling away and still have families living in them. If you wander off the main streets you may come across residential areas with filthy streets and children playing baseball with a bit of wood and a stone for a ball. The Cubans love baseball. Take some rubber or tennis balls with you to give to the kids. Be discreet when you give them out or you will have a big group around you once word spreads of your generosity!Tipping is pretty much expected. Just a few cents or 1 CUC can go along way.From the Cubans we spoke to they are respectful for what their country has given them. Some believe that there is a lot they could offer the world which would bring added benefit to their standard of living. Things may change with a different regime. Let's hope that the Cuban people prosper and the integrity of their nation remains.I hope that you enjoy Havana as much as we did."
40,“Havana: Lost Paradise”,"This city is always fascinating, especially when you consider it's very hard to find a place that it just trapped in time.This is the perfect destination for nostalgic people, those who enjoy imagine how a place was before. You do not have to force your mind in Cuba, you are able to see exactly how beautiful the city used to be and how even after years of communism and destruction keep charm and character.If you want to bring some gift consider the following: Shoes are the most appreciated gift for locals, so if you have some you do not use bring them. You will be glad to see the smiles in their faces.Also soap, shampoo, toiletries in general are highly appreciated.Consider those people do not have access to almost anything, something that may sound ridiculous to you can make a big difference to them.Finally is good to say that if you are going there looking for western tourist standards you'll be disappointed. Hotel and restaurat staff are in a slow mood that appears to be like the national culture. But let's be honest: average cuban people work for a ridiculous compensation (like $20 monthly)and they do not have their elemental needs covered.Please just think Cuba is far away from the first world where we live but visiting Havana instead will give you the opportunity to discover something definitely different, appreciate all what you have at home and see a unique city full of history."
30,"“Music great, food poor, air dirty...”","We wanted to see Cuba, particularly Havana, before Castro ceases to hold power. The fantastic architectural beauty in its crumbling state is surreal and some imagination brings this place to life. The people are very kind and generous (but watch out for crafty theives/scammers - mugging is not a problem, however).We spent most of 10 days around Havana. One needn't go far from tourist areas to see the filthy tiny apartments that people are forced to live in. The oppressive government spawns pockets of capitalism that cater to the tourist trade: non-official taxis, guides, cigar-hawkers. This is the only way for a Cuban to get extra pesos beyond their 15 pesos/mo salary.Maps of Havana and Cuba were sold at the airport in Havana. Taxi to our hotel in Vedado (part of Havana) was 25 pesos(CUC). Try to collect small change because nearly every public bathroom in Havana (even in hotels/restaurants) charges money - 10c(CUC) is good and will buy you some toilet paper as well. Learning basic Spanish phrases is nearly essential, as few people other than taxi drivers and guides speak much English.We saw an amazing band of 6 guys playing real Cuban music at the intimate setting of the Monserrate bar in downtown old Havana. They are 2 nights on/1 off. Food there is cheap and the usual quality for Havana. There is no variety in Cuban restaurant food due to limited supply, so expect lots of white bread, cheese, and ham, and any combination of the above. Eating beef gets a Cuban into HUGE trouble, so your hamburgers are made of something, but not beef. Also, they don't use salt or pepper and you'll wish you'd brought your own if even for the scrambled eggs at breakfast!We learned the hard way that anything left on your bed is considered a gift for the maid. Don't mistakenly leave your hairbrush or clothing! Gifts like socks, american magazines, toothbrushes, shampoo, and soap left on your pillow will result in fancy towel-characters from your maid. People on the street ask tourists for pens, chiclets, shampoo, and soap (pencils not wanted, however)."
50,“Havana is the place to be”,"Cuba is the best! After spending 9 lazy days at Brisas Hotel, Guardalavaca my partner and I were more than ready to visit Havana. What an amazing place! So much history (we'd read a lot before we arrived and also during the lazy days on the beach). The people were very friendly, of course there were hustlers but we're both from the Caribbean and used to this. Who wouldn't hustle if they were poor? We had a fantastic time, didn't feel threatened at any time - even walking around areas which we wouldn't dream of going to in London or Jamaica. No visit to Cuba would be complete without spending time in Havana. We would definitely go back there and spend more time in Havana and less on the beach."
50,“Old Havana”,"What a fabulous city! I only wish I had travelled here four or five years ago, because the tone of the city is changing with ever increasing tourism. Go as soon as you can. It is a city caught in a time warp - wonderful vintage American cars in various states of disrepair, beautiful buildings that range from crumbling to immaculately restored due to UNESCO designation of Havana as a heritage site. There is poverty here, but the people we encountered were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased to see tourists.In some areas of the city, particulary the Capital building area and the flea market tourists are hassled. Be warned that anyone offering to take your picture expects a tip, including the employees in the museums.If you are looking for good souveniers at reasonable prices, look for a government ""Artex"" store - prices are regulated and are the same throughout the country.Spend a few hours in ""Old Havana"", the other, more modern areas of Miramar, Vedado, Revolution Square are interesting but are no comparison to the Old city."
40,“warm and wonderful”,"I had the most wonderful time in havana in july 2003.Occasionally,you would run into a few cigar and handicraft sellers who would try to give you ""the best deal"",but they were easliy discouraged.I highly recommend staying in a 'casa particular'which is a room rented out in someones home.We stayed at Villa Miriam,owned by Miriam who is a theatre actress.She runs a lovely,quaint house and with 2 meals and lodging it comes to about 45$/nite.However, if you like the luxury of a hotel I recommend Hostal Los Frailes in old havana- beautiful, quiet and clean.It is an old city and not ideal for a person who needs modern amenities and services.The music and the people are entertaining.dont miss the art museum!!!"
40,“Cool Florida”,"For the urbane traveller, the Hotel Florida may be the place to stay in Havana. It is on the Calle Obispo which is a main shopping street in the Old City and it a recently converted private house that has a good restuarant. The rooms vary but they all have marble lined bathrooms and some have high ceilings and a balcony.It is convenient to the Museums and the craft market on the edge of the old city. The staff is attentive, friendly and discreet. I was not sure how they would react to bringing in any of the many whores that offer companionship but I gather that the Cubans are practical and pragmatic.Shopping is so-so and there are interesting things relating to Santeria which can be found among the usual tourist junk in the shops and stalls. Look for effigies of elegba with seashell eyes and a little spike on its head, there are numerous paintings for sale and some are interesting, most are almost Haitian in style. Other stuff include well made wooden boxes covered in coconut shell, little terracotta whistles and papier mache decorations. Other good buys are local musical instruments and local CDs. The Buena Vista Social Club CD galvanised Cuban tourism and earned Ry Cooder the enemity of the US trade department (despite an intevention from Clinton) who have banned him from working in Cuba.The food in general is pretty bland and dry and I would suggest that you carry sachets of sauces to help spice up the meals. There is a total absence of fast food and advertising so fat people are rare. the Cubans are very friendly and hospitable but beware of hustlers who try and sell you cigars or offer to be your friend-for-a-day. These are called jinteros and range from personable and helpful to tiresome and aggressive.I would reccommed the Arab restuarant in the old city. The Chinese quarter is a gyp and filled with embarassed looking employees in fake chinese outfits. The food looks like normal Cuban food in any case.The Tropicana nightclub offers a spectacular fifties extravaganza in a Rat Pack style settfinitely for the older nostalgic crowd. Better to spend the money listening to live music and giving it to the many needy people who are remarkably cheerful.You may want to bring small bars of soap and shampoo or candy as presents to the people you meet. Pens are always appreciated.Finally, avoid the five star horror hotels in Miramar. They are expensive, isolated and filled with jacketed servitors at every ten feet. The athmosphere is that of being under constant surveillance and not at all pleasant. The food is better than elsewhere but very expensive. Try and remember that the average monthly wage is $20 when ordering."
10,“Beautyful island - vacation in prison”,"I stayed one week for vacation in Havana. The city is still falling apart and the behavior of the people as well. First stayed at the Cohiba, really awful, never again. Then moved to a ""casa particular"", which is something like a guest-house. Run by a cuban living in europe and his family and his friends. The price was 30 $ a night including breakfast and well worth it. In Cuba you will not be robbed on the street; the thieves are in the restaurants, in the hotels or they wear police uniforms. We went to the Playa del Este and stayed for some hours on the tourist beach Santa Maria. Every ten to fifteen minutes police patrols arrived and asked cubans for their i.d.: cubans who dared to look to us, not even speaking to us, were taken in hand cuffs to the local police station and stayed there for one or two days. A digital camera was stolen by an employee of the beach restaurant. Nothing happened, because he works for the police. In the small beach restaurants they charge you the same prices like in Key West, but for nothing. A part of the money goes to the policemen on the beach .... The same happens in Havana. If a policeman, they are on every corner, thinks that a cuban woman or man is trying to talk or even to look to you, they were asked for their i.d. and quite often taken immediately to prison. That means you have to avoid any contact to cubans, otherwise they get into trouble. In the hotels cubans are not allowed to visit tourists or to go their rooms, officialy to avoid prostitution. There are some exceptions: Jinateiras working together with the police are allowed to the rooms. You can be sure that they steal what ever they get and give it to the security of the hotel. Avoid to rent a car in cuba, try to get a prepaid reservation from ur country. In Cuba you will pay the highest price per day in your life for the most awful and dangerous car (around 80 $ per day for a ten years old japanese small car). Be careful at gas stations: they will give you gas for 2 $ but charge you 20 in Miramar. Nice decoration, awful and unfriendly service from the owner, incredible high prices and in plus the owner asks for at least 10 $ extra tip! Cuba is a wonderful island with charming and poor people but the country is suffering under the pressure of a corrupt police state."
30,“Off to Havana Souvenir Stalls”,"Our Conquest Vacation Representative gave us this brochure during our Orientation at our hotel Arenas Doradas, and recommended these tours. We went on the Colonial Havana tour given by Rumbos Cuba, which cost $46 US per person.We picked this tour because it was described as a chance to see the ""culture"" and the ""history"". But it also included ""free time for shopping"". ""Remember to look for the famous cigars"". On the way to Havana we stopped at the Yumuri Valley gorge. There were lots of tour buses. There was a small group of musicians, a small cafeteria and lots of souvenir stalls. The view is breathtaking, although there were turkey vultures flying around below.It was a good thing I brought my Fodor's ""Exploring Cuba"" book with me, as it was a do-it-yourself tour. The people who did not have books were lost, as they did not know what they were looking at. All the signs are in Spanish. There is nothing describing some buildings, and no one speaks English. There are people waiting in every nook and cranny of every building begging for a ""tip"". There are people on the streets begging for ""tips"" for no other reason other than they are Cuban, you are looking at them, so you should tip them. If you ask them a question, they swarm you and beg for a ""tip"". It was quite frightening.The guide gave half-hearted, brief descriptions of a few buildings and rushed us over to the Cigar shop. The cigar shop was in the fort, Castillo de la Real Fuerza and La Giraldilla; symbol of the city and Havana Club Rum is on a turret in the fort. The guide did not mention any of this; I visited it myself, and read about it in my book. I asked her about The Christ on the Hill, which could also be seen from the Castillo de la Real Fuerza, and she said, ""yes that's Jesus Christ"". I could see it is Jesus Christ, I wanted to know its significance. My book had the description; it is a 66-foot high marble statue over the harbour at Casablanca, etc. She ran us by El Templete and could not tell me about the ceiba tree. I took a picture of a band of stilt walkers theatrical musical presentation who were going up and down the streets and I had to run from one woman who chased me for a tip for taking their picture.We were taken to the Palacio de los Capitanes and were told that it would cost us $2 US to take pictures inside. There were attendants sitting in every room who accosted us as we walked into the room to look around. It was most irritating.I expected to be hot and thirsty, and I was, but our lunch started with a steaming bowl of hot soup. I had a headache from the heat. I thought I would be able to rest at lunch, but shortly after we sat in our seats at the restaurant, the entertainment started. There were young female flamenco dancers. My headache got worst as they stamped and stamped on stage, and then came down for ""tips"" after the performance. In the restaurant some prostitutes came in and blocked the washroom door. One of the men in our group tried to go into the washroom but they blocked his way and said he had to pay them to get in. He was very upset. The prostitutes left. The Restaurant Management ignored them and did not address the problem. There were tip plates outside the washroom. I don't know why. There were no attendants in that washroom.After lunch we were dropped off at the sea of souvenir stalls, and given some ""free time for shopping"". I asked the guide if I could hand out the pens and notebooks, etc I brought to the locals, and she said yes. Very bad advice. As soon as the locals realized I was giving out stuff, I was swarmed. I had to run into a church to get away from them.We were then driven around to Revolution Square. We were usually hurried away from where there was nothing to purchase. We were hurried through the Columbus cemetery. The tour guide did not have much to say about there except they took us to La Milagrosa the tomb of the miracle woman and the guide gave us a little info on that. There was nothing to purchase there.We were then taken to El Floridita, the bar where Hemmingway frequented and were told we could use the washroom. Our guide left us there and told us to meet her at El Capitolio. She was hoping we would buy some drinks. No one did. We all walked over to El Capitolio and sat around.I read in my Fodor's guide about Cuba's oldest mailbox, dated 1841, in Plaza de la Catedral, and I asked our guide about it. She said it is no longer there, and showed no interest in discussing it with me. I was somewhat disappointed with this tour, mainly because of the lack of interest of the guide in promoting the historical significance of the city. I got the impression that the city was being gutted of its antiquity. It seems key artifacts or buildings are arbitrarily removed or changed. If this continues, then Havana will end up as an island of souvenir stalls.To the Cuban tourist board, people visit Europe to view its antiquity, not to visit souvenir stalls. I would recommend that you go into Havana with a tour guide otherwise the locals will harass you. I also recommend you purchase a Spanish dictionary. I highly recommend that you purchase a Fodor's guide on Cuba before you leave for the trip. Havana is overwhelming, it is best to read a bit about the city before you visit it.The tour guides seem to know very little of the history of the buildings, or artifacts. It is too vast and too complex, you would need a History Professor to be able to discuss the artifacts etc.Also, brace yourself for the locals begging for tips. They are aggressive and plentiful."

40,“Для тех кто любит колониальный стиль”,"Гавана один из древних колониальных городов в Карибском бассейне. К сожалению весь город на 80% требует реставрации, поэтому приготовьтесь..!!! Я бы разделил город на три основных сектора: 1) Старая Гавана (Капитолий, Китайский Квартал районы рядом). Жить там не советую... 2) Район Ведадо Средняя часть Малекона, гостиницы Гавана Либре, Национать, 23 Авеню. Самое движение там весело и прикольно. 3) Район 5-й Авеню.

50,“<La Habana Cuba”,"La Ciudad de Cuba es maravillosa, todo mundo deberia de darse un tiempo para conocerla, y romper con muchos Mitos que hablan de ella, primero la gente es Lindisima quiere mucho en especial al mexicano, es muy alegre, en mis recorridos por las calles y su centro te cuidan te miman te informan no roban no piden nada este es un mito que hay, ademas que al llegar a Cuba no te sellan tu pasaporte para que no tengas problemas con los países principalmente USA que luego te impiden su ingreso a ellos por el solo hecho de visitar Cuba, todo es barato mas o menos en costo del dolar en Mex fui en el 2013 y el dolar en Mex estaba en 13.95 allá me recibieron mi moneda Mex y me cambiaron en el aeropuerto por CUC Cubano controlado a 14.00 también en todos los hoteles hay casas de cambio, en Varadero tienes en todos los Hoteles los 3 alimento todo incluido y en la Habana solo el Desayuno en verdad vale la pena visitar la Linda Cuba fui 4 dias y pienso regresar ahora 7 días se las recomiendo muy ampliamente no se van a arrepentir de haber viajado a testa bella isla del caribe."
40,“Разруха :(”,"Конечно, мы ждали большего от Гаваны. По факту, это город, который когда-то был красив. Сейчас практически все пришло в упадок. Здания в колониальном стиле практически разрушены. Кое-где ведутся реставрационные работы, но общее впечатление от этого не улучшается. Прогуляться по старым улочкам, однозначно, стоит. Старый город, не смотря ни на что, очень понравился. Кроме того, Гавана, как, видимо, и вся Куба, - музей ретро-автомибилей под открытым небом."

50,“Inmejorable y inolvidable”,"Nuestra opinion es immejorable. Superó nuestras espectativas. Vacaciones inolvidables gracias a la estancia, la atención y sobretodo a los momentos compartidos. Me repito a otras opiniones que és estar como en casa, pero, és verdad."
40,“à visiter”,"Vaut le détour et/ou même un séjour de 2-3 jourstrès belle architecture, beaucoup d'histoire... de nombreux endroits à visiter qu'une visite d'une seule journée ne peut satisfaire... les resto sont sont biens et tarifs ok. Pour ceux qui auraient eux la chance de visiter Carthagène en Colombie il y a eux beaucoup de similarités mais en plus grand..."
40,“La Havane”,"La vieille partie de cette ville est très, très jolie. Notre guide était très sympathique mais néanmoins allez-y par vous même. On aurait pu croire qu'elle bénéficiait d'une ristourne pour les visites de lieux mercantiles."
50,“Una ciudad para recorrer”,"La Habana es una ciudad para recorrer, una mezcla de arquitectura española y art deco, es bueno ir a la ciudad vieja y contratar un guia en la Plaza de Armas para recorrerla a pie y descubrir un monton de encantos ocultos. Si pueden busquen a Cristobal, un genio"
50,“Ciudad de contrastes”,"Hermosa ciudad, rodeada de mar y malecones. Edificios antiguos que recién están recuperando y, al no tener un gran parque automotor el tráfico es muy ordenado.Es una lástima que no puedan mantener mejor el exterior de las viviendas."
40,“Encanto”,"Pasamos dos días maravillosos en la ciudad.Mantienen el encanto de lo tipico la Bodeguita del Medio me fascino, es bella y muy divertido, tomar un mojito, y escuchar muy buena musica, La comida es tipica. Me gusto el malecon, el Hotel Nacional, la Habana historica y su gente pintoresca."
30,“Visitez la Havane par vous même...”,"Nous n'avons pas aimés le tour guidé, car on passe trop de temps en autobus et pas assez de temps pour visiter. C'est une très belle ville à visiter, mais faites-la sans tour guidé si vous voulez en profiter."
20,“Solo para interesados”,"Es un lugar con mucha historia, valido solo para quienes esten interesados en conocer mas sobre el pais y sus costumbres. No aconsejo para gente que quiera visitar xq si. Barrios muy pobres que lo ponen a uno muy triste"
30,“Tour non complet”,On a presque rien vu de cette ville si fascinante. Tour fait par Air Transat Toutes les choses qu'on aurait voulu voir ne faisait pas parti de notre tour . Guide au nom de Dimas fatiguant qui a parle a 80% de sa vie a lui.
50,"“Linda La Habana,tiene su encanto propio.”","Su historia,su arquitectura es preciosa,su gente.Lo que no me gustó su pobreza y la falta de alimentos para los Cubanos."
50,"“La Havane, ville magnifique”","Nous avons grandement aimés l'architecture de la vieille Havane et en apprendre davantage sur sa riche histoire. Nous avons fait une visite guidée ce qui nous as permis de voir directement les principaux points d'attraction. Mais en une journée, c'est court pour tout visiter. Pour goûter pleinement à l'ambiance de la Havane, il faut presque y prévoir 3 jours, mais une visite guidée d'une journée nous en donne un bref aperçu. De plus comme nous partions de Varadero, nous sommes passé à travers la ville de Matanzas où nous avons pu voir davantage la réelle vie cubaine, en dehors des touristes. Les paysages sur le chemin sont sublimes!!"
50,“Vacaciones”,"Estuvimos 2 días en La Habana para conocer su gente, su cultura. Viajar te enseña a mirar la vida de otra manera."
40,“con dos dias sobra”,"visitar la habana ( ciudad) creo que con dos dias sobra si tus vacaciones estan en la playa de varadero o en los callos , no no gastaria mas de esos dias alli o haria como muchos que se van solo a las playas y toman un tour de visita alaciudad por el dia , con eso sobra!!!"
40,“Visite de la Havane Colonial”,"A faire, malgré le trajet de 2h30 c'est très intéressant, explication de chacune des villes ou l'on passe. La guide nous explique toute la vrai histoire de Cuba, je croyais le savoir, mais j'ai appris beaucoup de chose que je ne savais pas sur Cuba. Le ville de la Havane est magnifique, les batiments historiques le sont tout autant. Je le recommande fortement, et c'est sur que je vais y retourner."
50,“viaje al pasado”,"Ralmente estar en la Habana es un viaje al pasado,por la edificacion ,por los automóviles (aunque también hay últimos modelos,y por la amabilidad de su gente.Se puede caminar por todos lados y a cualquier hora con toda tranquilidad.Recorrer el malecón,tomar un Diquiri junto a E. Hemingway en el Floridita,almorzar en la Bodeguita del Medio y tomar un Mojito en el Hotel Nacional y asistir a la ceremosnia del cañonazo son recorridos que no se pueden perder,forman parte de la historia de Cuba."
50,“Crece día con día”,"Mucha gente no viaja a Cuba pues tiene una impresión completamente equivocada. Anímate a hacer ese viaje, de preferencia quédate de 4 a una semana en la Habana, y si puedes trata de alquilar un departamento desde tu país o vía internet, reducirás costos y hay de todo tipo, hasta mansiones con alberca súper cuidadas."
40,“toda una experiencia”,"Puede resultar chocante la realidad en la que viven como contraste con varadero. Pero vale la pena conocer su historia y verla de frente, recomiendo recorrer la habana sin temores es muy segura y rica en cultura. Experiencia transformadora."
40,“Volveria a cuba”,me gusto el trato de la gente y la historia de la habana vieja/notengo quejas.me gusto la catedral el fuerte camine por el malecon tome un mojito en la bodeguita del medio fui al cabaret Parissien un muy buen espectaculo todo me gusto
40,“Historia viva”,"Que decir de un lugar con tanta historia , solo llegar te pone la piel de gallina , gente muy amable y para nada pesada como nos habian dicho , ( las tienen bien vigiladas) sus callecitas con estilo Europeo son muy lindas para transitar , se respira historia y Revolucion a cada paso."
40,“Muy bueno”,"Interesante la antiguedad, es importante estar cerca de la Habana vieja porque sino no hay nada que hacer. No hay shoppings, nada...."
50,“La Habana que linda...”,"Pasamos tres dias en la Capital de Cuba recorriendo sus calles, conociendo su gente, degustando su gastronomia, y la pasamos muy bien"
50,“habana spettacolo!!!!!!!!!!!”,"la habana è uno spettacolo sempre in festa, la salsa da tutte le parti, la cordialità del popolo, il fascino di una città incantevole!!!!!!!!!!!!"
30,“esta igual o peor que hace 10 años”,"la habana esta como siempre o peor que hace diez años que estuve, es una ciudad muy bonita podria ser un paraiso pero esta destrozado, y la gente tambien, osea que no recomiendo ir alli a pasar tus vacaciones por que puedes venir, estresado, agobiado y sin dinero"
50,“A ne pas manquer”,Impossible de se rendre à Cuba sans visiter La Havane. Endroit rempli d'histoire fabrique à cigares fabrique du bon Havana club. La ville et son architecture sont incontournables. Vous y verez aussi la place de la révolution.
50,“Playas del Este”,"Frente al htl Inglaterra a unos pasos del capitolio, se encuentran unos autobuses que cobran al rededor de 3cuc por persona y es un viaje redondo que pasa cada media hra y los llevan a playas del este, la playa mas cercana a la Habana donde el agua esta calientita y si van en nov ni una alma ahi, lo malo son las malas aguas que si te tocan, te arde, una playa verdaderamente hermosa"
30,“no muy ameno”,"la habana es una mescla de viejo y moderno de maltratado y vistoso . no me impresiono verdaderamente se nota un poco de abandono en sus multiples y variadas edificaciones ,la poblacion capitalina tiene el humor tipico del cubano pero se nota cierta preocupacion hacia el que viene mañana ,los restaurantes en su totalidad son regulares .para los amantes de un buen helado[ice cream]recomendaria un establecimiento llamado coppelia situado en las inmediaciones de las calles 23 y 12 ,el malecon habanero aunque muy concurrido por los capitalinos merece ser visitado tiene areas para refrescarte con un buena bebida nacional o importada aunque a veces la higiene circundante al igual que en cualquier otra capital te impida pasarte al limite.en fin la habana contrario a la playa de varadero no me impresiono tal vez sea por que esperaba algo que superara mis expectativas?"
40,“adorei conhecer...”,"Para quem vai a Cuba deverá ir a Havana, cidade muito bonita,a beira mar, com duas areas destintas parte historica e parte moderna a cultura e origens deste bonito pais centram-se sobretudo nesta região."
20,“Ouf..”,"Quelle belle ville ! L'architecture est superbe, cependant on se fait achalé partout partout dans les moindres recoins. Beaucoup d'attrapes touristes. Vraiment fatigant de se faire quêter tout le temps...Dommage!"
40,“La Habana”,a mi entender solo para pocos días. Una ciudad muy historica pero un poco triste por la pobreza o humildad que se nota en todas partes.
40,“Parados nos anos 50”,"Havana velha, mistica, única. Fui lá 2 vezes e voltarei. Povo muito acolhedor, cultura muito rica."
50,“pour nouvelle frontiére”,"LA ville a visité en allant à cuba !Si vous passez par nouvelle frontiére, je vons conseille vivement de demander RAMON , qui est guide touristique mais surtout un ancien Professeur diplomé de l'histoire de Cuba , ils nous a fait découvrir Cuba de fond en comble sans pour autant se sentir comme un touriste !Juste incroyable à découvrir !"
40,“Vaya fiestas en la habana”,"Yo creo que si vas a cuba y no visitas la habana no has ido a cuba. Debes tener en cuenta que si llevas a tu novia posiblemente nunca vuelvas a verla. Que barbaro la habana. visita el Salon Rojo, luego me cuentas"
40,“paseo lleno de historia.”,"nos gustaron sus calles,la limpieza que vimos en ellas,las iglesias,la primer farmacia,un poco me molestó,que me persigan pidiendo a cada rato caramelos."
40,“Ciudad limpia y ordenada.-Sin vandalismo ni violencia”,Sus hermosos taxis-La sencillez y simpatia de la gente
10,"“No vayan, no hay motivo.”","Cuba no es lo que dicen, la gente no es amistosa, ni romántica, todos están resentidos contra los turistas y los ven con mucho odio.Un cubano nos siguió por la calle insultándonos porque no quisimos hablar con el, ya que los pocos cubanos que te hablan es para darte consejos turísticos no requeridos y pedirte dinero.Cuba es muy cara, los servicios muy malos, te tratan como si te dieran las cosas gratis y son mas caras que en Europa.No hay razón para ver esta ciudad puedo nombrar miles de ciudades en centro América y el caribe que merecen más una visita.Sobre todo porque no te vas a sentir mal tratado y odiado todo el tiempo como en Cuba.La verdad que por la actitud de la gente de miedo estar ahí.Y si hay quien trata de llevarte a conocer la ciudad y meterte en un callejón oscuro para robarte lejos de la policía.Vayan a otro lugar, Cuba no es recomendable para nadie."
50,“La Habana...............”,"Quedamos encantadas con esta hermosa,pintorezca ciudad,su historia,su gente,sus hermosos bares,La Floridita,La Bodeguita del medio,el museo de la revolución,su mercado de artesanías en la Habana vieja,un viaje que nunca olvidaremos,su gente por demás hospitalariaaaaaaaaaaa"
40,“Emilie et Yves a la Havane”,"Comme c'est la 3 fois pour Mimi,en général les guides connaissent très bien le site à chaque fois les guides sont différents donc les informations different et se complètent,on en apprend un peu plus à chaque fois.Le temps passe en autobus est parfait pour un cours accélère sur Cuba et les cubains,le circuit à été différents les trois fois donc agréable.Les gens à la havane sont beaucoup plus froids et intolérants,si on prend des photos des gens (surtout des gens costumes) ils vous demanderons de l'argent.Beaucoup de sollicitation durant votre visite dans la vieille Havane pour vous vendre à peu près n'importe quoi.Mais si vous êtes en forme car il y a beaucoup de marche,et un bon repas,vous aimerer."
50,“À visiter!”,"Nous sommes allés à La Havane avec l'excursion vendue par Voyage Transat. C'était bien mais si c'était à refaire, j'irais par mes propres moyens en taxi ou en autobus et j'aimerais pouvoir davantage circuler librement dans les rues de cette magnifique ville."
40,“Habana die Stadt der 50 er Jahre”,"Besonders haben mir die alten Autos gefallen, hier fühlt man sich wie zu James Deans Zeiten. Eine herrliche alte schöne Stadt mit freundlichen Menschen, die noch nicht zu sehr vom Tourismus verwöhnt sind. Wenig Bettler, freundliche fröhliche menschen, die gerne singen und tanzen und das einfache Leben lieben. Zufriedene Menschen von der Sonne verwöhnt"
50,“Históricamente interesante”,"Muy rica históricamente, es fascinante hablar con la gente que vive allí pero hay mucha pobreza.Recomiendo leer algo antes de ir así se aprovecha mucho mas"
30,“rico”,en los paladares se come rico y baratosolo hay que tener en cuenta de escoger los que son buenos como los que estan en frente del capitolio en la habana
40,“Très belle ville à visiter”,"Une journée c'est pas assez, nous y retournerons. Belle ville historique, belle architecture des immeubles. Une belle ville à marcher tranquillement pour profiter pleinement de l'ambiance.Nous avons acheté notre forfait d'une journée sur la plage par un représentant connu de l'hôtel, avons payé moins cher qu'avec le grossiste du voyage. Avons voyagé en minibus, ce qui nous a permis de passer à des endroits où les gros autobus ""voyageurs"" ne passent pas. Nous étions 7 passagers. J'y retourne c'est certain."
40,“la habana es única”,una ciudad distinta a todo lo conocido por lo vieja que es pero con mucha personalidad.
50,“un encanto”,"vale la pena!!!!!!!! no dejen de caminar por su ciudad vieja, el malecon, tomarse un taxi, parar en los barcitos ,donde siempre tenes grupo tocando su maravillosa musica."
40,“La Havane”,"J'ai visiter avec guide , 2 heures aller 2 heures retour , maintenant je suis mieux informer , adorer ca , mais cette ville mérite que j'y retourne tellement quelle a un beau cachet , donc je conseil d'y passer deux ou trois jours avec coucher , puis le reste des vacances a l'endroit a votre choix ...."
50,“arrepentida de no destinar mas dias a esta ciudad hermosa”,"de la Habana solo puedo decir que es hermosa, si bien no conte con varios dias para recorrerla, solo estuve 1 dia y medio, conoci la habana vieja, y de pasada la nueva. Me encanto todo de ella, sus calles su gente, sus transportes, su comida, todo todo, es una ciudad segura, lo unico que es molesto el tema de los vendedores insisten cada vez que uno ingresa a sus locales, y de alguna manera es una obligacion comprar, lo bueno es que uno regatea el precio y saca ventajas con los costos de otros locales. Consejo... NO SE PAREN CUANDO LES OFRECEN HABANOS, SON TODOS TRUCHOS, TODOSS.Mas alla de esto, me quede enamorada de esta ciudad"
40,“Muy pintoresca”,"Si es la primera vez que uno va a Cuba, si o si hay q pasar por La Habana, aunque sea 2 dias. Es raro ver tantos autos viejos de la década del 50, de todos los colores. Andar en coco taxi me encanto! y obviamente recorrer la habana nueva, habana vieja, la bodeguita del medio, la plaza de armas, la plaza de la revolución, el capitolio, el parque central, el mercado San Jose de artesanias, el famoso malecon! Se puede recorrer todo en un dia!!!"
40,“ciudad con contrastes muy llamativo y atractivo”,sus construcciones sus vehiculos no me gusto la situacion economica con que viven los cubanos
50,“Excelente”,Esta ciudad es hermosa dos días se hacen muy poco....
50,“Excursion merveilleuse”,"La guide Nellie connaîssait sa matière. Nous avons beaucoup appris sur la culture des habitants de Cuba, leur histoire. L'architecture de la Havane coloniale est belle à voir. La visite du musée municipale était correct, mais les employés demandent des pesos dans toutes les salles pour leurs petits-enfants, nous avons moins aimé celà. Dans la rue, les gens demandent des camisoles, du dentifrice etc. Nous le savions pas donc nous n'étions pas préparer à celà. Le repas inclut au Douze apôtres était excellent."
50,“une ville superbe”,"quel dépaysement, ville très sympa, pas du tout d'insécurité, on peut se balader le soir tard sans problème. de la musique partout, des gens qui vous interpelle pour savoir d'où vous venez et qui se mettent à discuter sans aucune mendicité en arrière plan une très bonne adresse de casa particular à vous donner si vous le souhaitez"
50,“Emoción pura.”,"Sin lugar a dudas, la mejor ciudad que conocemos hasta el día de hoy. La calidez de la gente es sumamente destacable. Llena de historia, la habana es simplemente hermosa."
40,“Havanna muss man gesehen haben”,"Von Varadero aus waren wir mit einer kleinen Gruppe in La Habana. Die ALtstadt ist sehr sehenswürdig. Vorsicht: jeder will für írgendetwas Geld: die in Landestracht gekleideten Damen, die Küsschen verteieln, der alte Herr im weißen Fabrikantenanzug mit Zigarre, die kleinen bettelnden Kinder.Ins Stadtbild gehören auch die Schwarzhändler. Das neue Kuba ist vor allem triste Regierungsbauten, die an DDR-Besuche erinnern."
50,“tres belle ville”,"quand on aime les vieilles voitures ça fait plaisir, surtout qu'elles sont très bien entretenues et pour cause les cubains ne peuvent s'acheter autre chose puisqu'ils sont payé avec des pesos Cubains et non convertibles contrairement a la monnaie que l'on nous donne et qu'avant de pouvoir se payer une voiture ils leurs faudrait des siècles. Allez voir les boutiques ou les cubains peuvent acheter l'alimentation qu'ils payent avec des ticket de rationnement comme chez nous pendant la guerre!!!! et après on vous vante les mérites de Cuba. je dis vive la liberté"
50,“Un lugar inolvidable”,"La gente, los lugares. Todo es pura magia. No estuvimos demasiado tiempo, pero alcanzamos a ver los lugares mas importantes."
50,“pintoresco total”,"No tuve mucho tiempo de recorrer la haban porque fui por un solo dia un par de horas, pero lo poco que pude ver me parecio fascinante. Es salir totalmente de la burbuja capitalista en la que vivimos, y a mi parecer esta muy bueno cada tanto ver un poco de realidad. Si van a la Habana tienen q ir si o si, a la plaza de la revolucion, al capitolio, y por supuesto no dejar de conocer la bodeguita del medio y el tropicana si pueden."
50,“La Habana”,es muy pintoresca y al igual que en varadero toda su gente es muy educada y amable
50,“Affascinante...”,"L'Havana è una città sicuramente particolare. Molto interessante e pittoresca la parte vecchia. Impossibile entrare alla Boteguita del Medio, troppa ressa. Occhio a chi vi offre affari per la strada (sigari non riconosciuti dallo stato e quindi non esportabili, talvolta fatti con foglie di banana). D'effetto la piazza con le immagini del Che e di Castro."
50,“Unica”,"Muy interesante ciudad, recomiendo ir a la cámara oscura,"
50,“visite de la havane”,"très belle visite mais pas assez de temps pour visiter la havane dans sont ensemble. Pris visite guidé en français avec très bonne description de la ville, de la politique et de ces leaders.Resto inclus dans le tour étais bon.Le seul bémol c'est le transport qui prend à lui seul pour ce rendre c'est 2 heures aller et 2 heures retours sans compter tout les arrêts dans les hôtels pour déposer ou prendre les gens pour remplir l'autobus."
50,“bien mantenida”,"estan restaurandola entera la mantienen mas limpia y estan arreglando el capitolio, el teatro real y todas las casas de malecon"
10,“EL CALOR DE CUBA”,En cuba hace tanto calor que no se puede caminar por la habanaLos Hoteles estan bien pero la ciudad se esta quedando vieja. No reconstruyen los edificios y cada año que vamos se ve peor. Seguramente volveremos pero no creo que estemos en la habana. Nos han dicho que en Holguin y Santa Maria hay buenos Hoteles. El NH esta bastante bien pero al salir te das cuenta de la realidad. Si podeis dar una propina a la gente os lo va a agradecer. Son buenos pero pide mucho. Lo otro que estresa son los de los caballos. POr cierto tomaros un Mohito en el Floridita y no dejeis de visitarla Bodeguita. Menudos Mohitos hacen alli. Si quereis mas informacion me mandais un msn que esto ya lo tengo mas que visitado. Feliz viaje
50,“Nostalgie des Verfalls”,"Havanna ist neben Trinidad eine der reizendsten Städte, die ich je besucht und besichtigt hab. Obwohl die Stadt durch die ständig präsente Gefahr von Hurrikans und das feuchte Klima massiv bedroht ist und man mit Renovierungen kaum nachkommt, macht gerade der überall sichtbare Verfall den Charme dieser Stadt aus. Dazu noch die karibische Lebensfreude und Freundlichkeit der Menschen, einen kühlen Mojito im Schatten der mächtigen Kathedrale und das Paradiesgefühl ist perfekt. Die ganze Altstadt ist Fußgängerzone, so kann man unbeschwert alle Sinne schweifen lassen. Es gibt unzählige Bars und Restaurants, viele mit Live-Musik. Besonders empfehlenswert ist ein Besuch der Havana Rum Fabrik mit Führung und anschließender Verkostung. Man sollte nicht verabsäumen, die beiden Hemingway Bars zu besuchen (Bodeguite del medio ist eher klein und touristisch überfüllt, Floridita ist die elegantere, etwas größere Variante .. aber beide einen Besuch wert!). Wenn man Havanna von obern betrachten möchte, steigt man gegen ein geringes Eintrittsgeld auf der Turm der Kirche San Francisco oder begibt sich auf die andere Seite des Hafens, wo sich u.a. das Che Guevara Museum und die überdimensionale Christusstatue befinden. Ein frühabendlicher Spaziergang im Licht der untergehenden Sonne am Malecon (Uferpromenade) entlang empfiehlt sich nicht nur für Verliebte, die Stimmung ist für jedermann ein Traum. Abschließend sei noch das Hotel Nacional erwähnt, Luxushotel auf einem Hügel gelegen. Die Zimmerpreise sind eigentlich für europ. Verhältnisse gar nicht so überteuert. Eine Besichtigung des Hotels samt Mojito in der schönen Gartenanlage lohnt allemal."
50,"“La Habana, sorprendente en cada espacio!!!”","Quizás porque no hice el circuito que compran los turistas por la Ciudad sino que pude conocer en cuatro días sus buses y compartir con su gente, el ballet Nacional de Cuba y conversar con sus protagonistas. El cuidado de su historia, la revalorización arquitectónica ,todo es sorprendente, en especial su gente a la que admiro y respeto mucho.Gracias a todos por el cariño que nos dieron en cada lugar.Espero volver a estar allí."
50,“La musica inebria...la gente ti scalda...l'atmosfera è d'altri tempi.”,"Non descriverò monumenti, nè darò notizie pratiche, ma offrirò le emozioni che ho provato. Prime fra tutte la musica : struggente, malinconica, romantica, o allegra e vivace. Sempre e ovunque musica e musica Cubana, che è unica, riconoscibile e inimitabile. Fantastica. Poi la gente : più bianchi che scuri ( contrariamente a quanto si immagina ) sempre sorridenti, anche se non hanno nulla e vivono alla giornata, ogni giorno come se fosse l'ultimo. Dignitosi, pulitissimi, ordinati, cordiali, amichevoli. Che bello andare in un posto e sentirsi gioiosamente accolti. Case recentemente ristrutturate, splendide, lucide di pittura fresca, e palazzi fatiscenti, corrosi dalla salsedine e dal tempo. Auto : americane anni 40/50, stupende, lunghe, grandi, ristrutturate pezzo per pezzo. Una meraviglia! Oppure russe anni 70/80 : orribili! Autobus chiamati ""camelo"" strapieni di gente vociante e qualcuno che si mette a ballare anche lì si trova spesso. Non mancate lo show del ""Tropicana"" , è bellissimo, in un rigoglioso giardino con ballerine e coreografia d'alto livello. E una serata nei loro locali, con quella musica..."
40,“muy buen destino”,"Es un destino perfecto...combinando playas hermosas y tranquilas, con baile y ritmo caribeño. Los Cubanos sumamente atentos y respetuosos y alegres y La Habana una ciudad sorprendentemente bella. El clima excelente (en invierno). Volvería sin dudar. No esperes encontrar grandes lujos."
50,“Niesamowite miasto”,"Niesamowite miasto w którym czas zatrzymał się 50 lat temu. Prawdziwa uczta dla oczu! Wiele miejsc do zwiedzania, własciwie cala Hawana to muzeum. Tropican show fantastyczny, ciągle w czołowce najlepszych. Tubylcy zaczepiają prosząc o pieniadze, ale nie kradną. Przyjazne miasto, ale najlepiej wynająć auto lub zwiedzac pieszo, komunikacja miejska prawie wcale nie istnieje. przemieszczac sie tu można również riksza lub koko taksi, łatwy i tani srodek transportu. Polecam Hawanę"
50,“el president”,"havanna ist die haupstadt von kuba und liegt im nordwesten der ca. 1000 km langen insel.wer die usa liebt, wird kuba noch mehr lieben. es ist naemlich eine welt ohne den usa: es gibt keine cocacola, kein internet, kein kreditkarten, keine leuchtreklame. obwohl das kommunistische land arm ist, sind die leute zu den touristen sehr freundlich und auch lebensfroh. wer die moeglichkeit hat, unbedingt havanna besuchen."
50,“Oxigeno para el cuerpo”,"Llegar a Cuba y a La Habana es pisar otro mundo, el sabor es distinto de verdad, Cuba es la autenticidad de la vida, es ver en una ciudad de mas de 2 millones de habitantes niños jugando por mitad de la calle, es la gran comunidad, es especial, los habaneros son únicos.La ciudad magica y especial desde el encanto de las zonas coloniales con sus vestigios del pasado en cada esquina hasta La Habana ""underground"" y santera.Para la gastronomía por favor, que tú no hayas estado en ningún sitio no quiere decir que no exista, en el europa en calle obispo en los nardos comete un pollo a la habanera, cerdo agridulce, ropa vieja, arroz criollo lo que quieras.Sobre el tema luz se puede caminar tranquilamente a cualquier hora la seguridad es total.La gente es diferente otro rollo, alegria de vivir, como debia ser España hace muchos años.El malecón igual que cualquier otro rincón de Andalucia? Por favor menos chovinismo, solo por historia del siglo XX no me merece ya la pena ni seguir comparando."
40,“da visitare”,"splendida città, assolutamente da visitare, possibilmente con calma, per gustare appieno e capire lo spirito e l'animo dei cubani. oltre le importanti e solite attrazioni turistiche, colpisce molto la piazza enorme dedicata a fidel, da pelle d'oca!!"
30,“la habana vieja”,Ciudad detenida en el tiempo su gente cordial culta y desinteresada
40,“Schöne Stadt mit marodem Charme”,"Ich war bisher 2 Mal in Havanna. Das erste Mal im Jahr 1989. Seit meinem ersten Besuch hat sich viel geändert.Besonders gut hat es mir gefallen, durch die Altstadt zu schlendern und quasi den maroden Charme dieser schönen Stadt ""aufzusaugen"". Auch der Malecon (die Uferpromenade) habe ich mir nicht entgehen lassen.Was mir ebenfalls gut gefallen hat: Ein Besuch auf einem der Friedhöfe. Dort wo wir waren (leider weiß ich den Namen nicht mehr) erinnerte ein ganz klein wenig an den Friedhof Recoleta in Buenos Aires."
50,“Velotours durch Kuba”,Havanna ist eine faszinierende Stadt. Die vielen alten Häuser aus der Kolonialzeit sind eindrücklich obwohl sie dringend einer Renovation bedürfen. Die alten Amerikaner-Autos lassen jedesAutoherz höher schlagen. Eine Stadtrundfahrt mit dem offenen Bus ist empfehlenswert. Überall wird man mit der Kultfigur 'Che Guevara' konfrontiert. Er wird fast wie ein heiliger verehrt. Es gibt vile kleine Restaurants wor man gemütlich und romantisch zu günstigen Preisen essen kann
50,“VAI CON L'UNESCO ( per fortuna esiste )”,"ciao a tutti,sono appena tornato da una meravigliosa vacanza a CUBA,L'AVANA/ VARADERO/ MATANZAS/CARDENAS E DULCIS IN FUNDO PLAYA CORAL( poco conosciuta dai turisti ).Che dire che non sia gia' stato detto ?l'AVANA coloniale che avevo visto nei film, o in tv, non e' assolutamente da paragonare alla realta', palazzi di una bellezza incredibile,facciate balconi porticati,chiese , meno male che l'UNESCO la inserita fra i patrimoni dell'umanita' da salvare.Le piazze, e la gente,disponibile,calorosa, ( anche se a volte chiede la mancia, ma va bene cosi' ) i paesini nell'interno con un fascino di altri tempi.saro un romantico, ma erano continue emozioni.che non scordero' facilmente.Se qualcuno avesse intenzione di andarci, lo consiglio vivamenteo se volesse delle informazioni su le cose viste, saro' felice di raccontarle.saluti da pimarkwiva CUBA..........................."
40,“HAVANA GRANDE AMORE”,"Per la seconda volta ho ripetuto il mio viaggio a Cuba. Questa volta tappa fondamentale e per approfondire meglio ho soggiornato all'Havana che avevo già visitato ma volevo rivedere con tranquillità.In questa recensione voglio descrivere non tanto l'aspetto storico della città che facilmente potete leggere su una guida completa ma le sensazioni provate.L'hotel prescelto per noi si trova in un quartiere moderno della città, niente di caratteristico, molto bello ma più economico rispetto agli hotel coloniali ristrutturati ....cmq pazienza....siamo ugualmente a Cuba.Si parte di buona mattina e raggiungiamo l'Havana Vieja, sicuramente la parte più interessante della città. Vestitevi comodi, zainetto per eventuali spesucce, scarpe basse e cominciate la vostra passeggiata, si gira tutta a piedi.Sono rimasta incantanta dalle ristrutturazioni avvenute negli ultimi anni trascorsi dalla mia prima visita, non esitate a sbirciare nei portoni aperti....compaiono giardini improvvisi, entrate nelle vecchie farmacie dove tutto è rimasto come una volta...vecchie ampolle, contenitori decorati. mensole in legno....fate una puntatina nelle reception di piccoli alberghetti che erano una volta conventi o piccoli monasteri....l'Havana è piena di curiosità che si lasciano scoprire un pò per volta, in tutta l'aria si vive l'atmosfera di storia, del passato, della rivoluzione....della schiavitù, del ballo e della musica.....è un mondo unico e per me' pieno di fascino. Anche la gente la trovo squisita, nella loro povertà sicuramente molto dignitosa e fantasiosa nel trovare il modo di avvicinarsi a noi turisti...una cosa che ricordo con molto piacere è stato un vecchietto che donava in cambio di una moneta poesie d'amore su foglietti di carta scritte da lui...osservate anche il loro mondo....le scolaresche di bambini di tutte le età che girano per il centro con le loro maestre....le vecchie auto d'epoca che ancora sferragliano per le strade....i bambini che giocano all'aperto davanti alle loro case....Una cosa importante da ricordarsi prima della partenza per Cuba è quella di riempirsi lo zainetto di piccole saponette, sarà veramente una cosa gradita da donare alla gente...visto che è un bene per loro raro e costoso.Non dimenticate una bella passeggiata sul Malecon (il lungo mare), punto d'incontro non solo per i turisti ma per la gente del luogo, visitate l'Hotel National....sicuramente il più famoso e non perdetevi un buonissimo Daiquiri alla Floridita""il bar frequentato da Hemingway, per chi ama ballara la salsa io ho apprezzato molto l'orchestra dal vivo alla Casa della Musica, un locale sicuramente meno turistico di quelli consigliati dai soliti tour operator.Le sensazioni che questa città mi ha lasciato sono di familiarità con la gente dal sorriso spontaneo, di tranquillità vissuta nel camminare per le vie, il piacere dei colori dato dal contrasto del cielo terso, delle palme e dei fiori che si arrampicano sui muri sgretolati, delle cose semplici ma sentite......e di una vita sicuramente vissuta con difficoltà ma con sentimento...Spero di avere lasciato a chi leggerà queste righe un pò delle emozioni che ancora a distanza di tempo io provo ripensando a quei giorni trascorsi a Cuba....sicuramente un mondo che vale la pena di conoscere."
50,“Schöne Stadt”,Die Stadt ist sehr schön. Allerdings reicht ein Tagestrip z.B. von Varadero vollkommen aus. Wir sind mit dem Taxi von Varadero morgens los gefahren und waren am frühen Abend wieder zurück. Der Taxifahrer hat sogar Deutsch gesprochen und so konnten wir uns sehr gut verständigen was uns interessiert und so konnte er gezielt unseren Wünschen nachkommen. Ein absolutes Muss: Cocktails in der Stadt! Sind absolut nicht zu vergleichen mit den aus den AI-Hotels.
40,“ritorno al passato”,"posso solo raccontare dell'havana vecchia scoperta con mia moglie e definita da entrambi""unica e meravigliosa"". due giorni trascorsi alla soperta di sensazioni straordinarie vissute in parte durante la nostra infanzia. comincio con il dire che il calore della gente ti fa sentire come a casa e ti permette di muoverti in tutta sicurezza anche la sera nonostante las carsa illuminazione di alcune zone. ovviamente non poteva mancare un buon moito alla bodeguida del medio, un ottimo daiquiri al floridita, la visita dei vari punti vendita di sigari e roon in calle obispo, ma la cosa che ci ha veramente emozionato e stato comperare piccoli oggetti direttamente nelle abitazioni private allestite come piccoli mercati e la dimostrazione di gioia e affetto ricevute da questo meraviglioso popolo. la musica dal vivo non manca di certo in ogni angolo delle piazze(suggestiva quella della cattedrale) e nei locali dove si può pranzare e cenare con pochi cuc. l'aver comunque avuto come base l'hotel sevilla situato in posizione ottimale per muoversi a piedi, ci ha permasso di gustarci a pieno questavacanza indimenticabile. dimenticavo: visitate il mercatino al porto vecchio ne vale la pena.Francesco AL"

Solamente dos toallas y un rollito de papel higienico fino y malo. La comida regular y mal confeccionada.Los colchones con los muelles flojos y casi afuera!!!!! En general muy malo todo. Creo seria mejor que lo Demolieran.!!!!!! Gracias!!!!!"
30,"“es una opinion muy sincera, leedla”","Todo el mundo recomienda la visita a esta ciudad, por lo precioso que es ¡. Hasta ahi de acuerdo, lo recomiendo y merece la pena ir. Es un mundo diferente, una ciudad muy peculiar, y lo mejor es perderse por sus calles, sus comercios, lejos de zonas centricas, y escuchar su musica en directo, es alucinante.Pero a la gente se le olvida contar ciertas cosas, que a cierto tipo de personas les conviene saber. Todos los viajeros no son iguales, y esta opinión va dirigida a los que si les importa ciertos aspectos. Primero en la habana para comer y beber en sirtios de confianza hay que pagar, a precio de españa, no más barato. Segundo: no tiene una gastronomia especial, por la comida no vayas. Por la playa no vayas, no tiene. si te da miedo andar a oscuras por la calle, no te lo recomiendo a las 18 horas es de noche y no hay ni una farola. Los bares tipicos como la bodeguita del medio o la floridita, no es que tenga algo especial, es que son de los pocos que se pueden entrar, es decir que son como los de nuestro pais, tienen higiene, estan pintados, tienen asientos , son los mejores de la Habana, pero solo por eso ( y por su historia...vale!). Y son muy caros. La gente es muy pesada, se te pegan y te dan una charla dificil de cortar ya que son muy buenos liandote. La gente mayor es amable, interesada, pero amable, pero ahora se ha puesto de moda que parejitas lindas, de muy buen ver y bien trajeadas se te acerquen, cuidadito con ellos. Además os digo lo que me paso a mi: por no querer aceptar en la calle sus servicios de guias o comprar puros etc... los rechazé muy amablemente, me insultaron, me dijeron racista, y me acosaron por varias calles. Ciertamente es azar, hay dias que estuvimos tranquilos y otros que nos nos dejaron ni un momento, son realmente cansinos. Y por último, mi peor aportación, ¿que es el malecon? Un paseo maritimo de 8 kilometros a la que le han añadido una carretera de 4 carriles sin pasos de cebras y coches a 100 km/hora, con un atardecer fantastico y precioso, pero no más de los que tenemos en Andalucia. A pesar de todo esto, claro que hay que visitar La Habana, que no te desanime sus cosas negativas, acaso hay alguna ciudad perfecta en este mundo."
40,“Kontrastenes by”,"Havana er et sted, som alle og en hver skulle besøke. Etter min mening. Et fantastisk by, som har mye å oppleve. Store kontraster. Du kan bo på en luksus hotell, som foreks. Nasjonal hotellet, spise og drikke godt med billige peng, i forhold til norske nivåer. Men man kan også bo på trivelige og hjemmekoselige såkalte Casa particular, som er mindre familiepensjonater. Noen av dem har bare et eller to rom til leie fra tillatelse av staten. Men der kan du virkelig oppleve cubanske liv. Hvordan lever familie, den samhold de har og vennlighet, som de viser til andre mennesker. Du kan oftest også spise hos dem og betale lit ekstra for det, men da får man også sikkerlig god hjemmelaget cubanske mat. Slike rom koster oftest rundt 20 cuc pr.natt. En cuc tilsvarer en dollar. Men er du lur, så veksle du pengene dine til cubanske pesos, på hvilket som helst gatehjørnet, så da lever du virkelig billig på Cuba ! Absolut anbefalt !Men det er lurt å ha også cuc tilgjengelig hele tiden, siden enkelte plass gjelder det bare det. Men man klarer seg utmerket med pesos og bruker mye mindre reisebudsjet enn ellers.I Havana er så mye å se ! Museum, park, stardbulevard Malecon, hvor lokale folk også bringer mye av sin fridtid. Det er lett å komme i kontakt med cubanske folk. De er glade og åpne. Du hører musikken overalt og ser dansende mennesker.Havana Vieja, den gamle Havana er en opplevelse i seg selv. Der kan du gå på Hemmingveis fotspor. Ta Mojito på hans stambar, samt Daiquri på Floridita, hvor han også satt ofte. I den gamle Havana er mye å se av Havanas og Cubans histori.Du ser også fattigdom i Havana. Alt er ikke rettferdig tildelt i kommunistisk Cuba. Gir gjerne peng til de gamle tynne dårlig kledd mennesker.Men alt i alt: Cubanske folk lever uten å stresse. ""Det du kan gjøre i morgen, ikke stress med det idag!"" Alt kan man gjøre på neste dag. Vi sier det motsatte. Men det fungerer på Cuba, likevel. De virker fornøyd tross alt, kan ikke gjøre så mye for å forandre det livet, som er ganske kontrollert fra regjeringens side. Men slik de selv sier; Det er to ting ingen kan ta fra dem, uansett hvor fattig eller kontrollert livet er. Og de er: MUSIKK og KJERLIGHET !Anbefaler å ta en tur til Cuba !25.12.2010 Leila Ponce Arencibia, Oslo, Norway"
50,“La Habana - das schönste open air Museum”,"Wer Komfort, Sprache, Nahrung, Umgangsformen etc. wie zu Hause möchte: warum fahrt ihr weg von zu Hause ?Wer aber eine mittelamerikanische Kolonialstadt sehen möchte, die dem Touristen auch nächtens im Stadtzentrum ""HABANA VIEJA"" Sicherheit bietet, der ist hier richtig. Trotzdem aufpassen: kleinere Diebstähle - besonders am Strand Sta. Maria- passieren täglich (Mistkerle gibts auf der ganzen Welt, aber hier steht an jeder Ecke ein Polizist, und ein Kubaner, der sich an Touristen vergreift, hat schwere Zeiten vor sich).Wem diese unvergleichliche Musik gefällt, die in fast jeder Bar live gespielt wird, wer anderen Menschen ins Gesicht sehen kann, wer qualmende Chevrolets, Fords, Buick, Dogde aus den 50ern nicht als Umweltsünde sondern als wunderschöne Museumsstücke erlebt, wer mit seinen Ausgaben in dieser Stadt auch zur dringend notwendigen Sanierung der Altstadt beitragen möchte (Erneuerungsprojekt von Eusebio Leal), und wer versteht, daß die Revolucion Cubana Ende der 50er Jahre mit unerträglichen Mißständen aufgeräumt hat und nun ein bißchen die Entwicklung der letzten Jahrzehnte verschlafen bzw. verweigert hat, der ist hier im größten Open Air - Museum richtig. Wer auf All-inclusive-Strandurlaub steht >> fahrt nach Varadero und teilt Euch die 24-Stunden Bar mit besoffenen (Franko-)Canadiens und Russen, da seid ihr in Havanna falsch. Beste Reisezeit für mich ist März - Mai, November-Dezember geht auch, kann aber schon mal durch eine Störung auf unter 20 Grad abkühlen. Und wer sich nicht vor Kontakt mit der Bevölkerung fürchtet: ""Casa particular"" heißt die offiziell mögliche Form der privaten Zimmervermietung und ist der beste Weg ein bißchen was über Land, Stadt und Leute zu erfahren. Ein bißchen Spanischkenntnisse sind natürlich von Vorteil. Und wie in allen Touristenzonen dieser Welt werdet ihr auch hier ständig angequatscht ""where are you from?, Cigars?, Salsa?....."". ? Je nach persönlicher Tagesverfassung könnt ihr Euch auf Kommunikation einlassen oder einfach ablehnen - die geben dann wirklich Ruhe - zum Unterschied von anderen Kulturkreisen dieser Welt. Abzockideen haben sie jedenfalls in allen Variationen (Milch fürs Baby, Medikamente fürs kranke Kind, sie zeigen Euch das beste Restaurant, die tollste Tanzveranstaltung, etc.etc.). Der Großteil der Cubanos gehört aber der Mehrheit der angenehmen Erdbevölkerung an und wir haben inzwischen wirkliche Freunde aller Hautfarben in dieser wunderschönen Stadt gefunden. Empfehlung: hinfahren, anschauen !"
40,"“Havanna, Nachtleben und Kultur”",Ich war für einige Tage im Hotel Saratoga untergebracht. Ein hervorragendes Hotel mit einem super Blick von der Dachterasse auf das Kapitol.Die Altstadt Havannas ist Weltkulturerbe und viele der kolonialen Bauten sind sehr schön restauriert. Lohnenswert ist auch die Besichtigung der Befestigungsanlagen an der Hafenzufahrt. Am Abend bietet sich der Besuch der Tropicana Show an - oder einfach das Nachtleben in einer der vielen Bars und Diskotheken genießen.

10,“Una Gran decepción”,"Estuve en Cuba hace 22 años, así que cuando me dieron la posibilidad de pasar una noche en cuba, me senti muy emocionada de volver... sin embargo fue una noche de pesadilla. La cuba que yo había conocido en mi niñez ya no existe, es una ciudad con los edificios deteriorados, oscura, con perros en la calle, con helados copelia de agua, gente que le pide a uno pesos convertibles cubanos en todo momento y hombres que ofrecen sus servicios...Todo es carísimo, aún cuando uno come fuera de los hoteles cubanos.La cereza de mi pedadilla fue que en el aeropuerto me robaron mis pertenencias, abrieron mis maletas y sacaron lo que les dio la gana."
40,“Havanna - wirklich eine Stadt voller Musik”,"Wenn man die typischen Rhytmen der kubanischen Musik nicht mag sollte man einen großen Bogen um Havanna machen: hier kommt man um Salsa, Merengue und Son nicht drum rum! Keine Bar, kein Restaurant, aus dem nicht entsprechende Klänge tönen - meist sogar live gespielt und von fast immer überraschend guten Musikern. Hier schein wirklich jeder Musik im Blut zu haben, selbst die Bedienungen wiegen sich im Takt der Musik...Aber Havanna hat auch Schattenseiten: Dreck, Verfall und Armut sind nicht zu übersehen. Und in den touristisch erschlossenen Gegenden sollte man sich der Bettler und ""Dienstleister"" zu erwähren wissen!Aber was soll's: Havanna ist ein Muss, wenn man schon in der Gegend ist! Und wer weiß, wielange Kuba noch so bleibt, wie es ist....."
40,“Wie in einer anderen Zeit”,"Kuba ist schon ein fasziniertendes Land. Wir haben eigentlich Urlaub auf Varadero gemacht und planten nun einen Tagesausflug nach Havana. Die Fahrt dort hin ist etwas holprig und dauert schon einige Stunden aber es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Es ist wirklich eine tolle Stadt und man fühlt sich wie in der anderen Zeit. Die Oldtimer sind wirklich klasse, die Stadt hat einfach tolle Gebäude und die Stimmung wie man es aus Filmen kennt. Allerdings ist die Armut nicht zu unterschätzen. Ich bin froh, dass wir einer Reisegruppe angeschlossen waren. Man wird als Tourist natürlich sofort erkannt und ständig angesprochen, vor allem als blonde Frau hat man es nicht so leicht. Ganz ungefährlich ist es hier nicht. Aber es war wirklich eine sehr schöne Stadt."
50,“Experiencia inolvidable”,"La Habana es una ciudad que hay que visitarla cuanto antes mejor. Aparte de su extraordinario clima y la simpatía de su gente, es uno de los pocos lugares del mundo en los que podemos hacer un viaje en el tiempo. Siempre recordaré la experiencia única de sentarme en las escaleras del Capitolio de la capital y observar el tráfico pasar, compuesto por coches de los años 50 y todo ello con la parsimonia y falta de stress que caracterizan a la ciudad y todo el país. La Habana Vieja es una joya de la arquitectura colonial española con varias propuestas gastronómicas y culturales muy interesantes. No se debe dejar de probar el enchilado de langosta en el precioso patio colonial del restaurante Condes de Villanueva. Un paseo en descapotable con conductor, disponibles al lado del Capitolio para dar una vuelta por El Malecón, El Vedado y Miramar nos llevará también a otros tiempos. Los mojitos de la Bodeguita del Medio y los Daiquiris del Floridita a precios irrisorios al cambio en euros tampoco se deben de obviar. Los museos son pequeños para los estándares europeos, los más interesantes son el Colonial y la Capitanía General, aunque en esta última el personal a la que descubre que eres español, no paran de hablarte, de querer hacerte fotos que no quieres y de pedirte una ""ayuda"" económica, pero el trato con los simpatiquísimos cubanos, aún en esa circunstancia, forma parte del encanto del país."
40,“映画のような町並み”,古い建物が今でも現役。クラシックカーがたくさん走っていて、まるで映画のような町並みです。ヨーロッパともほかの中南米諸国とも違う独特の雰囲気。ラムやタバコが似合う町です。ただ、夏の暑い時期に行ったので、夜遅くまで湿度が下がらないのには辟易しました。
50,“Ein Traum von alter Pracht”,"Ich liebe Havanna und werde dieses Jahr in 2. Mal hinfliegen. Ich mag alte Haeuser, vor allem viktorianische mit grossen Balkonen und Saeulen. Davon sind in Havanna so viele zu finden. Die Farbe blaettert natuerlich von vielen ab, aber genau das Macht den Charme der Stadt aus. Man hat das Gefuehl in einer laten Prachstadt zu sein, vor allem in Havana vieja, dem alten Havanna. Der Platz mit der alten Kathedrale ist wunderschoen und man sollte unbedingt die Lobbies der alten Hotels ansehen, Lobby lounging. Havanna vieja ist sehr sicher zum herum laufen. Wir hatten immer alles dabei und sind nachts durch die dunkelsten Strassen gelaufen, denn die Beleuchtung ist natuerlich nichts besonders. Es gibt auch viele kleine Buden oder shops in dem man lokale snacks kaufen kann, vor allem Backwaren. Das sollte man unbedingt versuchen. Obwohl es eine Art Touristenstrasse gibt, sind die Touristen und Kubaner doch sehr vermischt. Das gefiel mir. Ueberall fahren die alten Autos herum in allem denkbaren Farben. Auf dem Paseo in Richtung Wasser tanzen an manchen Abenden Leute Tango. An der Malekon zu die neueren Stadtteile zu laufen ist auch schoen.Gutes Essen ist etwas schwieriger zu fnden, aber wir entdeckten kleine Restaurants auf den Balkonen entlang des Paseos und der Malekon. Man sollte Kuba unbedingt besuchen bevor es westlich wird!!!"
30,“Kontrast zwischen reich und arm könnte hier nicht größer sein”,"Eine riesige Stadt mit großen Gegensätzen.Als Tourist sieht man leider nur die Oberfäche des Ganzen. Restaurierung wird groß geschrieben, aber nur dort wo die Touristen hinschauen sollen. Zumindest hat man das Gefühl.Auf den Märkten kann man dies und das kaufen. Schöne Bilder, Skulpturen, traditionelle Kunst rund um den Havannarum und die Kubazigarre.Feilschen ist unbedingt notwendig.Sehenswert ist Havanna allemal und wenn man einmal das Land besucht unbedingt notwendig."
50,“Bella ciudad: La Habana”,"De La Habana se han escrito y se seguirán escribiendo experiencias excelentes, muy buenas, buenas, regulares, malas o pésimas.En nuestro caso -el de mi esposa Veldi y el mío propio-, pasamos una excelente experiencia en esta hermosa ciudad caribeña, capital de la perla del Caribe, Cuba.Al llegar nos dijeron que tuviéramos mucho cuidado con nuestros objetos personales y que no frecuentáramos lugares muy alejados o solitarios, por nuestra seguridad. Claro que tomamos las medidas de seguridad correspondientes pero en esta ciudad, como en cualquier otra, si tienes el debido cuidado en tu tránsito turístico, no pasarás ningún problema. Nosotros la pasamos estupendamente. No tuvimos ningún problema en nada.Bueno, dada la recomendación, les contaré que, tal como habíamos leído, esta es una hermosa ciudad, llena de tradiciones y de gente muy amigable y respetuosa. Tuvimos oportunidad de pasear por el famoso Malecón de La Habana, sus añejas calles tanto de la ciudad moderna como la de la llamada ""Habana Vieja"", su primera catedral, la antigua Plaza de Armas o Plaza Mayor, el Cristo de La Habana, las murallas, la Plaza de la Revolución, a lo lejos el Palacio de Gobierno, el puerto, la famosa Bodeguita del Medio, el Capitolio, el Tropicalísimo; conocer una fábrica de ron, otra de tabaco. Todo, todo, muy agradable. Lamentablemente, sólo pudimos estar un par de días en esta ciudad, ya que era nuestro tránsito hacia Varadero, así que la recorrimos ligeramente pero lo que conocimos, nos encantó. Si tuviéramos oportunidad de regresar... lo haríamos.Ah, me olvidaba. Este viaje lo realizamos en el mes de noviembre del 2009."
40,“Die alte Dame Kubas”,"Havanna, schon der Name hat einen magischen Klang und wird unweigerlich mit Rum und kubanischer Musik assoziiert. Kubas Hauptstadt versprüht den einzigartigen Duft von Nostalgie, Revolution und Salsa im Blut. Zum unverkennbaren Stadtbild gehören selbstverständlich auch die Oldtimer, welche heute noch genauso durch die Stadt fahren, wie vor fünfzig Jahren. Als Reisender kann man natürlich auch mit so einem Gefährt mitfahren. (Z.B. Taxi). Es gibt auch Touristenbüros, welche solche Oldtimer vermieten. Bei einem Besuch in Havanna darf auf keinem Fall ein Besuch in der Havanna- Rum Destillerie und in der Altstadt fehlen. Optimaler Entspannungseffekt gibt bei einem Mojito in der zahllosen Bars in der Stadt. Ein Muss für Reisefreudige."
20,“Nette aber sehr arme Stadt”,"Wir verbrachten eine Woche in Havanna.Nach einigen Anfangsschwierigkeiten mit Hotel und dem lieben Geld. Machten wir uns mit einer Karte auf den Weg die Stadt zu erkunden. Sie erinnerte mich sehr an Peru-Städte. Sehr schöne alte Gebäude, jedoch kein Geld diese zu erhalten. Der Unterschied zu Peru ist nur, dass in Peru die Städte wenigstens im Inneren renoviert sind und in Kuba sogar dafür kein Geld da ist. Naja wir liefen los und gelangten nach wenigen Metern schon in die Viertel, wo unendliche viele Menschen auf den Straßen standen, die keine Arbeit haben. Aus den schönen alten Häuseren wurde mit Brettern dann wenigstens ein Schlafplatz gebaut. Auf der Suche nach einem Cafe waren wir dort auf jeden Fall falsch. Nach 2 Stunden Suche, fanden wir endlich die Starße, die für uns wie geschaffen war, umgeben von netten Plätzen mit Cafe's und Bars, verbrachten wir dort unsere nächsten Abende.Kurz: Kann man sich mal anschauen, muss man aber nicht, weil dafür gibt es zu viele schöne andere Städte auf der Welt."
50,“Die quirlige Stadt”,"Über das touristische Havanna möchte ich nicht schreiben. Dafür gibt es genug Führungen. Ich liebe es einfach die Seitenstraßen, abseits der Touristenpfade zu laufen. Die Menschen beobachten, in Gepräche oder Situationen verwickelt zu werden, zu fragen ob man ein Foto machen darf. Die Reaktionen dazu waren sehr positiv, neue Menschen kennenzulernen, miteinander zu lachen und auch zu tanzen. Es passiert so viel. Du erlebst sehr viel. Diese Stadt entwickelt ein sehr sehr starkes Eigenleben. Du hast keinen Plan und doch entwickelt sich jeder Tag neu und interessant. Gehe offen auf die Menschen zu und Du wirst das auch erleben. Viel Spass dabei!!!"
30,“Viel Kolonialarchitektur und maroder Charme”,"Havanna ist sicherlich eines der lohnendsten Ziele auf Kuba. Die Altstadt ist beeindruckend, der Malecon erlaubt einen schönen Spaziergang zwischen dem brandenden Meer auf der einen Seite und interessanten Häuserfassaden auf der anderen Seite. Allerdings machen viele Häuser einen etwas verfallenen Eindruck. Die Menschen sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.Die Stadt hat allerdings auch ihre negativen Seiten. Fünfmal waren wir in Restaurants, dreimal stimmte die Rechung nicht und wurde erst nach heftigen Protesten richtig gestellt.Das Fahren ist in Havanna nicht so kompliziert, wie es angesichts der Größe der Stadt sein könnte. Auch bewachte Parkplätze gibt es ausreichend. Wenn man erst am Nachmittag eintrifft und nicht reserviert hat, kann Schwierigkeiten geben, eine Casa particular zu finden. Zum Teil haben diese auch ein nur mäßiges Niveau. In denen, die wir gesehen haben, wurde im Unterschied zu den Privatunterkünften auf der Insel im Übrigen kein Abendessen angeboten.Insgesamt bietet die Stadt aber weniger, als in den Reiseführern angegeben. Wenn man drei oder auch nur zwei volle Tage veranschlagt, kann man das meiste sehen, und das auch ohne sich zu hetzen. Entsprechend mehr Zeit sollte man allerdings einplanen, wenn man auch die durchaus guten Playas del Este besuchen möchte."
40,“La Habana es bellisima!!!”,"La habana es preciosa, la gente es muy amable y es un lugar tranquilo donde puedes salir a pasear sin preocuparte demasiado por la delincuencia. Realmente vale la pena visitar Cuba!!!Sin embargo, escribo este comentario para alertar a futuros viajeros sobre el local llamado ""La Bodeguita del Medio"" el lugar es muy bonito esteticamente hablando, pero a nosotros nos estafaron con las cosas que nos vendieron. Compramos habanos ahi y luego descubrimos que no eran de la calidad que nos habian indicado, eran corrientes y, ademas de eso, nos cobraron 4 VECES SU PRECIO. Ademas nos vendieron un asafate muy lindo y luego también descubrimos que el precio era exhorbitante.Nos gusto muchisimo Cuba, sin embargo las personas que conocimos en este lugar nos dejaron un muy mal recuerdo, no creemos que todos los cubanos sean asi porque conocimos gente muy linda pero si es necesario estar alerta porque en este lugar buscaran sorprenderte!!!"

50,“Havanna Casa Particular”,"Für den, der sich gerne außerhalb vorgefertigter Touristenghettos bewegt, ist eine Privatunterkunft wie zum Beispiel in Vedado bestens geeignet. Durch den ständigen und direkten Kontakt mit Einheimischen erfährt man bald von Sehenwürdigkeiten und historischen Details, die dem ""Pauschaltourist"" so nicht herangetragen werden.Privatunterkünfte kosten zwischen 30 - 50 CUC pro Nächtigung und Frühstück ist nur nach vorheriger Vereinbarung mit inbegriffen.Unbedingt ansehen: Parque Central gegenüber des Capitols, den Malecon in der Nacht (Noch nie haben Sie so viele Menschen feiern, tratschen und tanzen und singen gesehen wie dort), Habana Vieja, die Altstadt, malerisch, spröde, ehrwürdig, Geschichte Stein auf Stein, gefangen in der Zeit, einfach wunderbar.---"
50,“Mein Havanna”,"Es gab schon Berichte über Havanna, aber ich möchte sie gerne ergänzen. Man kann sich sehr gut und vorallem sehr billig mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln fortbewegen, wie z.B.: mit den normalen Reise-Bussen auch guaguas genannt werden oder die langen Busse auch Camellos genannt. Wichtig ist nur, dass man die CUC (Peso cubano convertible) in peso cubano (ordinario) umtauscht in einer der Cadeca Banken geht das sehr gut und schnell. Man sollte stets darauf achten, das 1 CUC 25 peso cubano sind. Die Geldscheine lassen sich für ungeübte Augen leicht verwechseln und das nutzen manche Kubaner gerne bei den Touristen aus, also niemals auf der Strasse Geld tauschen !!Mit 40 peso cubano ordinario kann man schon z.B. 30km weit und weiter fahren, nämlich mit den Camellos kommt man bis weit in die Provinz von Havanna wie z.B. in das Dorf ""El Cotorro"" oder "" El Electrico"", sie werden als Stadtteile Havvanas bezeichnet sind aber zw. 20km und 30km von Havanna City entfernt.In Havanna City gibt es sehr gr0ße Unterschiede z.B. zwischen den Taxen die mit gelben Dächern sind inder teuren Touristen CUC-Währung und die mit den schwarzen Dächern sind in der billigen peso cubano Währung, und das gleiche gilt auch für die Coco-Taxies, das sind Motorroller mit anghängter und überdachter Sitzgelegenheit.Möchte man einmal weiter weg z.B. nach Varadero ist es ratsam auf die ""Überlandbusse"" wieViazul ( Avenida 26 y Zoológico, Nuevo Vedado, Ciudad de La Habana, CubaTeléfonos: [--], Fax: [--]Email: [--]© Copyright 2006 Viazul & Exclusivas Latinoamericanas S.L.) zurück zu greifen.

10,"“Havanna - eine Stadt, die enttäuscht”","Habe Havanna im August 2010 besucht. Die Stadt hat mich total enttäuscht. Abseits der Touristen-Pfade ziemlich verfallene Stadt, total heruntergekommen. Dann kam ein Regen (um diese Jahreszeit am Nachmittag normal), und die Straßen haben sich in reissende Bäche verwandelt. Wenn man in Kuba ist, sollte man zwar auch in Havanna gewesen sein, aber ein ""Erlebnis"" ist das keinesfalls, eher eine Demonstration, wie heruntergekommen eine Stadt sein kann."
50,"“La Habana, ciudad maravillosa de hombres encantadores”","Me encanta La Habana, es bella, calida, de gente muy encantadora y generosa."
30,“eigentlich nicht mehr richtig Cuba”,"Havanna ist eigentlich schon nicht mehr richtig Cuba. Wenn Havanna der erste Reisestop ist, dann verspürt man sicherlich den großen Unterschied im Vergleich zur westlichen Welt. Wenn man aber zunächst durchs Land gereist ist und erst am Schluss nach Havanna kommt, denkt man, man sei gar nicht mehr in Cuba. Hier gibt es alles, was es im übrigen Land - mit Ausnahme der Touristenressorts - nicht gibt - Waren, motorisierte Transportmittel, gute Hotels und noble Restaurants sowie durchaus schöne Wohngegenden. Alles in allem aber eine unwirklich anmutende Kulisse, den natürlich sind Not und Armut auch nicht weit entfernt. Im Vergleich zum Rest des Landes sind die Gegensätze nur ungleich größer und die Zeit läuft um Vieles schneller. Zwei oder drei Tage sollte man in Havanna bleiben. Das Capitol und die Zigarrenfabrik sind recht sehenswert. Übernachten sollte man unbedingt in Havanna Centro oder Havanna Viejo. Dann kann man alles gut zu Fuß erreichen. Denn obgleich in Havanna Busse fahren, sind sie für Touristen nicht wirklich geeignet. Denn es gibt z.B. keinerlei Fahrpläne oder Streckenpläne an den Haltstellen. Ansonsten gilt: Wer das richtige Cuba kennen lernen möchte, der muss unbedingt das Land bereisen. Havanna eignet sich hingegen gut als ""Cuba light"" für Pauschaltouristen, die es ansonsten in die Ressorts nach Varadero zieht."
50,“Vivere All' Havana - life in Havana”,"Rivolto ai Backpakers giramondo che, con un solo zaino in spalla, fanno del viaggio la loro più grande avventura…Cuba è un luogo meraviglioso, da vivere intensamente insieme al suo popolo. Non è facile e molte volte è incomprensibile. Ma se riuscirete ad armonizzarvi con la gente, a non pretendere e a ridere di tutte le bizzarrie che vi capiteranno, allora quest'isola vi lascerà qualcosa dentro di voi che nulla potrà mai cancellare. Il sistema della doppia moneta rende l'isola di Cuba una delle mete più costose dei Caraibi, ma appunto perchè esistono due monete è possibile scegliere di utilizzarne una piuttosto che l'altra.Una moneta è il Peso Convertible che segue l'andazzo del Dollaro: 1 Peso Convertible = 1 Dollaro.Tutti i prezzi sono prezzi europei, con la differenza che Cuba non è Europa!Ma allora come può essere cara come l'Italia o la Francia?Come fanno i cubani che guadagnano pochi dollari al mese a vivere con questo sistema?Perchè i cubani usano l'altra moneta che è chiamata Peso Cubano o Moneda Nacional, dove per fare 1 Convertible occorrono 24 Pesos cubanos.Solitamente i turisti usano i Convertibles e acquistano beni e servizi a prezzi europei, mentre i cubani usano il Peso Cubano e acquistano beni e servizi con i prezzi cubani che sono decisamente bassissimi. Forse Cuba è uno dei Paesi più economici del mondo se uno sa come muoversi.L'avventuriero che gira solo con uno zaino e che va a Cuba per vivere l'avventura, tentare di comprendere in quei pochi giorni a disposizione cosa significa essere cubano, dovrebbe necessariamente vivere come un cubano e questo può essere molto istruttivo, interessante, ma anche molto stancante e a volte penoso e triste! In questo caso è obbligato, per suo principio, a ridurre l'uso del Peso Convertible all'indispensabile e a vivere con la sola Moneda Nacional per tutto il suo viaggio. Purtroppo alcuni beni, tra cui anche quelli di prima necessità, sono acquistabili solo con la moneta Convertible e questo vale anche per il cubano, perciò o il cubano possiede i convertibles o non può comprare determinate cose. Questo credo sia uno dei motivi principali che spinge il cubano ad avere un ""negocio"", cioè un'attività più o meno illegale che gli consente di ""arrotondare"" la decina di dollari che prende di stipendio mensualmente. Tra le varie attività extra c'è anche quella di fregare il turista in mille modi usando l'unica arma a sua disposizione: l'astuzia.Muoversi a Cuba. Mezzi di trasportoViazul: compagnia di bus con aria condizionata e televisore a bordo. Parte esattamente all'ora stabilita. Si paga in convertibles ed è caro. Mai preso.Astro: compagnia di bus usata maggiormente dai cubani, spesso partono addirittura in anticipo rispetto all'ora stabilita; solitamente vengono riservati due posti per i turisti stranieri per ogni bus, ma possono diventare anche quattro senza problemi poichè i turisti pagano in convertibles.Per salire sull'Astro è necessario mostrare il documento d'identita e sul biglietto viene scritto il numero del passaporto oppure il numero della carta d'identità del cubano residente, cosicchè il cubano paga con la moneta nazionale per esempio 10 pesos e lo straniero paga, sempre per esempio, 5 convertibles che sarebbero 120 pesos, per fare lo stesso tragitto! Un bel guadagno! Una bella truffa!Sull'Astro solitamente non si vedono molti turisti ed è possibile che si sia gli unici stranieri a bordo e si possono fare conoscenze interessanti e vedere particolarità. Molti di questi bus sono dei veri scassoni!Camiones: agli stranieri è proibito viaggiare sui camion; c'è chi sostiene che non è vero, chi sostiene che ci sia una legge da qualche parte! Molto spesso Cuba è una contraddizione e ci si deve abituare a questo fatto... Pare a volte che nemmeno i cubani abbiano idea di come funzionano le cose laggiù... Molte cose vanno avanti per improvvisazione!Fattostà che se il camionista vi riconosce non vi fa salire, oppure acconsente in cambio di qualche dollaro che per principio non pago. Perchè pagare l'equivalente di 100 pesos quando il prezzo è 5 pesos solo perchè sono straniero e solo perchè lo dice lui? Straniero si, pollo no!I camiones partono dai terminal de omnibus a partire dalle 5 del mattino in poi e si collegano soltanto con la città vicina e con i vari pueblos della zona; non fanno tratte lunghe, solo tratte brevi. Per salire ugualmente sui camiones, pagando il giusto, è sperimentata la seguente tecnica: zaino e abiti non da turista, quindi niente pantaloncini, magliette vistose, occhiali da sole o quanto possano richiamare l'attenzione dell'autista e dei passeggeri. Vestirsi con pantaloni lunghi, maglietta possibilmente sporchina, non perchè i cubani vestano male ma perchè un turista malvestito a Cuba è una rarità, allora si passa più inosservati se si è conciati male; sguardo basso e bronciato, chiedere sempre chi è l'ultimo del gruppo, informarsi presso i passeggeri circa il costo del passaggio, prendere il numero nel qual caso vengano distribuiti i numeri per salire a bordo, preparare i soldi giusti, non parlare e non guardare in faccia il camionista al momento del pagamento, saltare sul camion e restare zitti finchè non parte.Il viaggio sui camiones, che assomigliano ai camion trasporto truppe della seconda guerra mondiale, è un'esperienza indimenticabile, un viaggio di 120 km può anche durare due ore e fischia, si balla e si salta ad ogni buca e poi si vedono e si apprendono un sacco di cose... Insomma ecco i prezzi attuali per alcune tratte: Cienfuegos-Cumanayagua 5pesos; Cumanayagua-El Nicho 40cv (40 centesimi di peso cubano); Cienfuegos-Trinidad 5p.; Camaguey-Santa Cruz del Sur 7p all'andata e 3 al ritorno; Camaguey-Las Tunas 10p.; Las Tunas-Bayamo 5p.; Bayamo-Santiago 7p..Volendo è possibile attraversare l'isola con un paio di euro! Tanto per fare un confronto: l' Astro dalla Habana a Cienfuegos costa 14 Convertibiles cioè 336pesos!Treno: il treno. Locomotore sovietico anni sessanta che va a petrolio, fuma come una vaporiera del 1800 e fa un randello incredibile; i vagoni però sono spaziosi e vecchi. Ho preso il treno due volte ed è stato bellissimo; sulla guida Lonely Planet è scritto: ""l'80% dei treni viaggia in ritardo e il restante 20% è cancellato."" Ho preso il primo treno da Santiago per Camagüey ed è partito con un'ora di ritardo perchè... mancava il locomotore. Un viaggio molto interessante all'aria libera tra le montagne, i campi, e le infinite praterie! Ho preso poi l'altro treno da Camagüey per Santa Clara, doveva arrivare alle 4 del mattino, ma alle 10 della sera prima comunque vado in stazione a chiedere se il treno delle 4 c'era, (poichè finchè il treno non parte dal suo capolinea nessuno è in grado di dire se ci sarà) e il treno già aveva un ritardo di 5 ore, così dormo tranquillo tutta la notte e alle 9 in punto mi presento alla stazione e del treno si erano perse le tracce! Nessuno in stazione sapeva dove stava il treno! Alle 10 comunicano che sarebbe arrivato entro 2 ore. All'una del pomeriggio il treno proveniente da non-so-dove entra trionfante nella stazione di Camagüey e senza ulteriori intoppi raggiungiamo Santa Clara nel tardo pomeriggio.Il treno si paga in convertibiles perchè come per il bus è necessario un documento di identificazione e i controlli per raggiungere la vettura sono numerosi; la tratta Camaguey-Santa Clara è costata 9Convert. corrispondenti a 216pesos, un cubano da Camaguey per raggiungere La Habana paga 17 pesos!Autostop: nella circonvallazione delle città dove strade più grandi si intersecano è possibile trovare un passaggio in autostop, ho provato una sola volta da Cienfuegos a Trinidad perchè ho bisticciato con il camionista che mi aveva scoperto, (allora non avevo ancora sviluppato la tecnica). Per chi fa autostop può venire d'aiuto riconoscere le targhe delle macchine: la prima lettera indica la provincia di appartenenza del veicolo quindi probabilmente anche la sua destinazione. (H=Habana - F=Cienfuegos - S= S.Spiritus - C=Camaguey - T=Tunas - G =Granma - U=Santiago, ecc.) le targhe gialle sono auto particular, le azzurre sono statali, gli altri colori non li ricordo perchè non li ho scritti negli appunti. Invece da sperimentare è il passaggio con l'amarillo: l'amarillo è un signore vestito di giallo che appena fuori dalle città ferma tutti i veicoli che sa lui e fa salire le persone che necessitano di un passaggio; praticamente un automobilista se viaggia solo o se c'è posto sulla sua vettura è tenuto a fermarsi e a caricare gratis una o più persone che necessitano di un passaggio... ottimo mezzo di trasporto. Da Santa Clara all'Habana usufruire dell'amarillo costa 3 pesos, si prende un numero e si aspetta che qualcuno passi per di là; quando arriva il proprio turno la prima auto disponibile si ferma e carica fino alla città richiesta... Ho avuto una rivincita perchè l'amarillo ha fermato un Astro che era mezzo vuoto per La Habana, di fabbricazione cinese, nuovo di zecca e con aria condizionata: Santa Clara-Habana con 3 pesos! Quella volta ho pagato meno che i cubani che erano saliti alla stazione degli autobus 3km prima!"
50,"“Camagüey, Cuba; maravilloso destino.”","Nuestro viaje fue increible, Camagüey es un lugar hermoso como hermosa es toda su gente, caminar por el centro de la cuidad, recorrer sus plazas visitar las iglesias disfrutar de un rico frapeado en el Cafe Ciudad o tomar una riquisima y fria cerveza en el Cambio bar es algo q tenemos q vivir otra vez, definitivamente junio es el mes ideal para andar por aquella tierra y disfrutar de su carnaval. Un tip es que en lugar de hotel optes por quedarte en casa particular, de esas q tiene permiso de hospedar turistas es muy economico y la oportunidad q tienes de hacer amistades es incomparable. La tranquilidad, la cultura, la gente son factores importantes que te llevan a disfrutar de una estancia extraordinaria...es otro mundo !!!! Dicen por alla... si bebes agua del tinajon te quedaras en Camagüey...nosotras no tuvimos que beberla...solo el hecho de respirar aquella paz dejamos nuestro corazon alla. Nos vemos pronto en Camagüey."
20,“Havana - É preciso conhecer para acreditar que existe”,"Gente..... Nunca imaginei tal experiência. É uma mistura de fascínio pelo povo e horror pelo governo ali instalado. É muito chocante a situação em geral. Muita pobreza, carência de tudo. Um povo muito acolhedor, gentil, cortez e que de alguma forma entende o regime político a ele submetido. Foi muito triste saber que o oftalmologista trabalhava como charreteiro porque assim ele teria um pouco mais de condições. A médica arrumava as camas de um hotel de luxo pelas mesmas condições - ganhar gorjetas e melhorar as condições de vida. ""Nosso Oftalmologista"" nos pedia, quase que diariamente os restos dos sabonetes que usavamos - Isso é muito cruel.Ah!!! quase me esqueci. Mulheres, não deixe de levar na bagagem absorventes. Não se encontra com facilidade, principalmente se acontecer um fluxo no domingo. As farmácias estão fechadas - esqueceram!!!!! TUDO LÁ É PÚBLICO E NÃO FUNCIONA NO DOMINGO. Me foi oferecido ir a um consultório médico e me recorrer a algodão e gases`. Muito cruel"
50,“Mein Favorit in Kuba”,"Besonders sehenswert ist die Altstadt Havannas, mit ihren barocken und verschiedenen Monumenten, die zu den ältesten spanischen Kolonialsiedlungen gehören. Sie wurde 1982 unter das UNESCO Weltkulturerbe gestellt, und werden seit dem langsam restauriert. Eines der schönsten Gebäude darin ist der der ehemalige Gouverneurspalast. Außerdem sehenswert ist die Hafenfestung. Touristische Attraktion ist auch der restaurierte Plaza Vieja. Ein weiterer Anziehungspunkt ist noch der Platz der Revolution. Viele kleine Cafes laden zum verweilen ein."

50,"“La Havane, La Vieille Ville.”","Après avoir visité de nombreuses villes ou pays, La Havane restera pour moi l'exemple de l'authenticité, la propreté et la chaleur de ses habitants. J'ai été très étonnée par leur niveau de connaissance et leur culture étrangère, l'ouverture sur les autres leur plaisir et envie de parler, de partager.Découvrir au détour d'une rue de magnifiques constructions, une présence du ""vieux continent"" avec le petit détail qui nous rappelle que nous sommes toutefois bien loin de celui-ci. Oui, aucune ville ne ressemble à La Havane, elle est unique. Je retournerai m'assoir sur la place de la Cathédrale, tremper mes lèvres dans la mousse d'une Bucanero, immergée par la musique du groupe ""Chocolate Caliente"". Ce n' est pas un rêve."
50,“la mia seconda patria...”,"Non voglio essere scontato, la mia è una dimostrazione d'amore verso quella terra che più mi ha fatto sentire a contatto con l'umanita' di tutti i viaggi che ho fatto fino ad ora.La Habana(avana per i più), è una concentrazione di razze ,popoli ,tutti riuniti sotto un'unica bandiera che,criticabile o meno,ha tenuto il punto ,con qualche sbavatura inevitabile,contro lo strapotere di un vicino scomodo come gli USA.Il fervore dei primi anni della rivoluzione ha ormai lasciato il posto alla certezzao quasi che qualche cosa cambiera',e di questo i cubani ne sono certi,non dimenticando il grande nonno Fidel.A parte questo preambolo dovutoCuba offre tutto quello che un turista puo' desiderare, dalle infinite spiagge che accerchiano l'isola all'entroterra che è ricco di valori a noi ancora sconosciuti.E' troppo poco lo spazio per ricordare citta' come Santiago,Camaguey,Santa Clara,Olguin,la stessa Habana e le isole Cayo Largo.Cayo Coco,Cayo Blanco.Bisognerebbe essere un cubano per sapee tutto di quella terra...io ho fatto il possibile per questo...per passione"

10,“CUBA: la gran decepción”,"Estuve en Cuba entre el 2 y el 17 de febrero de 2010, para participar entre otras cosas de un Congreso Internacional de Educación Superior. Desde el momento mismo del arribo al aeropuerto hasta la salida de la Isla, fue una experiencia completamente desagradable. Los taxistas cobran lo que se les da la gana a los turistas, los porteros y empleados de hoteles venden de contrabando todo lo que puede interesar, bajo engaños y falsificación, a un turista: habanos, moneda, artesanía, etc. La ciudad de La Habana está, literalmente en ruinas. El bellísimo patrimonio arquitectónico que alguna vez hizo de esa ciudad un lugar maravilloso, es a mi entender ya irrecuperable. Los edificios se caen a pedazos, de noche la iluminación es escasísima, en fin: La impresión es la de estar en una ciudad desvastada, solo con supervivientes al borde de la miseria. La atención al turista es pésima en general. La comida escasa, mala y carísima. Los cubanos han entrenado su instinto de supervivencia en base a 50 años de penurias. Y eso, el turista lo paga. No robarán o estafarán abiertamente, pero han desarrollado las mas variadas formas de embustes, mentiras y charlatanería que los convierte en únicos. En Cuba nada es lo que parece, ni la tan mentada educación, ni la salud ni los avances científicos en medicina y biotecnología. Durante los 15 dias de mi estadía prácticamente no hubo pan en la isla, ni hortalizas, no solo para los cubanos sino tampoco para los turistas.El turista sentira que llega a una educada tribu de caníbales, que no tendrán escrúpulos a la hora de despojarlo de todo cuanto puedan. A los que pretendan viajar, les recomiendo que se ahorren los malos ratos que deberán pasar. Una gran decepción."
50,“Viaje cultural”,"Hola, Me he quedado con ganas no solo de quedarme varios días más, sino de quedarme a vivir en Cuba, me he enamorado de cuba, por lo siguiente: no hay contaminación acustica, no hay violencia en el transito, no hay agresión entre las personas, en suma es todo más paz, al mil por mil y con esto te resumo todo, como la gente tiene toda un mismo nivel social no hay ganas de matar a otro como se dice en vulgar, para sobresalir, y me encantó por su naturalidad, por la gentileza de su gente, bueno que mas te puedo decir de La Habana y Cayo Largo(Caribe).Ha sido el mejor viaje cultural que he hecho,en Cuba no hay habre,no hay desempleo, hay sanidad publica, hay educacion gratuita y obligatoria, son supercultos, todos tienen un techo donde vivirSabeis que en Latino-america hay mucha hambre,miseria,enfermedades, niños trabajando etc. y aqui no.Estube en la peluqueria que me costo 16 pesos cubanos, compre una barra de pan que me costo 15 pesos cubanos, compre una pizza que me costo 10 pesos cubanos,1 puro 1 peso cubano, tambien un chorizo que me costo 1 CUC(dolar), ya se que ganan unos 250 pesos cubanos al mes, unos 10 dolares al mes pero tambien se que tienen la libreta de racionamiento cada 15 dias(arroz, pollo, aceite...) y que solo pagan un 30% de la luz que consumen etc.Se que no pueden tener lujos, pero tienen las necesidades basicas cubiertas.Espero que podais ir a Cuba lo antes posible, es como estar en España 100 años atras, pero antes leete un poco la independencia de cuba 1898, algo sobre José Martí,Fidel Castro,El Che Guevara y Camilo Cienfuegos.. Si quieres aprovechar tu viaje estudia un poco de historia porque te hara falta. Ej. Carlos III hizo un Castillo que cuando termino le dijeron si iba a ir a Cuba y verlo, el dijo que con lo que le habia costado lo deberia ver desde España.No dejes de ir, lo recomiendo, y ademas coge el mismo hotel que yo .Hotel Nacional de CubaEl Hotel Nacional de Cuba, inaugurado el 30 de diciembre de 1930, es uno de los hoteles más clásicos y emblemáticos de La Habana. ...Aqui se hospedo grandes personalidades, presidentes, Sara Montiel entre otros es una pasada, es un monumento Nacional si no te hospedas en el, por lo menos ves a verlo, eso si acompañada por la guia es gratuita, ya que antes en ese sitio habia una fortaleza, podras ver las trincheras, cañones, cueva etcNo se engañen como nosotros pagamos en CUC(dolar) ir a Cuba sale Caro ya que al igual que hay hoteles buenos, tambien hay muchos restaurantes muy buenos pero logicamente son caros.Un consejo los que mas engañan son lo taxistas nunca que te digan el precio, la manera unica de que no te engañen es exigiendoles que pongan el taximetro(sale mucho mas barato, los taxis en Cuba no son Caros por lo legal), en los restaurantes que te den la cuenta por escrito y por lo demas no hay que buscar precios baratos en cuanto a excursiones ya que no hay competencia de precios.Ir a Cuba alucinareis, y vereis que no hay estres porque todo es media hora mas tarde.Buenas vacaciones, disfrutarlas y no intenteis arreglar el pais."

Les transports cubains ne sont pas du tout ponctuel, les taxis sont un peu chers (ils ont vus les touristes) ainsi que les excursions des hôtels. Les cubains font vraiment attention quand ils vous prennent dans leur voiture.L'architecture de la ville est vraiment impréssionnante et vous fait voyager dans le temps. Mais la ville est vraiment dans un état .......... N'hésitez pas à rentrer dans les patios. Souvent les portes sont ouvertes et les cubains sont vraiment très accueillant. Ils n'hésitent pas à vous proposer de vous faire visiter la ville. Rhum et Salsa nuits et jours dans les rues. En échange pour les remercier vous les invitez à boire un verre ou à manger dans les restos qu ils connaissent et qui sons des restos avec des prix abordablesN'hésitez pas à prendre dans votre séjour les transferts car ils sont vraiment très cher.Nous sommes partis a varadéro (plage, soleil bronzage repos....) Toujour le même accueil chaleureux. Les villes de varadéro se ressemblent mais valent le détour .Prenez dans vos valises des vêtements que vous ne mettez plus. Les cubains ne vous demanderons jamais d'argent mais vous pourrez les remercier de leur services en leur donnant."
20,"“Barcelo Mediterranea Saidia, Marruecos”","He llegado hace unos dias en este ""hotel de 5 estrellas"" y no puedo mas que decir que espero que cambie mucho, ya que el entorno es idilico. El hotel carece de servicios tales como limpieza y mantenimientos, servicios esenciales para esta categoria como una recepcion operativa y resolutiva. Comer comiamos, pero todos los dias lo mismo y en un horario nada flexible (desayuno 7 a 10, comida 13 a 15 y cena de 19 a 21). El Snak bar se prevé abrirlo para el año que viene y en un horario de 10 a 18 horas. Como punto bueno, el campo de golf. El hotel tiene que ponerse las pilas para dar un servicio acorde a la categoria y esto no llegara a menos que se realicen inversiones importantes en el hotel, lo cual dudo viendo la situacion actual"

40,“un sitio encantador pero ojo a quien se le habla”,"La Habana es un lugar encantador, aconsejo visitarlo con cuidado:La bodeguita del medio, solo beber el famoso mojito(comer allí resulta caro), el Malecón de la Habana, el Hotel Nacional, la fortaleza, la fabrica de tabaco, el paseo de Marti.CUIDADO:""los jineteros"" los que llevan a los turistas a lugares caros no ofreciendo la calidad prometida (después de auto invitarse se cobran ellos ademas la comisión). ejemplo: ""El toldito"" un bar en la calle San Rafael, cerca del hotel Inglaterra. Me cobraron 5cuc. x mojito con hojas amarillas. El baño tupido era asqueroso!Por no discutir pague y me fui muy decepcionada, era las 12 de la noche de mi cumpleaños."
30,“Con un día alcanza”,"El recorrido de la ciudad de la Habana se agota en un día. No recomiendo el humilde espectáculo del cañonazo que se realiza diariamente a las 21,00 hs. en el fuerte. Sí es excelente el show de Tropicana (cobran por ingresar la cámara fotográfica) adonde sugiero ir ya comido, pues la cena es cara y no está a la altura del lugar y del espectáculo que se brinda. Vale la pena visitar la Casa de Gobierno y palacio MunicipalEn todas partes en general el trato es muy amable. Visto los salarios que perciben y las condiciones de vida a que se encuentran sujetos, resulta comprensible que quienes nos atienden aguarden alguna gratificación extra. Muchas personas que prestan servicios de camareros, taxistas, etc.,son profesionales médicos, ingenieros, etc. que a través de esa gratificación pueden mejorar algo su pasar. La paradoja es que quienes realizan los trabajos en la menor escala, tienen mejores retribuciones a través de las propinas, que quienes realizan tareas tras un mostrador que nada reciben."
40,"“Ciudad única, pero en ruinas”","Lo mejor de La Habana, y de Cuba entera son sus gentes. Nos encontramos con una ciudad ruinosa (zona de El Vedado), y calles desastrosas (alrededores de Calle Obispo), por sólo citar dos ejemplos.Por contra, hay exceso de museos y casas natales de los héroes de la revolución. Es abrumador e irrelevante (por su escaso interés) a la vez.En cuanto a la vida nocturna, debe tenerse en cuenta que se encuentran en economía de guerra (tal cual) y el alumbrado público sólo existe en muy pocas calles y deja muchísimo que desear. Una vez situados en el ambiente que buscamos, la noche será genial, sin duda alguna.Todo gira en torno a la revolución y sus héroes. Por tanto los edificios referidos a ello estarán perfectamente a su disposición, no las calles donde viven los cubanos de a pie.Excelente mención necesita la zona de La Habana Vieja (catedral, plaza de armas, casa de la artesanía, la bodeguita de enmedio, la Floridita, la calle Obispo, café Paris, etc, etc, etc). Todo esto en una zona muy concreta y de fácil acceso a pie.Si os gusta el mojito: en el bar del museo de Havana Club. Pero sin duda alguna.Me ha quedado la impresión de la pobreza de las gentes, que vivien amontonadas en casas arruinadas, un puerto marítimo (de la capital del país) vacío y destartalado, y por contra zonas de arquitectura faraónica (plaza de la revolución, famosa por los discursos de Fidel), ministerios, capitolio...En cuanto a aspectos más simpáticos: los coches de los años cincuenta (a cientos), los coco taxis, el ambiente del malecón, y la música en vivo (desde la mañana a la madrugada en cualquier rincón, bar, hotel, o donde sea). En general cualquier hotel (Hotel Nacional, Habana Libre, Inglaterra,...) tiene actuaciones de todo tipo a diferentes horas abiertas al público.De madrugada os recomiendo ""El gato tuerto"", en el vedado, frente al malecón, no muy lejos del Hotel Nacional.Tambien os recomiendo para ir a comer la Casa de Canarias y la Casa de Andalucía, Se trata de restaurantes humildes, pero con una relación calidad-precio brutalmente favorable. Existen también los ""paladares"", restaurantes habituales para los cubanos."

Varadero tiene unas playas hermosas y definitivamente la habana es encantadora...una recomendación: COMPRAR UN SEGURO MÉDICO, porque los servicios de salud, así sea una consulta de 3 minutos con el médico del hotel vale un dineral...en 15 minutos de consulta por un dolor en una pierna de mi madre se fueron casi 110 euros!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Y asi sucesivamente...en el hotel todo era incluido (varadero) y en el de la habana venía incluido simplemente un desayuno...les recomiendo comer en la calle de la habana vieja...allí lo hacen todos los europeos y es muy barato (1 CUC), que es lo mismo o similar a un euro....los hoteles (casi todos) ofrecen servicios de autobuses gratuitos hacia la habana vieja...prepararse para caminar, observar y tomar muchas fotos...LES RECOMIENDO: la plaza de la revolución, el capitolio y la habana vieja. Suerte!....se me olvidaba...ojo con los vendedores callejeros que tratan de abusar con los precios y confundir con ladevolución del cambio o vueltos...No llevar dolares, sólo euros.

Par contre nous avons été fort décus par le Sévilla, beaucoup plus cher et beaucoup trop grand avec des prestations bien inférieures à celles du Florida. C'était bruyant, aussi peu chaleureux qu'un hall de (belle) gare ,seul point positif, une agréable piscine extérieure...Dans la région de Vinales éviter à tout prix l'hôtel de Pinar del Rio : Vueltabajo (éviter aussi la ville qui n'a rien à montrer)"

Parto de la base de que los cubanos en general me parecen gente estupenda, pero, y ahí esta mi sorpresa, no tenia ni idea de que existieran cubanos ,en compareción con españoles, tan ""ricos"".En mi recorrido por La Habana hemos visitado las tres partes que la componen, a saber: La Habana Vieja, Vedado y mi sorpresa ""Miramar"".

50,“Indimenticabile (sotto tutti i punti di vista)”,"Una città da visitare da soli e non in viaggi organizzati per apprezzare sino in fondo la reltà della città che si evidenzia soprattutto nella parte non prettamente turistica.Il consiglio è di acquistare una buona guida e di noleggiare una macchina (il traffico è scarso anche al di fuori della città) in modo da potersi muovere agevolmente visto che i mezzi pubblici sono scarsi.Indimenticabile il viaggio in una città che è in grande decadenza con pochi segnali di ripresa.Da visitare:- il Museo della Rivoluzione per poter capire il ""passato""- il Capitolio- il Paseo del Prado- il mercato Quatro Caminos che risulta essere uno dei mercati agroalimentari più vecchio ed importante della città. Sicuramente può essere una sorpresa per chi è abituato ai nostri mercati- il mercato domenicale che si svolge vicino a Plaza dela Revolucion dove si possono apprezzare le qualità dei prodotti agricoli locali- i quartieri interni dove si può vedere la vera Havana che non viene generalmente vista dai turisti- la gelateria Copelia dove i turisti hanno una sezione a parte e non possono mangiare il gelato assieme ai cubani.La lista delle cose da visitare è infinita. Il consiglio è quello di lasciarsi trasportare dai suoni della città senza seguire una meta precisa ma entrando nella ""vita"" havanese.Sicuramente abbiamo mangiato molto bene.Se riuscite cercate il quotidiano GRANMA. Davvero interessante."
50,“Una buena elección”,"La Habana tiene esa mezcla inefable de ciudad portuaria y canalla, de crisol y mestizaje de razas, de luz y sombra, colores y música capaz de hechizar los sentidos del turista que se acerca a ella y sorprenderle en cada esquina, en cada patio, entre columnas, entre flores, olores y sabores. Posee el encanto de la espontaneidad de sus gentes, de la suave indolencia propia del trópico y del ritmo ajetreado de una gran urbe.Mis sugerencias para el viaje son:Para desplazarse por La Habana deberían probarse todas las opciones de transporte público disponibles para el turista:coco-taxi (el más caro, aprox. 5-6 CUC), bici-taxi, taxi compartido (el más económico 1 CUC dos personas), taxi normal, guagua, calesa y moto-taxi, para los afortunados que localizen alguna de las que están en funcionamiento.Enfrente del Capitolio existe un restaurante muy recomendable por el precio, la abundancia y calidad de los platos, excelente servicio y agradable ambiente. Se llama ""Los Nardos"", existen tres restaurantes distintos en el interior, todos excelentes y con algunos platos comunes en el menú de los tres. Subiendo las escaleras nos encontramos en primer lugar ""Los Nardos"", un piso más arriba ""El Trofeo"" e indistintamente a través de éste último o de ""Los Nardos"" se accede a la pizzeria que ocupa el piso superior.Para los amantes del jazz, en la calle 23, zona llamada ""La Rampa"" ,en el Vedado, próxima al Hotel Nacional hay un buen club de jazz con actuaciones diarias y distintos artistas cada día. Se llama ""La zorra y el cuervo"". Con la entrada se tiene derecho a dos consumiciones."

Se recomienda recorrerla a tu gusto, no dejando de lado ningún lugar como La Haba Vieja, Miramar (el más lejano del centro), Vedado , Centro de la Habana, encontrarás el Capitolio, la Plaza de la Revolución, las fortalezas, sus iglesias, callejones en donde se respira nostalgia y son cubano.Algunos datos, puedes tomar un Coco Taxi en la Habana Vieja para que te lleve a la Plaza de La Revolución, cuesta unos 7 CUC (1 CUC= 1.40 Euros).Y a la Bodeguita del Medio, que está a un costado de la Catedral, tienes que ir sólo por un mojito y tomarte fotos, como turista no es agradable comer ahí.No dejes de asistir al Cañonazo de la 9 PM, tiene un costo de 6 CUC por persona, es imperdible si pasas por la Habana.Maravillate como nosotros con esta ciudad, una pos postal de los años 50, para enamorarse."
50,“Mi primer viaje al exterior (1997)”,"Cuba es un pais pequeño, pero mi impresión sobre sus ciudades, su cultura y su gente fue muy positiva, el clima es rico, la atención tambien, la comida... pues normal, el mojito...delicioso!!, las playas divinas, lastimosamente solo pudimos estar en el mar un par de dias devido a una tormenta q se acerco, pero en general, la pasamos muy rico Nubia, Mary y yo."
40,"“Cuba, un hermoso viaje al pasado”","Estuve en Cuba en dos ocasiones, en 1997 y entre diciembre de 2005 y enero de 2006.En la primera ocasión viajé con un amigo, aprovechando el encuentro de juventudes comunistas de todo el mundo, y en la segunda ocasión de luna de miel.En resumen la primera vez que fui, producto de la actividad, todo era fiesta y la verdad es que no se me hizo difícil pasar la noche con mujeres, que a cambio de una invitación a cenar terminaban la noche con uno.Igual conocí personas hermosísimas, desinteresadas y amables que me mostraron un real deseo de amistad, mujeres hermosas incluidas, que únicamente querían eso, hacer amistades.La seguridad ciudadana era excelente, incluso excesiva, para quienes vivimos en un país sin ejército, como Costa Rica, pero supongo que la actividad lo ameritaba.Recuerdo que me hospedé en el hotel Colina, de un nivel aceptable, y diagonal está la Universidad de La Habana, donde iba a dar un discurso Fidel Castro, me creí muy inteligente y me fui a mi habitación y abrí la ventana, desde donde tendría un panorama incomparable, pero apenas abrí lo que vi fue un franco tirador en el edifico de enfrente que me obligó a cerrar la ventana de inmediato y salí de la habitación, ya para entonces dos agentes de seguridad habían llegado a la puerta de mi habitación, no me dijeron nada, pero entendí el mensaje. Esto no me entristece, más bien lo recuerdo como una anécdota muy singular.Y no me mal interpreten, los policías son amables con el turista, y muy gentiles.Para el 97 Cuba apenas estaba en proceso de asimilación de la falta de ayuda de la URSS, tras su desaparición y la pobreza se veía muy fácilmente en los maltrechos edificios, autobuses y vestimenta de la gente.Igual, los cubanos son increíbles, siempre encuentran una razón para celebrar. Las playas son bellísimas y me arrepiento de alguna forma de no haberme hospedado en una casa autorizada por el gobierno para ese fin, pues se llega a conocer más a la gente así que aislado en un hotel.La segunda ocasión, casi 10 años después, fue mejor en algunos aspectos, se nota un mejor estado de los edificios y un mejor nivel de vida, quizás por la apertura hacia el turismo.Igual disfrute menos parranda, pero conocí más sitios, ya que en mi primera visita me dedicaba a las fiestas nocturnas que me hacían dormir casi todo el día, y en la segunda ocasión, conocí más La Habana de día, que de noche.Sólo La Habana te consume días enteros tratando de conocer sus sitios históricos y turísticos, es increíble la historia que encierra. En 1997 estuve 11 días, y la segunda ocasión fueron 9, y no me cansé de conocer sitios hermosos. Para mí Cuba es un museo viviente.Si lo que buscás es conocer un país atrapado en el tiempo tenés que ir a Cuba, si bien observás autos modernos, sobran los viejos vehículos gringos de los 50, que aún funcionan, los edificios son también de arquitectura hasta colonial en algunos casos, y otros más modernos, como de los 40 y 50, es como ver los de South Beach, sólo que un poco despintados.Las playas son espectaculares, de arena blanca, calmas y con un calor seco, que no te abochorna, como sí lo hace el calor húmedo del caribe de Costa Rica.No podés ir a Cuba y no visitar el Hotel Nacional, donde podés entrar libremente, te comprás un mojito y te sentás en lo alto de los jardines que te permiten ver el mar desde lo alto, igual ahí mismo podés visitar un pequeño museo que era un fuerte desde donde se disparaban los cañones para repeler a los piratas. Ahí mismo hay una galería de arte con exposición permanente de obras bellísimas.Tenés que visitar la Plaza de la Revolución, un símbolo de la insurgencia y un sitio amplio, podés subir al obelisco (previo pago) y ver desde ahí los dos extremos de la isla.También debés comerte un helado en el parque de Coppelia, donde se filmó Fresa y Chocolate, mientras ves pasar a la gente.Ni hablar del Capitolio en Habana Vieja , los museos, edificios viejos, la bodeguita del medio, la casa de José Martí, en fin, Cuba es un monumento a la historia.También podés regatear un poco y comprar artesanías bellísimas, en madera y otros materiales, aunque a mí me encantan las de madera y fue lo que compré.Por las noches sobran los sitios donde pasarla bien, donde a bajo precio podés escuchar músicos nativos que nada tienen que envidarle a las mejores orquestas de salsa del resto del caribe, Colombia y Venezuela.Lo que sobra en Cuba es eso, artistas, gente cultivada en las bellas artes que te sorprende con sus habilidades.También debés visitar Miramar, que es un sitio donde se encuentran la mayoría de embajadas y centros diplomáticos, por lo que se pueden encontrar tiendas al estilo Miami, algo que no se ve en el resto de la Isla, ni en el centro de la ciudad.Aunque debo aceptar que no compré nada porque los precios son muy altos. Pero en bus llegás en 30 minutos y podés pasar un buen día, almorzás y te regresás.Si vas a cuba tras mujeres, te recomiendo quedarte en una casa de alquiler, pues aunque hay restricciones al respecto, hay más posibilidad de que podás meter a esta mujer a tu cama, algo que se reduce a cero si estás en un hotel. Pero como digo, las posibilidades en las casas de alquiler son igualmente bajas, así que tendrás que pagar por una hora en una casa clandestina casi lo mismo que te cuesta una noche en la casa o el hotel, para poder tener sexo con tu compañera.Procura no comprar nada ""de oportunidad"", pues sobran los timadores que se te acercan ofreciéndote habanos o ron de marcas reconocidas, pero son falsificaciones, y podrías hasta tener problemas legales.No podrás pasar desapercibido en La Habana, como foráneo, tu ropa, por más sencilla que sea se notará sobre las ropas viejas de los cubanos, así que serás como un grano de frijol en medio de una puño de arroz. Eso hará que todo el mundo se te acerque vendiéndote cosas u ofreciendo chicas, lo primero que te dirán ""cómo estás"", y al recibir respuesta tratarán de identificar tu acento, casi siempre fallan diciendo ""mexicano"", en el caso de los costarricenses, y si les respondes terminarán haciendo conversación y caminando a tu lado, para hacer creer a los policías que son tus amigos y así no ser espantados por la autoridad, entonces querrán saber cuánto tiempo tenés de llegado a Cuba y si es tu primera vez, y con base en eso sabrán qué tan fácil te podrán timar.Así que decí que es tu tercera visita y que ya tenés más de dos semanas, así se irán porque pensarán que ya te conocés todos los timos.Así que no te sientas mal por contestar grosero, no contestar o hacer un gesto grosero con tu cara o mano de rechazo, pues eso es mejor que el timo que te querrán hacer.Si insisten amenazalos con llamar a la policía, verás cómo desaparecen en fracciones de segundo. No te confiés, ellos están escondidos, están en las esquinas, en las bancas, y calculándote como presa, sé grosero y te dejarán en paz.Es casi imposible que un cubano te asalte con fuerza o con un arma, eso sería una pena de cárcel casi inmediata y por muchos años, eso los cubanos lo temen, pero sí son expertos en timos, y te terminarán vendiendo algo o pidiendo algo de dinero regalado.Por ejemplo, en los alrededores de la Universidad de La Habana sobran tipos que salen de un momento a otro de la Universidad, bien vestidos, con un maletín y te dicen que son profesores, parecen alterados y te dicen que van de prisa porque su esposa acaba de tener una niña. Eso te enternece y le prestás atención, te dice que es profesor de historia (pese a que en esa sede, frente al Colina, sólo dan carreras de ciencias médicas) y te sacan de su maletín folletos y monedas antiguas y te las regala. Eso te engancha, luego te dice que está preocupado porque su bebé ocupa una medicina muy cara que no está en los hospitales cubanos y que si vos no podés comprarle la medicina en la farmacia, vos lo hacés y luego él la vende a menor precio en el mercado negro. Al decirle vos que no, se disgusta y te pide de regreso lo que te regaló y regresa a su punto en la Universidad, esperando una nueva víctima.Te lo digo, cuidate de los timadores.También sobrarán las prostitutas y los prostitutos. Cuba es muy segura, pero no andés por barrios no turísticos, para evitar problemas, y menos de noche, y no vayás a centros nocturnos a los que te inviten que queden muy lejos del centro turístico.Igual si decides hacerlo, llevá poco dinero. Y no llevés el pasaporte, es preferible una copia o que te lo pida un policía y te acompañe hasta tu hotel o casa de hospedaje para que se lo mostrés que perderlo. Aunque en ocasiones tu sólo acento basta para las autoridades.Te recomiendo desplazarte en bus, con cuidado de que alguien te saque cosas de tu maletín o bolso, sale más cómodo, y es divertido compartir con la población. Cuando esperás un bus siempre llegás y decir ¿el último? Entonces la última persona que llegó, antes que vos te dice “yo”, se supone que es para respetar la fila cuando llegué el bus, pero igual todo el mundo se avalanzará en molote para subir, pero es divertido preguntarlo para sentirse parte de ellos. Los precios son risibles en cuanto a pasajes, pues son en moneda cubana, hay dos tipos de taxis, unos para turistas y otros para locales, las diferencias por un mismo viaje, por ejemplo entre centro habana y habana vieja puede ser de 25 pesos cubanos (1 CUC) en taxi para locales a 5 CUC en taxi de turista.Igual hay sitios para comer muy caros (un día pagué 14 CUC) por un desayuno para dos (unos $17) a almorzar por 7 CUC en un paladar, que son pequeños restaurantes autorizados por el gobierno. Les recomiendo La Roca, es un restaurante cerca del parque de Coppelia y parece un restaurante fino, pero a bajo costo, buena comida, fina atención y hasta trovadores o pianistas acompañando tu cena. Excelente.De las playas de recomiendo Guanabo, ya que si bien queda un poco lejos (una hora de viaje en bus), hay más lugares donde comer o comprar bebidas, es un centro poblacional y el servicio de bus es mejor. Mientras que Santa María queda a medio camino de Guanabo, hay menos seguridad y menos lugares donde comprar y hay que caminar mucho para llegar al lugar donde se toma el bus. Pero ambas playas son preciosas.También podés comprar el pan en las panaderías, que no había en el 97 y preparar tu sándwich, si caminás por el malecón, desde la Piragua (Hotel Nacional) camino contrario a Habana Vieja, al cabo de 1 km te encontrarás un supermercado y varias tiendas, al estilo de un centro comercial, donde podrás encontrar algunas cosas, como jabón, pastas, carne, embutidos y otros productos.Respecto al dinero, antes se permitía el pago con dólares pero ahora no, ahora se utiliza una moneda que se llaman CUC (Peso cubano convertible), que equivale a unos 25 pesos cubanos y a $1.25. Existen las cadecas, que son casas de cambio oficiales, sólo cambiá tu dinero en estos lugares, no lo hagas con nadie más ni en los hoteles, pues saldrás perdiendo.Te recomiendo no llevar dólares americanos, pues te pagan el precio más bajo por él, te recomiendo los dólares canadienses o los euros, son los mejor pagados o bien, sin conseguís libras esterlinas también salís con buen efectivo.Los podés cambiar por CUC o por pesos cubanos, tratá de tener las dos monedas, ya que a veces si te comprás una golosina, pagás el bus o un taxi para locales será mejor que andés pesos cubanos y si comprás en tiendas para extranjeros tendrás que pagar con CUC. Un almuerzo te puede salir en la roca en 4CUC, mientras que con 100 pesos cubanos (4 CUC) podés comerte 100 helados en coppelia, un sándwich cubano de lechón en la calle por 3 pesos, en fin.Para que veas que hay dos mundos monetarios en Cuba, en el parque de Coppelia hay cerca de 4 puestos de helados, que cuestan un peso, pero siempre se hacen largas filas porque los cubanos lo consumen mucho, podés entonces ir al centro del parque sentarte en cómodas sillas y pedir un helado un poco más elaborado, por 3CUC (75 pesos cubanos).Prestá atención, sino te irá mal con el dinero, siempre preguntá si te hablan de pesos cubanos o pesos convertibles y hacé una operación mental rápida para ver si es un precio racional convertido a la moneda de tu país.Y si tenés dudas, escribime que yo te cuento."
10,“to er mundo e gueno.......”,"es un pais muy pobre , con mucha gente sabionda y simpatica , cuidado con confiarse, no cambies jamas dinero , llevaros 2 tarjetas visa y master y sacar dinero con pasaporte en entidades como banco internacional de cuba, no lleveis dolares, penalizan 20% los pesos cubanos carecen de valor( 25 veces menos que el cuc dolar cubano.todo el mundoi quiere sacar tajada desde taxistas,guias,buscadores de gangas etc..es un pais muy caro y las buenas comidas se pagan a precios muy altos y no con la calidad de aqui en españa.tienen una concepcion de la vida muy diferente y sobre todo viven entre la suciedad y el abandono.yo considero que la cal no es cara y que la limpieza en un pais turistico deberian cuidarlo mucho"
30,“como intentaron timarnos en La Habana”,"Algunas aclaraciones para evitar timos en La Habana:- NO es verdad que los cubanos no puedan hablar con los turistas. Lo que no pueden es ""acosar/hostigar"" al turista. Se hace para protegerlo de timos. Los policías conocen a los que se dedican a los timos de verlos ""trabajar"" y por eso los detienen. A nosotras nos salvaron del timo.- Los ""chavitos"" son LO MISMO que los CUCs o pesos convertibles. NO son monedas diferentes como te querrían hacer creer. Los CUCs son la moneda que usan los turistas.- Los PESOS son la moneda que usan los cubanos. Solo se pueden comprar ciertas cosas con pesos y generalmente de peor calidad. Los pesos cubanos apenas tienen valor, mientras que 1 CUC vale como 1 dolar. con CUCs se accede a todo. Por eso los cubanos quieren CUCs y solo pueden acceder a ellos a través de los turistas.- 1 CUC= 1 dolar.1CUC=24 pesos cubanos- NO es verdad que si pagas en CUCs (en un bar por ejemplo) un porcentaje de lo que pagas se lo dan al cubano que te acompaña en ese momento. TAMPOCO es verdad que si pagas en pesos (o ""chavitos"" para hacerte el lío) te ""ahorras"" esa ""comisión"" pq simplemente no existe, pagues en lo que pagues.- (Si vas a un paladar o restaurante recomendado por un cubano si es probable que a él le paguen por llevar un cliente. Pero ese es otro tema. No le pagan porque pagues en CUCs.)- Para que las cosas te salgan más ""baratas"" (te ahorras la ""comisión"") te sugerirán cambiarte el dinero en sitios como un ""mercado agropecuario"" (nunca sitios oficiales como un banco). Te dirán cosas como que la comisión les sirve a ellos para obtener comida para sus hijos.-Para ganar tu confianza te ""devolverán"" el dinero supuestamente obtenido en la cafetería de la ""comisión"" obtenida por pagar en CUCs. También pueden ir vestidos con camisetas de tour operadores para que creas que trabajan para ellos y asi confiar.- Te atraen diciéndote que te van a llevar al ""festival de la salsa"" o cosas similares que saben que atraen al turista."
