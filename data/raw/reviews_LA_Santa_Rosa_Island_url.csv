50,"Missed the boat tour, will definitely go next time in San Diego","We just saw the films in the park theatre. They were amazing and motivated us to want to the islands up close. There is only one touring company and it was booked up that day, so you need to plan your visit, something I did not do. Learn from my mistake, book before you come.",jerryssobel
50,Five star adventure on a day trip!,"Five star adventure on a day trip! Great for a staycation. Easy drive to the Ventura Harbor where we boarded the Island Packers boat. First dropped off kayakers and campers on Santa Cruz Island. Rather than taking the short way we were able to view the back side of Santa Cruz on our way to Santa Rosa Island. Glassy sea and comfortable weather enhanced the adventure.Great pier at Santa Rosa Island made going ashore easy. Naturalist explained the history of the Island on our way to the Cherry Valley trail. Once the trail became steep and rock we bade good bye to the hikers and backtracked our way to the beach.Flush toilets and running water!Beautiful place that deserves more time.On our return we explored, by boat, the Painted Cave on Santa Cruz Island. The sixty five foot boat easily fit into the cave! Awesome experience!Whales, dolphins and more dolphins made the return voyage to Ventura Harbor a wonderful journey.Island Packers does a great job and makes it an adventure.",Cavydad
50,Beautiful and Diverse,"Santa Rosa Island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. You can get here via boat (Island Packers from Ventura, 3 hours each way), or plane (Channel Islands Aviation from Camarillo). It is definitely not for everyone, but it is unbelievably beautiful and diverse. And well worth the trip.We camped for two nights at Water Canyon, so we were able to spend a few days exploring the island. We enjoyed the beach at Water Canyon, which extends from the pier to black rock. We took the coastal road (warning, as of June 2019 the bridge to cross Water Canyon was destroyed, so you have to cross water up to 3 feet in height to reach the trail) to the Torrey Pines Loop. These pines are one of the rarest pine trees in the world. There's one grove around San Diego, and this one on Santa Rosa. That's it. We also loved the hike to Lobo Canyon, the wind- and water carved sandstone features are unbelievable. No cellphone service, no restaurants, no stores. But just perfect.",Susie1028
50,a National Park with a varied human history,"this park didn't become one until 1986. It's the second largest island in the National Park that was home to the Chumash natives as well as cattle ranchers. This is also one of 3 locations where they have found the remains of an ancient endemic pygmy mammoth. Some buildings can still be seen. There are many hiking opportunities (like to Cherry Canyon). It's another remote island very well worth visiting. Bring water, good shoes, suntan lotion and a hat. You will need it.",Marion W
50,Get here if you can.......,"We flew out to the island with Channel Islands Air (CIA....yeah, sounds ominous). Empty, beautiful, cliff top dirt runway. Great surf. Wonderful hiking and pine trees. Rare to be someplace with so few people. It isn't cheap, but it is worth it. Check about taking a cooler/water, etc. Absolutely no services or opps to get anything you don't take with you for your adventure.",KansaTraveller
50,Worth the trip !,"Awesome little island off the coast. The boat ride each way is about 3 hours, so kind of long, but was still a fun part of the experience. Once at the island, we unfortunately only had 3 hours to spend there, did a short guided hike with the volunteer, then relaxed at the beautiful beach. Ut was windy and I felt the water was too cold for swimming, but nevertheless alluring and relaxing. There are clean bathrooms on the island and few camping sites, do camp there if you have the time.",zeejay808
50,"A day at Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park","For those who have never been to the Channel Islands, Santa Rosa is not the place to start, it is farther out, windier, and the distance means less time on the island. For those who have been to the neared Anacapa or Santa Cruz, a visit to Santa Rosa is delightful. The ride out and back is 2.5 hrs each way, unless you get stopped for a ""show"" - yes I mean marine wildlife. On our trip out, we were stopped by a display by a pod of 4-5 humpback wales who put on a show of breaches, pec-flaps, tail-flaps and the like for over 20 minutes! It was the highlight of the day.Not to say the island wasn't fantastic. Because of the distance out, there are 2 options: About 3 hours total on the island, OR tent-camp for 2 days until the next boat. The beaches are beautiful, the hiking plentiful, the scenery grand. We loved the whole experience. On the way back the boat captain took us into the Painted Cave on Santa Cruz, a place you're not likely to see on any of the other boat tours.We will definitely do this again.",Paul M
40,Cherry Canyon Trail,The hike was more challenging than I anticipated but we made it to the summit for great views of the island. The weather was overcast but made for great hiking weather. Our guide was terrible but the scenery made up for it.,dmbakerphd
50,"Peace, Quiet and Beauty","Santa Rosa Island is amazing! Staying for a few days isn't for everyone but I would encourage you to try. There are no amenities, no stores, and little room for error. Thankfully there were sinks and flush toilets. Some of the nicest in the entire National Park Service... but I digress. The campsite does have potable water. Fine for cooking, so-so for drinking.The campsite is a short and flat mile and a half from the pier. It is an easy walk... and walk you must. There is no other way to get around the island.Visit the Torrey Pines, a Pleistocene era holdout. Hike Lobo Canyon (about 12 miles round trip from the campground) to the beach. Visit all you can. Watch for the foxes. Island Santa Rosa is recovering wilderness and it is beautiful.",D. Michael W
50,Day trip to Santa Rosa Island,"Stunning vistas, beautiful and peaceful hikes and long white sand beaches with hardly another person in sight. The boat trip out is long - 3 hours for us - but we stopped to watch a blue whale and a pod of 100+ common dolphin and the views of Anacapa and Santa Cruz Island as we passed were wonderful. We hiked Cherry Canyon, Water Canyon and down to the beaches and I can't wait to return next spring and do it all again.",Laura D
50,Worth the trip,"On day two of our trip to the Channel Islands we were able to visit Santa Rosa Island. It took a little longer to get out there, but it was worth the trip. We were only able to walk the Cherry Canyon trail, but it was a nice hike.",rebusinessforms
50,Remote beauty to explore in Southern CA,"First, most of the time, it is really windy on the island. You need to have the correct equipment or you will dehydrate and end up quickly in a bad way. Good tents that can take wind are a must. Also the foxes are everywhere and they will collect or chew on unattended things. Second, cell phones do not work on the island and there are very few rangers, so you must use caution. It is very remote and help is hours away, really follow warnings. The island is very rugged with many loose cliffs and canyons and few finished trails, but that all being said, it is worth it. You will see animals and plants found no where else in the world. Beautiful wilderness.",rawills5339
50,An unbelievable gem,"Go! If you are in the LA or Santa Barbara area and love the outdoors, YOU MUST go to the Channel Islands. Untouched beauty all around (once you get on the island which is an hour boat ride from Ventura Harbor). Hiking, camping, kayaking await. No tourist traps, just nature at its finest. Cannot recommend more highly, especially in spring time when the wild flowers are in bloom.",Sondra M
50,A day trip is not enough,"We took the Island Packers boat ride to get to Santa Rosa and spent 2 nights on the island. It took us about 3 hours to get there and the weather was bad in the morning.Day 1: As soon as we reached, we went to the campsite and set up our tent. We had lunch and went off to the Cherry Canyon and then Lobo Canyon trails. Lobo Canyon was by far the most impressive hike on the island (and we did almost everything that was on the map). It took us about 5 hours (round trip) from the pier and we were exhausted by the time we got back. It was well worth the trip though - we saw interesting trees, flowers, rock shapes, paths through bamboo-looking plants, birds, and, at last, a beautiful desolate beach where we dipped our feet in the cold water (that felt great after all the walking). Once we reached the campground, we had dinner and went to sleep almost right away since it was too windy to stay outside of the tent and we were exhausted from the day.Day 2: We went off to East Point (the longest trail) and passed through the Torrey Pines trail. That was a lot of walking (once again). Torrey Pines was worth the hike uphill - those trees are beautiful and have huge pine cones. Going to East Point was not exciting at all, partly because Skunk Point is closed in this time of the year. Also, there was no place on the road to hide from the sun or the wind and the walk was really long. We were lucky to find a nice beach near East Point and hide from the wind, so we could light up our gas stove and cook our lunch. By the time we found a place to cook and sit for lunch, we were already starving. We walked by the beach on the way back, but didn't spend much time there since it was very windy and we were getting cold. Again, too much wind, so we went to bed early.Day 3: We wanted to see Black Mountain that day,so we packed and took our backpacks to the pier, and then headed up for the trail. We took Soledad Rd on the way up and Telephone Rd on the way back and we were glad we didn't do it the other way around. Telephone Rd is very rough and it is not used (by cars) anymore. All other trails were clearly marked with signs where there was a chance of going the wrong way, but not Black mountain. We missed the path to the peak and we got very lucky to meet some of the island rangers who showed us the way. If you are going up Soledad Rd, first you reach Telephone Rd. going uphill on your left. You need to bypass it and walk around the corner, where you will see the path to Black Mountain peak going up on your right. There is a telecommunication tower on the peak and it seems to be the only one nearby. If it's clear, you can see three more of the Channel Islands form the peak - nice view, but not that impressive. Again, it was windy and there was no place on the trail to hide from the sun, so we ended up having lunch on the beach by the pier. By the time we were done, it was time to get on the boat.We stopped with the boat to see the Painted Cave on Canta Cruz Island and saw both dolphins and whales. That was certainly a great experience! We never saw the famous kit fox on the island, probably because we stored our food (as required) in the designated box. We did see some paw prints on one of the trails, though.We had a great time on the island, but since we are not experienced campers, it took some time to prepare properly for the 2-day trip. It was good that the water on the island is potable (although not tasty) and that there were spacious clean restrooms at the campground. Also, our tent did quite well in the wind, although we set it up only partly in the shelter (we saw a tent that did not stand up to the winds so well). I wish we had time to explore Water Canyon since its description sounded very attractive to me: ""Follow the stream bed and animal paths through a beautiful canyon with year-round water and native vegetation on the steep walls.""If you are going just for the day, think about spending about 6 hours on a boat with some snacks, drinks, beer and wine, and 3-4 hours on the (most likely) very sunny and windy island. This time should be enough to go to Torrey Pines and maybe Cherry Canyon or only to Black Mountain (which is good but not that impressive). The white sand beaches are also very beautiful, but it was too cold and windy to get in the water.Overall, it was a great trip! My advice would be to prepare for strong sun and wind and to use common sense where no direction is given. Get all the information you may need before you get to the island and familiarize yourself with the hiking trail map found here: http://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/upload/srihiking2012.pdf . Also, do not rely on your cell phone - there is no network coverage.",Gergana K
50,"White sandy beaches, and Torrey Pines!","This is one of the wonderful Channel Islands, and it run by the National Parks Service. It is a fun boat ride out, via Island Packers Cruises. Once you get there you'll be let off the boat onto a pier where you'll see the sandy coastline. Once off the pier and on the land, you'll see what once was a ranch with old wooden fences and buildings. In the distance you'll see rolling hills and during the summer months, flowing waves of golden grassy areas. There are many trails to walk, of different difficulties, so there's something for everyone! I chose to hike to the Torrey Pines. This island is one of only two places on earth that they exist! The walk was beautiful. I passed the campgrounds (yes, you can even camp on these islands) and a few grassy areas along the way. Once there, the trees were almost majestic. I took my time walking back and took a trail down to the beautiful white sandy beach for the lunch in my backpack. The blue, clear water was breaking softly against the sand. I was in paradise. I headed back to the pier to catch the boat, and on the way back, we saw some humpback whales; a mother and her calf. The mother was spouting and then diving down, showing off her magnificent tail, while the baby stayed near the surface and breached over and over! Then we moved on and made a stop at the Painted Cave (on the edge of Santa Cruz Island). It's one of the largest sea caves in the world. The captain brought the huge boat into the cave so that everyone could get a close look at the many colors that mother nature had put in this cave. Once we left the cave, we came across some playful dolphins and they raced the boat for a bit! Then we headed back to the mainland. It was a wonderful day and I can't wait to do it again!",Donna L H
50,Fantastic experience on Santa Rosa,"Thoroughly recommend this trip. Primitive yes! But well worth it if you come prepared. Island Packers were fantastic! Boat ride in was absolutely wonderful. We wish we had brought a folded up cart......we had to do three trips back and forth to the pier and campground to get our supplies sorted. That walk to the campground is very, very long and dusty! Water Canyon campground lovely and they have terrific amenities such as flushing toilets and clean, large bathrooms! The showers were unavailable until the drought is over :( but the flushing toilets did just the trick. Be prepared for windy weather. Bring extra pegs and ties for your tent. The windbreaks around the tent were very useful.... Would recommend the Los Lobos Canyon walk with the naturalist from the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. Dianne was awesome and very knowledgeable. Did not make it to Skunk Point ( all the surfers went there) or the Torrey Pines. We will be back for sure!!",sarahlevitt
50,Big island - plan to hike or take a tour,Santa Rosa is 15 miles by 10 miles. You get there by ferry or plane. Once on the island there is no public transportation so be prepared to walk and hike or bring a kayak. There is nothing available on the island so you must bring what you need - and take it all back with you. After years of ranching and hunting - the island is returning to its natural state. There are plants you won't see other places. The quiet is great. The wind is mighty. The canyons are great. Having 1500 feet in elevation and pretty beaches makes for a varied landscape and fun hiking. Plan carefully and you will have a wonderful day. See my review of Channel Islands Aviation. I found this to be an ideal trip!,SueMC_56
50,Ride there is 1/2 the fun,"Used Island Packers to get there and saw whales on way there and back, including a view of the Painted Cave on Santa Cruz. The boat staff was very knowledgeable about the terrain and sights.Read the hiking map before you get on the island (available on the NPS site, http://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/hiking-santa-rosa-island.htm) to plan your time if you are there for a day trip. It's realistic to walk to Torrey Pines to get acclimated to the island and the winds, and then take the Cherry Canyon trail back to dock as an excursion (but note that the trail head is hidden behind a large map sign that leads to campground).",SaturdayTravels
50,Exhilerating Camping on the Edge of the Deep Pacific,"My husband and I spent an incomparable 3 days camping on Santa Rosa Island, among the Channel Island off Ventura, CA. We traveled with Island Packers, concessionaire for the Channel Islands National Park. The captain and his crew and the Park Naturalist, Lisa Anderson,were totally dedicated to the passengers' safety and enjoyment. On the way out, we paused to watch whales, to take close ups of pelicans and seals, and to drop off day trippers at various islands. The sea was choppy and the wind strong, but we had expected that since since all of us were warned when we made reservations and before we boarded.When we reached Santa Rosa, we unloaded into rubber dinghies at Water Canyon Beach. Getting down with all our gear was tricky, but the crew helped every step of the way. When we got to shore, we had to climb out and walk through the surf, but again, we had been warned and we were helped whenever we needed it. Once on land, we were on our own; still, it wasn't complicated to figure things out.The 1/4 mile hike from the beach to Water Canyon campground was the most difficult part. The climb from the water to the camp site was very steep and carrying all the gear was arduous for 60+-year-olds. Again, we knew what to expect and just made our way. Two young men very nicely helped with the heaviest item. The campground is gorgeous, with endless views of the hills and sea. We made sure to get our 2-man tent well tethered within the windbreak because we knew that the wind would really start to blow as soon as the sun started to go down. We also squeezed the picnic table as far in as possible so that we would have enough shelter to boil water for soup and coffee. That came in handy later when we were joined by our neighbors for a game of cards.The rangers at the island are well informed and attentive; among them, Lisa Anderson is an outstanding Naturalist and guide. She laid out the possibilities for our stay and scheduled hikes to the far side of the island as well as to the more accessible and warmer side. We hiked both routes and were amazed at the depth of Lisa's knowledge and her kindness in making sure we got to see everything. What we were interested in was what formed her presentations. The hikes are on a tight schedule, and at times require sure-footed hikers, but they are not rigorous. Viewing the Pacific from the far side of Santa Rosa was the highlight of the stay.On a tight schedule, and through a rough sea, the Island Packers boat met us on the third day. Again, we had to walk through the surf, but the crew handled all of the gear and made sure we all arrived safely on board. On the way back, we had a wonderful adventure. We stopped to pick up a few passengers on Santa Cruz Island, and then we began an unforgettable tour. The captain knows every inch of the channel Islands and he had a hundred fascinating stories to tell. We had to be careful because of the waves, but we paused to enter Painted Cave on Santa Cruz Island and to leisurely progress along the bays of the island. Then the captain announced that he had been informed by another boat that there was a dolphin feeding frenzy going on on the west side of the island. Hang on! We raced out to see the frenzy, then we roared along in the middle of hundreds upon hundreds of dolphins in the water and birds in the air. They leaped and swept and dove and screamed. and we slid along with them. As we turned toward Ventura, all of a sudden it was wintry. It was wet. It was wonderful.",Off-the-veranda
50,A world away,"This island can now be reached via plane through Channel Islands Aviation. Its a beautiful, quick 25 minute flight from Camarillo Airport. The island is remote but there are lots of trails, pristine beaches and restrooms. Over the course of 4 hours I was able to visit 2 beaches, see a Torrey Pine forrest and walk on trails with incredible views. We saw several leopard sharks in a bay, pelican and even a bald eagle. You owe it to yourself to take a trip to this island.",Cynthia S

50,Paradise with wind,"My husband and I went out to Santa Rosa on Island Packers from Ventura. We chose a day trip because of the night time wind (day wind is bad too but doesn't spoil the trip). We had a great boat ride over, spent 5 hours exploring, and cruised along santa Cruz on the way home. While on the island we went straight to the beach for lunch (20 min walk) and were delighted to see bright white sand and blue water-so beautiful! Then we walked to the campground where we took the 3 mile trail called Cherry Trail which lead back to the pier. Once at the pier we climbed down the stairs (low tide) and played on the beach tide pooling for an hour. We both enjoyed the experience on a remote island! Wear layers for boat and wind.",SweetPeaVentura_CA

50,We loved the hiking,"This is a great place for hiking. From almost every trail, there is a view of the ocean. The trails are clean and well marked...they are steep, but not too strenuous. In the campgrounds, the kit foxes are everywhere. We plan to go back soon",Kandy R
50,Santa Rosa Island,"Visited Santa Rosa Island on a charter flight with Channel Islands Aviation. Our pilot and tour guide was Mark Oberman, who has been flying around these islands since before I was born.He drove us around the ranch area and pier, and--after giving us some options--dropped us off at the Torrey Pines trail for a short hike up to the ridge and back to the runway via Black Rock.In addition to getting to see the historical buildings, flowers and wildlife on Santa Rosa Island, we got a good overview of Santa Cruz Island from above (Anacapa Island on the other hand was hidden in clouds).",Eric Jain
50,"Serene, Harsh Beauty--Not for Wimps!","Camping on Santa Rosa Island is definitely NOT for everyone; however, if you want the real deal camping experience, you must go! Camp here only if you appreciate quiet, windswept views and at night want to see the most mindboggling view of the milky way. In the day, hike to Cherry or Lobo Canyon and bring lots of water. For nighttime, bring a comfortable lounge chair, and a really good book. Before you leave, make sure to pack out every single speck of garbage. Oh, and bring plenty of chocolate. Peanut M and M's taste especially delightful here for some reason.This is a fantastic trip--not many places like this left in the U.S.",professorBgirl
