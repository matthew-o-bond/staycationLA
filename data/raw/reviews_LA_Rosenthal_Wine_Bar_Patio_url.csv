50,Great atmosphere with local wine,"We love rosenthal winery! Live music on fridays and Saturday‚Äôs with food trucks available. Great picnic style area with comfortable tables, umbrellas, and convenient and clean upscale port-a-lets. We like the wine club membership they offer to get extra perks. There are a couple of nice places to eat dinner before or after a stop at the winery and the beach is literally across the road. The sunset here is lovely. Friendly people make us feel at home. We highly recommend a stop at rosenthal winery and even better if you join their wine club. There is some indoor seating but we like the pleasant lawn area. They have lawn games to play is live music at night on weekend. Lots of good memories from here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610charj
40,Fun Joint for a Saturday or Sunday Funday,"At first glance you may miss this place driving down the PCH.. except for the huge chairs and wine glass out front which makes it somewhat touristy vs a sophisticated wine tasting room... was charged $8 to park (no other option), but was glad we arrived at noon, as this place gets packed and parking is hard to get. We did a mix of red and white tasting and then purchased two bottles of the chardonnay... overall the wines are fine and the inside did have a wine tasting room feel... but the highlight is the backyard patio with live music and picnic table seating... since this was our first time, we didn't realize that it was bring your own food, but they did have a food truck that had some pretty good looking tacos and burgers.. my buddy had the burger and said it was really good.. Cholada Thai is also next door... (go grab some golden bags!!!)... by the time we left around 3pm.. the place was packed and standing room/patio only.. with a lively vibe.. would definitely go back...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlanoGreg
40,Good Wine,"This is a wine bar and patio where you go in and purchase what you'd like to drink and take it out to the patio and enjoy the ocean air, your drink and music. They don't serve food but there is a food truck on site if you desire. It has a nice feel but when crowded parking is difficult",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707lpf
50,Sunset at Rosenthal,The wine tasting was great! We learned about the process of becoming a sommelier and about the weather/drought patterns in Malibu and how it effects the grapes. Great wine and great live music. Phillip is an absolute legend and did a great job of walking us through the wine tasting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianHollie
30,Wine Sampling,Stopped here at the weekend. $5 for parking. Seems like a fun place to sample wines and enjoy the music outside. BYO food. We ordered the white and red wine samplers. The folk serving knew there stuff but the wines were just so so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFTraveller62

You will not be sorry",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawgs2018

40,Wine Tasting and Live Music close to the Ocean,"Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon sipping wine and listening to music while enjoying the ocean breeze.Forget the dark wine bar and head for the sunny garden patio in the rear where there is live music on weekends.Yesterday we heard extremely talented, energetic young musicians, brother's Matthew and Josh Samson on Guitar and Reinhold Schwarzwald on Saxaphone. They played cover songs, reggae and their own material. The crowd loved it! We would go back there just to hear these guys.We enjoyed a superb, cold Rosenthal Chardoney and a picnic that we brought from home.They have a pizza truck that serves very good pizza or you can order food from a nearby Thai Restaurant if you get hungry.Highly recommend for a great outing on the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2trvlLa
40,Sit back. Unwind and have a bottle of wine!,"The place is simple, almost basic but the wines! Ohh, great selection, really good! Bartenders are knowlegeable, helpful, entertaining and accomodating! Parking is quite limited so I suggest you come off hours like 11am, better yet, come on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boots5758
50,A funky little winery bar off Malibu,"A very cozy, relaxed, fun wine bar in Malibu.I went to check out the wine tasting selection and it was well worth it!A decent selection of red and white wines to try with a great 80s music selection and warm staff, what more do you need from a bar?!I would definitely head back here again, this time, reserve an area in the wine garden where there is live music on weekends :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deexo
10,Not good,"Their wines are not really good. It‚Äôs reasonably new. One of the wines from the tasting list tastes like fart. Also, it‚Äôs quite expensive. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunapascale

40,Roadside winery and garden area - ok but nothing special,"This roadside winery on the Pacific Coast Hwy is easy to find and has a large car park alongside its garden area. We tried several wines and they were just ok, (although I admit to not being a wine connoisseur), so we didn't buy more bottle to take home. Our visit coincided with what seemed to be an office group ending a boozy lunchtime - several of the girls were busy throwing up in the garden area as we sat down to enjoy our glasses of wine. Eventually the group was gathered up onto two buses and driven away, I expect their journey was eventful as some of the passengers were not really fit to travel anywhere.Good points:+ Reasonably priced+ Easy to find+ Plenty of parkingNot so good points:- Overenthusiastic visitors can leave their mark around the garden so watch where you tread and sit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000
40,Fantastic Ambience and solid Wines,"I couldn't wait to take my friend to our new favorite wine spot, the Cornell Winery in Agoura Hills, but when we go there, they were closed for a private party. We hadn't been to Rosenthal since they moved to their current location, so we decided to give it a go, and I'm glad we did.The best thing about this new location is the grounds. It's beautiful! The inside is very nice, and it's right across (the street) from the ocean. But they have a HUGE back patio (that's so large, ""patio"" isn't the right word) that is absolutely gorgeous at night! This is the perfect place to bring a large group of people for a nice, relaxing hang out!The wines are pretty decent. We did a flight, and they were all very solid. None I didn't like, none that kicked my butt. But very solid. Picture the best Malibu Family Wines has ever had... but nothing close to what they typically have available at Cornell Winery.The negative part is the prices. It is an outrageous $17 for a 4 wine flight! That's crazy to begin with, but if you're only serving 4 wines on a $17 flight... you'd better be giving generous pours... but nope... these were run of the mill stoppers with tiny amounts of wine. The glasses and bottles are very expensive as well for what the wine is, or at least the options. Most of the bottle START at $48 and go up... Let me tell you... you can buy bottles on par and far superior to these for around $20 at Cornell Winery... and for $35 you can buy literally the best bottle you've ever had in your life! So the value at Rosenthal compared to it's competitors is not good.I would say the value is a 2, the wines are a 4 and the ambience and atmosphere is a 5... so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and giving them a 4, because your experience here (if you can afford it) will be wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Good Wine Tasting Place,"We met some people here for wine tasting, and weren't disappointed. Although the wines aren't great, they prices aren't that high either, so its a good value for mediocre wines. The only food they had came from a food truck out back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgL1591CZ
50,Can't wait to return,"Visiting from Canada, I stopped in to check out the place during the day. We had been the night before for a family wedding which was fantastic. My cousin is a member there and I was given the VIP service. The wine itself is incredible and the location is amazing directly across from the beach. If you are in the area you need to stop in for sure. The staff are friendly and it's a very casual laid back comfortable atmosphere to enjoy excellent wine and hang out with friends in a beautiful outdoor setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janyamilli
40,Great way to spend the day!,"Beautiful location across from the ocean. Comfortable seating for large or small groups- there were 4 of us. The wine selection is good, we got a sparkly wine that was very good. Took our own snacks and had a lovely time. Loved the variety of music. It was during the week so it was quiet. Understand they have live music on the weekends so will probably go back for that experience. The bar person was very nice, helpful and welcoming. They have wine flights but you have to stay at the bar for this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
40,Great for small or large groups,"This place was great for a relaxed low-key birthday party. There is an $8 dirt parking lot right next to this place, or you can find free parking on Pacific Coast Highway. Wines are ordered inside and they give you an ice bucket for the wine. We had a sparking rose and orange muscato that were really good.We arrived right when a party was leaving and was able to get a table with an umbrella.Any table that doesn't have a ""reserved"" sign is first come first serve. You can bring your own food and on the weekends there is a food truck and live music. They have higher quality portable restrooms, though towards to the end of the afternoon the women's side did get a bit messy with toilet paper and paper towels. Cornhole is set up between the men and women's entrance, so watch out for flying sandbags.If you have a party of 8 or more, you can make a reservation with a $50 deposit. For every two people you have to buy a bottle of wine. We had a party of 6 and bought 4 bottles and took the wine we didn't finish home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pocketsize_traveler
40,Great afternoon stop,"Lovely location and comfortable seating for visiting, enjoying wine and the location. Chris was so friendly and helpful in making wine choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattib59
50,Wine Tasting with friends,"Love this place! Great wine, wonderful location, and nice, friendly staff. Would highly recommend this place for a birthday party or just to meet up with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socialmediagirl69
40,Their wines are excellent.,"Went on a Sunday afternoon with members. This gives reduced prices for their bottles - which start at around $38. Then there is the 7 glass tasting (3 red and 4 white) - and I have to say they were all of top quality. No doubt about it. There is a food ""truck"".I thought I would give this a miss, but you can take your own snack food which is normal, and probably your best bet. A pleasure to be in a mainly youthful crowd of people, nicely attired and looking for a fun time. Right across the road from the Pacific ocean. We had a live guitarist. All very pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maxima5
40,Cool place with much potential,Interesting set up.The local wine was very tasty.Knowledgeable server.Huge outside seating area.We would have stayed and drank more if they had food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arloredrock
50,Fun place!,"We stopped by this wine bar in Malibu to do a wine tasting. For a very reasonable price you get to try 3 or 4 red wines and 3 or 4 white wines. The bar keep was very personable, and shared wine making stories with my husband.After the tasting we each bought a glass of our favorite and went outside. There was a food truck and live music. Across the street was the ocean . People were celebrating birthdays and other occasions outside, with balloons and other decorations. We spent a very pleasant afternoon here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaG618
40,Really Nice Tasting Room,Great tasting room in the perfect location. Would have been nice if you could take your tastings back and forth to the patio. Also would have liked a warning about needing to pay to park right at the building. Definitely just park on the highway leading up to the building. The wines were good. The servers were very friendly. And you can't beat the ocean side location. We could have sat on the patio all day drinking wine and listening to the great music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtvogen
40,"Malibu's best winery, hands down","We'll start by saying Malibu isn't a place you visit to go wine tasting! You go for the 26 miles of coastal beauty! Here, the winery is an added bonus.There are 2 wineries people visit in Malibu, here and Malibu wines. Unfortunately for the taste buds, Malibu wines is more popular. That said, Rosenthal has much better wines, no questions asked!We went on a Saturday afternoon, while it was busy, it wasn't too busy for a little individual attention from the bartender who gave us detailed explanations of the wine, the history of the business and the French wine maker who creates their wines and blends. I really enjoyed the specifics!The wines were pretty good, on the white side I enjoyed the roussanne and on the red, the pinot noir. As for food, they are limited to cheese and crackers and they have a food truck every weekend with pretty decent variety. You can also bring your own food, which is recommended especially on weekdays.The patio is pretty awesome. But you'd expect that with outdoor space in Malibu on the PCH! They have live music there on weekends. If you want to guarantee space, you can reserve tables or there are public seating areas as well.I recommend stopping by 100%, I'm glad I only waited 13 years in LA to finally enjoy this little surprise on the PCH!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessehendon
50,So fun and awesome....,"Wines are delicious and love that you can buy them and take home. On a Sunday, they had music outside which was fantastic. Do the tasting flight, then buy a bottle",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romazzino
30,Slow service,"We were driving past when we saw the giant table and chairs out the front, and I love roadside big things, so we stopped in. It was just before 11am on Saturday and a man told us he'd have to charge us $6 for parking. We told him that we just wanted to taste some wine and wouldn't be long, so he let us park for free.The staff were great knowledgeable etc, but he kept getting distracted by other things and left us for ages, a few times. He ended us giving us another free tasting to apologise for the lack of service.It was $16 before tax to taste 4 wines, we got just 1 tasting to share. There was 2 wines we liked, of course they are the most expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0wi3
40,A fun yet informative winery,"On our way down from LA to Venice Beach, we found this gem of a winery along the way down the Pacific Coast Highway. Though it seemed to be a crowded, traffic-infested area, we were pleasantly surprised at the grounds. The local sommelier definitely knew his stuff. There was a wine for every taste, and very reasonably priced. Buy a bottle and enjoy it in the backyard. There is a stage so, though we were there on a weekday and during the day, they have bands that come there. Maybe next time! Make sure to visit, taste, and buy when in the Malibu area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MannyDana
30,"Good location, mixed review on tasting itself","We stopped in impromptu while waiting for take-out order at Cholada next door. Venue very pleasant, especially tables out back with live music on weekends.Wine tasting was mixed. The menu advertises a tasting flight, which normally means 4 wines on a platter at once, which you can take with you, say outside to the lawn. Here it means that you get 4 sequential (small) tastings of wine at or near the bar. Not bad, just not what we thought we'd signed up for.Our wine steward, however, was very knowledgeable (by Napa or Bordeaux standards), very personable and solicitous. We enjoyed talking with him and learned a few things.As others have noted, the retail prices are not remotely competitive. We bought a bottle of Albirino in large part given the experience with our steward, which seemed fair. But hard to justify buying bottles of wine there to take home.So, hang out in the back, drink wine, and listen to the music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swb_muir_beach
40,Wine Tasting on PCH ...,"Rosenthal Winery's tasting center is conveniently sited on PCH 1 / Pacific Coast Highway, right between the Reel Inn & Choladas. Easy off from PCH with lots of parking places. Pleasant and attractive tasting center serving fine Rosenthal wines. Fun., you'll enjoy.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
10,"Nice location, horrible wines",The wines are of a poor quality. You can buy better tasting wines for $5/bottle at TJ's. For $30 a bottle you would be much better off with 1995 Chateau Canuet Margaux (you can find it at Wine House).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer94
50,Great fun on a Friday Night,"My friends and I headed to Rosenthaall on a Friday night whilst on holiday.We couldn't believe our luck as it was a wine tasting (4 different wines) for ¬£13 each, plus on a Friday night there is live jazz AND (if you got a seat) you could buy boxes of crackers and cheese and just eat cheese and drink wine whilst listening to jazz. It was fantastic and great value for money. I really recommend this wine tasting on a Friday nightI managed to get over excited and break a wine glass (sorry about that guys...) and they were so nice about it.The huge table and chairs outside area also great fun...probably more so after a glass of wine.Helpful Hint - go on a Friday night, do the $13 tasting, eat cheese.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate_Robinson29
40,Nice way to spend an afternoon,Laid back atmosphere with knowledgeable staff. We brought ourselves a picnic and tasted several wines before purchasing a few bottles. I will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasteslikehappy
20,Run down road-side shack,I thought this was going to be a winery. But it is a dilapidated looking shack apparently 20 miles from the actual winery (which apparently only allows visitors on certain dates!). You can do wine tasting inside this shack and there is some tables and chairs. Through the back door you go into a dilapidated backyard covered with dirt and patchy grass and some tables and chairs. There were a couple of bands playing but the atmosphere besides being next to the beach is nothing to write home about. Wines are good but they should do something about the outside seating area. There are portable toilets at the end of the back yard! How much more tacky can it get?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy91206
50,Laid back,"Very nice, laid back atmosphere. They know their wines, but are not pretentious. Inside, you can sit and look across the PCH to the Pacific, or you can sit out back in a picnic like area. Food trucks occasionally.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaleG880
40,"Aging like wine, rather nicely.","I haven't been to Rosenthal in a long time, since before they moved for sure (I disliked their old location). So when friends invited us for a members wine tasting, I hesitantly agreed.Much to my surprise, the Rosenthal brand has gotten better with age. I remember doing a few tasting and maybe, just maybe liking 1 wine. Not enough to buy, just liking it enough to take a few more sips. This trip everything was pretty tasty. Their Albarino was the highlight of this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayy
50,A gorgeous day in the sun,"We had a blast here last wednesday. Decided to call in and then maybe go to the beach but the place was so nice we ended up hanging out in their garden, listening to the great music and popping in and out for a glass of wine. You can bring your own food and make a picnic out of it which I will definitely do next time.It was pretty quiet and you were never hassled by the staff who were wonderful.Chris was very friendly and always made sure we were well looked after. I would love to go back at the weekends when they have live music.A day we'll remember for a long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887ashc
50,Perfect Afternoon,"Beautiful location, directly across the PCH from the beach! Pack a picnic, bring in food from a neighboring restaurant (I love Reel Fish Inn), purchase light snacks on site, or order from a food truck on the weekends. Order wine by tasting, glass, or bottle. Live music on the weekends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessrleggett
50,Just great,"It was my first time going wine tasting. I had a blast!It's along the beautiful pacific coast highway in Malibu... You walk In and up to the bar where they serve you 4 different wines. We ended up buying a bottle and enjoying it with some friends .They have an outside patio area in the Parking lot end that has outdoor benches and chairs. The outside has a huge chair and wine glass which is great for pictures. After the wine buzz we took the little bridge that leads you under the highway and over to the beach.Caught a beautiful sunset and felt like I had a mini vacation, if you're with good company it is a nice not too expensive little spot to enjoy. The service was nice and not too aggressive , really cool.Great for locals as well as visitors. I would say it's in a nicer area of Malibu that isn't filled with young kids or teenagers so the beach atmosphere is just right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
30,Nice option for a day near the coast,"Went recently for a Saturday. They have their own wines available at a moderate price. The location features outdoor seating as well as a small indoor seating area. They have live music outside which changes performers half way through the day. The first music group that day was pretty bad, featuring all of their original music. The second performer was much better- he mixed well known current music with some originals and was very good. They have catering trucks at the location if your hungry, and the prices are kind of high for what you get. Overall, I understand that is how the make their money and I accept it as a business. They charge $5.00 to park . They only have outhouse facilities but they were clean and well stocked. All things considered, it was a pretty good day. I will go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelpY372BZ
40,We are in Malibu!!,"Beautiful Location right on PCH..... very good wines, knowledgeable staff. I have to say though, at $60 for a bottle of wine (one of the less expensive ones on the menu) and 2 wine tastings (which totaled about 1 glass, at the most), this will be a one hit wonder for me. Kind of expensive. But we are in Malibu.An absolutely beautiful place, we took our wine to the back patio area where we sipped in leisure and enjoyed the Sunday ""70's type"" of music ensemble that was the entertainment......The $5 parking fee was kind of over the top because this was a pricey experience anyway, but I can understand that because it is right across from the beach and they need to keep out the riff raff. The porta potties were probably as clean as can be reasonably expected but were kind of unexpected and a a turn off for such an upscale venue. The oversized chairs and bottle of wine outside the building was the best part for me. Funny.....like from the movie ""Big"". A nice experience, but having ""been there, done that"" I will return to drinking my two buck chuck in my lawn chair at home.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msdude
40,Nice day drinking spot in Malibu,"My wife and I had visited Rosenthal the year before with some friends and decided to return with some other friends visiting from Minnesota. This is not the winery, but the wine bar with a rear picnic area. The wine is decent but the location is right off the famous Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu across the street from the Pacific Ocean. There is nothing like drinking in the warm sun with the ocean breeze and the sound of the waves. The service is very good with friendly staff though the one male staffer was not that knowledgeable about his own wine. The staff was very attentive to bring out a wine chiller with ice and replace it when the ice melted. The nice thing about Rosenthal is that you can bring your own snacks and sit in the rear picnic area or sample the food trucks that are stationed there. Sometimes they will have music. The minor gripe is the $5 charge for parking in a dirt lot when you're purchasing bottles (plural) of wine - not a good business practice. I understand you do not want beachgoers parking there but you can have someone attending to that instead of charging patrons. Be aware that there is no bathroom but four outdoor upgraded port-a-potties. Also, Rosenthal will host special events and close off the rear picnic area, so call ahead on the day you plan to go and see if that is the case otherwise you will be relegated to the inside. Not that there is anything wrong with that but why be indoors when you are in Malibu?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/942donaldc
50,Wine Tasting at The Beach in Malibu,"This is absolutely one of my favorite places to hang out on a sunny afternoon!You can do a tasting flight inside with the super friendly and knowledgeable staff or order by the glass or bottle and sit outside in the grassy back patio area.Bring your own snacks/food, order from the gourmet food trucks (there every weekend) or get food to go from one of two amazing restaurants just a (beach)stone's throw away (Cholada Thai or Reel Inn) which are truly two of Malibu's great local secrets that still have the OG Malibu vibe from the good old days (I grew up in Malibu, so this means a lot to me and is not easy to find anymore with all the glitz that's come to town in the last couple decades).If you want to hang out on the beach, there is even an underpass that will get you safely across PCH if you're a little wobbly after your wine (Frogger is not as fun in real life!)The Tasting Room Manager, Riley, is one of the nicest and most authentic guys you'll ever meet. He treats everyone like family and he'll make you feel welcome and want to visit often... which I most certainly do!This brings me to the Wine Club, which is a GREAT deal if you live nearby because you'll get a free tasting for you & a friend (up to 4 times a month!) and it even includes social events at the owner's (Mr. Rosenthal himself) Malibu estate where some of the grapes are grown.Please feel free to watch the surfers across the street, but don't paddle out into the lineup if you don't know what you are doing/are not a local ;)Also... if you're NOT super friendly & cool, this place is not for you...It's 21 & over and children are generally not allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DogBeach90265
50,perfection,"Wine and music on the beach.. what more do you need? Tastings available at the bar, bottles available for purchase to enjoy in the garden. Live music on the weekends. Grab some take out (Reel Fish Inn for Seafood, or Thai food right next door) and enjoy with your wine! They have snacks for purchase (cheese, crackers, hummus, etc.) My favorite spot in Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessrleggett
50,Great wine tasting,"We went here on the way to a restaurant in Malibu and it was really interesting, we were a group of 7, and tasted several wines. They were really good wines and the staff were really knowledgable about their wines. Two of our group joined their club which meant all our tastings were free but we bought some wine to bring back to the UK.Really worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479AndrewG
50,We're Not Just Visitors We're Full-Time Members,"Yep this tasting room is my new Friday night destination. You will find me at the bar from 6 to 9. On weekends, you will find me on the back patio where there is likely live music entertainment. There is hardly a day when ""Rosenthal"" isn't lovely, wispy, blissful & amazing. Best off the tasting list is the 2009 Chardonay ""Sunny Garcia."" Second, the ""Malibu Estate"" Cabernet Franc. The 2011 ""Surfrider Equality"" has a sunny day ocean crispness, that's a wave you'll want to ride all summer day long. If you've truly joined the party, the ""Albarino"" is a keynote white for members only. I no longer need to drive all the way to Santa Ynez or Temecula, to get my needs for sublime wine experiences met. The only thing weak about the place is the bathroom situation. But there are a number of nearby restaurant selections for your after-party getaway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Life_of_Sean
50,Rosenthal Tasting room,Love coming here with my girlfriends. The prices are great and you have a beach front view with a grass garden surrounding. weekends you have live music. This is a great place to visit in malibu. Its affordable and you can bring in your own food or they have gourmet truck cooking along side. next door is a fish shack. across the street the beach. perfect place for a date or to go out with friends. sunset is best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynr2013

50,Basically the only wine we drink,"We have been Rosenthal Wine Club members for almost 4 years at this point. The staff is super friendly and willing to tell you about the wines you are drinking. Their new tasting room is beautiful and conveniently located right off the PCH. They have an awesome back patio where you can sit outside and enjoy the ocean breeze. They have an outdoor bar for easy drink access. They often have food trucks on the weekends as well as comedy events, trivia nights, and yoga at the estate in Malibu. The wine is fantastic and well-priced for the quality. I highly suggest checking it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtneyjestes
50,Excellent wine and beautiful sunset,"We went with 35 friends for a birthday celebration. The staff were very accommodating and interested in making this a great party. There was plenty of outside seating where you could watch the sun set - a nice variety for 2,4,6 or 8 - our party only took up about 1/3 of the back yard. The parking lot was ample and we were allowed to bring in our own food, cake and entertainment but I did see food being offered and saw on the calendar they do have entertainment on some days. I loved the merlot and we'll definitely be back. There was an indoor wine tasting bar, widescreen TV so you could pop in and catch the scores. We'll definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pathoranberg
50,Best Wines in Malibu Close to the Coast!,"My wife and I belong to the wine club. You have to buy the selection they produce quarterly but that is all. You can tase for free that way. If you don't belong, you can still taste but there is a charge. The wines are stellar, especilly the Reds. Their new location just North of Topanga Cyn. Rd. on PCH is spacious and modern. They have a wine garden in the back that has music. Call to confirm when, but usually the weekend. Escape the heat and drink wine across from the ocean, it doen't get better!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445ChrisR

40,"Fun place, really convenient location","Easy access right on the PCH. For the most part, minus a hiccup at check out, the service was super friendly and attentive. The atmosphere wasn't great, a little banal, but the happy staff (not to mention the gentlemen were also easy on the eyes!) made us feel very welcomed. The wine was decent, so we bought a bottle of the cab sauv (2006) with some brie (triple creme - yay) and crackers. There were also some fun wine accoutrements.It is worth visiting for its super accessible location and great staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ms_OffTheBeatenPath

40,"Good Wine, Great Location","Across the street from the beach, this tasting room is in a prime Malibu location. The wine is very good and the staff is friendly. Rosenthal has a casual, non-stuffy feel. On Pacific Coast Highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaCalifornia
50,Moving to a new tasting room,"Delicious wine, enjoyed everyone I tasted. Servers were very knowledgable and friendly. Were told they are building a new tasting room to open soon so check the new location before you set off. Don't leave empty handed either!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCKathleen
10,"Terrible service, atmosphere and price","This is nothing more than a roadside shack that charges a rip off $15 for a wine tasting. We waited about 15 minutes to have someone greet us only to state they were closing in 10 minutes at 5:30 and to sample a couple of red wines was $15 per person. The wine list was terrible and very over priced. We decided to walk next door and pleasant discovered an awesome restaurant with glasses of wine for $8, lobster, pasta, steaks, and much more plus a beautiful decor and the friendliest staff including owner I have met in a long time. We liked the place so much we stayed for dinner. It is called Beaurivage Mediterranean, website is beaurivagerestaurant.com If you place the Rosenthal winery in your GPS or print a map, do so only to find this awesome restaurant and say hello to the owner Daniel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phenomjet
50,"Rich, Generous Wines and Knowledgeable Staff","I live in Malibu, but frequent Rosenthal--The Malibu Estate Tasting Room. I always take out-of-town guests to visit the pretty, little tasting room located on the Pacific Coast Highway adjacent Beau Rivage Restaurant. For $15, you can try all of the wines. I am a member of their Wine Club, and so my guest and I are complimentary. You can belly up to the wine tasting bar or sit outside and order from the Beau Rivage menu, which features excellent Mediterranearn cuisine--perfect for your wine. If you want to visit the winery, itself, you'll have to join the Wine Club, which hosts events for members all the time and frequently at the winery. Everyone I take to Rosenthal is impressed--and I have wine snobs with internationall palates for friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAPlatinum
20,"Fun the first time, but not a place to go back to","If you've never been to the tasting room, it's fun to go as a novelty experience -- there are not really too many places to go wine tasting in Los Angeles, so it's a fun afternoon to drive up the coast and check this place out.The wine is just alright, not that great. I've never tasted anything there that I was impressed by, but that's just my taste buds.I have not enjoyed any of my several return visits there as much as I enjoyed the first time I tasted there. The first time my boyfriend and I did a tasting there about 10 months ago, we thought it would be cool to join their wine club and have a local place to go wine tasting on the weekend. But the tasting room can get positively packed on the weekends - we were there yesterday and it was jammed full - and other times we have been there, it seems like people use it almost as a bar ... obnoxious 'big spender' types drive over from the Valley and shoot the breeze with the staff for the afternoon, pausing occasionally for loud conversations on their cell phones. It's not a very professional tasting room sometimes.For the value and the tasting room atmosphere, I would say, check it out, bring out of town friends there! but for anything more than that, it's just not that great, and I think we'll quit the wine club before the next shipment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmeenne
30,Rosenthal Tasting Room--2nd best wine experience in Malibu,"We visited the Rosenthal Estate Winery Tasting Room on a Sunday in August. Be aware that the tasting room is NOT located at the beautiful estate pictured on the website--rather it's a small-ish building located on the Pacific Coast Highway. Traffic can be very heavy, so allow extra time to get there and look closely for the ""Wine Tasting"" sign out front or you'll drive right by it.The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We paid $15 for 8 tastings and the portions were generous. We enjoyed the wines and bought a few bottles to take with us, but the whole experience was over in about 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiFlyer
50,Great Way To Spend An Afternoon!!,"I took my husband to the Rosenthal Tasting Room on a Wednesday afternoon for his 40th birthday. We love wine tasting in Napa, and are planning trips to the Central Coast and Temecula. The Rosenthal Tasting Room was such a nice surprise! Most Angelenos don't know we have a wonderful winery right here in the city!Dave, our host for the afternoon, was a repository of extensive information about winemaking, the Rosenthal wines and winery, and the history of California wines in general. My husband I spent two hours picking his brain during our tasting, along with another couple who were driving by and saw the small ""wine tasting"" sign. Try to visit on a day when Dave is hosting!The wines were delicious! They were offering two tastings - four wines for $12 or ten wines for $15. Suffice to say the $15 tasting is quite the bargain. We joined the quarterly two-bottle wine club. We have not yet been, but on weekends the tasting room sets up a patio and conducts tastings outside. You can order brunch from the restaurant that shares the parking lot, and there is a wonderful view of the ocean accross the PCH. It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon, with or without out-of-town guests in tow! With the wine club membership, you and a guest taste for free.The grapes are grown near the Rosenthal Estate in the Malibu hills, which is generally not open to the public. The Estate does have tours and events throughout the year, and you can sign up for the mailing list and wine club at the tasting room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalagirl22
