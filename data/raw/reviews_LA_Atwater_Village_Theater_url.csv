50,HAND JOB,"The world premiere of Hand Job, a play by Erik Patterson and a cast headed by Steven Culp. This intimate theater was abuzz with this new play. Its intimacy brings the audience into the NY apartment, where the play is located. Strong performances by each of the small cast made that afternoon. The play posed many questions about the interaction of art and reality. Well done!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway776206
40,Wonderful Experimental Theater,"We went with friends to see a series of one-act plays in this tiny theater. The place has two rows of seats around three sides of a 20' x 30' (approx) rectangular stage which consists if a plain cement floor. Production is lean but professional; the actors, many just starting their careers, range from interesting to extremely talented; the plays were likewise varied in emotional and theatrical power, but all were interesting. In a small area outside the theater there's an al fresco coffee and drinks stand with some tables. It all made for a wonderful evening!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaseaton
