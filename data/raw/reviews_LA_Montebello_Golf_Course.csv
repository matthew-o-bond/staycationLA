50,Great golf course...,Montebello Country Club is a great place to play golf. We have been playing here for the past thirty years. The course is always going through positive transformations. The greens are in great shape. The staff is super cool. The cafe has great food....,Hector C
10,Poor conditions,I have played the course several times over the years. I have seen it in such poor shape. The course has deteriorated drastically. Today I was shocked to see the bunkers ruined as if a Jeep had taken a spin in it. Very disappointing for the price,Sab738
40,Home on the range,Monday Chinese New Years ! First time on the range ! 8 use for 120 balls not bad ! Range so so but balls are fine and no frills practice is fine by me !Lunch at the cafe bar not bad ! Nice surroundings ! Beef dip with fruit plate although not the best I've had but for 8 bucks seems a deal !Will go back try the course next time !Nice public golf !,Ciregnuk
50,A challenging course with a great view!,The course was in great shape. Good greens and tough fairways - but a stunningly beautiful course. The patio at the clubhouse after is a must.,ken_leach
40,"Well kept, well paced course!","On a beautiful Sunday morning, our foursome teed off at 9 am. During our less than 5 hour round, we waited a couple of times at the par 3s, but otherwise, moved nicely through the well-kept course. Greens were in good condition. Would definitely play there again.",ragsmad
30,Just ok,This golf course is in a great location about 8 miles from LA. That is the best part about it. It is not a great layout. It is not that challenging. It seems to allow too many golfers on the course on weekends so the wait time is horrendous. The cart service is not good. You can go nine holes and not see the dink cart. The condition of the course is average. Some greens seem to be kept excellent while others are in horrible shape. The fairways are average and not mowed that tight. i only play this course when I am trying to kill time. Dont go out of your way to play this one.,Gene2459
50,"Magnificently Unique, Stunningly Beautiful","I love this golf course!There that's my review.............ahhh but you want more, ok let's see what we can say about this course and why you should do whatever you can to play it.1. Designed by a famous golf course designer Stanley Thompson. (course was opened in 1931) who created a classic beauty a wonderfully picturesque design carved out of an area of natural beauty.2. Great club house, with dining and shower facilities, simply top notched with dining facilities and pro shop and staff.3. Excellent value for the money, green fee includes a cart which you definitely need for the up and down terrain.4. Each hole is different, and tree lined by mature trees. Because of the mature trees you cannot see any hole but the one you are playing. Montebello is not a long course but very challenging, small undulating greens add to the challenge.5. Course is not crowded, pace of play is good, 4 to 4 1/2 hours is normal.6. Course condition is excellent, well kept and well manicured.7. Montebello golf is just so very very picturesque and scenic and classic, it's like stepping back in time, a total joy. There are some stunning views from the tees, this course looks so good, you'll forget your score!8. Electric powered golf carts, clean and quiet.9. Great customer service by pro shop and staff out on the course, classy and friendly.10. It's in Quebec, so you feel like you are on adventure to a unique destination just when you drive here. Montebello is a beautiful course, in gorgeous surroundings and is just such a totally classic joy to play! In the fall, with the leaves changing it is even more beautiful!So far this year I've played here 6 times and each time it is a joy, I just get tired of it.If you are in the Ottawa area, it is definitely worth the 1 hour drive to get here. Excellent value for the money! Chances are you'll see me there when you go, so please hi, or fore? See you at the 19th hole!!",Bleuemoon2
