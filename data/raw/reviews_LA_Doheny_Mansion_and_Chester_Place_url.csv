20,Not Feeling this one.,"I’m going to have to agree with the negative reviews on this one. We weren’t required to cover our shoes nor discouraged in using cameras, however for the most part, the negative reviews were spot on. I was quickly disinterested by the rambling of the docent. I get these folks are volunteers, so maybe not experts... however, we are paying patrons; so therefore the “what do you expect for nothing” opinion is null. It’s historical, it’s a nice location, and it’s being used to educate others. Is this a bargain - Meh.... maybe for some. Would I do it ever again? Nope - nada - Nyet. Seriously, travel just a little further and visit the Nethercutt Museum. A M A Z I N G! Oh - it’s sans cost but your time and travel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreadpiratedb
10,Dohn't bother with this dump,"I love viewing old homes and learning the stories behind them and so when a friend from Palm Springs suggested that we do a bus tour from Palm Springs to the Downey Mansion I was ""all in.""Our group had to be split into two groups, and we had alerted the volunteer docents that we needed to board our bus by 3:00 pm in order to get a jump on LA's notorious rush hour.While both docents were dedicated volunteers and clearly loved the mansion, their presentations were disorganized, rambling and at times, tedious. Our docent constantly had to refer to oversized note cards and kept jumping around in his time-line of the family history.When our group finally got to go inside the mansion, we were told that the other group had gone over time and were still in the building. This delay was inexcusable since the docents knew that we were on a time crunch.The inside of the mansion does have some dramatic components, but again, the tour was marred by the disorganized presentation of the docent.My friend was also surprised that the tour only included the first floor of the mansion; the upper floors have been converted into offices for the nearby university.I would encourage the docents to try to develop two tour formats: an extended format for those who are not on a schedule and a ""highlights"" format to capture the essential points of the family's story and the house's features.This tour was a waste of time as far as my friend and I were concerned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351food4thought
50,"well worth the price of learning about one of Los Angeles’ most important early settlers, innovators, and investors.","The story of the Doheny family is a long and circuitous story, involving two generations and two major homes. This review will cover the Doheny Mansion and a second review will cover the second family home, called Greystone Manor.We took a tour of the Doheny Mansion on Chester Place in the historic West Adams district, late last year, which is where the father, Edward L. Doheny and his family lived for almost sixty years. Wealthy from his investments and production of crude oil in the US and Mexico, and the first to sink an oil well in Los Angeles, he became one of the richest men in the world. The house was one of the first Victorian mansions in the area, and now lies on the properties of the Mount Saint Mary’s University. It’s two-story chateau built in 1899, opulently displays a combination of Gothic, Moorish and Mission styles.A product of the gilded age, the house is well furnished with period furniture pieces, Tuscan marble, gilt carvings, and a huge Tiffany glass dome in the Pompeian sun room. The domed room is where the tour begins, and for a good half-hour a history of the family and the house are regaled as an excellent introduction. Then, the group moves throughout the house upstairs and down, and outside around the gardens and grounds. The docents reveal impressive tidbits about the artists who contributed to the furnishings and surprising stories about the family. I won’t go into the family history here, but you can read about them in the well-documented book, Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L. Doheny. Although one can receive a good introduction from the docents, I do recommend reading the book beforehand, so that one has a full understanding of the family history, allowing the house to be the ornament that crowns the family’s beginnings.Public tours are available every other month on only one day of that month, led by knowledgeable volunteer docents. There are two types of tours, one lasting 1½-hours, and a more complete tour that lasts 2½-hours, which we took. Tours begin at 10:00 am and the second tour starts forty-five minutes later. Private tours can also be arranged. You must make reservations ahead of time and there are discounts for seniors, groups, and Saint Mary’s University students. No children under twelve are allowed, nor is photography, but the home can be rented for special private events. The Doheny Mansion has been used for musical concerts, film and television productions, commercials and photography shoots. All proceeds go to the conservation of the home in renovating the structure, restoring paintings, rugs, and lighting. The price of $20 per person is well worth the price of learning about one of Los Angeles’ most important early settlers, innovators, and investors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lutea

20,Not That Great,"I was really looking forward to this. I was pretty disappointed. When we got there, we were herded into another house and had to sit and listen to an awful tour guide who spent a half an hour giving us the whole history of the family down to grandchildren. Then we went outside and stood around some more, got led into a big empty space with a pool and walls that looked like a concentration camp and got shown pictures of when it was a big beautiful green house, (why not restore it to its former glory so people really have something to see?), an hour and 10 minutes after we started we finally got to the steps of the mansion. Everyone has to put on booties, but not the tour guides. ? There is the main room, another main room, 4 small rooms and a dining room. Not much to see. They kept saying they don't USUALLY let people in some of these rooms, if that's the case you don't get to walk into any rooms except the two main rooms and the dining room. NO UPSTAIRS VIEWING AT ALL! Plus they were very militant about no picture taking. Why not? Had they at least let us do that we might have felt like we got our money's worth. Unless you're REALLY into the history of this place don't bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308gwenl
