50,Love the summer reading program,"The La Habra Library is a very small town feel with helpful and friendly librarians. During the summer, it's extra special with their MANY reading programs from small children, to grade school, to teens, to adults. It's a great place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stntplr
40,Found a charming library in La Habra! Was Willy Wonka hiding here? Or just a Dahl?,"Willy Wonka lives here?Did you know the city La Habra has a charming historic brick library. Come here to pick up a children's book for .10, pick up or return books, read a recent newspaper or study after class or go online, it's up to you. Designed by architecture firm of Anthony & Langford in 1982 (original library given graciously by John & Anna Launer) used 1898 to 1962.Shelves are warm wood and organically inviting. Notice cute little corners filled with books, art and even a section dedicated to author Ronald Dahl---wrote Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory. Children's section is light and bright.Jill Patterson (at the desk) was helpful. Local Art is for sale on the wall and it's a bargain---Van Gogh in training--- lighting on canvas was excellent. Do visit and check out the La Habra Historical Society.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170indiac
