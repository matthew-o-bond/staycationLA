30,“Vietnam”,"The motorcycle capital of the world. :)Traffic light rules:Green - I can GOYellow - I can GORed - I can still GOI'm not a coffee lover but I love their coffee. Sooo heavenly! :)The famous place Saigon Square! Whoa! A lot of cheap branded clothing, bags, etc. Oh I love! :D"
40,“City visit”,Beautiful city with a lot of trees and lakes and the city centre well organised in the french style.
40,“Street food in Hanoi”,Street food in Hanoi is very good and globally no problem with hygiene. Food is fresh as well as the meat and other stuff. Advantage of doing daily marketing and not unecessary stockage in fridges as in european countries. People are more than freindly if we take the time to try to understand them.
30,“Mr”,"Hanoi, bustling, but vibrant city with chaotic roads, motor bikes and scooters, was lunar new year so all the streets and markets where thriving, great city to be in this time of the year, hard rock cafe, rocking bands, well worth a visit, walked around alone at late night, safe and no incidents, just hot hot hot.. Clothing dit cheap so arrive naked.."
50,“The best experience in Vietnam!”,"This was simply the best thing I did in Vietnam. Picked up from our hostel we soon went to our tour guides (amazing) house. We then biked to the market and bought all our food in Vietnamese! We then cooked some amazing dishes that was some of the best food I've ever eaten. Our guides were such good fun, so many laughs, and an amazing experience. Do not miss this!!"
10,“Ethnic travel Hanoi - totally not off the beaten track”,"We used a company called ethnic travel in Hanoi, Hang Giay to book a 3D 2 N tour of Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long island. We decided to go with this company as we'd heard of stories of unscrupulous agencies, offering hiked up prices, but this one had such a good write up in the lonely planet,, we especially liked the idea of low impact on the environment, off the beaten track, away from other boats etc - as the lady assured us "" we use our own boats, so you will not be with all the other 100s of boats all going to the same place."" it cost a little more but we were willing to pay for an environmentally friendly, more tailor made experience. How wrong we were. The company overbooked and had to hire another boat company called the Helios. Once on the boat it was a horrible experience, we were caught right in the middle of the mass of boats all heading the same way. The crew were very unfriendly, and at least half of us came off the boat with really bad stomach cramps and a running stomach. Worst of all was when we saw the crew tipping oil and petrol waste directly into the bay. I was disgusted. The homestay was not so much a homestay, more of an incredibly hot, unpleasant experience in some rooms. Zero contact with the family, and the guide did not provide any information. All in all we spent almost all of the time on the road, or moving from one point to another, there was a few minutes for swimming. We had to ask so many questions, just to try and find out a little about the local environment, Halong bay, family customs etc. We did raise these issues with Ethnic Travel, who simply appologised."
50,“Charming Hanoi”,"It was my 6th visit to Hanoi and it's still as charming as ever. The city is so cool, the local people are very friendly and helpful. Hanoi which is 1000 years old is fasinating. The streets are small and very personal, city has it's unique character which I found most pleasant. Shops and restaurants stay open till late unlike other cities in Vietnam. The lake areas seems to be the centre of attrtaction to one and all. A tour of the city on board one of the green cars( found at West lake area was good.Got to see rows and rows of streets with different trades and places of interests.At he lake itself , folks were trying hard to get a glimpse of the legendary turtles in the lake. The Bia Hanoi (beer from hanoi) was the match winner, I have always been having many pints of that without fail every time I visit there. Many big hotels with International brands operate at Hanoi and some of them have gaming clubs which are open only to foreign passport holders. I visited one but was not lucky enough to win that time.Next time for I will. Great city.. charming Hanoi."
50,“West Lake Tay Ho Hanoi - great neighborhood in Hanoi”,"Hanoi Neighborhood Xuan Dieu and To Ngoc Van has blossomed in the last 12 years i have been here into a great area to live and visit where the quality of life is wonderful. Fresh air, lake views and breezes, fun to walk around, bike, shop, eat, dine, live music in the evenings, shisha, Cuban Cigars, coffee, tea, beers, wines, Ice Cream, flowers, bakeries, gourmet shops, art, clothes, furnature, medical and dental clinics, spas and massage, temples, 5 star hotels and boutique hotels, jewlery, dozens of restaurants from Japanese to Beer houses, guest houses, Organic vegetables, Vegetarian restaurants, if ever need any advise or tips email me at donchef@ymail.com"
20,“Hanoi annoys”,"We went to Saigon 4 years ago and expected Hanoi to be much of the same: maybe less Americanised, maybe more French colonial, probably more Vietnamese. No. It was like night and day.The first thing that hits you is not being able to walk on the pavement because of the 2 million motorbikes and scooters that are parked. In the gaps in between, some families appear to have located their dining room as occasionally you have to sidestep about 6 or 7 adults eating while sitting on a small footstool a 5 year old would struggle to sit on. Because there is no pavement to walk on you meander on the road, carefully avoiding the other 2 million motorbikes and scooters that are riding past.The next big culture shock is tryiong to cross the road. Traffic lights are merely coloured lights flashing on posts. They don't mean a thing. Zebra crossings are just paint in the road - nothing more. If we waited for the traffic to subside we'd still be there now. Like all the guidebooks say, you have to take your life in your hands and walk into the road at a steady pace and the bikes will all ride around you. We got really into it and it was terrific fun in the end.The Green Tangerine restaurant was our favourite - an old French colonial house with a courtyard and was very atmospheric. Opposite is the Spot Bar which is a great place to chillout.There were a couple of bars over the other side of the lake called the Polite Pub and the Lp Bar which both stayed open late-ish by Hanoi standards.Food and drink were both very cheap by UK standards - Tiger beer ranged from 80p - £ 1.05 (local brews were even cheaper) and a G&T was £ 1.25 - £ 1.90.The guidebooks aren't wrong about the rip-off taxi drivers. We only used taxis for one journey and gave it up as a bad job. We went to Ho Chi Minh's Mauseleum and were charged 40,000VND (£ 1.30). That was fine. We walked to the One Pillar Pagoda (which wasn't as spectacular as it sounds) and the very underwhelming Temple of Literature and got a cab back from there to St Josephs Cathedral (not a patch on Notre Dame in Saigon). The theiving git wanted 700,000VND (£ 21) and pointed to his dodgy meter which must have clicked on every wheelturn. After a very long argument we settled on 200,000VND (£6.00) which was still a rip-off and left a bad taste in the mouth. In Saigon we were based in the Novotel which is located on the edge of town and used taxis twice a day for a week with no problems whatsoever. The funny thing was, a local complete with conical hat and baskets on a pole kept bouncing in for her twopennyworth and I thought she was giving the taxi driver some stick. Nah! She was trying to sell us a hat while we were in the middle of an argument!All in all, a good holiday, but I have to say that I much preferred Saigon."
50,“Tan My Design”,"An awesome boutique in The Old Quarter.This boutique is modern and homes a great restaurant, cafe as well as designer goods, silk items and jewellery, shoes, bags.I paid 2 visits here and each time, found some more items I couldn't live without.Loved their stylish but unique hand bags made out of rice sacks.Not cheap but a great memory of Vietnam!Bought teeshirts, silk wall-hangings as well.Loved the concept incuding the copper ants climbing the centre pole.Would certainly go back and definitely worth a visit."
50,“Hanoi Kids - a great service”,"We visited Vietnam in April and finished our stay in Hanoi. Our guide from Hanoi Kids was Dzung, a 21 year old university student. She had very good english language and a sense of humour that made our day enjoyable.She met us at our hotel as arranged. She was slightly late, but this message was conveyed to us. We needed to change our prearranged plans as we found we had already visited some of the planned places and one of us had an injury that meant we couldn't stand for long periods of time. Dzung was understanding of this. She organised all the taxis necessary on her mobile very efficiently to get us about.We visited Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, where it was interesting to get the perspective of a guide. Dzung was very informative and knowledgeable about this place. We then had a most enjoyable and leisurely lunch at Quan An Ngon, 18 Phan Boi Chau. We invited Dzung to order for us and after carefully ascertaining what Vietnamese food we had already tried, she placed our orders. We really enjoyed the food, and the restaurant was packed and buzzing, which made interesting viewing. We tried many different dishes that we would not have thought to try on our own.Later on, we went to a wholesale market where Dzung helped translate and negotiate prices for a few items that I wanted to buy. We finished with a ride on an electric car around for 15,000 dong (I think) each around the old quarter. This was great fun as it made it easy to see many streets of the market without the hassle of avoiding traffic while on foot.Dzung accompanied us back to our hotel and we parted after giving her some gifts we had brought from NZ. She was a great ambassador for her country and we enjoyed the day. All our communications with Hanoi Kids were very polite, friendly and helpful. It was a pleasure to deal with them."
40,“Forget the Highway Code!”,"Could not believe the amount of motor bikes, bikes and general meyhem on the roads. Don't try running across the road as you are better walking really slowly and let the bikes go round you as they come from all directions - literally. The puppet show is worth a watch but try and get to the front. A Cyclo tour is a great way to see the old town. The Presidential Palace , temple of literature are worth a visit. Keep safe."
40,“Hanoi the bustle city”,Hanoi is an interesting city with so many things to do. Locals were very friendly and accomodating. Had the best sushi in Hanoi. The traffic was crazy but locals seem to know just how to avoid hitting you while crossing the street.Hoi An is a beautiful beach town and is known for their tailoring abilities. I found while travelling on a rental bike dauting when approached by the locals to advertise their businesses.
10,“Very disappointed by North and Central Vietnam”,"Just came back from 3 weeks in North and Central Vietnam. We were very disappointed by the country in general. We probably had many cliches from movies and documentaries about Vietnam. However the reality was very different.Disappointments:People: Even though we met a few nice people, our general impression was that foreigners were not welcome. They welcomed our money and tried to get as much as possible out of us. We got scammed in hotels, restaurants, taxis, spas, for shoe fixing, for laundry, for drinks and even in supermarkets!In hotels the staff were usually overzealous, trying to sell you anything they could.Hanoi: Very noisy and tiring city. In the old quarters it is hard to walk, breath and sometimes to speak because of the motorbikes (on the road and on the sidewalk). It's also hard to find hotels that are quiet and do not scam foreigners.We had to be on our toes for pick pockets and scams all the time. We got attacked in a bar by the owner and someone attempted to pick pocket my friend. When my friend reacted, he was pushed to the ground and broke his foot.Vietnamese food:Once you have eaten the Pho (rice noodles), fried squid, lemon chicken/fish, spring rolls and soups... There isn't much left. Most of the time cheap meant also bad...Perfume Pagoda:40 minutes of climb among the shops... I never saw the mountain... The river ride is beautiful, but a little long...Hue: the citadel is beautiful but falling apart and poorly protected! The tombs were very nice, but the roads terrible to get there. When it rains, Hue is depressing. The DMZ has almost nothing to offer in view of sights... except for the tunnels.Transportation:For a country which has benefited from mass tourism for the past 20 years or so, and even though there is much corruption, nothing has been done to improve the road. Their main are all tiny and therefore useless as crowded with bikes...Garbage everywhere, pollution and dirty/dead lakes...Good:Western food: great western food! It's not cheap, but there are numerous good western food (French, Italian) restaurants.- In Hanoi check out: Le Salsa, Mediterraneo and Al Fresco (all nearby the cathedral). Hoa Sua training school restaurant, is excellent for food. Wild lotus, high class Vietnamese is great.- In Hue: La Carambole (excellent french food).Little Italy. Why not restaurant.The Cafe culture is very present and pleasant.Mai Chau valley: We were meant to go to Sapa, but as the weather was not good there and we saw that the roads we had seen were terrible, we decided to go to Mai Chau. This was the highlight of our trip with regards to people. The Thai minority there is very welcoming, genuinely friendly. We stayed in a stilt house and had great walks with one of the locals.Hoi An: Beautiful and exquisite, even though extremely touristy.Halong Bay: beautiful and unique! However a terrible road to get there..."
50,“Fantastic tour guide”,"The people was all fantastic. Our Guide, Anna was full of personalizing, very informative & ensured we had a great time. Her English was fantastic. The food was delicious!"
50,“Local guides for local experiences”,Visiting Vietnam for the first time and with teenagers was the most rewarding experience thanks to our guides. Travel Indochina employs knowledgeable and passionate local guides who tailor the experience to your needs. The city is stunning and exotic and the food is fabulous. Our guide recommended places to eat and even helped us to book our restaurants for evening meals before the end of our day tour. I highly recommend Travel Indochina if you want to see the real Vietnam (we travelled to Hoi An and Halong Bay also) and have opportunities to enjoy local experiences without all of the tourist hype.
20,"“Busy capital, good local eats and gorgeous river”","The capital of Viet Nam is not exactly it's best advert for tourism despite their being the gateway to both Sapa and Halong Bay. We visited in December 2010 for 4 days experiencing their first ever official new year's eve celebrations. Best things to do: eat with the locals on street corners, squatting on stalls whilst drinking their local home brew 3000 dong 'beer'. Go shopping, if that's your thing, at the night markets or Doun Xuan market (sp?). Stand in line for your chance to view the corpse of Ho Chi Minh, doors open 8am, close 11am - only open certain days of the week. Experience the Hoam Kiem river at night - take a walk and watch all the young lovers enjoying time together.But if you want my honest answer - you can do the above in one pre planned day then get out and take a trip to Halong Bay - be sure to do the two night adventure - that way you can get away from the masses of boats and tourists - or visit the steeped rice hills of Sapa in northern Viet Nam.I have tried to write a fair review based on an open mind.Whatever happens you will love Vietnamese people for their friendliness and their good local food."
10,“Could not leave fast enough...”,"This city is so NOISY, crowded, polluted, dirty, rundown, and unattractive. I spent three days there with 3 preteens and hubby. I'm glad we got out alive considering you risk your life if you cross a street. We live in Taipei, Taiwan right now and this Asian city is so much cleaner. I don't understand why anyone would go to Hanoi. There is nothing there worth purchasing. I'd rather skip any silk purchases than ever go back. We only went to visit HaLong Bay and I am not sure it was worth it since we had to spend time in Hanoi. No tourist sites were worth visiting either. The Mausoleum was closed both times we tried to get in and the Army Museum closes between 11:30 and 1:00 or something crazy. Hoan Kiem Lake is just swarming with people."
50,“Hanoi A Nice City and a Nice Place to come”,"Hanoi is nice place to visit. If we are looking a quite and nice city with some part of old town and the heritage from the past and still keep the main of history with slowly grow up.Hanoi is a small city but very attractive with people and the natureof Culture Original native peole.With many Boutique hotels and many nice Places t visit such as : HHo CHi Minh Complex . Temples , Lakes and so many small parks interral city.Shopping center and eating area is Old Town People often call Old Quarter."
20,"“The place certainly had character, but I couldn't hack it”","I heard so many reviews of Hanoi about it's culture, how much fun it is for tourists, it's good food. And yet, I did not see any of this and I'm starting to think I went to another place entirely.It did not help that our hostel was nestled at the back of the Old Quarter, where it seems all Hanoi-an meat sellers decide to sell their produce, in 40 degrees of heat. The smell was putrid with people spitting, and sitting with their meat unrefridgerated and cut in such a savage way that you cant quite tell whats laid out.The restaurants all were not so clean and nice a fellow travellers told us that at all costs we should NOT EAT STREET FOOD. the food tastes good, but food poisoning is a sure thing.We were hastled by tuktuks at such a rate that I lost it by the second day. and the pavements were used as extra storage for shops, meanwhile pedestrians were trying to wiggle themselves through parked motorbikes whilst moving motorbikes come at them.The Old Quarter certainly had character but 'charming' would not be the word to describe it. I found myself attempting to escape the havoc and finding any western place to sit to get away from the noise. the traffic was so crazy that I felt the need to hide back in my apartment.The stench soaked through my clothing so I smelled like a wet dog/ 5 day old pork steak. everyones idea of fashion was there matching pijamas with high heels underneath. and the so called 'green city' was anything but green. The greenest thing I saw was the mouldy green Lake at the center.The pagoda on the lake was quite pretty but after such tiredsome day all i wanted to do is retreat.Now many backpackers who saw the north of hanoi lake or who stayed at hanoi backpackers had a completely different vibe from the city. so perhaps we went about it all wrong.But in my opinion Hanoi is not for the faint hearted. If you like to see busy city life like youve never seen before. I recomment it"
20,“Golf in Hanoi”,"I would think twice before booking a golfing trip out of Hanoi.I have just played at King's Island, Chi Linh Star, Phoenix and Tam Dao. They are each a minimum 1.5 hour trip in the most nerve wracking traffic. That in itself is sufficient reason and I was on a ""luxury trip"" in a 4 seater modern car let alone a bus or van.Other members of my golf club had warned me about the travelling before I came but after I had booked.The courses are well groomed and resort-like but do not compare with Hawai, Queenstown (New Zealand), Bintan (Indonesia) , Palm Springs, Fancourt and Sun City (South Africa) etc.My caddie at Tam Dao spoke not a word of English and my two caddies at Chi Linh spent most of the time texting on their mobile phones paying little attention to the golfer.You will be ill at ease at these courses if you do not speak Vietnamese.If Asia is your preference, golfing in Thailand , Hainan and Mission Hills are much better options."
20,“Postal service in hanoi vienam”,"Please be aware that when sending parcels internationally out of Hanoi, that your gifts or belonings may be stolen out of boxes, out of 5 boxes sent to Australia, 3 were opened and goods stolen, they unwrapped them and even put the wrapping back in boxes after takening goods.VickiAustralia"
20,“Experience in Hanoi”,"We have just returned from a trip in Hanoi. The city is vibrant and interesting. Especially the streets around the Old Quarters. Everywhere is motorbikes and the continuous horning of vehicles on the roads. As this was our first visit, it was a challenge for us crossing the roads. The trick is to cross the roads in a steady pace. DO NOT dash across. We also went to places like Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (thinking it was the musuem because we have told the taxi driver to bring us to the Museum but he brought us to the mausoleum instead). We took the taxi from our hotel in Chan Cam Str. The taxi ride was about VND17K. But it was closed. We asked around and get to the nearby One Pillar Pagoda and HCM Museum. The museum was closed from 11.30pm to 2.00pm that day (it's open from 8.30am to 11.30am and 2.00pm to 4.00pm). Generally, we find people in Vietnam friendly as they (esp. those tricycle men) would come close to you and asked whether you need help if they see you reading a map. The next thing they asked you is to take a ride from them. But be very careful and clear when you bargain for those tricycle ride along the roads. We took one from HCM Musuem to the Temple of Literature. Two-way ride and it cost us USD6 + VND50K ie. more than double of what has been agreed (USD3) before we took his tricycle.We took a taxi from the HCM Museum back to our hotel. Thinking it shouldn't be more than VND30K, but the meter actually read ""501.0"" and the taxi driver demanded us to pay him VND500K. We were then locked in his car. Left with no choice, we forked out our last VND65K (as that was our last day in Hanoi) to pay him and told him that that's all the money we have. He took the money but still refused to let us go and he claimed that he is a ""taxi mafia"". Finally, we told him we would call our hotel for help and started fishing out our phone, at this time he released his door lock and shouted ""GET OUT"" at us. These are just some unpleasant episodes in Hanoi. Overall, we have enjoyed our stay in Halong Bay cruise and Sapa village."
40,"“Buzzy, colourful and thoroughly enchanting”","I could praise Hanoi just for the food alone. whether basic stall or upmarket restaurant, all dishes are mouthwatering and delicious!But Hanoi stimulates all the senses! Crazy traffic, colourful lanterns,exotic smells, shabby chic architecture, enchanting temples comfortably juxtaposed ancient and modern culture, fabulous shopping from street markets to designer shops and, most importantly, hospitable people! We were there for far too short a time but we enjoyed every minute!"
50,“Da Nang Beach”,"Everyone visits Vietnam has to go to Da Nang Beach. A lot of five-star hotels are building. The services are really good. The beach is wonderful by its nature. It's one of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam. The weather is great, too. Even in winter, it's still warm and a little bit hot. You can go to beach around the year. It's a perfect place to have a vacation with family or friends even in Christmas holiday."
50,“My favorite place in Hanoi”,"There are tons of great places to eat in Hanoi, ranging in price from less than a $1 (street stalls and pho) to over $20 (The Press Club) for a meal. For those not wanting to cook (me), eating in Hanoi can be easy and cheap. Below are some of the places I like. By the way, Vietnamese for 'dog meat' is 'thit cho', so you know what to avoid.Budget*Pho Ga (32 Le Van Huu)- Famous for very good Hanoi pho (chicken noodle soup), a bowl costs $0.73 and is a filling breakfast or lunch. There are air conditioned rooms upstairs.*The Kangaroo Café (18 Bao Khanh)- a backpacker café run by an expat Australian with big burgers and good chicken snitzel for about $2.*Café Moca (16 Nha Tho)- good western and Indian food for about $3-$6. Delivery available.*Café Julien- an internet café with good food and ice cream. The steak sandwich ($2) and the Thai green chicken curry are both very good ($2).*Tandoor (24 Hang Be)- very good Indian food. The Sunday lunch buffet is a great for about $5; set lunch during the week is about $3.50. Delivery available.*Little Hanoi (21 Hang Gai)- good breakfasts (excellent French toast) and sandwiches ($2).*The Hilton Hanoi Opera (1 Le Thanh Tong) has a good bakery with 50% off on items after 6pm.Moderate*The Garden (36 Hang Manh)- a nice restaurant with a courtyard in the ancient quarter. The chili chicken is very good for about $4.*Brothers Café (26 Nguyen Thai Hoc)- beautiful restaurant with courtyard in what used to be a temple. A good buffet lunch is $7.*Church Street Bar and Grill (Nha Tho)- a nice restaurant that has little balcony on the 2nd floor. If the weather is nice it's a great place to sit and watch the street scene below. The food is very good, but pricey for the area. The set lunches with a choice of appetizer and entrée is about $7 (the squid salad followed with sea bass is excellent).Expensive*The Emperor (18b Le Thanh Tong)- very beautiful restaurant set in old French villa with great atmosphere and great Vietnamese food. My favorite place to take visitors to Hanoi for a fancy dinner.*Le Tonklin (14 Ngo Van So)- also good Vietnamese food set in a French villa.*Hoa Sua (81 Tho Nhuom)- have a good French meal and feel good about yourself-- this place takes street kids with few opportunities and trains them in English, French, and restaurant careers. For dessert, the profiteroles (pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with chocolate sauce) are excellent.*Nam Phuong (19 Phan Chu Trinh)- good Vietnamese food with live traditional music in the evenings."
50,“Everything that Canberra's not”,"hanoi put the zap on me from the moment we stepped into our first cyclo ride around koem lake. It is red hot in august and we loved it cos the city was everything that Canberra's not - beguiling, frenetic but relaxed, stylish and cheap. i pictured john mccain crashing into west lake as i sat in my sheraton hotel room...what an amazing history but no-one really seems to care these days, the vietnamese are too busy moving on and living their lives. the food was incredible - esp at KOTO and House of Son Tinh. Our small children loved the water puppets we have already started saving for next year's visit."
10,“A bit of slap and trouble for my booking”,"Just a warning to prospective tourists in Hanoi. My family and I recently travelled there and booked a tour to Halong Bay through The Real Sinh Cafe. Not only did they not turn up to pick us up on time for the time - meaning we missed our boat - they also refused to refund our money. When we complained, I was struck in the face by the manager. I am a petite woman. While we were there other travellers came in claiming they had been threatened with broken bottles and having their passports stolen on their Halong Bay cruise booked by this man. My assault was reported to police and he was charged. This man is both dodgy and dangerous."
40,“Crazy Chaotic Hanoi”,"It's actually difficult to rate this city -- Honestly speaking, it's the worst place I've been to since most of the locals are unfriendly (unless they want money from you), the traffic is absolutely out of this world and well -- getting lost or ripped off can be a daily occurrence... You can also get harassed or assaulted by a xeom driver who'd like to get more money from you ---But, it is also in Hanoi wherein you can find a tight-knit expat circle, friendly fellow travellers and some nice Vietnamese people who would have a nice chat with you... It is also in Hanoi wherein you could find a huge number of experiences that you can talk about and laugh about in the future. If you're an adventurer and looking for experiences and tales that you can share with your friends in the future, then head to Hanoi for a visit...For more information about Hanoi, check out this hub -- http://hubpages.com/hub/hanoitouristspotsYou can also find pictures of Hanoi here --http://emancipation.flixya.com"
10,“Don't bother with Face Club in Hanoi.”,"All great until a friend from ho chi minh city, her boyfriend and my wife and I decided to go to the FACE CLUB - 6 p hang bai formerly known as THE LOOP, to do some dancing after reading that is was a good place to go for dancing.When we arrived we found that beers were 125000 dong each. To be sociable we bought our drinks and then went to dance and were confronted by staff who grabbed my arm and led me from the dancefloor with others leading me away. We then decided to leave and when going our separate ways by taxi, unfriendly bouncers then stood out on the road beside us to intimidate us. My advice is don't go to the face club- if you are a foreigner, you aren't welcome---Neal.--Australia"
40,“Old Vietnam”,"Hanoi is a much nicer than Saigon in many ways. It has many the own houses and streets. The streets are still named based on the products that were sold in the good old days such ""sugar street"" ect..When in Hanoi, check out the concerts at the Hanoi Opera house. It is worth it. Take a cyclo to the thearter. This takes you back to the 60's...very romantic. Don't miss a long early morning walk around the lake. It is highly recommend to spend a few days just to explore the city visiting the Literature temple for example or visit Uncle Ho's house."
50,“A peaceful place!”,"I spent a day visiting Son Tay ancient citadel in Son Tay town. Although it has been repaired recently, I still felt old structure of the citadel here. There are a lot of ancient trees and flourish flowers along the path and it is so large for me to walk along the moat. The thing I like best is the main gates made of bee-stone, a special material from Xu Doai. The gate is covered by the root of huge hundred-year-old trees as a result of a long time. Also, there a pagoda which has been constructed stands out among the greenery. One more thing that make me impressive is a couple of cannons at one of the main gates. I could touch the cannons and saw some Chinese characters on them. Seeing the high blue sky and the ancient trees, I felt Son Tay ancient citadel is peaceful and quiet, features the countryside in the center of the hustle and bustle urban area."
20,“Use a little extra. Not a romatic city!!!!”,"When booking hotels in Vietnam, use a little extra to get a 4* or 5* hotel. We would rather stay in a double room in a 4-5* star hotel, than in a suite deluxe in a 3* hotel."

You were recommended by a member of booking.com's reservations department and I'm glad I followed their advice because you handled this very promptly and efficiently.

40,“my favorite place in Asia”,"We went to Vietnam about one week ago. I brought with me 2 children and my wife. It was the first time we traveled to a country in South East Asia. Vietnam just came into our mind for our trip only a few days after we set off. The image of Vietnam was quite different from what we often thought of it before. Vietnamese people are quite friendly; however, their English was not so good as we expected. As a result, we had many difficulties at the beginning. Right after coming to the airport ( Noibai international Airport), we moved to Melia hotel ( It is located in Ly Thuong Kiet street in Hanoi). We stayed there for nearly one day and wondered how to travel in Hanoi. Luckily, the receptionist of the hotel gave us the brochure of a volunteer organization which was founded by volunteer students. They provide free tour guides for international visitors. We logged on their website: Hanoifreetourguides.com and immediately contacted and ask for help. Most of its members are students who are very young and friendly. They were supported by Hanoifreetourguides for 5 days in Hanoi without having to pay and fees for guiding. Thanks to Hanoifreetourguides which give us unforgettable experience in Vietnam.

40,“Great handicraft store”,In Hanoi there are non-profit handicraft stores called Craftlink. There are a few. One is near the Literature Museum and another outside the Enthnology Museum. They have nice ethnic scarves and other handicrafts of better quality than most other stores that we saw.
40,“Visiting Historic Hanoi and Avoiding Tourist Traps”,"Hanoi is one picture-perfect city especially for photographers. The ""Old Quarter"" as they call Hanoi is rich in old architectural and historical landscapes which are still used up to this time. You will find wonderful photographic interests by simply standing along the street: Old buildings, street vendors wearing nonla and traditional dresses, magnitude of motorbikes, cyklos, beautiful lake parks and temples almost everywhere.But be aware of some tourist traps:1. In Noi Bai Airport, the information counter can be a tourist trap. Upon exiting the baggage bay area, I approached the information counter to ask for a city map. It was manned by a man wearing decent clothes and tie. He didn't give me the map at once. Instead of me asking an information personnel, I found myself to be the one being asked as if I was being checked by an immigration officer. It was a domestic airport and I flew from Ho Chi Minh and I was at the airport lobby. Writing everything down on a notepad, he asked about the purpose of my visit, the length of stay in Hanoi, my hotel reservation, etc. Finally, I realized that he was not an airport personnel but a tour agent who have access to the lenient airport lobby. The worse, an unmanned information counter. He asked me if I would to try the Ha Long Bay cruise or the guided city tour. In my disgust, I turned away and I wasn't able to have the map which was still in his hand.2. There are lots of taxi drivers in the airport who will just lift your baggages and immediately put them into their cab trunks so you won't have a chance to ask for the rate. Stop them and make sure nothing leaves your pushcart. Look for the taxi bay counters and transact only with them. It's should only be $15 to Hanoi proper.3. Deceitful taxi drivers. You can never know which taxis are fair and which are not. When you realize it, it's already too late. A distance of a 5-minute walk may take you just the same amount of time or more riding a cab. Driver will attempt to take the longest route possible. Or if not, the taxi meters spin like slot machine. If you are planning to ride a cab, ask the hotel to arrange it for you. Have a handy map and study it. Hanoi is a great city to explore by foot.4. In taking pictures of people, especially the street vendors, do it discreetly and fast. Don't let them pose for you unless you're wiling to pay them some dong. Sometimes they will ask for more than what you would have given.5. In buying souvenirs, make sure you haggle for the price you think is fair. For foreign tourists, normally they mark up the price up to 100% or more.6. Don't ask if you're not really into buying. Moreso, be aware of their belief that if you're the first customer, they must sell to you or else it brings poor sale for the day. Planning what to buy avoids hassle.7. People with motorcycles and cyklos will approach and offer you city tours. If you're not interested, a simple hand gesture is understood. Sometimes, uttering a word might only worsen the scenario for they may follow you and insist on hiring them. But if you're into it, make sure you agree on the rental fee and you clearly understand the terms first. It's better to ask the hotel about the running rate before negotiating.8. The standard rate of a taxi to the airport (Hanoi Proper-Noi Bai Airport or Noi Bai-Hanoi Proper) is $15, nothing more. Ask the hotel to arrange the transfer for you. When you arrive to the destination, some drivers may ask you to pay for what is on the meter reading. Chances are, you would be paying much more than $15 in dong. Disregard the ridiculous meter reading. Let them know that you know the rate. Hand him the $15, no questions asked. Pay them in dollars. Don't pay in dong to avoid complication.9. If you're travelling alone, don't put your stuff in the trunk as much as possible. So you could just walk out of the cab after handing the fare to the driver.There are lots of uniformed tourist police roaming around the city especially in the tourism spots. So it's very safe to explore the city. Touring in Hanoi is such a bitter-sweet experience. But it's all worth it!"
50,“Nice picture in the small city”,"It was a stunning time with us.Everything was so different than we thought about this country.All of what we hearing is just about the war.The city is crowded and busy and modern,lovely weather and nice,friendly people.We have been some of most attractive place.It was a great time to spend a good time and good price over here.Love this country love the people,Halong bay is one of the best place for us."
30,“Hanoi”,"A nice city but not much to do. Good restaurants are hard to come by. We saw the few sights that there are to see (Ho Chi Minh Mauseleum, Hanoi Prison, etc) but you can do al these in a single day. Took a cooking class which was fun. But... the best thing was our trip to Halong Bay. A big drive (3 and a half to 4 hours) but well worth it. Do either one or two nights but don't bother with a day trip. But be warned, the drive is a nightmare!"
40,“Thoughts on Hanoi”,"May 24, 2010. I'm a 73-year old lady who traveled alone for a month in Vietnam. I stayed 8 days at Atlantic Hotel in Hanoi's Old Quarter. The hotel's location was quite a walk to restaurants and major points of attraction, so for me, whose favorite mode of transportation is my two feet, the location was not good. Others take taxis, so distance is not a problem. I recommend getting a hotel closer to Hoan Kiem Lake if you enjoy walking.Hanoi is lovely, ugly, peaceful, chaotic, and very alive! As in most of Vietnam, sidewalks are not for pedestrians. They are for living, in all it's glory and gore! For parking motorbikes, for butchering dogs, for eating, picking lice from a friend's head, giving haircuts, letting chickens run, playing checkers, socializing. I never could get used to walking in the streets with motorbikes, cars, vans, pedalcarts, etc. all whizzing by me.If you've arrived in Hanoi from the south, you will find that tours are more expensive in Hanoi. For example, city tour averaged around $25 and miss many of the great sites. Same tour in Saigon is $5 and more comprehensive.Food was not as good in Hanoi as in Vietnam's more southern cities. I'm a vegetarian and choices were more limited, although there are several vegetarian restaurants in the old quarter and the offerings were quite good.The best part of the old quarter were the tiny alleyways tucked into the streets. Also the communal houses located on nearly every street with its temples and gardens. Duck through the archway, and you are in a cool, serene world. I recommend travelers to really walk those streets and get to know them and really experience daily life in Hanoi.The history museum within walking distance was excellent. Beautiful displays, English explanations. Ethnic museum was interesting, but the explanations were too limited and repetitious for every tribe. It's quite a way out of main city area, so you will definitely need a taxi to get there. Walking around Hoan Kiem Lake was such a pleasure. Cool breezes, beautiful landscape.It was over 100 F on a few days and very humid. Next time I go to Vietnam, it will be winter months! But electricity stayed on all the time, which was not the case in cities in Central Vietnam.Even though I spent 8 days in Hanoi, there is still so much that I didn't get to see....so I have an excuse to go back a second time!"
40,“A city in flux”,"Hanoi, the capital and so too the seemingly unavoidable transit point for most trips further afield. Not forgetting that it has proven itself time and again a reliable spot for all a break from all things typically Vietnamese, i.e. there actually exists a resemblance of nightlife and, well seeing pizza and spaghetti on a menu is like finding a dearly loved and long lost friend (expensive as it might be). Actually, forget seeing pizza and spaghetti on a menu - seeing a menu is enough to inspire a sigh of tender joy.I suppose a few useful traveller-tips seldom go astray for those of you who might have a trip to Hanoi somewhere in the future.Firstly, though you will naturally be drawn to them, try to avoid western-style restaurants; they tend to serve food at European five-star prices and in French-style portions. If you are going to indulge yourself there is a chain of restaurants called “Pepperoni’s” and “Al Fresco’s” who do specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays, all you can eat pasta buffets and half-price pizzas, and if you are hungry (I’m guessing you will be travelling in Asia) you can actually consume your money’s worth. Otherwise, I suggest you be brave and try to snoop-out a street-side restaurant which has a lot of Vietnamese people surrounding it and just get anything that remotely resembles something edible and you may just be surprised at how incredibly tasty they are.Secondly, and quite importantly, supermarkets selling food we recognise are few and far-between, as a matter of fact I have only seen supermarkets in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi so far, so when in Hanoi you should probably try to stock-up on crackers and any other munchies you may need – although relatively expensive, when you are faced with another bowl of noodle-soup with chicken-claws in it, or your stomach decides that squid is maybe not the treat you expected, you will be endlessly grateful for crackers and ""Laughing Cow"" cheese.Thirdly, the most amazing sight I have seen in the city is at night on the road through the west-lake (Hồ Tây) the lights of bars and restaurants and the pagoda is simply wonderful. Although it is somewhat outward of the tourist district (Old Quarter) it is worth going out to it (Xe-Om – that’s a motorbike Taxi - should cost about 25thousand Dong – that’s a Euro).Fourthly, places to stay are numerous and you will probably be comfortable regardless. For a hotel-room you are talking about 250,000Dong (10Euro) and for the backpacking budget traveler I would suggest either “Hanoi Backpackers” or “Drift Backpackers” where you can get a dorm for between 100 and 150,000 – they are both clean, comfy and central.In terms of nightlife, that really is a matter of taste. The usual approach taken by the group of volunteers that I am in Vietnam with is to go to a rather western-styled bar (Le Pub or Hair of the Dog) and then make our way to one of the nightclubs by taxi spending maybe an hour there before heading to another nightclub. I would suggest you do it differently and, where I leading a tour, this is what I would do: go to one of the Cafes that border on every green (or blue if it’s one of the lakes, actually stick with green) area and get yourself a Coconut or a fruit-ice drink (e.g. iced lemon-tea). Then head to a nightclub and stay at the one, because the next won’t be better, thus saving you a taxi-fare and the time and annoyance from traversing the city.My final words are the following: Even if they are incessantly annoying, dirty and shady-looking try to oversee the flaws of the Xe-Om driver for a while and brave the dangers of Hanoi’s streets, because whisking along the traffic-jammed streets and weaving your way through small alleyways will be a memory you will never forget and if you miss the opportunity you may just always regret it."

50,"“Hanoi , A Trip into the unknown”","On a recent visit to HCMC (Saigon) I took a quick decision to spend a few days in Hanoi and its environs but it really was a trip into the unknown for me . I was a solo traveller, with no friends , no contacts and little or no information about the destination. Looking back now I can say , in hindsight ,that it was a good decision. With the help of Julia in Vietnam Trip Advisor a compact three day visit was arranged. Highlights of the visit were a walk around the spectacular Hoan Kiem Lake , the impressive Post Office Building , the Catholic Cathedral and The Street Market all within five minutes walk of each other. The jewel in the crown was , without doubt , a day trip to Halong Bay which no tourist shoul miss,If you intend visiting Vietnam put Hanoi on your must do list and above all dont miss out on the Halong Bay Experience. It is a truly unforgettable experience."
10,"“China visa, Hanoi”","Here's an interesting fact: in the capital city of Vietnam, just 60km from China, you cannot get a Chinese visa from the embassy. Well, apparently you can, but only if you're Vietnamese. We went to the embassy early yesterday (you have to go early, it is only open from 8:30 - 11:00 Mon-Fri) but were told we were not allowed to get one there, only Vietnamese people can. We asked whether we could get a business visa instead of a tourist one (as suggested by the guard there), but were also told that's not possible. Apparently Saigon is the only place in Vietnam to get one.Incidentally, like many countries in this part of the world, the best way to obtain visas seems to ask around at hotels and travel agencies - inevitably there's always some corrupt person at the embassy who issues a few extra visas on the side for a commission. Obviously it's risky (don't pay up front) but I know of quite a few success stories and no failures yet..."

50,“Hanoi - Vietnam”,"Hanoi - Vietnam infoHanoi ( Vietnamese: Hà Nội), the capital of Vietnam, is a fascinating blend of East and West, with Chinese influence from centuries of dominance, and French design from its colonial past. It is largely unspoiled by modern architecture of the 1970s and 80s, and is now going through a modernization that is making it a rising star in Southeast Asia.West Lake: covers over 500ha, the biggest lake in inner Hanoi. In the past, it was ever a relic section of Hong River. According to bibliography, in the 11th century, the lake was named Dam Dam (Mu Suong lagoon). In the 15th century, it was called as Tay Ho. Ho Tay was a landscape of Thang Long. From Ly and Tran dynasties, kings set up many palaces for entertainment around the lake. There are now 61 temples and pagodas around the lake now.Red River flows into Hanoi from Phong Van, Ba Vi district. After going to the north surround Co Do, Tan Hong, it runs to the east and south at Quang Lang commune, Phu Xuyen district. It covers some 120 km in Hanoi area.Excluding the two mountain ranges of Ba Vi and Huong Son and Sai Mountain Range, the suburban region of Hanoi has Soc Son Mountain located in Tam Dao Mountain system which includes many small mountains situated in Me Linh and Soc Son districts. Among those, Ham Lon Mountain or Chan Chim is the highest, 462m.According to a general census on April 1, 2009, Hanoi had more than 6.448 million and covers a total area of 3,324km2. It comprised 10 districts, one town and 18 suburban districts. Hanoi stood the second nationwide in population number and ranks the first in Vietnam in terms of area. The city is listed among 17 capital cities with the biggest area worldwide.On August 1, 2008, Ha Tay province, Me Linh district of Vinh Phuc province and four communes of Luong Son district, Hoa Binh province, were merged into Hanoi. Since then, Hanoi has one more district, one more town and 13 additional districts namely Ha Dong district, Son Tay town and the districts of Ba Vi, Da Phuong, Hoai Duc, Phuc Tho, Thach Thach, Quoc Oai, Thanh Oai, Chuong My, Thuong Tin, Phu Xuyen, Ung Hoa, My Duc and Me Linh."
30,“Average nothing special but the palace”,There is not much to do there. There is only 1-2 days worth of things to do. The big thing is the palace and government building bu thats it .
50,“Tour of Vietnam with Asianatravelmate”,We booked our tour of Vietnam with Asianatravelmate and our trip was organised by Kristal We cannot recommnend this company highly enough. We travelled from Hanoi to the Mekong Delta with 3 stops on route. Each time the guide was there to meet us and take us on our siteseeing trips. All spoke good English. The hotels and restaurants organised by them were of a high quality. We were so pleased that we had done the trip with a company in Vietnam as their knowledge was so great.Rob Knight
20,"“Cold, intense & stresfull”","We're in our third week of a four week holiday in Vietnam which has been amazing, with the exception of Hanoi. We spent about 5 days in Hanoi in between Ha Long & Sa Pa.The city is full of people trying to sell you ANYTHING, you find yourself simple saying No to anyone before they've even said anything. The tourists don't make eye contact let alone say hello, or even a nod. It's a very intense and unfriendly place.Some of the sights are nice, we saw the Ho Chi Minh museum, the lake, water puppets and some more and they were all ok.I would recommend spending as little time as possible in Hanoi and enjoy the real Vietnam in Sa Pa, Hoi An and the country side."
50,“my favorite place in Hanoi- Golden Light Technologies”,"If you ever needed translation service when traveling to Hanoi, Vietnam, I would recommend you the Golden Light Technologies. From this office at 9 Dinh Le str., near Hoan Kiem Lake, you can easily find this office with good translation and interpretation from 15 - 25 USD per an hour. Besides, they also offer website development with impressed design.Kien Nguyen."
40,“Arriving in Hanoi”,"We've arrived in Hanoi, in luxuriant greenery, steamy temps, and a raucous hectic streetscape. Wow, it's really a great contrast from Briton Ferry where we live, but while we love it, we're not sure how long we could 'live' in this space.A hotel pick up car greeted us at Hanoi and the driver attempted to negotiate the 35km to the city. While four lanes, the outer lane was for motorcycles, and the inner lane for cars. But, like China, each driver takes risks to get in front of the next car that leaves us shaking our heads. The trip reminded us so much of our car ride from Beijing Airport to the Beijing city, except the highway was instead like a goat track in comparison. And, instead of 120+km/hr, here we were lucky to get to 60km/hr. The driver said he was a bit late for an appointment so would we mind if he sped a bit. We said OK, and giggled as he tried to gain nothing in a traffic jam traveling at an average of about 45km/hr. The similarities to Beijing are the way cars, bikes, pedestrians just go everywhere/anywhere, without any hint of signal as to intended direction (or so it seems to us).Like the HaNoi airport, the road shows considerable signs of aging. We'd read the freeway from the airport to the city is the best road in Vietnam. Mmmmm... This is the capital, so we're now somewhat frightened as to what might befront us.After booking into our hotel (good room, central location), we headed off for a bowl of Pho (noodle soup) and a wander around this hectic place. We also discovered that Hanoi has brilliant coffee. Having a French background, we should have expected it."
50,“Hanoi is really nice anf fully culture city”,"The city with many beautity of spots. You can see the history of Vietnamese people we came here the first time andwe really like it, we like the culture here very indochina and really peace place for tourism . When you come here you will see first most pepel use moto bikes and you can visit many nice place in Hanoi and explore the life here."
20,“Hanoi- Not My Kind Of Town”,"Before planning a trip to Vietnam I had read many positive reviews on TA about Hanoi and its “charms.” After five days there and venturing to many parts of the city, I must say that Hanoi is a tough and aggravating city to get around (my wife and I walked most places, are from NYC, and thought we knew traffic), the food is nothing to rave about (we tried tiny stools to sit down restaurants), and the architectural character leans heavily toward sooty concrete (French Colonial excepted).We stayed in the Old Quarter (Hanoi Elegance 2 (great hotel, see separate review) on relatively quiet Ma May Street for five days, excluding the Halong Bay overnight, figuring we needed at least three days to settle in and get “the lay of the land.” We never settled in and the lay of the land was a nerve-rattling frenzy.Sidewalks are not intended for pedestrians but are used for motorcycle parking and to extend the squat seating area of local eateries. Most walking is done on the street. Hanoi is not the place for a leisurely stroll, poking into interesting shops, or scoping out a nice café or restaurant.Thank goodness for Highlands Coffee and their iced coffee with milk (order a double). It’s the only quiet respite we found (outside the Opera and Flag Tower/Military Museum). Best time to walk the Old Quarter is before the rooster crows, otherwise it’s a din of motorcycle madness. A great spot to observe is Legend Beer near Hoan Kiem Lake where you can see that all the converging chaos truly is an unchoreographed motorcycle ballet.As for food, we eagerly sampled the legendary Pho (noodle soup with beef, chicken or you name it). One place (Pho Bo Gia Truyen/49 Bat Ban) had great broth but questionable beef. Another joint (Pho Ga/53 Hang Ma) had decent chicken noodle soup and a very friendly staff. Guess I’m just a jook/congee man; didn’t see the attraction of Pho.Instead, we squatted for more tasty Bun Bo, a noodle dish with just a bit of broth, peanuts (Vietnamese peanuts are super peanutty), beef, lemongrass, and basil at Bun Bo Nam Bo/67 Hang Dieu. The recommended Quan An Ngon/18 Phan Boi Cahu is bustling, good food, and a long menu. We tried Bun Cha (pork and noodles) one time to taste what all the fuss was about, then again at another place to see if we missed something, then stopped trying.Biggest mistake was eating at Cha Ca Thanh Long/31 D Thanh on a Lonely Planet recommendation over Cha Ca La Vong, recommended by the rest of the world. Six little pieces of fish with dill, shallots, scallion and not much else. Add on two beers and they took us for 200,000 Dong. Stay away.There was Green Tangerine (stifling ambience, good food, very expensive for Vietnam), Garden (excellent shrimp in clay pot, request a courtyard table), Highway 4 (a chain that adds 10% gratuity but your chance to try ostrich, pig ear or locust), and Restaurant 69 (just up from out hotel and no desire to cross another street, fair food).And then there was The Coffee. I probably could never find it again but the best coffee we ever had was discovered after emerging from a small alley on Ngu Xa island on West Lake. Facing north towards the lake, it’s the coffee shop behind you on the right with the young man waving you to sit down. We did. On actual chairs! Unlike other drip coffee in the metal filters that, when it’s finally, finally done is luke warm, this was piping hot with scrumptious condensed milk on the bottom. It was 85 cents of heaven. If you like Vietnamese coffee, get some beans from Café Mai/96 Le Van Huu.Visited Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (a somber and respectful walk around Uncle Ho in state [died 1969]), Ho Chi Minh Museum (very funky and unexpected) and his Stilt House and car collection (all well worth it; go early); Museum of Fine Arts (every other subject has a gun); Puppet Theatre (a hoot, must see, buy tickets ahead); Dong Xuan Market (huge, probably best not to go early when all the enormous bags of T-shirts are being unpacked); Night Market (a suffocating experience); St. Joseph’s Cathedral (saw the Sunday service- the priest is American); Hanoi Hilton (aka Hua Loa; see the photos of smiling US POWs and read how well the Americans were treated and how badly the French treated the Vietnamese); Flag Tower and Military Museum (captured American planes on display); Lenin Park (the park is a little spooky on a bright Sunday afternoon and as an update, the lake is a pile of dredged dirt).What really makes a trip are the people. And as a rough estimate, about half the Hanoians (?) we met were generally friendly and the other half were indifferent, which is fine. My point of regional reference is Chiang Mai, Thailand; Siem Reap, Cambodia; and Hoi An, Vietnam; and in these places the people we met were by far more outgoing and friendly than the local people we met in Hanoi.If heading to Hanoi, don’t expect a quaint, provincial, capital city. It’s a bustling and hectic place that will do a number on the senses. Clearly a lot of people love it, and it is worth a visit, though perhaps in a small dose to start.porkroll"
50,“memorable trip”,"Memorable tripwhat a wonderful trip in Hanoi. I went with my family for a week holidays. We went to shopping around the perimeter of the return sword lake and in the Old Quarter. We bought alot of stuff. We were really interest and feel excited about where to go next. Honestly Hanoi was one of the places that i shouldve visit long time ago. Also some supermarkets are pretty good for buying some of the more of the more unusual food items as well as staple branded products that are common. We was back to hotel and went to swimming in a hotel called Sofitel Metropole. That was one of reputable hotel that i ever go. Everything was all clean and convenience.and Next day, we left Hanoi to go to Halong Bay. I chose Phoenix Cruiser (at first i had wonder Phoenix Or Emerald Cruiser , two boats were different in Services and price, but at all save my husband's money, i got Phoenix) They was great and with a big cruise that made we feel more confident about and going to have a wonderful trip,great staff,great service,i like the food as well. We were not have alot info about where we should go,they provided helpful instructions for us. Well pretty happy about what we had, nothing really to complain about. We had another night in Hanoi before taking a plane to our home.Hopefully we will have one more chance to go next year:)"
40,“My adventures in Ha Noi: Land of motorcycles and noodles”,"I opted to travel via the two-day two-night trip via sleeper bus from Saigon to Hanoi instead of an hour flight. It was an enjoyable experience. I was the only passenger on this particular bus who dared to complete the journey.After a 12-hour bus ride from Hue, the fourth and last city stopover, I finally got my first glimpse of Ha Noi. Winter has just set in, painting a bleak color on the horizon. It was quite a change from Ho Chi Minh.Unlike Saigon’s tropical weather, I learned that Ha Noi has its four seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn. The temperature was between 15 -20 degrees during my first week. I was told that it would be up to 7-8 degrees by the first week of January.I am the kind of traveler who prefers to learn explore my way around rather than do advanced research before traveling. I stayed near Hoan Kiem District, where you can feel enough of the day and night activities. At one end of the Hoan Kiem Lake District, you can find a wide array of locally made products.At this time, high quality jackets and sweaters are saleable to ward off the cold. Hotels also abound in this area, both for high-end vacationers and for backpackers. Life never stops in Hanoi. When most of the business establishments are beginning to close down their shops for the night, noodle vendors are also starting to put up their stalls.In about 15 minutes, you can see people sitting with a bowl of noodles in every possible corner of the narrow streets, unmindful of the smoke billowing out of the thousands of motorbikes passing by. Million motorbikes crossing the streets especially the main thoroughfares of Ha Noi or Saigon or the other big cities like Hai Phong farther up north is a dangerous thing do for a first timer. You should always take extra caution.I had practiced a technique by going along with more than two people slipping their way to the other side, especially elder ones. That’s the safest way I found and it proved effective.See related articles in my website:http://saipancatalyst.blogspot.com/2009/12/retreat-to-viet-nam_04.html"
20,“transport from airport!”,"FYI----The government is doing roadwork on the long bridge between the airport and the city. It took us over 2 hours to get to our hotel, the cab driver (who spoke 2 words of english) tried to take us to an airport hotel without really telling us what he was doing. We argued with him to stay in the traffic just because we felt sketched out that he was trying to take us somewhere else. It shortly became obvious that we made the right decision and the only way to get to the city is to sit in the traffic and go over the bridge. So beware of any scamming that cabs might be involved in to make a quick buck by taking you to a close airport hotel and charging you the full amount."
40,"“The most unexpected treat, and what a place!”","An amazing city! Hanoi was so memorable and it had nothing to do with the wonderful 4 and 5 star accommodations we stayed at.The place has a vibrancy and energy due to growth and governmental/commercial change - you will be an instant millionaire with the dong being valued so low so definitely take advantage of the shopping, so much wonderful local (read Asian) arts and handicrafts to buy at really low prices - if you're happy with the price then it's not worth bargaining because these people are poor, help them out! If you do your research you can find inexpensive restaurants with amazing food (if you go to tourist restaurants you will pay the price!). The temple of literature is a must see and visiting Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum was an experience that I'll never forget. The Hanoi hilton (prison) was also memorable and the most famous market was a fun/crazy experience as is the neighborhood you'll find it in! hanoi is also a great starting point to visit other places in Vietnam like Sapa or Halong Bay. Feel free to email me with any questions you may have - I thoroughly recommend this town for people who are not overly high maintenance and understand that this is not a resort place but somewhere with history and cultural value."
50,“Jbr Hanoi”,"Will endeavour to keep it simple. We arrived in Hanoi in the afternoon and went straight to our Hotel from the Airport ""Hanoi Elegance 4"" what a great establishment to stay in.The rooms were perfect, the front office staff were lovely. We went straight out to explore as we only really had a few hours in Hanoi as we left to go to Halong Bay the next morning. We wandered the streets and went to the lake, we stayed in the ""Old Quarter"" so everything was close and handy. Hanoi is a beautiful city.After a lovely breakfast we were picked up by Columbus Tours as we were off to Halong Bay on the ""Pinta Gold"" we were doing a one night stay. The boat and tour was amazing, our accommodation with red rose petals in a love heart design on our beds through to the staff and the food which just seemed neverending. Would highly recommend not missing Halong Bay it was a real treat. We were back at our hotel the following day by 5pm just in time to head out for dinner and shop. Our first night in Hanoi we ate at a little restaurant not far from the Hotel called Geckos we were the only ones in the restaurant but the food was delicious. We loved Hanoi and would stay and recommend the Hanoi Elegance 4 without any hesitation. They even pack you up breaky if you have an early flight to catch."
50,"“Han Lon Bay a must see if visiting Vietnam""”","Every visitor needs to make the trip to Han Lon Bay. We booked a private tour from our hotel travel desk for the day. Tour included driver (stays with the car), English speaking tour guide (who stays with you the whole tour), lunch on boat which was fantastic. Drinks at own expense. On board your captain, deckhand and cook who serves the food which is cooked on board. Wish we had booked a couple of days on Hanlon Bay as it is such a huge area to explore.The only down side, it wasn't a clear day, very smokey as rice straw was being burnt off in rice fields. Still took plenty of photos. Visited a factory on the way down where handicap people work doing silk sewing, dressmaking, lacquer ware. It was a very interesting place. Would highly recommend a visit of a couple of days to Hanlon Bay ."
50,“Tho Ha tradditional village”,"Tho Ha, which is situated over 30 miles North of Hanoi, can be reach after a drive one and half an hours.Tho Ha is a traditional village on a peninsula, surrounded by the Nhu Nguyet river. The easiest way to reach the village is to take a short ferryboat across the river.The local people here is famous for their hospitality and industry. They live by traditional jobs of making rice paper and rice wine. You will be amazed by the architecture of this village. Your trip leader will bring you to visit a family where the local people live by making rice paper and raising pigs. As you walk around the village you will have a chance to mingle with the local people.Walking into the Tho Ha village is like walking into another world. The village is geographically isolated, and a result, it offers a unique glimpse into rural life that you will not see elsewhere during your time in Viet Nam. To our knowledge, no other foreigners visit Tho Ha. For many travelers, this visit is a highlight of their trip to Vietnam. We top-off the morning with a Vietnamese lunch at a popular restaurant on our return to Hanoi."

They know the inside outs of Vietnam, great scenic places, friendly staff, and good old aussie food!!"
50,“A fantastic place if you have time to discover it”,"Hanoi is not like other capital city, it has an old town spirit with all the activity of a city. People sit down anywhere in the floor to eat, have a tea or just talk and observe life going by.Before travelling Vietnam I supposed that five days was to much for Hanoi but I was mistaken, enjoying a complete morning in places like the literature temple is part of the real discovering of the city charm. The best of the city was the last night in the fantastic Metropole hotel during my last night there....a part of the history of the city still like in the old days"
50,“A special hotel in Hanoi”,"If you are looking for a hotel located in the thick of activity in the heart of the old city of Hanoi, with superb restaurant food, excellent staff service and reasonable prices, try the Hoabinh Palace Hotel at 27 Hang B Street, Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi. I am a serious collector of ethnic art and textiles. Having failed to purchase something I wanted to bring home in the rush to get to the airport., the hotel did it for me. I sent them the following note of thanks:""Gentlemen,The baby hat arrived today, safe and sound. Perfect! Thank you so much for doing this for me. I don't think there is another hotel in the world that would have extended itself in this way to make a passionate collector like myself happy, when it had nothing to do with hotel business. I am really very grateful to you both.Regards,Binnie Fry DeLarm"""
30,“Hanoi - Scam city!!”,"Our first night in Hanoi had us entangled in a hotel scam that we eventually came out on top of; but overall our stay in Hanoi was wonderful - of course it depends what you're looking for.We were there to experience the daily lives of the people and chose to stay in the Old Quarter not far from Hoan Kiem Lake.We had booked tours to Halong Bay, Tam Coc Caves/Hoa Lu and Perfume Pagoda.Our stay in Hanoi was a wet one, with only a day or two where it did not rain. Our first day was for getting our bearings, seeing the tourist sights and just enjoying the Old Quarter's streets and merchants - unfortunately it rained all day and we only saw half of what we wanted to see while trying to stay out of the rain and learning to cross the roads.Our tour to Perfume Pagoda was another wet one and from our experience we would recommend giving it a miss altogether - although a subsequent visit to Tam Coc Caves would have me feeling cheated of what could have been. Had the weather been good, even staying at the bottom of the mountain sitting by the river until your group returned would have been worth it - if the weather had been good!!We arrived at the river where our ladies were to transport us by iron boats to the foot of Perfume Mountain and the multitude of restaurants - lunch was provided but you pay for it with drinks. Next is the trek to Perfume Pagoda - due to the rain our group opted for the chairlift and what a sensible decision that was! Below was a long line of what looked like shanty roofs all the way to the top of the mountain - we were later to discover these were simply vendor stalls lining both sides of the walkway to and from the pagoda and the only chance we had to see the countryside was from the chairlift itself. Some of us opted to walk down the mountain - a huge mistake!! We not only had to contend with the rain and the slippery stone path but also walking through the hundreds of stalls lining the way that blocked out all that beauty. Back at the boats, even though they are paid by the tour companies to transport us, the ladies will harrass you until they receive a tip - be prepared for sulking if you don't. All in all, a very unpleasant day with very few highlights to report on.The following day was a tour to Ha Long Bay and we were lucky in that the rain eased while we sailed the bay in a dragon boat and enjoyed a wonderful vietnamese lunch on board. The boat stopped at a floating village where fresh seafood could be purchased by tourists and cooked by the crew - unfortunately, not understanding the language means we missed that little point and imagined we had to transport the live seafood back to Hanoi. A wasted opportunity for fresh crab and lobster! We had opted for a half-day boat trip but with better weather then a 2 or 3-day cruise would be so incredibly relaxing.Our next tour was to Hoa Lu/Tam Coc Caves and finally we had sunshine. Again ladies in canoes floated us along a river and through 3 grottoes - nothing could be more relaxing than the slow clunking of oars hitting the oarlocks whilst being rowed along a silent river on a sunny day. The sunshine, the silent river, the green ricefields, the limestone karst outlines - absolutely beautiful. If you go to Hanoi, visit Ninh Binh.This was our last night in Hanoi and as the weather was typically balmy we went for a stroll around Hoan Kiem Lake. Saturday night at the lake is for young couples - romance was everywhere. It is also the place to go for icecream at one of the number of icecream shops along the water's edge.Our last day in Hanoi was again a wet one but we loved the area so much that we again ventured out in our plastic ponchos and ended up at a 3rd floor restaurant overlooking the length of the lake - what a brilliant memory to take away from Hanoi."
10,“Beware the scam taxi/hotel”,"Recently I arrived in Hanoi and was late due to a plane delay. The driver scheduled by my hotel was not there. Another driver whose fare had been a no show offered to take me to mine. I gave him the address and telephone number which he called to say I was on my way (the hotel verified that). However, I was brought to a hotel where a ""hotel manager"" met me and told me that my room was not empty and they would take me to a partner hotel. Not knowing any better as he had approached me in the taxi, I was brought to a horrible hotel - the Vietnam Star Hotel - and the driver refused to take me any farther. It was 11 pm and as a single traveller I did not venture out. The room was disgusting and fyi the hotel night manager was in on the scam. Another man in the hotel had the same thing happen. Beware Hanoi - full of cheats and scammers. My all day City Tour lasted only one half day and left out several sites. When I went to Sapa, my tour had not been paid for by the tour agency - Sinh Cafe Travel Agency. Fortunately, the hotel did not make me pay again as they realized what had happened and informed their Hanoi contact. The same agency had not given any information on my for my Halong Bay cruise. Again fortunately I was allowed to travel. I had a receipt for all of these trips so the Agency was responsible. After talking with several travellers I realized I had been overcharged for most of the tours, but everyone paid something different. Agencies are not honest so you have to really be careful. Even the agencies in the good hotels vary the prices."

10,“Don't Try Tours from http://www.hanoitravel.com.vn/home.htm”,"This tour operator tends to give you all the promises that they cannot keep. So once you're in the tour, you will find extra costs here and there.I joined a 3-day Halong Bay Cat Ba Island in Hanoi; and a day trip to CuChi Tunnel and Tay Ninh in Saigon. First they sent you a pretty fruitful itinerary and ask you to pay deposit, when you arrived they would give you another one which contains less activities and less sight-seeing. When you really joined the tour, you're already in the trap and could only go whatever extra costs they gonna charge you (like drinks, bike even cup of tea, etc.)I complained about my 3-day trip to Halong Bay Cat Ba Island and tried to make their next trip to CuChi Tunnel better, but they kept changing the operators. Turned out that no pick up (you have to walk to the meeting point), everything like lunch, entrance fee were not included..I was pissed off with their unprofessional service. Paying more is not a problem because it's relatively less compared to my home country, but you felt like your day was ruined by them. And they made you nervous and confused when they kept changing the operators.If you going to Vietnam (they operates tour not just in Hanoi, but Saikong, Sapa and rest of the country), NEVER EVER book tours from them. They just know to earn fat commissions. Let your friends know this too.Their website:http://www.hanoitravel.com.vn/home.htm"
20,“Taxis in Hanoi”,"My wife and I spent a week in Hanoi last month. Our visit was spoilt by many unscrupulous taxi drivers who had fast meters fitted to their taxis. When queried about the outragouos fares many drivers became very aggressive and threatening. We were quite shaken by this. According to to an English language Vietnamese newspaper that we read in Hanoi, fast taxi meters are a growing problem. The authorities must deal with this quickly or the reputation of Hanoi as a friendly destination for tourists will be seriously damaged. Our solution was to ask our hotel to provide the phone numbers of reliable taxi firms. All taxis have their phone numbers clearly displayed. We found Mai Linh taxis with a green logo and ABC taxis were safe and reliable. Beware the others."
30,"“No Problem,but the tours purchased there were crap.”","Well I got to say the hotel was quite bearable.Having a frig in the room is a big priority for me,being a drinker.Also no one else reviewing here has mentioned the the hotel has an elevator.I booked by phone from laos,and the manager was there to greet me at the door on arrival,even thought the flight from Luang Prabang was delayed 4 hours.We had a front view room,small balcony,looking out over the fascinating street life in this old part of town.The tours that he booked were crap though,one a city tour,the other a Halong bay tour.He also booked our train ticket down to Danang,no problems there.If you book a tour,get detailed info on the type of vechicle,what you get ,and where you go.Our Halong bay tour had an agressive driver,we are all cramped into a small mini bus,and we also waisted over an hour detouring off to some tourist trap souvenir shop,supposidly run by some charity.I doubt it!The so called seafood meal on board the boat trip was rubbish.So check the the bus size, then the bus travel itinery to make sure there are no stops at souvenir shops etc,and get details of the food served on the boat cruise..The city tour,I must say the included meal at a restaurant was excellent,but the driver dumped us some place miles from the hotel on the return,and main features of the tour like Uncle Hoes tomb was closed for servicing.[no one told us that!]Some temple we went to I was not admitted to as I was wearing shorts..[no one told us that!]All the other stops were so crowded with gawking tourists,it was impossible to even get a photo without a tourist in it.I was so happy next day to get a map and locate the sights that ""I WANTED"" to see,then hop in a cab,and go to those specific locations,and in most cases there were no other tourists there.The most memorable was the war museum.Not a white face in sight,and wow, the displays of war were amazing.A WARNING about the taxis in Hanoi.There is, or was an honest taxi company.Check it out in LP.The others all have scams,dicky meters,etc,one even had a US $ sticker suggesting the price was in US $ not Dong.Rule of thumb,dont take a taxi that cruises YOU.Hail one yourself ."
40,“beware of having your bag slashed”,"Thursday 27th AugustBooked a van for our journey to the airport with Mr. Viet at the Fish Café, he arrived bang on time gave us a pleasant ride and did not hold his hand out for a tip which was a refreshing change, who started all this tipping rubbish? If the person does something extra than get you from a to b fair enough but a fare quoted is a fare quoted, I am sick at this stage of people holding out their hand for extras.Had a pleasant flight with Vietnam airlines to Hanoi, a short flight apparently too short for something to nibble on, we were given juice directly after take off and that was it.As we were staying in Hanoi for 5 nights our hotel gave us a free transfer and credit to them for this they were there waiting for us, but that is the only credit will give to themat this point, I have already done my review on the Queen Star Hotel , I made it my top priority on my return.We had a lovely time in Hanoi for five days with one day away in Halong Bay which I will do a separate report on.My first job here was to get some glasses organised, we dice with death again dodging the scooters both on the road and parked on the footpath, the crossings don't seem to serve much purpose anywhere, we get horribly side tracked on the way to the street of glasses, so many sights to see so many shops oozing with goodies but we press on.I choose two different frames for myself and a groovy pink pair of Burberry for my grand daughter all at $20. I arrange to have only one pair made up with lenses $70 and as I wear bi focals and have quite a strong lens he told me 2 days but Anne and her numerous pairs of glasses and sunnies would be ready the following day.We walk down as far as the lake and have coffee and got jumped on by several hawkers, it would have been nice to sit in peace but no we just had to have the wallets and of course we needed hundreds of postcards!!!!!!!!We tried to do the walking tour the next day but again so many things to side track you like the “footpath police” don’t know what they are called but all the shop owners from one end of the street of shoes from one end to the other in a mad rush to get the shoes off the path and in the shop, its one of the sights that I still laugh about when I think about it.We took cyclos a couple of times to different locations we were told about and not once but twice we fell for the story that they could not enter the next street as it was one way but pho 24 was just round the corner, what fools we were (again)Our cyclos that we took to the museum and mausoleum etc. did not try to rob us and gave us a fare price. We waited in line to file past Ho Chi Minh and that was a eerie experience which I will not repeat but at the same time I am glad I did it.Our hotel was in a good location and the markets were not far away, what a shoppers paradise three floors of goodies of every description and I was glad to find some of the dried sugar coated ginger that we had found in Ho Chi Minh.Our glasses came up to expectations and then some, as he had made for me varifocals and not the bi-focals that I am used to, he thought he was dong me a favour and it took me quite a bit of explaining that I can not wear varifocals, I resorted to drawing a picture and he was happy to do them again.Our stay in Hanoi was marred at the night market by my foolishness of putting my purse in my cloth shoulder bag even though I had a deep pocket and a bum bag. I had it slashed and fortunately that is all that fell out as I had my camera in there also, I only had about $100 in it and my credit card was back at the hotel, and I still shiver when I think that someone with a knife was so close to me. Another lesson learned"
10,“BEWARE OF THE TAILORS... MANY ARE SCAMS”,"Be wary of the cheap custom made clothing available in Hanoi. We went to shop on Hang Gai Street called Yen Boutique. AVOID THIS STORE AT ANY COST. The women who work there are con artists trying to pass off clothing saying it is custom made. It is the worst qualtiy clothing. We have to have a long drawn out fight to get our money back that they refused to refund. If it sounds too good to be true than it is. Save yourself the headache and the awful customer service and becareful where you go to on Hang Gai street. I saw other people receommend the same store. Maybe they had a good experience but I would be wary of it.Haoni has great restaurants but be careful in the clothing shops, especially Yen Boutique at 115 Hang Gai."
50,“Terrific traffic experience...”,"One of the curious things about Hanoi is the old quarter of the city, which is like SHOPPING MECCA. What makes it curious is not just the fab shopping but the fact that one can hardly walk along the tiny footpaths due to all of the motor scooters parked outside shops and in some cases parked inside the shops. Now this means that one must walk in the gutter, and when it’s raining this can be a bit of toe wetting experience!. I guess so far this is all sounding not so curious or exciting but it really is (I will slowly get to the point sooner or later).Having only experienced daily driving through traffic congestion and the accompanying road rage of Aucklands motorways. I found myself ill prepared for the onslaught of Vietnams vehicular unpredictability!!. Hubby and I came to the following conclusions:1) white lines on the road are for decoration only not to be taken seriously by road users.2) Cars are for the seriously rich3) Those with cars would go nowhere fast; as motor scooters are the kings of the road4) ROAD RULES: what ever…5) HELMETS: yeah right….6) Only two persons to a motor scooter: hahaha7) Butchers can carry more than three fully grown pigs per motor scooter8) If the family wants to take a vacation ….easy pack up all necessary belongings including the family dog and head off into the sunset on your scooter….Now put all of the above conclusions into one small area (the old quarter, basically small road ways). Now doesn’t that make you curious?Now I am sure you are probably wondering how it could be shopping mecca when you must have to keep one eye firmly in front of you and one firmly on the surrounding traffic. Easy….scooters are easy to manoeuvre through pedestrians, only if the peds don’t hurry out of the way. Hey the Vietnamese are practically born on the back of a scooter. They don’t need silly old fussy foreigners rushing across the road when they can fly pass you by mere inches! I mean really!.Being me I couldn’t wait until sun up on the first morning to go and peer over the balcony onto the old quarter below. No I was up at sparrows fart gripping the edge of the railing peering down below in my dressing gown in light misty rain. Now while most people are sleeping. Life carries on for the busy motor scooter. Rush hour is any hour of the day or night and rain is definitely no issue. I was excited, grinning like a mad thing waving at anyone who happened to look my way!!After what seemed like a short while I was lead back to bed by a sleepy hubby who was obviously being kept awake by my hysterical hellos and giggling. ( I would like to point out that the balcony wasn’t attached to our room like you were probably imagining, it was actually 6 rooms, 2 elevators and one stair well away from our room!! Hmmmm maybe he had a point)."
50,“OHHH the weather in March....”,"Yes I know most people travel the world fossicking and exploring ancient sights and yes my hubby and I did that too, but I just want to share with you the other little things that happened along the way because really if you want to learn about ancient stuff go to the library or google it you would get much more accurate information from there trust me!.Me being me I have to check the weather at every destination we are headed to prior to leaving. I hate the cold I mean literally hate no loath the cold one wiff of a cool sea breeze and every hair on my body stands on end I look like a hedgehog, so it’s really not the prettiest sight. My prior to departure weather check advised me that Hanoi would be at it’s lowest around 15 degrees. Now that’s pretty chilly, some part of my brain refused to believe that it would be that cool. So I only packed one merino long sleeve top imagining myself swanning about looking regal in a pair of jeans and a fancy fitted shirt I had picked up cheap at the markets. HA!, I went straight for the oddest shade of purple skin tone and glazed eyes from the stiff wind and head to head out to the closest market to get a jacket.Now it’s ok to feel like an idiot with out everyone around you pointing it out but really. I had little old Vietnamese woman rushing over, dropping their baskets to run their hands over my prickly skin and tell me it was cold and to put something warm on!. COLD no FREEZING yes. Now hey I was a foreigner for all they knew I could have been Russian and used to cooler temps so I held my head high and smiled, gripping their nice warm hands in my freezer palms and said “no no I am fine I like it like this!”HAH, that’s the biggest load of cods-whollop to ever drivel out of my mouth.Now I just want to go on a little tangent for a moment. I have obscenely long limbs. Not elegant graceful model type limbs. I am talking oragataung length arms that almost scrap along the ground when I walk. And garguantian legs and to top it all off they are stick thin!. I mean really if anyone says they would love to have my height and elegant limbs must be blind because the majority of other woman in the western world is a descent 5 foot 6 inches not 5 foot 10 inches. Now just think about this for a little bit; if the majority of people are of descent average height who do you think clothes makers make clothes for? NO not old excessive height old me. So going to buy jeans to fit length ways is just a cruel joke and trying to find a nice top with long enough arms to keep my arms down to my wrists warm is just impossible. Now picture me height greedy Reghan heading off around the markets in search of a warm jacket in an Asian country where the average limb length is half of mine.After two long cold hours, Hey I was looking at other stuff at the markets too you know!, After about the ten millionenth time I asked in slow draw out English with hand actions as well for a jacket with LONGGGG arms I found it. It glistened from it’s rack calling to me, inviting me to touch its faux fur lined neck it was all turquoisey and lined and it had ‘arm length’ I could just tell. I hesitated I didn’t want this euphoria to wear off I gently lifted its price tag over. It surprised me further by being WELL within my budget. I carefully took it off its rack and slipped it over my shoulders. OH beautiful it fitted like a glove. “Yes I’ll take it thanks, no need for a bag I would like to wear it now” I was sooo happy I skipped along the street with my hubby shaking his head in my wake. Five minutes later the spell was semi- broken. I reached up to bring a picture down to eye level and that’s when it happened as soon as my arm was raised any higher than 45degrees away from my body the arm length shot up to my elbow leaving me feeling exposed and cold.I mean really with arms like mine this love affair was bound to end sooner or later, I consoled myself with that fact that if I kept my arms down at all times I look fantastic. Its about finding that happy medium. My hubby is still pondering my logic!"
20,“Hanoi for holiday?”,"I recently went on a trip with my mom to Hanoi in early Mar 08. Thinking to reduce some hassle, I bought a package tour with Air Asia which includes airticket+hotel. Though I've been told by some friends that Vietnam is not what you would expect and we should be prepared to encounter some problems, we went ahead with our plans as I've always wanted to see this country. Here, I would like to share my experience with fellow travellers.HotelThe hotel which i've chosen is the Hanoi plaza hotel. In the original package by Airasia, we are assigned the standard room. however, I emailed the owner (tony/jack) to upgrade my room to deluxe with an additional charge of USD10/day. Overall, the rooms are clean and the staff are friendly. Only thing is..beware that they might swap your room to a different grade for whatever purposes!!Walking the streetsMy mom and I found walking around the old quarter area a tiring experience. There is a constant flow of traffic who have no qualms about honking. The noise is enough to drive you mad not to mention you need to be on a constant lookout for traffic. it is distracting trying to look at the shops and fighting for space with all the bikes and cars. it is not pedestrian frendly. The sights however was interesting. The steets are worthwhile to explore but pls be careful with your bags. My mom's backpack was opened from behind her twice! Luckily she felt the tugging and turned around in time. oh...did I mention that crossing the streets is a hazzard?? the french quarter is much much better with proper walkways.FoodFood is pretty good but I found that the cha ca is overrated. At the price of VND90,000 per person, I thinking would be better spent elsewhere.Halong bay tourI went on a halong bay day trip booked from the hotel. The place is worth a visit but you have to be aware of the 7 hr bus journey to/fro. I found that the Hanoi tours have plenty to improve on. After travelling extensively in thailand, I do compare the countries. Hanoi needs to improve on the proffessionalism. The guide was not well verse and was not prepared. He did not use the opportunity to tell the tourist more about the place nor did he take initiative to ensure the comforts of the tourists. I asked him for paracetamol at the begining of the trip. He kept promising to stop at a pharmacy for me but he never did. included in the tour was lunch. what they dont tell you is...water is not provided!!! I've yet to travel to a place where lunch is served without water. The least they could have offered was a cup of tea but no.....all drinks have to be purchased with only coke and beer as option!In my honest opinion, I may not choose Vietnam as a holiday destination again. The problems with hotels (room swapping) and tourist facilities is just not up to standard as yet. If you are the type to rough it out, it may be a place for you. Hanoi does have interesting sights but you have to rough it to see it."
40,“Old-fashioned charm in Hanoi”,"We took a Vietnamese cyclo (it is very much the extension of a bicyclewhere the passenger sits in the carriage at the front and the cyclist at the back) to Hanoi Old Quarters, which are made up of quaint littleold alleyways with old shops selling almost everything from householdsto tourist goods. It is like a old fashioned market place, as there are also traders selling fruits, flowers and nic-nacs by the streetside. The alley ways are lined with tall, beautiful, shady treesthat makes the place cool and and a very pleasant place to stroll around. A charrming place not to be missed."
50,“Fascinating destination”,"Lots to see and do here, ranging from the heart of the communist beginnings to arts to easy accezs to other areas such as Ha Long Bay. very odd to see Ho Chi Minh in his glass case, but ot to be missed. Be sure to add it to a Vietnam trip."
10,“dont trust anyone!”,Hanoi in my experince recently (4 weeks ago) is a very dangerous place & is full of `scams` i.e.taxi drivers taking you to a different hotel to the one you have given him instructions & mapfor and taking you to a similar `sounding` hotel name which is a few miles away then expecting you to pay extra for him gettinglost!!!! DONT PAY!! REFUSE & IGNORE HIS PROTESTS!Just give him what you know to be the correct fare & walk away!!The streets near to our hotel are in almost in complete darkness due to the amount of high overgrown trees and most of the street lights not working! This encourages unsavery people who follow you & want to take you to your hotel and in my case a European woman came out of the darkness & put her arms around me and asked where I was from while my friend witnessed her putting her other hand into the side of my bag!!! BEWARE!!Also dont go into any karaoke bars upstairs in private rooms because there will bring in lots of food that you didnt order & at the end give you a very large bill to pay..and block the exit door!
40,“Hanoi attraction”,"I like Hanoi, I went around the end of February 2007, the weather was cool. Sometime a bit of dizzle, but nothing heavy.Art work and handicraft are very fine and of outstanding quality, overall. Prices vary, depending on the works, I prefer shopping at the Old Quarter, where there are numerous little shops and stores. Try their little red chillies, red hot stuff, mother of all chillies.We visited the outskirt, took a boat ride along the karst landscape. Stayed overnight on a big boat at Halong bay, the water was very calm.Will go there again, to track the Sapa mountain."
50,“Fell in love”,"Born in Europe I have been living in Asia for more than 10 years. So I saw many countries and cities here. Hanoi I liked most. Ho Chi Minh City for instance is boring to me - apart from the great china town there what most tourist do not visit/know. But Hanoi might not be a place for tourist used to luxury trips. But then it would not be Hanoi anymore anyway. It is a place full of live and contrast. You have to touch it and it will touch you. You will live in it.Hanoi has a lot to offer for tourist and many hotels have great rooms - I checked at least 15 hotels with rooms in the $ 25 range. In most of them internet is free and even available in the rooms. Some rooms have even computers.The food is excellent too. But it might be a problem for tourists not used to Asia to find the right place or to accept a different standard in respect of clean. On the other hand all the food scandals in Europe for instance...The people are mostly extremely friendly. Some taxi drivers will try to cheat you with wrong meters or/and detours. But you find such taxis almost everywhere in the world. Try to make fixed prices without meter - normally no problem,Problem in Hanoi is the air pollution. I am not sure if it is lower than in Bangkok. Another problem for many tourists is to cross the street with all the motorbikes. My advice - walk slowly and PREDICTABLE. I always cross without looking much at the traffic. I think Hanoi/Ho Chi Minh City are one of the safest places to cross the street - I am not kidding. I would not do this kind of street crossing in Europe, USA or in other Asian countries.All in all I have to say Hanoi has me surprised in many positive ways. I did not expect to see anything new after such a long Asia experience. But Hanoi is different from all the cities I saw so far in Asia. I really fell in love with it."
50,“Senator Mc Cain”,It is amazing to see the actual site where Senator John Mc Cain (R-Arizona) was shot down during the Vietnam War. The monument is a tribute to him as he is now considered a man of peace in this country as he has worked tirelessly to bring about relations between this country and the U.S.

30,“Hanoi ist nur bedingt zu empfehlen!”,"Die Strassen in Altstadt sind sehr schmal,eng, dreckig.Die Bürgersteige sind von Garküchen und Motorrädern belegt.Die Leute müssen auf der Strasse gehen!Das ist sehr gefährlich!Die Sehenwürdigkeiten sind leider nicht gut gepflegt und hinterlassen keinen starken Eindruck wie in anderen Haupstädten in Asien.Taxi ist billig aber man muß immer aufpassen,weil man schnell von Taxifahrer mit manipuliertem Taximeter betrogen wird.Das kann im Restaurant für ausländische Gäste-teilweise selbst für Vietnamesen mit südlichem Akzent-geschehen."
50,“INCREÍBLE HANOI”,"Delirante, desorbitante, impresionante y electrizante, así es esta increíble ciudad; su gente, su cultura, su tráfico!!Súper aconsejable si no tienes vértigo en la carretera, si el bullicio te provoca y si eres muy muy urbanita/sorpresivo, por ejemplo, estuvimos tres horas para cruuzar una calle, era imposible: las motos te sortean, aquí no hay semáforos. Genial, maravillosa cuidad."
30,“やかましいけど自然体”,フランス領だったことがあるので そのおもかげが残る町ときいていたので街並みに期待していたのですが、そんなことはなかったです。とにかくバイクが多くて 空気が悪いです。でも 人をだまそうというふんいきがある街ではありませんでした。ものを売りつけてくる人がいないです。日本人だからといって 笑顔で興味深く近づくという人はまったくいませんでした。無関心という言葉がぴったり。人情を求める人には さびしいかもしれません。ベトナムのかわいい雑貨にであうこともありませんでした。雑貨が目的の女子はホーチミンがいいかも。商品は価格の表記がほとんどないので、買い物がしずらく、書いてあってもドルだったりベトナムドンだったり よくわからなかったです。でも 食事が採ってもやすてから、貧乏旅行にはよいですよ。マッサージも600円くらいで70分間 真剣にやってくれました。まじめで 冷静な人種という印象をうけました。
50,“Anstrengend für Fussgänger - dennoch ein Besuch wert!”,"Ja, Hanoi ist für FussgängerInnen klar ein hartes Pflaster. Versuche, die Strasse in Eiltempo zu überqueren können schon mal traumatische Erfahrungen mit sich bringen. Ist das langsame !Uberqueren der Strassen jedoch einmal gelernt, so kann die Erkundung der wunderbaren Stadt beginnen! Und es lohnt sich: schmucke Plätze, verwinkelte Gassen, farbige Märkte und kleine Ruheoasen in Form von Boutiquen, Parks oder Restaurants. ein Besuch lohnt sich auf jeden Fall - ob für den Rucksacktouristen oder die Luxusreisende.."
20,“ぼったくり”,ぼったくられることが多いです。タクシーは遠回り、おつりは渡さない。商品価格は倍以上。５倍の価格をとられたことも・・・ホテルではチップを要求、ツアーデスクも通常の倍以上の価格。スーパーやコンビニで買うのが安心です。もちろん、いい人もいると思いますが。だまそうというか、たくさんお金を要求することが当たり前のようです。価格交渉が苦手な私にはあわない国でした。
50,“Hanoi - eine Stadt voller Gegensätze”,"In Hanoi geht es hektisch zu - fast noch hektischer als in anderen vietnamesischen Städten. Das Wasserpuppentheater ist sehr lohnenswert. Die Karten sind in der Regel 14 Tage vorher ausverkauft. Mit Glück kann man aber noch eine Karte am Abend ergattern. D.h. wer abends in der Stadt ist, sollte schauen ob der Ticket Schalter offen hat. So haben wir mit viel Glück noch eine Karte bekommen."
40,“Impactante”,"fue la primera ciudad de Vietnam que visitamos, y el cambio con lo que estamos acostumbrados los de occidente fue muy fuerte: las motos, el tráfico, el calor, la contaminación...asfixiante!! Pero a la vez bonito. Preciosos sus parques!"
50,“Mopeds über Mopeds”,"Wer keine Mopeds mag, der sollt hier nicht hingehen. Teilweise stinkt es schon erbärmlich von den 2-Taktern, aber der Charakter ist einfach nur klasse. Eine tolle Altstadt mit jeder Menge Geschäften und Restaurants."
10,“ハノイのショッピング”,2月の春節の後、5日に到着し、それから4日間滞在しました。旧正月のせいか、ほとんどのお店は閉まっていました。それでも空いているお店を見つけ、買い物をしました。品物に値札はなく、すべて言い値でそれから交渉です。小さなバックを8ドルと言われ、6ドルまで交渉し7つ買いました。それから、別のお店を覗くと何と3ドルで売っていました。頭にきて、そのお店に戻り、返品したいというと、（その間5分です）もう、オーナーがお金を取りに来たので、現金がない。と言われました。では、オーナーと交渉するから電話をして、と頼むとしてくれました。オーナーは、’あら、ごめんなさい。それではおまけにもうひとつ、もらってください’といわれました。私は、オーナーが認めたことなのでスカーフと袋を貰って帰りました。このように、買い物は相当大変です。数日後開いたほかのお店をみると、値段は嘘のようにみんな違っています。空港でベトナムドンを円から変えましたが、買い物はほとんどドル建てでドンの表示はなく、聞いてもレートはとても悪いです。そして、余ったドンは円にはホテルでさえ交換してくれません。街で使い切らないと空港の免税店でも使えないので、ただの紙切れになります。ドンの両替は最小限に。
50,“物価が安い！”,ハノイの町は、まさに西洋と東洋の融合です。活気がありとても刺激的です。物価が安く、エステやマッサージなどは特におすすめです。１時間ほどの全身エステが4000円くらいでした。テクニックも抜群、使用している化粧品もお肌にやさしかったです。食事も日本人の口に合うと思います。パクチーが苦手な方も多いと思うので、別添えでと一言かかえるとお料理に添えてだしてくれます。
50,“Vietnam-Rundreise”,"Hanoi hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Man kann sich mit einer Rikscha durch die Stadt fahren lassen. Ansehen sollte man sich das Wasserpuppentheater, welches am Altstadt-See liegt. Abends ist dort alles schön beleuchtet. Von dort aus wird auch abends eine Straße als Nightmarket umgebaut. Leider werden dort für Europäer weniger interessante Dinge angeboten. Der Literatur-Tempel ist eine größere Anlage in der Stadt, den man sich ansehen sollte. Ich meine, um 17.00 Uhr schließt aber die Anlage schon. Im Ho Chin Minh-Mausoleum waren wir nicht drin, den Platz davor haben wir uns aber angesehen. Im Vergleich zu Ho Chi Minh City hat mir Hanoi besser gefallen. Man merkt doch einen gewaltigen Unterschied zwischen einer 1000jährigen Stadt und einem neuen HCMC."
40,“Wie man es sich so vorstellt ....”,"Hanoi ist eine schoene Stadt und im Gegensatz zu Hoh Chi Mihn City etwas traditioneller.Der See und die Altstadt in der Stadtmitte sind typisch vitnamesisch und laden zum herrum laufen einfach nur so ein.Die Stadt ist auch der beste Ausgangspunkt fuer Touren nach Holang Bay oder Sapa im Norden von Vietnam.Vietnam Airlines unterhaelt taeglish dutzende Fluege nach Saigon und auch uberall anders hin. Ebenfalls bietet die Airline von ihrem Office einen Shuttle fuer wenig Geld direkt zum Airport an.ZU kaufen gibt es auch alles was man sich nur so vorstellen kann ... nicht immer legal ..... aber von der Qualitaet gar nicht mal so schlecht :)Und vor allem das Essen !!!!Kleiner Tipp noch, das Hoh Chi MIhn Museum ist kostenfrei, aber sehr stark frequentiert, daher was mehr Zeit einplanen ..."
20,“シクロとのトラブルに注意”,２０１１年の１月にハノイに行きました。水上人形劇のチケットを買うため宿泊したホテルそばからシクロに乗って行くことにしました。事前に料金を聞くと１５，０００ドン。ガイドブックで１ｋｍ１０，０００ドンからとあったので距離から見ても妥当だなと妻と２人では狭いなと思いましたがシクロに乗り込みました。行く途中写真を撮ってくれるというのでお願いして２枚ほど撮ってもらいました。目的地に着いたのでお礼の意味も込めて２０，０００ドンを渡すと怪訝な顔をしています。５０，０００ドンだと言いだし最後には１５０，０００ドンだと言う始末でした。この間１０分ほど。現地の人も集まってきてシクロの運転手に何か言っていました。最後、相手は５０，０００ドンで引き下がりましたが。ハノイ初日の朝からこの状況でしたのでうんざりしてしまいました。
30,“お金の単位に注意！！”,２０１１年元旦から３日までハノイに滞在しました。ノイバイ国際空港で日本円を両替しました。ベトナムに滞在中使用したのは紙幣のみで硬貨を見ることはなかったです。紙幣の種類は多く、また絵柄が似ています。使用していて大変だと思ったことは、ゼロの数が多く、例えば５００，０００ＶＮＤ（５０万ドン）なんていう紙幣もあります。代金を支払ったり、おつりをもらうときにはとても気を遣いました。またベトナム人の英語の発音は聞き取りにくく、５０ドルなのか１５ドルなのか聞いても非常に分かりにくいのでトラブルを避けるためのも筆談した方がいいです。
40,“ベトナムの首都”,活気に満ち溢れていました。公用語はベトナム語ですが、多くの場所で英語が通じました。フランス領だった名残があり、建物は可愛らしく、クロワッサンがとても美味しかったです。
40,“２年前のガイドブックが結構違っていました”,2008年にホーチミンに行き今回（2010年）ハノイに行きました。ガイドブックは２年前に購入したものをそのまま使いました。待ち歩きショッピングと何箇所かの観光地に行きましたが、観光施設の入場料がほとんど高くなっていました。水上人形劇場、戦争博物館・・・ベトナムの経済成長の一端を垣間見た気がしました。なかでも一番困ったのが病院の場所でした。妻の具合が悪くなったので病院に行きました。（ＳＯＳインターナショナル）　でもその場所には病院がなく郊外に移転したとのこと。あとで分かりましたが２０１０年７月に移転したそうです。ただ、移転前のビルのガードマンから無料タクシーチケットがもらえました。古いガイドブックを持っていかれる方はご注意ください。
50,“アジアにヨーロッパが程よくミックス”,ベトナムへはホーチミンとハノイの両方に行きましたが、ハホイのほうが治安はかなり良いように感じました。ハノイ観光で人気の伝統芸能、水上人形劇は見る価値があると思います。市内の有名な建築物はヨーロッパ式のものがほとんどですので、フランスの気分も味わえます。少し遠い（車で３時間程）ですが、ハノイに行かれたら、ぜひハロン湾まで足を伸ばしてください。ハロン湾のクルーズは景色が最高でした。食事はベトナム料理もフランス料理もはずれがなくどこの店でもおいしかったです。市内観光もオススメですが、歩くときは埃りっぽいので、マスクを着用されると良いと思います。宿泊は中級以上のホテルにされることをオススメします。
50,“Hanoi - die außergewöhnliche Hauptstadt Vietnams”,"Sc hon auf dem Weg vom Flughafen in die Hauptstadt Hanoi muß man sehr schnell erkennen, daß alle Vorbereitungen auf diese Reise in den Hintergrund treten und man sich in eine völlig andere Welt –mit anderen Spielregeln und anderen Gepflogenheiten – versetzt fühlt. Man kommt aus dem Staunen nicht heraus. Je näher man der Stadt kommt desto lärmender und intensiver wird der Straßenverkehr. Für unsere europäischen Vorstellungen ein völliges Chaos, mit kreuz- und quer fahrenden Autos, Fahrrädern und Mopeds .. Mopeds...Mopeds mit bis zu mindestens 3 Personen und meist noch beladen hinten und vorne mit Gemüse, Eiern und allem möglichen beladen für den Verkauf am Markt. Es gibt zwar Ampeln, aber es scheint so, daß sich niemand danach richtet. In großen Kreuzungen fährt alles aufeinander los, man biegt links oder rechts ab oder fährt geradeaus weiter, alles ohne Blinker oder Handzeichen zu geben und mittendrinn eine alte Vietnamesin mit mindestens einer langen Stand auf der Schulter vorne und hinten beladen mit Kostbarkeiten für den Markt. Aber alles löst sich in Wohlgefallen auf – es wird kaum geschimpft dafür aber gibt es ein wahnsinniges Hupkonzert. Wir haben keinen Unfall registriert!Der alte Stadtkern entfaltet seinen Reiz in alten Pagoden und Tempeln, prächtigen Kolonialbauten, die Straßen säumen mächtige Bäume und immer wieder findet man kleine Seen. Am Rand der großen Straßen, meist unter altem Baumbestand, hat ein Vietnamese seine Fahrrad-Werkstatt eingerichtet, oder der Friseur hat einen alten Spiegel am Baum befestigt und auf einem Stuhl sitzt sein Kunde, dem er gerade die Haare schneidet oder ihn rasiert. Die Gassen in der Altstadt sin d nach Handwerken benannte, so gibt es eine Hutgasse, oder Pfeiffengasse, in einer andere Gasse gibt es nur Seide, oder Bambus. Das Handwerk wird auf dem sog. Gehweg ausgeführt und der Strassenverkehr oder Fahrräder und Fußgänger teilen sich den Rest der Gasse um vorwärts zu kommen. Hoch interessant und aufregend ist eine Fahrt mit der Fahrrad-Rikscha mitten durch das Gewühle. Sehr interessant und schön anzusehen ist der „Ho Hoan Kiem (See) direkt im Herzen der Altstadt. In der Mitte des Sees befindet sich der Kleine „Schildkrötenturm“.Um diesen See und den Namen der Insel rankt sich ein Sage. Gegenüber des Sees findet man das berühmte„Wasserpuppen-Theater“ – unbedingt sehenswert. Auf den Märkten kann man alles kaufen. Die malerisch aufgebauten Obst- und Gemüsestände, Blumenstände und Gewürze verleiten zum Fotografieren. Es ist jedoch nicht erlaubt die Marktfrauen -ohne vorher zu fragen - zu fotografieren. Es gibt unzählige Sehenswürdigkeiten in und um Hanoi, diese alle aufzuzählen würde den Rahmen sprengen. Die Leute sind äußerst freundlich und sehr fleißig. Bei einem Vietnam- Urlaub sollte man einen Besuch von mehreren Tagen für Hanoi unbedingt einplanen."
20,“ハロン湾”,ベトナムのハロン湾クルーズ、物凄く期待して行って来たのだがとてもがっかりしてしまった。中国の桂林下りの後だからかもしれないが、写真で見るよりただ広くて、岩に名前が付いていて、鍾乳洞に入りでお終り。人により感じ方の違いが有るのかもしれないが、私の心に響くものはなかった。波は穏やかなのでランチクルーズには良いのかも知れない。あっと言う間のクルーズ季節により又違う顔を見せてくれるかもしれない、４月に行ったので、何方か、良い季節で感動した方がいらしたら口コミお願いします。
40,“のんびり自分のペースで過ごせます。”,ホーチミンほど都会ではなく、小さくて回りやすい街。ハロン湾ツアーをはじめ、いろいろなエクスカージョンがあるので、数日滞在しても飽きない街。もちろん美味しいレストランもたくさんありますよん。
40,“フランスとアジアの融合!!!”,今年の６月下旬に訪れました。市内観光あり、ショッピングあり、エステあり、ベトナム料理あり。大満喫でした!!!ちょっと歩いただけで岩盤浴状態^^;ではありましたが、東南アジアの熱気を充分体感できました。ショッピングも、ベトナムならではの地元市場(値切り交渉必須!）あり、欧米や日本資本のお店も沢山あるので、お洋服、アクセサリー、雑貨など、センスのよいお店が多く、楽しみ方も色々です。レストランも、ベトナム料理は勿論、フレンチ、イタリアン、イングリッシュパブ、ちょっとしたカフェなど、欧米系の観光客や駐在員をターゲットにしているお店も沢山あります。以前より衛生状態もよくなってきたように思いました。また国が豊かになってきたのか、執拗に物売りが追いかけてきたり、といった状況もありませんでした。日々進化するベトナムをまた必ず訪れたいと思います。
40,“ハノイ”,ハノイは昔城壁に囲まれていたこともあり、各所にわずかながら門が残っています。一柱寺はその独特の外観から多くの観光客や市民が訪れる場所です。ご存知のとおりベトナムは社会主義国であり、旧ソ連や中国がその首領を崇めて遺骸を保存しているように、ホーチミン廟ではベトナムの指導者ホーチミンの遺骸が保存されており、一見に値します。
50,“面白い”,個人旅行で４泊しました。１泊はハロン湾船上宿泊。３泊は旧市街宿泊。バイクの多さによる道路の横断のしにくさには参りました。夫婦旅行だったので主人の後にくっついて歩けばなんてことなかったのですが、結局一人で横断することは無かったです（しようと思わなかった）シルク商品、刺繍バック、アジア雑貨などに興味がある方は、楽しいショッピングができると思いますよ。
30,“首都 河内”,人多，尤其是在老城区，还剑湖附近，路很宰，显得很拥挤。摩托车多，川流不息，不过看到人过马路会绕开出租车宰客狠，尤其是那中两厢的像QQ的小车
40,“バイクに驚き”,空港からタクシーでホテルへ行く際、道路に牛が・・・そのうちハエのごときバイクの大群に驚かされます。ハノイ市内でもバイクはすごくだんだん楽しくなりますね。食べ物はフランスの影響もあり洗練されていると思います。フォーなど現地フードもほんと安くすごく楽しめました。
40,“Beeindruckende Metropole”,"Hanoi war der erste Stopp unserer Reise durch Vietnam. Und es war durchaus ein gewisser Kulturschock: Die Stadt ist überfüllt mit Millionen (!) von Mopeds und Verkehrsregeln gibt es anscheinend keine. Um die Strasse zu überqueren braucht man 1. Nerven, 2. Geschwindigkeit und 3. Glück! Ansonsten ist die Stadt jedoch sehr beeindruckend. Besonders sehenswert ist der Kult um das Mausoleum von Ho Chi Ming sowie das Kriegsmuseum. Sehr romantisch ist eine Rundfahrt um den See in einem Fahradtaxi - bitte aber erst am Abend wenn es weniger Verkehr gibt!"
30,“ハノイの事情”,ガイドブックを読んでいったので注意をしていたが、まさに自分の身にも起こったことが多い。まず空港からのバス、airport taxiは信用がおけて全部2ドル（ＵＳＡ　ＤＯＬＬＡＲ）と書かれていたが、インフォメーションで乗り場を聞いてそこに向かおうとすると、親切そうな人が案内をしてくれた。ガイドブックの写真とは異なる大型のバス、値段を聞くと４ドルという、それは違うと言って離れようとすると３ドルでよい、という。これはだまされると警戒して空港に戻りが警官の制服の人に乗り場を尋ねると、airport taxiなどは知らないという。公共バスの乗り場を教えてくれた。そのバスでもホテル近くにいけること、料金が2ドルであることを確認して乗った。降りたところでホテルまでのタクシーを捜していると英語ができるオートバイ運転手が2ドルでホテルまで乗せていくというのでで乗っていき到着したところで2ドル渡すと4ドルだという。約束は2ドルだと英語で言って2ドルだけ渡してホテルに飛び込んだ。おつりがないように空港で両替しておいたためうまくいった。言い忘れたが空港のＡＴＭで両替しようとしてカードを入れたところ、出てこなくなってしまった。このこともガイドブックに書いてあったが、かなり焦った。必死で英語ができる空港にいる警官のような人に事情を話しても通じず（英語がわからない人が多い）両替所の係員に言うとそのＡＴＭの銀行の窓口を教えてくれたのでそこに行ってＡＴＭをあけてもらいカードを手元に戻すことができホットした。空港についてからホテルに着くまでの間にこのようなことが起こったのだからベトナムの事情が如何なるものであるか、想像はつくであろう。日本の何十年か前の光景だということである。
30,“一碗河粉的差别”,"2010年3月,相约一行6人,3男3女从上海出发,展转到了河内.这个城市给我的第一印象,好似7-80年代的上海,从某种意义上说,还不如那时的上海来得繁华. 但有相似之处,毕竟一个曾是殖民地,一个曾是国外列强的租界地.我们到达河内已入夜,大家入住旅店安顿后,就外出觅食.由于才到,路不熟.大家觉得就在住处附近看看有什么好吃的.逛了一圈,周边也没什么象样的饭馆.只好来到了排挡摊,大家各自要了碗河粉.一问价格,好家伙,要我们差不多15人民币一碗.摆明了外来人士的差别待遇嘛.试想一个人均收入400-500人民币的城市,一碗路边摊的河粉要15元?看看周围在吃的一些越南人民,貌似不像有钱人,呵呵...大家都挺饿的,也没多做计较,都要了碗来吃。过后,我们结帐买单是,看到几个越南人掩嘴交谈并偷笑,虽然我们没听懂他们在讲什么,瞧那情景,应该是说,哈哈,中国人民,你们富起来了啊,那就多支援我们些吧..."
40,“偉大な方です”,商業都市である南のホーチミンに対して、政治の中心地であるハノイは観光というより企業ビジネス都市という感じを受けました。高級レストランや接待用のラウンジ（キャバクラ）がたくさんありパンフレットにもたくさんの広告が出ています。感動したのは建国の父であるホーチミンのおじさんが冷凍保存されていて参拝できるという事です。海外の観光客は優先的に入場できますが、ベトナム人は3時間くらい並んでやっと入れるそうです。戦時中、国民のほとんどの人が会うことも見ることもできなかったからだそうです。政府要人も含めてすべての国民に尊敬されているそうです。穏やかな顔で国民を愛していたというのが表情に出ていました。（短パンは入れませんので、小奇麗にしていって下さい。）
40,“ホーチミンより治安がいいので安心”,ホーチミンとハノイ両方行ったのですが、ハノイの方が治安が良く、夜などもそんなに危険ではないと思います。お店も１０時近くまで空いていますし、繁華街は人も多いので安心して遊べます。少し心配な人はタクシーを使っても、かなり安いのでお勧めです。街自体が大きくなく、コンパクトなので回りやすいとも思います。
30,“摩托车，摩托车，到处都是摩托车”,越南不愧是摩托车的王国，到处都是摩托车，一条窄窄的马路，我愣是过了20分钟，人很多，建筑都不是很高，毕竟是号称比中国落后将近20年的地方，去的话，期望值不要太高，一些设施肯定不能和国内相比的，总体就是到此一游。
50,“Mijn favoriete plaats tot nu toe in Vietnam.”,"Ik ben nu 2 x naar Hanoi geweest in Vietnam via --- en heb een werkelijk fijne en interessant verblijf in en in de wijde omgeving van Hanoi gemaakt. Binnenkort gan ik een reis maken van Hanoi naar Saigon, ook met dezelfde organisatie.Ik zet mijn reisverslagen over mijn Vietnam en andere reizen op internet.Ik vind het fijn om weer voor de derde maal terug te kerern naar Vietnam.Vietnam = Veelzijdig."
40,“一个值得去的国家和城市”,越南是一个离我们很近的国家，河内是一个又有欧式味道，又有社会主义色彩的城市，在他的旅游街区有很多舒适的小店买一些特色的东西作为礼物很不错，也有很多特色的小餐厅，环境很好，物价不高，充分感受到人民币升值的好处，全民英语很少有人会完整的汉语，人民币倒是可以通用！
30,"“Hanoi, kann man, muss man aber nicht gesehen haben...”","Eine quirlige Stadt, in einem - immer noch - kommunistisch geführten Land, wo nur langsam die Privatwirtschaft ankommt.Viel Verkehr, hauptsächlich mit Mopeds und Fahrrädern, sehr laut, mit viel Gehupe und ohne Verkehrsregeln."
30,“ハノイの旅行会社を使うとき！”,初めてハノイに行ってきました。旧市街地は，中国桂林のヨウサクなみの外人だらけで，すっかり価格も高騰しています。当然ベトナム語が話せないので，英語の通じるトラベル会社でチケットなど頼むのですが，これは気をつけないと，危ないです。以下，ご注意ください。①価格は税込みかどうか確認すること。②バス亭，もしくは，空港・駅までの送迎方法・費用を確認すること③チケット受け取り方法を確認すること。④US$で見積もりを受けたら，VT$にする際のレートを確認すること⑤最後に一番大事なことですが，数件の旅行会社をまわって，条件を確認して比較することですね！以上ご参考まで！！
40,“金、土、日はナイトマーケットへ”,週末だけ開かれるナイトマーケットがあります。雑貨や服飾、アクセサリーなどなど、いろんなものが売っていて見てるだけでも楽しいです。普段はバイクがいっぱい通っている道ですが、このときは歩行者天国になります。
40,“国際空港から、少し走ればそこには牛が・・・”,ホーチミンほどバイクも多くなく、静かないいところでした。成田から到着し、バスで市内へ向かいましたが、少し走ればあたりには牛の姿が見られるという、およそ一国の首都とは思えない光景が広がっておりました。到着した日の夜には、夜行列車でフエに向かいましたが、駅も列車ものんびりムードでした。アジアの列車ということで、中国並みの状況を勝手に想像していた自分にはある意味、拍子抜けといった感じでした。
20,“ホーン鳴りっぱなし”,バイクの量がすごい。センターラインが無く、対向車がいなければ道いっぱいに使い追い越しする。車のドライバーもバイクのライダーも警音器（ホーン）を鳴らしっぱなし。指がホーンボタンから離れない。３人乗り、４人乗りは普通。生後数ヶ月と思われる赤ちゃんも抱っこしてライディング。街が埃っぽいせいかマスクは必需品。店頭でもオシャレ？なものが並んでいました。
40,“ベトナムのいいところ”,典型的なアジアです。バイクが多く、活気があります。食べ物はアジアの料理が好きな人にとってはすごくおいしいです（パクチーが苦手な方は残念なことになります）。しかも、安くてヘルシーです。見た目にはおしゃれな感じはありませんが。ハノイだけしか行っていませんが、ハロン湾は幻想的ですごくきれいでした。でも、なんといってもベトナムの魅力はショッピングです。安くてかわいい雑貨がたくさんあり、見ているだけでもすごく楽しくなります。また行きたいと思っています。ただ、バイクが多いせいか空気が汚いので、マスクを持参することをおすすめします！
30,“ハノイでの交通手段”,私も初ハノイでしたので交通手段には悩みました。。。旅行前には様々な場面を想定して出かけたのですが、とりこし苦労でした。ハノイはタクシー、バイクタクシー、シクロと大体３種類の交通手段があります。旧市街散策なら、ひたすら歩くのもいいでしょう。徒歩圏内である事は間違いありません。タクシーも旧市街内であれば日本円であれば約１５０円くらい。これが一番安全かな？よく、ぼられたとかの話がありますが、私の友人がそうでしたが約１０００円のものです。そういうのは、「日本税」として仕方のないことと割り切った方が、せっかくの旅行が台無しになる気がします。バイクタクシーですが現地の人はこれを利用します。一番安価です。が、事故が怖いです。ものすごい走りをします。事故を考えると？です。次にシクロですが、これが一番高価ですが一番優雅です。大体一時間あたり約５００円くらいです。私の場合はこのシクロを利用しました。ホテルのフロントでお願いしてドライバーと直接交渉です。ここで大事な事は「チップ込み」で契約する事です。これを足がわりに行きたいショップやレストランのハシゴをしました。まあ、ご参考までに。。。。
50,“ベトナムは人間が面白い”,ハノイはベトナムの首都。でも、南部のホーチミンが経済の中心なのに対して、政治の中心部だけあって、ホーチミンよりも統制が取れているように思う。旧市街をめぐっていると、お菓子やさん横丁。荒物屋ばかりの通り、墓石どおりなど町全体でひとつのデパートみたいな感じ。みんなよく働いているから、見ていて気持ちがいい。特に女性はよく働きます。食事は安くておいしい。とくに日本人には味が似ているから、とっつきやすいと思います。おすすめの都市です。
40,“ＵＳドルが使えない！”,４年前にホーチミンへ旅行したときには町の至る所でＵＳ＄とベトナムドンが使用できました。今回も同じベトナムの首都と言うことで、ＵＳ＄を主にベトナムドンは２人で２０００円のみ空港で両替しました。実際に各観光施設や飲食店など殆どがベトナムドンしか使えず、ガイドブックも含めて騙されました。空港タクシーとホテル以外ドルは使えないと思った方が良いです。ハノイへ行かれる方は空港で日本円から直接ベトナムドンに両替することをお勧めします。
40,“ホーチミンよりは好き”,旧市街のホテルに泊まって、そこの周辺しか歩いていませんが、通りごとに専門の店が固まっていて、それをみて歩くだけでもなかなか楽しかったです。銀製品の通り、ブリキの通り、おもちゃの通り、バッグの通り…電卓の通りまでありました。（さすがに３、４店舗だけですが）意外と困るのが、コンビニがないことです。水やコーラを買うのも一苦労です。もし町を歩いていて水やコーラ、ビールを売っている商店を見つけたら覚えておきましょう。バイクの排気ガスがかなりきついので、のどの弱い人、体調の悪い人はマスクをして出歩いた方がいいでしょう。自分はのどをやられてそのまま風邪を引いてしまいました。タクシーを使ったのですが、ホテルの名前を聞き間違えたのか全然違う方向へ行ってしまって（旧市街は一方通行が多いので迂回してるのかと思った。）料金の支払いでちょっともめました。基本ですが行き先ははっきりと確かめようと思いました。またホアンキエム湖の周りを歩いていて、疲れたのでホテルまでシクロを使いました。支払いの段になって例によって最初の交渉と金額が一桁違うと言い出しましたが（数百メートルで1500円だと言い張る）無視して最初の交渉通りの金額をつかませバイバイ。ベトナムの一桁違う詐欺はもはや伝統芸能の域で、とりあえず言っとけみたいな感じで言ってきますが、まともに取り合うと疲れるので、ほっといて適当な額を渡しましょう。撃退方法としては「じゃあUSドルではいくらなの？」が有効です。ホアンキエム湖は意外とおすすめスポットです。のんびりぼんやりするにはぴったり。地元の人も普通にくつろいでますよ。あとチェーとシントーはおいしいし安いので毎日食べましたね。最後にノイバイ空港で食べたバインミー（フランスパンのサンドイッチ）がうまくて、もっと町中で食べとけばと後悔。帰りにホテルからノイバイ空港までの移動、早朝だしボッタクリタクシーに当たったら面倒だなーと思っていたら、ハロン湾ツアーで使ったAPTトラベルのチラシに送迎プラン17ドル（ちなみに空港からハノイ市街地まではエアポートタクシーが一律15ドル）を見つけてそれにしました。普通に無口なお兄さんが（一度もクラクションを鳴らすことなく！）カローラで送ってくれました。帰国時に無用なトラブルを避けたい方はおすすめだと思いますよ。
40,“ノスタルジックな雰囲気のハノイ”,ホーチミンより暑くなく、人もさっぱりとしたかんじがしました。（バイクタクシーなどしつこい勧誘がない）街角のふつうの食堂がおいしかったです。旧市街はおもちゃや文具、金物などいろんなものが売っていて見ているだけでも楽しかったです。はんこもここで作りました。お気に入りです。
40,“バイク天国”,バイクのクラクションが鳴り響く音で朝が始まり、東南アジアの町だな、という印象。バスに乗って観光していたこともあり、思ったほど空気の悪さは感じませんが、街歩きをする時はマスクは必須かと思います。
40,“タイ湖”,この冬に2度目のハノイに行ってきました。ハノイのいいところは、特別な観光スポットはなくとも静かな雰囲気を楽しめるところだと思っていましたが、残念ながらかなり交通量が増え、“のんびり”という感じではなくなっていまいした。で、なるべく市内から離れたいと思いましたが、日程のこともあり、とりあえずはタイ湖周辺へ。バイタクで片道３００００ドンで行きました。道路にはやはり車が多いけれど、湖の周辺はゆっくりできます。
30,“ホワンキエム湖”,ハノイの市内にある湖、ホワンキエム湖。湖の真ん中には亀の塔があり、現地人の憩いの場になっている。湖沿いにはいくつかのカフェやレストランもあり、非常に過ごしやすい。ハノイに行った際は是非立ち寄っていただきたい観光地です。
30,“Dépaysement garanti”,"Hanoi est une ville étonnante. Pour mon deuxième séjour, à 6 ans d'écart, les changements sont visibles surtout au niveau de la circulation.Trop intense dangereuse et sans réel code de la route. Du coup chaque conducteur deux roues ou voiture utilisent sans arrêt les klaxons, c'est épuisant pour les piétons.De la circulation il n'est absolument pas rare de voir des voitures allemandes et même quelques voitures de grand luxe comme des Porches. Du coup les paysans avec leurs vélos chargés comme il est impensable de le voir chez nous, sont de plus en plus rares.Les taxis ne comprennent pas toujours où vous souhaiterez vous rendre, privilégiez les taxis qui ont des partenariats avec les hôtels, cela vous évitera du stress.Une petite anecdote : j'ai pris un taxi en revenant de Halong pour rejoindre l'aéroport. Il m'a dit oui mais en réalité il n'avait rien compris et pire il ne savait pas où se trouvait l'aéroport de Hanoi !!! Pourtant ce sont des vietnamiens de confiance qui lui ont demandé de faire la course. Extrêmement anxiogène quand on se retrouve je ne sais où, sans pouvoir se faire comprendre.Il faut compter environ 350 000 dong Hanoi ville/aéroport. (1 Euro = 22 500 Dong).Les rue ne sont pas parfaitement propres mais de réels efforts sont fait. Les femmes sont chargées du nettoyage à la nuit tombée, j'ai rarement vu un homme faire ce travail.Les inégalités s'accroissent visiblement. Les vols se multiplient et j'en ai fait l'expérience dans la rue avec un ou une pickpocket, mon appareil photo a disparu... et fouille de mes bagages à l'aéroport ou quelqu'un a pris mon téléphone portable. Évitez de porter des montres ou autres bijoux pour ne pas tenter les voleurs.La campagne est toujours aussi belle, ses rizières verdoyantes où apparaissent les chapeaux pointus des paysannes qui travaillent les pieds dans l'eau. les buffles tirant les charrues ou des charrettes d'un autre temps.La nourriture est très parfumée, les soupes délicieuses et le riz parfaitement cuit !!Un vrai changement ce voyage au Vietnam, je le recommande."
10,“ノイバイ空港免税店のボッタクリに注意！”,先週観光でハノイを訪れた際ノイバイ空港を利用しました。その時免税品店の中にある「NOIBAI SOUVENIOR」という店でリッツクラッカーと缶ビール、缶ジュースを買いました。リッツは1.5ドルと値札が付いてありましたが、ビールなどは値段も確認しませんでした。。すると「12ドル」と言うのでありえないと思いながらも空港ということもあり支払ってしまいました。ところが、その後行った店では同じビールが2ドル、ジュースは1.5ドルで売られているではありませんか。引き返して文句を言うと無視するので、他の客に聞こえるよう大声で叫ぶと渋々6ドルと少しのドンを返してきました。若い女性店員二名ですが心の荒んだ連中です。ちなみにこの店のことは空港警備関係者にも通報しましたが、かれらも「ああ、ボッタクリか」程度の認識しかないようで、真剣に調べる様子などは見受けられませんでした。皆さんお気をつけください。
