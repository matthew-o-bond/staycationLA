10,Never never never again!!!!!,"I booked 2 nights, one before my international flight and one on the way home. The first bad thing I dealt with is the shuttle stops running at 10. I had to purchase an Uber. My shower after flying for 17 hours was broken, and when they changed my room the other barely worked either. I arrived at 10:30am for a 12:30pm flight within the states. The desk lady forgot to call the shuttle guy. When we finally left at 11:30am he went to get gas and pick up a crew member at baggage. He was very rude to me and said I had plenty of time. He was 100% incorrect. I missed my flight home which was clear across the country. I had to wait and wait to go standBy on another flight. I did make it home but it was a horrible experience. When I called the hotel back upon my arrival at home, the front desk manager said I was lying. Really?? Are you serious?? How can THE CORPORATE RAMADA BRAND keep their name on this hotel??",Lauren B
40,"Used to go there, when they had the Hawthorne Air Show..","Smile, took my little one..to get some breakfast there. The waitress that was waiting on our table really made my daughter feel like a queen...with the whipping cream on her waffles as a smiling face. Very cute lol. ( please forgive me that i had to mark Sept. 2015,because there is no later date than this one given.)",Dale M
50,Best Museum in Hawthorne,"This place is outstanding, with excellent displays of yesteryear in Hawthorne. They serve great coffee. Lots of old geezers sitting around and very friendly as they live in the past. When you are in Hawthorne, by all means take in this museum. A great place to take children and youngsters. Mafia members and other crooks have a special display here. Go see it sometime for a real flavor of Hawthorne life.",Lorenzo O
40,Museum in the Beach Boys' Hometown,"We visited Hawthorne, mainly to see the sites where the Wilson brothers hung out, and we were steered to the museum for some memorabilia. There are a number of books, pictures and such, but I think this museum could do a bit more to honor America's band. Like maybe a bigger display area. It was nice to get the feel of Hawthorne as we walked along some of the streets near the museum. Made me very nostalgic.",cynsha
