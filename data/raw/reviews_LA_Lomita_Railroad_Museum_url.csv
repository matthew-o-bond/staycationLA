50,A Detailed Historical Surprise,Stopped numerous times when they were closed. Finally got there when they were open. It's an interesting history of both full size and hobby size steam railroading. Children do quickly get board but my wife and I read and studied every display.

40,A Fun Way to Spend a Couple of Hours,"Most railroad museums are built on old existing stations or railroad facilities, but the Lomita Railroad Museum is built from scratch on a residential street in the South Bay. Not to worry, because, despite its size, it's a serious railroad museum, with a steam locomotive and tender, two cabooses (one of which has great exhibits in its own right), a boxcar, and a tank car. There is ample parking and the admission fee is a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamespJ4477IT
40,Great Little Place to Visit,"We went with our Young Family to the RailRoad Museum. Yes, we are both very keen on railways - but even the young children enjoyed clambering around the engine footplate and the two caboose.

40,Great Little Railroad Museun,"A bit off the beaten track but very much worth a visit if you’re in the LA or Long Beach Area this is a small museum with a lot to offer. There is lots of parking outside and entry is via a small secure gate where you press a buzzer for the gate to be released. The museum building takes the form of an old railroad depot and has a wealth of artefacts on display. Particularly interesting are the miniature locomotives that used to be manufactured on site. The main exhibits are out side though and include a full size steam engine where you can climb up into the cab, complete with all the right noises as if the locomotive was speeding along. There is also a caboose to explore and see what life was like riding in one of these vehicles. As well as the main site, just across the road are a couple of freight cars and the other side of the park is another caboose to explore. It’s all done really well and packs so much into a small space. The staff were also extremely friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc

I should have brought a picnic lunch to eat at the open park across the street with my son, next time. The museum was $4 for adults and $2 for kids and had a museum gift shop inside. It's good for about 1-2 hour visit just walking around enjoying the sunny day. We found plenty of free parking and there were only about 4 other visitors there when we were there.

40,Small Museum That Tries Hard,"I made a trip to Lomita just to see the Railroad Museum after it was mentioned in the AAA's WESTWAYS magazine. This is a very small museum that tries to be much more than it is. I was surprised at how small it is. There is an attractive train depot that serves as a small museum and gift shop. Outside are two trains--a dining car and a steam engine. If you love trains, as I do, it is fun to walk through the dining car and to climb up to the engine and see the controls. The attraction is very small and not worth a special trip to Lomita. Of course, if you are in the area, why not stop by?There are two train cars in the small park across the street from the museum and another car in the vacant lot next to the museum. I imagined the small plot will give the museum a chance to grow. There is train memorabilia in the train depot museum but most of the displays are minimal. There are better train museums around but of course, this is the only one in Lomita. I give the museum high grades for having an attractive facility in a small plot of land wedged in around apartment buildings.This museum could be so much more but it is limited by the available space. They've made the depot look so nice and if you never get a chance to enter a train, here is your chain. Again, this attraction is small and I was disappointed that I used a chunk of a vacation day to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
