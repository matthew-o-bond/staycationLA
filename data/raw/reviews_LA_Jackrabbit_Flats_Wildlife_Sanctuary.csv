30,Take a Walk in the High Desert,"Jackrabbit Flat(s): 114 acres of creosote bush scrub, desert chaparral, joshua trees and, alas, people's discards. During early spring, however, Jackrabbit Flats has lots of wildflowers, plus blooming cholla and beavertail cactus.Sometimes it's nice just to be able to walk around in the desert without trespassing, even if people leave their trash lying around (bring a garbage bag and pick some up, if you want to help tidy up.) For several more desert ""sanctuaries,"" look up the LA County Parks and Recreation website, and use the dropdown Parks --> Wildlife Sanctuaries at the bottom of the page.",SoCalRambler
