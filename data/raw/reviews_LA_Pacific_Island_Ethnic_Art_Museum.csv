50,What a gem!,"This small museum is the only place in the US where I've seen YAP money displayed. So check out the adjacent garden that's included with admission and where you'll also find rare ancestral figures as many were incorrectly seen as idols and thus destroyed. Inside there is one room with rotating exhibits that includes at least one heritage item per section. On site, usually on weekends, is an artist in residence. There's a small gift corner where we bought an unique handloomed textile very reasonably. Enjoy!",GlobalGypsy_13
50,Wendy,"This museum is small but mighty, a true jewel. I was on the last day of an LA trip before returning to my home on the Big Island of Hawaii. My daughter, who now lives in LA, and I were lucky to visit on the last week of the tattoo exhibit. We enjoyed the diverse representation of tattoo styles from many different Pacific island groups. There was a good range of historical and modern tattoo styles with clear explanations for all photos and artfacts. Fran was so knowledgeable, full of aloha, and we learned so much from her. Mahalo Fran! The museum also sells books, shirts and other gift items. Any traveler who really wants to learn about Pacific island cultures from a pono and respectful viewpoint should visit PIEAM. We stayed for almost 2 hours. Iâ€™m telling my family and friends to visit PIEAM if they get the chance.",BigIslandWendy
50,"Small, But Interesting","Even though the size of the museum makes it seem a bit overpriced, there are many interesting artifacts inside, and don't miss the ""backyard"" exhibit outside.",Fearless730216
20,A Very Brief Glimpse of Pacific Island Culture,See it all in 15 minutes. You can learn a few things and see some indigenous art. Some pretty hibiscus outside in the sculpture garden.,PasadenaJane
50,Small but very cool,"If you have any interest in Pacific Islander art, including Palauan story boards, latte stones, etc. you will enjoy this museum. It is small, but very cool.",Emily C
40,"Hidden gem, thanks Dr. Robert Gumbiner","Great treat to find arts and crafts from Pacific Islands in Long Beach. Wood carvings, some textiles, stone work give a briefest taste of the marvelous art and artistry of a little know area. Many of the items are from the collection of Dr. Gumbiner. I hope they expand the collection and add more commentary. Riches to be discovered here!",JWP8
40,Great Little Museum,"Long Beach has a great Pacific Islander community. And, one of the very few Pacific Islander Museums in all of Southern California. While it may be small, it is curated wonderfully and speaks to the local community and its rich history.",Alexander_Designs
50,In small things,"This newly opened museum is based on the collection made by Dr. Robert Gumbiner. This small store front museum consists of a video room, a tatoo corner where someone was getting a tatoo while we were there, stunning objects, and a sculpture garden with wood sculptures and stone Yap money. Admission for seniors is only $3.00, and quite reasonable if you combine your visit with free Target Sundays at the Museum of Latin American Art across the street that was founded 20 years ago by the same collector.",GlobalGypsy_13
20,not worth the price of admission,This place is very small. There is not a lot to see and when I went the person who was working was not very friendly. I only went once and will probably never go back. It would be better to visit the Museum of Latin American Art which is across the street. That Museum is also free to visitors on Sundays.,JuanitaB0nita
40,"Tiny place, but you can learn much","This museum is smaller than most. It sits in the median of converging busy streets. While you can see most art pieces and view the videos within 2 hours, it's possible to take away information about the diverse cultures of the Pacific Islands that you probably will not have learned elsewhere. The art collection is mostly the private collection of the founder. The staff is very knowledgable about what pieces they have. Tours are available. Better for older kids (teens) than younger. Park across the street at MOLAA for free.",chgo919
