50,Great historical ship!,"Lane Victory is one of only three surviving Victory ships, and she is a fascinating example of a merchant marine vessel from a different era.For an admission fee of only $7 you can access most areas of the ship, including two interesting and informative museum display areas packed with artifacts and information.The staff are all volunteers and you can tell they love the ship and are doing their best to preserve her and assist visitors, but she is a little rough in spots. So come out and support this great old ship and the people who take care of her!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9001YLwilliamm
40,S.S. Lane Victory Cargo Ship Really Floats,"There is a lot of history in the lower deck of this ship docked in San Pedro. It is named after Isaac Lane, an African-American Church planter of the 1880’s. One delightful thing about this ship is that unlike the Iowa Battleship which moored two miles away, this ship is tied by ropes to the dock. Therefore, it floats and moves with the harbor waves. At first, I thought it was a side effect of some pain medicine I took! However, my fiancé said she felt the ship rocking back and forth too. That made the tour all that more realistic.The down to earth ship’s cook Bobby took a group of us around the ship with great tips about the service of this historic ship museum. We especially liked the conning tower and the inner workings of the ship.We suggest you call ahead before visiting because this ship still is used for filming special events and civic documentaries just as it was during its heyday as you will learn.A side feature of that area is the weekend free hop on, hop off red bus that takes you through several interesting places around San Pedro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
40,Enjoyed the visit,"After all my life living in the Greater Los Angeles are and seeing the resent addition of the Battleship USS Iowa docked in Long Beach I found another ship that has been here for 30 years, the S.S. Lane Victory. The Lane Victory was a Merchant Marine ship which served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War ""was well as in times of peace as part of the merchant fleet."" ""Now a nationally recognized historic landmark, the S.S. Lane Victory serves as a living museum and memorial to the service and sacrifices of all Merchant Marine sailors and Navy Armed Guardsmen."" I never realized how much support the Merchant Marines gave to the war effort protecting our country. I nice thing about visiting this ship museum is that you can do it at your own pace looking at all the open areas of the ship and spending as much or as little time you want. The ship was divided into two parts, one area for the Navy Guardsmen and the other part for the Merchant Marines and naturally the large cargo areas. I was amazed that the Merchant Marines did not get veterans benefits. I don't know and wonder if they received any benefits? I highly recommend taking time to visit this ship museum and learn about another part of our defense we don't hear much about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormKeith
50,"Well Preserved Ship, Staffed by Good People","I had the pleasure of visiting the Lane Victory about 2002, when my Grandfather Bob was still around and a dedicated volunteer (Engine Room, Oiler). We put on boiler suits and did some painting :)He sat on a similar ship loaded with artillery shells during the Battle of Leyte, PI and they watched the Kamakaze planes crash into other ships feeling fear, sorrow and desperately hoping they wouldn't be next.Visiting the Lane will bring the living conditions, the technology--and the fear--that our brave WW2 generation lived with while serving their country.I have my Grandfather's WW2 Merchant Marine Victory Medal, his Wartime Shipping Administration Transit Slips for a dozen round the world voyages and his US Coast Guard Certificates. I value these so much. But I tell you, I would gladlythrow it all into the sea and never look back for just one more chance to walk with him aboard the Lane Victory.Next time I get to the west coast I will take my children and tell them about thier brave grandfather and his comrades. I highly recommend you read a little bit on this and bring YOUR children to the Lane Victory before these things fade into our history forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralphbD757MZ
30,It was closed and not on website,I was super excited to visit and that was short lived once we got there. I understand there is special events for production. The boat is used all the time just upset because I bought tickets to go and unable to go due to it being closed until Monday. Please make sure to call if you are traveling far,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shilobeagle2017
50,VERY INTERESTING SHIP WITH LOTS OF HISTORY,"This museum has many stories to tell from the shipyard where it was built to the Hollywood movies and TV shows that are filmed on board the SS Lane Victory. The ""Gangway Watchman"" Chips Chiappinelli who was in the Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944 told us all about the signal flags and what to see on the ship. We wondered all through the museums which have many interesting exhibits about the Victory-class ships. I gave this museum 5 stars because it represents an important part of our history. There are only two of these ships left of the nearly 500 that were produced. Take time to read about the California Shipbuilding Corp. That is an amazing story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielM19932
40,Part of history,Visit the S.S. Lane Victory in San Pedro and learn about a key part of the U.S. vistory in World War II.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,A ship with small Museum,Always love to tour old war ships. Lane Victory is well preserved and fun to explore. The Museums had tons of displays and info which would take days to read and see. My wife enjoyed the jeeps up close. This is not free admission as some web sites might claim. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raroboy
50,History comes alive,"If you have an interest in ships, boats, WW II, the Korean war or history - this is a great place to spend a few hours. You can get thru most of the ship on your own, and if lucky get a guided tour of the engine room. Two holds have been made into museums, with lots of information and photos and exhibits. Soda vending and restrooms, no food. Open most days but check the website for schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
50,Interesting and educational visit,"A well preserved 1945 cargo vessel . I had a great guide in Dave who showed round the bridge and engine room and explained everything about the ships history , especially the moving story of the rescue of the Koran refugees in 1950 .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffb21
50,Very Interesting & Informative,"It's easy to overlook this well-preserved World War II cargo ship near the USS Iowa. In fact, I understand it used to be parked where the Iowa is. Many interesting exhibits and you can wander around almost the whole ship. The exhibits are roomy, well explained and not at all condescending. It's also not usually crowded and it's a good place just to hang out for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binks79
50,Great museum ship,"A piece of history. Really nice preserved for an over 70 year old cargo ship. Almost like a liberty ship just with a stem turbine instead of a steam engine. Loved it. If you like history or old engineering milestones, it is a must visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863ludgerh
50,Another place to experience naval history,"S.S. Lane Victory is the last of the WWII Victory-class cargo ships left. It tells the story of how Merchant Mariners and Naval Armed Guards kept the supply lifelines to Europe and the Pacific moving during WWII. The ship is open from the engine room to the bridge. There are two very informative museums located in cargo holds.I was also very pleasantly surprised to discover that the steam engine used in the filming of the movie ""The Sand Pebbles"" is located onboard. It was very cool to see it.It is located just down the street from USS Iowa and both ships can be thoroughly visited on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/namsman
50,"interesting, informative, great info","I am always happy with an old ship - the people who volunteer are invariably fonts of information and they so much appreciate your interest / which was the case here. I spent at least 90 minutes and could have stayed longer. The merchant marines who served were invaluable to our victory in WWII, and when you consider the casualty rate of these folks - wow. I hope there is always enough interest and support to keep these important vessels afloat, in good order.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,For anyone who had family in the Merchant Marines!,"We loved our tour of the SS Lane Victory. It is a World War II supply ship. These boats sailed the seas during the wars to bring supplys to the frontlines and the military around the world. They were protected by a few guns manned by Navy Gunner's Mates. Most of these shipped were torpedoed and sunk and only a few remain to this day and very few are still in operational condition like the SS Lane Victory. Onboard you may tour the bridge, chartroom, radio room, and state rooms as well as the cargo holds. The cargo holds contain two museums, worth the visit all by themselves. Tours are self guided, however if you ask, we found volunteers willing to take us pretty much wherever we wanted to see and tell us about it. In fact, one of the greatest thing about this boat is that many of the volunteers are, in fact, WWII aged sailors who lived through those days and can relate many first hand stories. It's truly an honor just to meet these guys.From the Harbor Freeway (110) at Harbor Blvd, drive south following the signs to Berth 49 (SS Lane Victory). Harbor Blvd becomes Miner Street. Continue until Minor ends at a large parking lot, and you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreeleyJoe
50,Merchant Marine Museum,"World War II could not have been won if supplies could not have provisioned the armies and navies. Merchant mariners and ships accomplished this mission. The Lane is the last survivor of over 60 AP2 7600grt freighters built in 1944-45 for the war effort. It is a tremendous example of that period technology, a historical artifact. You take a self guided tour, unfortunately the bridge and engine room are off limits. It would have been nice if there were more guides, but the ship is manned entirely by volunteers. There is a merchant marine exhibit in one of he holds. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9861YPtoms
40,Historic Ship - SS Lane Victory,"We visited the SS Lane Victory in the Port of Los Angeles. The SS Lane was built in the LA area in 1945 (World War II). The SS Lane Victory served during World War II, The Korean War, and the Vietnam War as well as in times of peace as part of the merchant fleet.There is an interesting museum on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,Great stop for any History Buff,It's a nice museum ship and the efforts of the Merchant marines who delivered supplies on these victory ships is portrayed in a wonderful way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemountg
50,Ships,"If you are into ships, military ones, than this is the place to go. I have been reading ""Destroyermen"" series, and it was hard to picture living on a ship. This ship had it all and i could feel and relate to my book much better. Its huge! Kids would get a little bored, but the turrets and missile launchers will get their attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/542abej
40,History - alive and well,The Lane Victory is the only sailable WW2 supply ship in operation. It was used to supply the allies (Great Britain) during World War 2. It is manned and outfitted completely by volunteers (always in demand) and has a great museum with newspaper articles from that period. Every person (in particular the young) should take a tour of this extremely interesting and living piece of history. Wear walking shoes and long pants to navigate the steep stairwells and narrow entrances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodismyvice
50,A one-of-a-kind cruise,"The ship is well worth visiting while it is berthed, but it is far better to go on one of its cruises if you can. In years past the ship has offered day cruises in the summertime, which are simply unforgettable. On a cruise ship, you're in a floating hotel. Not on the Lane Victory. This was a working ship, and you can get the whole experience. Unlike on a cruise ship, you can go virtually anywhere you want on the Lane Victory. You can go in the engine room, on the bridge, in the captain's quarters, in the radio room, in the crew's quarters, in the cargo hold - you name it. It's really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hiker01Cypress_CA
50,History into the Future,TREAT A WWII OR VIETNAM VETERAN... IT WILL MAKE THEIR YEAR!This World War II Merchant Marine vessel is the last of its kind that is ocean certified. In fact the non profit organization that operates the ship as a museum usually hosts 3 ocean cruises per year where they recreate the past for a full day cruise in the Catalina Channel of the Coast of Southern California. Guns blazing as World War II vintage airplanes attack the ship! A great buffet style lunch was always a treat! If you enjoy history take this full day trip out to sea or just stop by and tour the on board museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926eds
50,"Very interesting place, too bad did not get a chance to cruise with her","Utility information for those who may have special needs:This place has bathroom. Unlike some big ship. Yay. I am looking at you, IOWA.Not wheel chair accessible except for some part of the deck.Stairs are steep in most cases (also narrow).First thing first, this is a place for those who really like navy/ww2 stuff, therefore if you are not a fan of such (not an enthusiasts to be honest), don't mark this place on your plan. (although the scenery view around this place is oaky. Well, just oaky).However, if you are , to some extent, greatly interested in this ship (provided that you have some basic knowledge about it), then continue reading the review. Otherwise go check out somewhere else.The reason I give this a 5 out of 5 is (I prefer 10-points scale, just saying) 3 points for its value, 1 points for the tour guide (my family is the only tour group in that ship at that time, so I assume the tour guide is not something that happens all the time. But in the other hand, not many people go to place.) and 1 more points for its surprisingly large amount of displaying collection.This ship is still functional and cruise every summer (not for 2014, it was under repair and maintenance).So if you are going to LA at the summer, consider it. The ship also has a lot chambers which you can go in and immersing into your imagination which takes you about 70 years back (Gosh, I zoned out again). and on each walk ways you can see the placards which contains the info of the its lost sister ships (some are not the Victory model, so distant cousin ships) and those who scarified along. There are also two large chambers below the deck which stores a lot collection for display. Be sure two visit both location.Since this ship is a cargo ship, it has been widely used across the globe during the war time (including Korean war), which resulted in large amount records of ration supplied to each places and how they affected the war or wear affected by the war. Really vivid demonstration of its usefulness, and a great aspect of learning the history. It also has some information about the path of cargo ship development.I walk around the ship for about 3 hours, and not get bored at all. (if it is not because they are going to close, I will stay longer) This place worth at least two hours of your time. Plan ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/landey9g
50,A fitting tribute to US Seamen,"The directions to the ship are easy to follow and visit did not disappoint. Constructed in WWII, this ship languished for many years in Suisan Bay before being selected for conversion to a museum - and what a great job has been done by the volunteers who spent their own time bringing it back to life.All areas are usually open but during my visit there was no access to the engine room because the boilers were being re-tubed. When this work is completed the ship will then commence its programme of regular cruises around the area - something I would have enjoyed but sadly not this time.The explanatory placards describing the working of the 20mm and 40mm guns were well written and clearly followed.The memorials located throughout the passageways to the U.S. Merchant ships and crews lost during WWII were moving reminders of the price paid for our freedom. They provided a description of the loss and also the fate of the U-Boat that sank the vessel.The museum was well equipped with explanatory displays on survival - epic tales of courage and determination were read. The history of Convoy PQ 17 was described.The work of the volunteers to keep the vessel in first class condition was very apparent and it was good to learn that members of the Sea Cadets are also playing their part in the conservation projects.There is plenty to interest all family members - a recommended visit.+",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieBStockport
30,"Worth the $5... but that's it, really","We checked out this ship while we stayed at the Queen Mary a couple weeks ago in May 2015 and upon entering, a very nice elderly man got us prepared with our $5 tickets. I don't believe there was a map. If there was a self guided tour, we never got the info.So off we go exploring the ship on our own. I thought there'd be plaques or labels on everything so we could learn everything about the ship as we walked through, but there were barely any. Volunteers were working in some of the rooms (so they weren't on standby to explain anything either) and at times I felt like I was intruding on their space even though most of the areas weren't blocked off for exploring. Stuff was everywhere (ropes, paddles, chairs) so you will need to watch your step, and the outside metal stairs connecting each level are steep so people afraid of heights may have a hard time going up and down between the floors.The museum down below was where we received all the education about the ship. There were some cool and interesting exhibits, but there were also some under construction.Overall this ship didn't seem well maintained. It's good for the cost of the ticket, but that's it! It's not very memorable nor exciting. Give this ship an hour or two at most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dh375
50,Well worth the visit,"While not well known, the ship is amazing. You can wander to your hearts content and learn a lot about the merchant marine ships. In addition there are volunteers that will give you some insight - just ask!The ship is away from the beaten path and a bit out of the way but after an hour on it you will be happy you found it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperiencedTravelers
50,Learn Rich History About Role Merchant Marines Played in WWII,"Excellent ship to visit. Learn the rich history of the Merchant Marine and the role they played, especially in WWII. Many do not know that the Merchant Marine actually had more ships sunk than the Navy during WWII with few to no survivors. We did not realize that until we took this very informative tour. Plan a day and go see this ship and the Battleship Iowa. Excellent tour for all, but be sure to wear close toed shoes and be prepared for a day of walking and climbing ship ladders. Check out Groupon for possible discount tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnb843
50,Very interesting..! History lesson.,Very interesting visit. Is a learning experience. The historic value is all over the place. Is amazing if you have kids the will enjoy every momment. Is super interesting to visit all parts of the ship. After you finish there is a virtual reallity machines very good. I strongly suggest a visit. You can struggle looking for parking. The parking can be costly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelerPRUSA
50,A history lesson in person,"The Lane Victory is the last working ""Victory"" ship that was utilized in World War II. It was a supply ship that ferried supplies to allies and US servicemen across the water. The difference between the Lane Victory and the Iowa is that you can tour almost the whole ship on Lane Victory whereas the Iowa is limited. It's great for young boys especially to learn about what it takes to man a war - it's not just about guns and tanks. Even though I am a woman, I thought it was extremely informative and touching. There are newspaper articles from that period in time where you can read great stories and get a true feel for how it was to live in a time of war. Do yourself a favor - go and visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BornanEnglishRose
50,navy and history buffs should visit,"After visiting the battleship Iowa some months ago I was anxious to see the nearby SS Lane Victory sitting all alone at the very end of the San Pablo gentrified waterfront. Parking is extensive and free. Access to the Lane Victory is nominal, so both free parking and inexpensive ship access was a refreshing change from the rather expensive Iowa experience. I leaned a lot from this visit. I thought that the SS Lane Victory was a Liberty ship, but Liberty ships were built earlier in WWII, were initially unarmed, and slow. The Victory ships were not part of the Henry Kaiser build, came about later in the war, were speedy (17 knots), and reasonably armed - 3 inch guns on bow and stern together with anti-aircraft guns all over. These guns are all accessible to the public on a most interesting self guided tour climbing all the way up the the flying bridge. Best of all was a magnificent museum with all sorts of naval, WWII and post-WWII memorabilia. Of particular interest to me were excerpts from Long Beach and LA newspapers about WWII. I spent an hour reading about the declaration of WWII, combat and war action reporting, as well as the Japanese surrender, all through the eyes of newspaper reporters. Merchant mariners as well as naval and general history buffs of the mid-20th century will love this exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/figgie32313
50,Excellent wartime exhibit,This is an AP2 class naval auxiliary. Commissioned near the end of WW11 and serving in Korea and Vietnam she is a great example of this duties this type of ship carried out. She is dedicated to the service of the Merchant Marine during WW11.Now operated by volunteers you do a self guided tour that is divided into three segments. Allow up to two hours to thoroughly explore the ship.A must do for a military history buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winddancerone
50,Extensive and superb self guided tour.,"We had attended the Tall Ships Festival, which happened to provide us access to both the USS Iowa and the SS Lane Victory. The Lave Victory was by far the better tour. Access to a huge portion of the ship was available including climbing down into the operational boiler room. The volunteer staff were very friendly and well informed on the history and specs of the ship. Two of the holds had been converted into a museum / gift shop that held a rather extensive collection of artifacts from WW2. My teenage daughter actually enjoyed the tour quite a bit and she's not really much of a history buff. It was nice to be on a museum ship of this era that, one was still sea worthy and two granted direct access to all the equipment. You could go right up and touch the wheel, sit in a jeep, or even take a pic on the deck guns (made safe of course). It created a much more visceral experience for us than you typically get just walking around looking at artifacts from behind ropes. Hats off to the folks running this ship, they've done it right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Da-Raz
50,Good tour,This is a self guided tour which will last about 2 hours. It is very interesting for the history buff. Watch out the they try to get your money at the gift shop and you must walk through to exist. The ship receives no outside funding for restoration. Keeping that in mind what they have accomplished is incredible!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356shannenm
50,Lane Victory radio show,Went onboard to (a) fly my US Flags onboard the ship and (B) to do a pod cast for my internet radio show. This ship us just so neat and it's stories are intriguing. Skip all the tourist places in LA and see the really special stuff . If you are a veteran this should be a mandatory stop.Permalink: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/s3production/2014/06/25/ss-lane-victory-merchant-marines-1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s3production
40,A nice step back into time!,"I recently stumbled upon the SS Lane Victory and was very happy to do so. The hours were 9-4 on a recent Friday. Entrance for adults is $5 and $2 for children. Once aboard, you'll feel like you've taken a step back into time. The ship has plenty of decks to climb and halls to explore. There is also a small museum on board. Definitely worth the $5 to take in a piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,If you're in San Pedro with nothing to do...,"Well, I got a Groupon for this ship and I'm glad I did. After seeing the magnificent USS Iowa, the Lane Victory doesn't really compare. It's waaaay out at the end of the harbor all by its lonesome. The regular cost is only $5.00 and it's really worth to see for an hour or so at that price. We walked around and looked at all the things that are meant to be seen, but then it was done. Parking is free and there is plenty of it--but unfortunately, it's mostly because there aren't that many people there taking a tour. It's worth the drive during nice weather because you cross the St. Vincent Bridge and it's gorgeous, but I definitely wouldn't put this on a bucket list or anything. Many TV shows and movies are filmed on this ship and that was interesting to discover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbgirl-forever
50,Great Day at Sea!,"If you have the opportunity to take this 1 day excursion you will really enjoy it. Plenty of free parking and short walk to the ship. Once onboard there are areas set up with lots of fresh pastries and coffee, juice & bottled water. There is plenty of seating throughout the ship so you can enjoy the smooth cruise out to sea. You have the opportunity to view different areas of the ship at your leisure as well as take a guided tour of the engine room. I highly recommend this tour as there is a lot of history behind the running of this ship. Around noon you arrive just outside of Catalina Island where they set up a great buffet of chicken, tri-tip, salads & fresh rolls. As you enjoy your meal you may have a chance of seeing dolphins as well as throughout the cruise. Bring binoculars, as there is so much to see. Many boats coming and going from the mainland to Catalina Island. Once lunch is finished and you head back home the ship makes an announcement that they have found a spy on board! About 1/2 hour later a mock aerial attack takes place. This is the highlight of the cruise watching the dogfight take place in the air. Plenty of photo opportunities. After that as you head back into the harbor the LA Firefighters greet the ship with a huge water display from one of their boats. Absolutely beautiful. There is a museum onboard where you learn so much history as well as a gift store. There are plenty of volunteers with a vast knowledge of the history of the ship. Bring a jacket as the early morning can be brisk as well as when heading home. And flat shoes as some of the stairwells are quite steep. There are dancers on board dressed in that era. You will not be disappointed with this full one day excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,An overlooked gem of history,"Put this ship on your list. Great history, spectacular museum exhibits, great for families and a good place to sit and watch the ships go by. This is a must visit for anyone who loves ships.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenotheViking
50,Was really fun,when I went there it was really fun. But I had a hard time of finding the museum. I had a really fun time. It is affordable. And the staff Is nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubasean1023
50,Take the cruise!,"This is a not to be missed attraction. A living piece of history, well cared for by a few who sailed on her or a ship like her during WWII. This is a wonderful day out. The trip takes you by Catalina near Avalon. It provides a very nice lunch. You have the run of the ship and a bridge tour is informative. As are the history museum below decks. The engine room is a living, breathing example of some interesting technology and mechanisation of the day. It is run with TLC and the old girl feels as she has a soul. We were entertained by a mock dogfight from the Condors of Van Nuys, flying AT-6 vintage airplanes. We even had gunners firing at the enemy aircraft. Don't worry, they don't use real ammo. There was a very important ceremony for fallen Merchant Marine Vets and a wreath laid on the ocean, honouring them. The Swing Cats band played 40s music and were wonderful. The ladies in the band did some wonderful vocals and harmonies. They have soldiers dressed up in uniform, myself included. Some were dancing swing steps. Chaplain Erik Cliine did a first class job and his dad rode along with us and he and I shared some fun stories of our lives. This is very important history everyone should see and understand. They sail 4 times in the warm weather months. If you can't make it out on a trip, see the ship at her berth and take your time. The cruise departs San Pedro at 0900 and returns about 1630 hours. It's a wonderful day at sea or a simple visit. You'll never forget it. We are thankful for the soldiers and seamen who protected us aboard the Lane Victory and are very fortunate to have her still very much alive and cared for. Every contribution and fare is valuable and goes toward preserving and operations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntrak
50,Museum at sea,"We went on one of the summer cruises on this floating museum. The cruise was delightful. There was a continental breakfast for starters, music with dancers in period costumes, an aerial dog fight and tours of the hot and steamy engine room. The buffet lunch was very good with a more than ample selection of all we could eat. Water all day was complimentary and soda and beer up to four per person, no charge. We cruised Catalina and took a harbor tour past the IOWA. This was a full day and run by volunteers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyD638
50,Full day of fun,"The Lane Victory is now berthed at pier 43. We found out about this historic ship from a short aticle in a travel magazine. It seemed a bit pricey, but once on board it became apparent that a great deal of thought went into showing the ""crew"" the life aboard a WWII/Korean War ship. The museum, gift shop (strong on history), the band in WWII uniforms, the actual crew in historic uniforms, all came together to make a full and busy day. The crew did some great displays of jitterbug dancing. The condor squadron (WWII planes) flew overhead in a mock straffing run and the guns onboard were fired to repeal the attack. There was a continental breakfast and full lunch. We did a sail-by of Avalon, Catalina and when we returned to port, were greeted by 2 byplanes with smoke tails. This cruise is only offered 4 times during the summer, so you have to hope on before she starts sailing. There are several hotels to stay nearby so you needn't drive on the day of the sail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dugan_charles
50,One historic day at sea,"The tug boats slowly backed us away from the pier and our one day voyage back in history began. We enjoyed some coffee and pastries as we roamed the main deck and wondered at the masts, booms, and cables that loaded and unloaded cargo. The hatch above cargo hold #4 served as a bandstand and the entertainers, dressed in khaki uniforms of the era, sang songs from an earlier time. As the day progressed, we were told that a German ""spy"" had escaped from captivity and had radioed our position to enemy planes. WW II fighters roared alongside and overhead, simulating their attack as our guns fired and our ""hits"" created smoke from the planes and yells of victory from our throats. A delicious buffet lunch was served as we cruised slowly by Catalina Island. The two museums revealed a large, working engine relocated from the movie ""Sand Pebbles,"" several WW II Jeeps, many ship models, flags, and equipment from the wars. Back on deck, we explored the guns and chatted with other passengers, and tasted the fresh sea air as we cruised back to port. Our safe return from the successful defense of our ship warranted a welcome from a fire fighting boat with all hoses spraying in a beautiful pattern. Wow! What a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwharper2
50,Hard to find,"I think the SS Lane Victory has been moved to make room for the Iowa but we felt it was worth the search to find it. While we enjoyed roaming around the ship, the museum on board has a vast amount of information and artifacts. We would love to take one of the cruises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuanneS8737
50,Great fun on a World War II Cargo Ship,"This is a real WWII Victory Ship build in 1945 in San Pedro. It served in WWII, Korea and Viet Nam. It is manned by volunteers. The boarding went smoothly and they served a continental breakfast on board the ship. The cruise was from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm and went out near Catalina Island. They served an excellent buffet for lunch including tri-tip, chicken and a pasta dish. Also they included fruit and salads. After lunch there was a mock attack by enemy fighter planes. The simulated firing of anti-aircraft guns on the ship using compressed air for the sound of the guns. It was very realistic. There was a band on board playing 40's music all day. They have these cruises 3 or 4 times per year. I would hightly recommend it for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fcd4usc
50,SS Lane Victory - The hidden gem of Los Angeles (San Pedro),"Definitely worth a visit for two basic reasons 1) To immerse yourself in the memories recreated within this brilliantly restored World War II Merchant Navy vessel and secondly, to meet the marvellous crew who either served on the SS Lane Victory or have a marvellous passion in helping visitors to view the ship and its history through their eyes.We spent about half a day on board (though you may personally spend less), and were given a thorough and totally informative tour of the ship - even as far down as the bilges! I would recommend good shoes as you will be going up and down steep ladders here and there.The ship is actually in seaworthy condition as from time to time it takes parties out for various activities (wedding parties for example), though we did not take such a trip. Perhaps the greatest curiosity on board, is the toilet seat framework/arrangement that is positioned so that you would sit over the sea to the side of the ship! This relates to a heroic rescue attempt of thousands of Korean refugees and others.It may seem odd, but one of things I liked best was the ability to roam almost freely. Back here in England a similar visit would be far more restrictive.The ship is in effect a floating museum and I would highly recommend a visit if you are able to do so. It is located within the Port of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kernow01
