50,Amazing experience.,"The three days riding in Sierra Nevada with the Running Horse Ranch's horses and Daniela will be a well-kept treasure for life. Good horses that are well-trained, kept and fit for extraordinary rides in the mountains are excellent companions. I will remain in awe and gratitude for the experience. NB. Humble attitudes, OK fitness level for riders and good riding skills are recommended. Not for the faint hearted. Still, a trip where safety for horses and people was at the forefront. Thanks Daniela, Running Horse Ranch & the Horses! Amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sivo332
50,Atvâ€™s,"Great place to stop by for horseback riding and Atv rides, great people running the ranch, our whole group enjoyed immensely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyh247
50,A ride to remember!,"The Burnt Peak trail was a beautiful and fun ride, unlike anything I have tried before on horseback. With it's narrow and winding trail, closed in by bushery and low branches, and the steep climbs on uneven and sometimes unstable surfaces, it is definitely not for beginners. However, much thanks to Daniela and her beautiful mustangs, it never felt unsafe, and for the experienced rider looking for an adventure I can absolutely recommend Running Horse Ranch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drtiram
50,One of the best times of my life!,Our tour guide was so friendly and encouraging. The sights were breathtaking and was well worth the money for everything you get. Me and my girlfriend plan on coming back multiple times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98Travis108
50,"Great trails, happy horses and nice hosts for experienced riders","I decided to book the 5 day â€žPacific Crestâ€œ trail ride for experienced riders â€“ and it turned out to be one of the best trail rides I ever did.What is really important to me when booking such holidays is that the owners are real â€žhorsemenâ€œ and take good care of their horses. They did not disappoint me.One thing you need to know upfront: Most of the rides are for truly experienced trail riders. Which is great if you do have this experience, because itÂ´s no â€žnose-to-tailâ€œ and therefore not suitable for beginners. I think they do offer beginners lessions on their farm as well. My suggestion is: Do yourself a favor and be honest to yourself in terms of your riding capabilities.The horses:Most of the horses are Mustangs, many of them born in the wild and domesticated later. They are extremely sure-footed and reliable, but still smart and very â€žrideableâ€œ.They live in huge pastures in a big group. On the first day, you spend some good time with them before going onto a trail â€“ which is very good for building up some initial trust and understanding between rider and horse.The rides:We decided to ride in the early mornings, returning around lunch time. The afternoons were far too hot to continue riding - which allowed to spend some free time on the farm or in the L.A. area for the humans and some recovery for the horses.Daniela doesnÂ´t take the same trails every day, but also loads the horses onto her truck and drives to trails further away, which is nice in terms of variety of rides. ItÂ´s a very nice mixture of mountain climbing, tiny paths through bushes, nice trotts and canters.The location:The rooms are spacious and due to the remote location of the farm very quiet.Beds are super comfortable, the shared kitchen and bathroom is equiped with everything needed.They do also offer Quad-Tours etc. for non-riders.The hosts:Daniela is a German living in the US since many years, so you can communicate in german if you like / need to and of course in english.She is very interested in getting a good connection to the guests, but absolutely respecting your privacy / relaxation time if you need it.It might not be the cheapest offer you can get in this area â€“ but to me, the good care for the horses (and for us ðŸ˜Š) were definitely worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reisender4711Nrw
50,What An Amazing Experience,"Visiting from Ireland, we only had a few days in southern California. Our two daughters are both equestrians and compete back in Ireland and the UK and they were keen to get some riding in while on holiday. But we didn't want something that would leave them going home disappointed... and what Daniela at Running Horse Ranch (Lake Hughes) had to offer was just what we were looking for! It was excellent. The horses are well looked after and the location is spectacular. Daniela tailors the riding treks to the experience of those taking part, and she took us high into the hills above her gorgeous ranch, looking over the Sierra Nevada desert. For me (dad) it was the perfect way to take in the spectacular scenery, that we'd never have seen had we stuck to the roads. And my wife and the girls, all of whom ride regularly, it was an experience that they'll remember for a long time. We all enjoyed it so much and Daniela is the perfect hostess. The accommodation was basic, but clean and comfortable. And an absolutely beautiful place to wake up in the morning! I would definitely recommend visiting Running Horse Ranch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielC2601
50,5 day horse trekking adventure,"After doing some research online for riding holidays I chose to do the 5 day horse trekking adventure at Running Horse Ranch in Lake Hughes, which promised an exciting and adventurous riding experience and it was.After arriving and spending some time chatting about horses then settling into my cabin, Daniela first took me and another guest into the riding arena and gave us tips and instructions on handling the horses and to allow us to get to know them. Then we headed out for our first ride in the mountains surrounding the ranch which was terrific.For the next four days we rode early, before the heat really builds. This is a real trail riding experience, with a variety of rides including; riding through the stunning scenery of the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park in the Sierra Pelona Mountains and riding along challenging single trails in the Angeles National Forest with steep up and down hill sections, with breathtaking views and unbelievable scenery from the mountain tops.Daniela and her daughter Ichella are both great riders who love and know their horses thoroughly. The horses are well looked after and happy, fit and forward going whilst being calm and well mannered.These are not huge nose to tail rides, Running Horse Ranch is perfect for experienced riders who want to explore the amazing scenery and challenges of riding in this part of California. I recommend spending at least a couple of days here in one of their comfortable cabins. I had a room with a the bed that was sooo comfortable, a shared kitchen, bathroom and living room with a huge TV, though I chose to sit on the porch in the afternoons with another guest and watch the local wildlife; lizards, birds and of course the horses and on one evening we all shared a bottle of wine.I look forward to going back and riding more trails with Daniela. Thank you for an amazing and unforgettable holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessica0092018
50,ATV Tour with an amazing view,"While visiting California with my brother we wanted to do something different and we found, that the running horse ranch also offers ATV tours. It was a 2 hour ride and Daniela whoâ€™s also from Germany was so helpful and friendly, she took the tour with us and the view we had was just amazing and it was so much fun. Thank you so much Daniela would come back anytime and do it again I wish you all the best !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaL5301
50,The Real Deal,"Thank your Daniella for providing me and my 3 grown-up children with a vacation we will never forget.We travelled from Ireland in the hope of experiencing an authentic 'Western' experience and we certainly were not disappointed.You are an excellent and generous hostess and the ranch experience was perfect.As for the horse riding, we just loved the daily 4 and 5 hour trails up into the mountains. The trails were nicely challenging for us and the views breathtaking.We will cherish the four days we spend at 'Running Horse Ranch' and hope to return in the not too distant future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pajok
50,Fantastic advanced horse ride,"Itâ€™s all about love. Happy horses keep you safe! And they give you so much enjoyment.Daniela and her daughter Ichella are great. Daniela is from Germany and they know their horses.See tremendous love and passion and the horses when I talk to them. Well loved and taken care of horses are reflection of what they do to their horses. And it shows. This is not a nose to tail ride. This horses are astute and well mannered and still spirited which I appreciate.Their riders and gas are their primary concern. They took time to walk us through with Tips and instructions and they let us practice with handling the horses in trading in the arena to make sure that we understand and are connected to the horses Emotionally. This makes all the difference. And itâ€™s a sign of Daniellaâ€™s commitment and training under Perelli.Our horses were a Mustang and it in Arabian. I know both are hot blooded and sometimes can be hard to handle, but we always wanted to ride these horses. Daniella has done an amazing job with these animals.Surprisingly both were very calm and well mannered. It was such a pleasant ride.The ride was on a terrific singletrack trail with steep up and down hills sections. Longer rides wouldâ€™ve put us up on the ridge on the Pacific crest Trail.Wow. I would recommend this to anyone who is experienced and wants a real ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7877JKdavidc
50,"Not your average trail ride. Much, much better.","I rode with Daniella a year and a half ago for a half day desert ride in Antelope Valley. It was very enjoyable. On that trip I also did a mountain ride in Goleta and another trail ride in Oro Grande. Daniellaâ€™s was the best and decided when I came back I was riding with her for my 3 available days to ride. It was a good decision as I rode with her for 3 days that were very enjoyable, riding an Arabian the first day and Mustang the next two. Unbelievable scenery from the mountain tops, feeling like you are on top of the world. Some challenging trails up and through the mountain, a good amount of trotting, and well-conditioned horses. You need not trailer your own horses out here to have a great riding experience. This is definitely tailored, as promoted for experienced riders, and you will not be bored. Itâ€™s been two weeks Iâ€™m back on Long Island, and canâ€™t help but continue to reminisce about my rides, as well as keep watching my videos. Great memories and I look forward to going back and riding more trails with Daniella. Happy trails to you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcB4841IX
50,Best 12 year old birthday ever!,"I brought my 2 daughters here to celebrate my youngest's 12th birthday. It was exactly what we were looking for, very quiet and peaceful, beautiful mountains, and beautiful horses. A great escape from L.A.You get a very personalized experience here. The owners treat you like friends, and they have an obvious love for all their animals. All in all, a special experience. I recommend spending the night. Waking up to a quiet sunset in the mountains with horses outside your window is something you won't forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ambers922
50,Bring your sense of adventure and come prepared to ride,"Running Horse Ranch is perfect for experienced riders who want to explore the amazing scenery and challenges of riding in this part of California. As a distance rider traveling from North NJ, I wanted a unique yet fulfilling vacation experience and Daniela was able to customize a trip for me so I could make the most of my time at the ranch. Both her and her daughters are wellsprings of information. Their care and devotion is evident from how well the horses are taken care of and aptly trained. Bring your sense of adventure and come prepared to ride- You will leave feeling refreshed and make memories of a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracecX1686ID
50,Serious horse riders will LOVE this place!,"Where do I start? I arrived Friday night. Met Daniela and chatted quite a bit about our love of horses. Found out we share the same training philosophies which put me at ease as I got ready to meet Astaire. He was responsive and sweet and I got even more excited for my ride to Sandburg. It was lights out (stayed in one of the trailer rooms) for a 4:30am wake up call.Saturday morning there was a sweet knock on my door and Daniela had breakfast for me. I ate and met her 3 amazing daughters who took me out on my ride. The 4 of us had a fantastic time climbing the trails, watching the sun rise, and laughing the morning away. The trails were beautiful and challenging enough for this experienced rider. 17 miles of trotting was finished off with our trailer ride back to the farm, right after we ate lunch.Word of advice: the website says that all day rides are for experienced riders. That means you need to be balanced and able to flex and bend through the bushes and trees. Do not wear anything you don't want to potentially rip since you do get close to the shrubs. This is not a dude ranch ride. She offers those, but this was not one of them. For me, it was perfect.If you're looking for a place to ride in the LA area (about 2 hours from the airport) then this is the place. If you are truly a horse person, then you NEED to ride here! If you're a beginner, you will love this place too! Daniela and her daughters love these horses like family so they will make sure you know what you're doing before you head out.Final words, one of the best rides I've had. I've ridden in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Maryland and Pennsylvania. This is right up there with the best.If I'm ever back in the area, I will ride again. Thank you Daniela, Ichelle, Val/Riccarda, and Bonnie!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelrd
50,not your average trail ride,"Our experience was really special. We had a 2 hour private ride catered tour riding experience. Most trail rides are hokey and not very challenging or interesting. We were introduced to the horses, learned their stories and were taught to get comfortable. Daniela has amazing insight/knowledge and experience that she happily shared with us. The area is amazing, the horses were great, Daniela was great. It was the best experience I have had doing a trail ride, I would come back again for a longer ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caspercautis
50,An unforgettable experience,"It is hard to describe what a wonderful experience it was to spend several hours with these horses. Daniela and her daughters have trained these amazing wild mustangs to be the most relaxed, responsive, and impressive horses we've ever had the pleasure to ride. Daniela will help you get to know your horse and for the horse to know you before you go, so that your ride is a bonding experience with the animal. The English saddles are amazingly comfortable for the rider and the horse. The trails are scenic and exciting. And the conversation with Daniela and her daughters along the way is such a pleasure. They know so much about the landscape and especially about how to communicate and interact with the horses. What an unexpected treat is was for me and my two teenagers. We will definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sfleury92130
50,Wonderful experience,"This was everything we had hoped for when looking for a real riding experience in the LA area.Challenging trail, lovely responsive horses, and beautiful scenery!Daniella was a fantastic guide and went to great lengths to make sure we were happy and safe on our horses. This included letting us spend time getting accustomed to them in the sand arena before hitting the trail, which was perfect for my less experienced boyfriend.We would definitely recommend Running Horse Ranch to anyone looking to do some 'proper' riding! We had an amazing time and will definitely be visiting again if we make it back to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelyw687
50,Fabulous horses and scenery.,"Running Horse Ranch is a great country experience for average to experienced riders. The ranch is owned by Daniela Keyes and her family and she was a complete pleasure to ride with. She and her family clearly have a lot of passion and respect for their horses. My 12 year old daughter and I loved having time to bond with our well mannered endurance horses before we hit the trail and the Daniela made sure we would treat her lovely horses well and the way they are used to.The trail was tough enough to be challenging and Daniela made sure we and our mounts were always safe and happy. The forests were lovely and cool and the views from the top spectacular. You do need to have some level of experience before taking on one of the longer trails as there is quite a lot of trotting.I would have no hesitation recommending Daniela and her horses to anyone passionate about riding who genuinely cares about the horse they are spending time on.Thank you again Daniela. If we make it back to LA you are definitely one stop we will be making, only this time we will stay at the ranch too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nogluten2013
50,Unbelievable riding in a beautiful place,"Daniela and her daughters define natural horsemanship at its finest. When I contacted her to spend 3 days at Running Horse, I simply could not conceive of the wonderful experience that awaited me. So many online vacations promise much and deliver little. At the risk of sounding hokey, this experience was healing to me. Daniela loves her horses, her daughters and her guests. From the first evening ""getting to know you and the horse"" session, I could tell she was looking to keep her horses as enthralled with the rides as I was. As a small animal veterinarian, animal welfare is paramount to me, and Daniela walks that perfect balance of healthy horses and happy riders. We rode early, before the heat and at that magical time of day when the world is yawning and stretching its arms. This is a real trail riding experience, complete with trotting on gorgeous single track in the California coastal mountains and, if your ability allows, cantering too! The horses look forward to their time on the trail and Astaire, the dapple Arab who was my trusty steed, was both fun and forgiving of my shortcomings (it had been YEARS since I'd been on a horse). Daniela was patient and kind, but let me push my limits in a safe environment. I was finding myself thanking her and her horses, while she was thanking me for my stay! After the morning rides, the rest of the day I had time to nap, read, hike, talk to her horses and I suppose I could have explored the Antelope Valley, but I was on a mommy retreat, so I just soaked up quiet time with me, the natural world, books and horses. Even though I was a recluse Daniela had a wealth of suggestions for activities -- she just sensed my need to take it easy. As for food, you could make your own meals, but Daniela made sure I was well fed in only the way a good host can - good food, lots of it, and not too fancy, but delicious. As a mom of two little kids, I am happy if someone puts top ramen cooked in front of me, so I savored the fresh salads, eggs and hashed browns, and other fare she brought to me. Boy, did I feel spoiled! The guest house is clean and comfortable - just the way I'd probably decorate my house if my husband didn't have a say! Even in the July heat wave, I could retreat to the cool of the house or take it easy in the heat on the porch. This is a great place for a couple or small family to enjoy ""ranch life."" Next time I might even bring my husband and kids -- or maybe not. Mama loved her horse time...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194bridgeth
50,Fantastic Trail Riding!,"Daniela and her horses are an absolute gem. This is the perfect place to trail ride where you're allowed to trot and canter the horse. And it's not far from LA! I had a fantastic time doing the ""2 hour ranch trail ride"" with a friend, Daniela, and her daughter. Daniela is a fantastic instructor and does everything she can to make your trail ride the best it can be and for a price that can't be beat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/als9311
50,Running Horse Ranch should be named LOVE Ranch,"Age has no boundaries at Running Horse Ranch. As a senior rider, Daniela, daughters and oh those wonderful horses took 40+ years off my life! Why do I call it LOVE Ranch? Love of the horses and the tasks at hand whether the outstanding mountain rides [over 5000' altitude] to Burnt Peak and other rides, then to the tack room, tacking up and making sure saddles, bridles are perfect for each rider; happiest horses I have seen a few but all the horses at LOVE Ranch are happy, loved and they show it by giving spectacular rides! Now at home back riding I am in awe of what I personaly had experienced at LOVE Ranch aka Running Horse Ranch. Thank you and hope to return before I am 80!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dipalodonna
50,Enjoy Spectacular Endurance Horses and Wonderful Trails at Running Horse Ranch,"We spent 4 days at Running Horse Ranch last week and had a wonderful time. I have done Equitours nationally and internationally and none of those horses could compare to RHR's top-notch, proven endurance horses in terms of performance, reliability, safety and temperament. Plus, the RHR team is very friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable, and they take excellent care of their horses. I highly recommend this equestrian adventure for experienced, adventurous riders, whether you want to ride for one hour or one week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5768TBjaned
50,Powerful,"Had a fun time riding up steep inclines, narrow switchbacks and mountain ranges. Scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and varies from desert scrub to big treed forests with their dappled understory.. Horses surefooted and well trained. This place is Zen for riders looking to unwind and reconnect with the natural world. This is not your Grandpa's ""trail ride"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892joanc
50,Amazing,"Dear Daniela,we really enjoyed the wonderful trails and the nature. The scenery was amazing and after 2 month without a horse it was soooo great to be back on it. Your horses are so nicely and they know the ways. I could feel that the horses know what they do and that makes me feel comfortable.Thank you for that great experience. I would come back everytime :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrissi112
50,Perfect horse and nature experience!,"The running horse ranch is the perfect place to go if you are searching for a wild west horse adventure in beautiful Angeles Forrest. I picked this ranch because of the promising description on the homepage and I didn't get disappointed. The horses are kept in an open stable with a lot of space and company. They look healthy and well fed, fur and hooves are in good condition. But what really blew my mind is the fact how well they are trained. They are all really nice, react easily to everything and safely put their feed even on very challenging trails. And by challenging I mean steep hills with sand or stones, sometimes slippery, they do an incredible job. I would recommend this place to every experienced horse back rider who wants to challenge himself with an incredible adventure on wonderful horses! I hope to come back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1082FKrebeccas
50,Family Bonding,"While visiting our aunt in LA, we searched for an riding vacation which offered more than the typical trail walk.Daniela, the owner of Running Horse Ranch was friendly and promising on the phone, that there are no beginners in the groups and the groups are no more than fife riders. So we signed in for the five day riding vacation week at Running Horse Ranch- and we had a blast!As experienced riders, hunter/jumper, we had our hopes set on leaving the show ring behind and enjoy some scenic trails while also riding some speed.The horses at this ranch are pampered, connected to the family, and living on large clean pastures. I liked that this family truly cared about theyâ€™re horses, so the horses enjoy a great life on large pastures with big run in sheds. Daniela, the owner matched my son to Mirage and I rode Dasani. She took time in the arena to test us, explained to us patiently, how the horses need to be cued. We could feel she wanted to make sure we will enjoy a safe ride out on the trails. After we hit the trails the ride took of first at a walk and later longer periods of trot and some cantering. Make sure you bring not your most expensive riding pens, since a lot is going through some brush. However we really liked it, since it challenges our riding skills. The trails bend a lot, its feels like zooming trough a jungle. You will have to bend and watch out as faster you go and we went pretty fast. The horses are very collected and seem to enjoy the challenging trails at a faster pace.There are also a lot of hills up and down, this trail keeps you definitely busy.The next morning we went up by five and experienced a magical sunrise in California. Daniela rides her horses during the summer month while in the early morning hours. The long steep hill climbing makes it easier on the horses, but also on the riders to avoid the mid day heat of the day. There is a lot of shade on the trail, since we rode through a beautiful ancient pine forest. The horses are very responsive, forward moving and made us feel safe on this challenging trail. Bring sunscreen, and water, it was not really that hot.Next morning we drove to a movie set scenery and enjoyed a ride trough a impressive world of rocks. Just breathtaking!Day four we went to the desert, trotted in to distance on picture square roads and white shining river beds. Our last day was another extreme climb, with lots of trotting( and the most miles of the week). The scenery is on all riding days spectacular and each day so different.The cottage is small but very, very cozy, clean and you will see the horses in their pasture, from every room. The drive to LA is also easy, just jump on freeway and zoom down, we visited my aunt on various days after riding.On the last day, there came a lady from LA to joining the ride heading to Sandberg with Luxor. Since she was a rider who visits the ranch often, the ride was also outstanding. Daniela and the girls are truly great with their horses, have some edge cutting stories to tell. Their horses running in long distance races and it shows! Running Horse Ranch does not entertain beginners. This is a trail paradise left for experienced riders. We have gotten much more what we've got promised,and we will be back for a 7 day adventure.Eric and family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erickd98
50,Best. Ranch. Ever ...,"While visiting our family in LA, my husband and I searched for a riding adventure day and it was AMAZING!!. Ms. Daniela, the owner and her family were so kind, helpful, professional, and awesome. We was looking for a trail as a experienced riders, and we found the correct place.They showed us all the horses, they live on a large green pasture. The horses running in long distance races and they are very responsive. Daniela and her daughters took us to the famous Vasquez Rocks, impressive rock formations that Hollywood movie producers have regularly used for film scenes, my husband and I enjoyed the rocking view so much, such a great experience!.They offer a five day riding vacation week at Running Horse Ranch, and we will definitely be going back for that!Carolina M.

50,Scenic trail ride on outstanding horses,"I stayed in Los Angeles California for business I decided to stop by for a day ride at running horse ranch The horses are in great condition, well cared for, living in large pastures. Riding was truly a fantastic experience, saddles are very comfortable and fit well the horses. The trails are not everyday, due to the climbing with spectacular views, and lots of steamy trots. My Arabian gelding Estaire listened to cues like clockwork. Very friendly family operated ranch with exceptional horses. Looking forward to come back for a riding vacation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W4663ARmichaelk
