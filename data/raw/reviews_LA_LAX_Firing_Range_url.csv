10,Worst service Ever Experienced,"Hands down the worst shooting range experience (20 year competition shooting veteran here) I've ever come accross. Ammo shop people have awful attitude, unprofessional, using profanity and threatening customers. Make you walk around the block to access the other side of the building where the range is.The range is another story. We got yelled at, got berated, cursed at by the employees. All started because we couldn't get their door open when they buzz you in. Then they said because we had a child with us, we couldn't go in. However they couldn't give us a minimum age!My friend bought the wrong size gun cleaning kit (not even 15 minutes before from them), they wouldn't allow return, saying we don't have receipt (we put it in the car)! Make matters worse they said ""how do we know you didn't empty the box""?? It's still wrapped and we JUST bought it!!Later, awful attitude, throwing things at us (safety glasses, etc).Man, the people working here must be treated like stray dogs because THEY HATED their lives! You can't make this stuff up!! Worst service I've ever seen.",Harout D
50,What an experience. 5 stars,I wanted to try firing range so I visited LAX firing range and I had one of the best experiences so far. It was super fun shooting in the range. Staff was friendly and assisted whenever required. Safety standards also high. Thank you LAX FIRING RANGE for this experience. Location is also good near LAX so was not far from my airport hotel during transit.,Aby
20,"Rude, and unwelcoming.",Avoid this place if you're a tourist. They are not very welcoming to tourists and behave very rude as if they expect you to already know what you are doing. Very ignorant.,BritishMale359
50,Fantastic experience,"We visited from the UK and weren’t quite sure what to expect. We walked in and were greeted with very cheerful and helpful staff who ran through everything with us and made it clear we could ask anything, they’d even come in and help if we needed it..... a very good experience and brilliant staff.",daffodilsSL
50,very friendly and professional staff!,I came here with some friends and the staff were very friendly and advised us on which firearms were best for us to use in the range. It wasn't very expensive either bit a little far if you're staying in LA.,Sanny101
50,Very professional gun range,"Few friends and I went to LAX Firing Range with a groupon and we had a blast. This place is very professional and offers many different handguns and revolvers, but also some high power rifles for rent. You do not have to own a gun, and this range is open to public. You will have to sign the waiver and present an ID for each participants. You will have to rant a lane (per hour), rent a weapon and buy bullets from them.The staff was very knowledgeable and very professional. They fully explained how to use the handgun and briefed us on safety once at the range. The ear and eyes protections is included in the price so basically you can walk. Classes is are highly recommended for first time users of any handgun or rifle.This is a highly recommended and very safe place.",TravelAdventureGurus
30,Still Worth Going,"I took my boyfriend here to get some target practice in. Great variety of firearms. However, the ammo kept jamming in the chambers. The ammo was clearly cheap.Nevertheless, would still return. Staff are nice, and very approachable.",katie s
