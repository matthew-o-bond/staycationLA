50,Fun group classes!,Real Fitness has group classes and private training for all fitness levels. This is a great place to check out if youâ€™re looking to get a workout in while visiting LA. Check out their intro class special as a great way to tryout some classes. The gym is just a few blocks away from the beach so you can get a workout in and then walkover to chill at the beach after ðŸ˜Ž,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rizz206
50,Real Fitness has it all,"Real Fitness is a great spot for getting a great workout and being a part of a tight knit family. Located on the corner of a bustling Playa Del Rey neighborhood, Real Fitness has an intimate set up that youâ€™ll enjoy. Thereâ€™s plenty of free street parking and parking in the lot which if you know LA, parking is always an issue lol. The actual facility has every bit of gear you need and the trainers are downright awesome. Peter and Lucho run Real Fitness to make it a great resource of any age.Personally, I thin this is a great spot if youâ€™re looking for more private high impact workouts and/or travelers looking for a spot to get in a good workout. Additionally, if youâ€™re looking to connect with a community and meet new people this spot is perfect. After an intense workout class last Friday there was a DJ and beers/wine/snacks afterwards. It was pretty awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamcjjohnsonjr
