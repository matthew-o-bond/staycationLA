30,Ok mall with a nice Food Court,"Lots of parking spaces and the typical Macy’s, Marshalls, Victoria’s Secret and Michael Kors stores. The Food Court also has plenty to offer for all tastes. All in all an ok mall.",Fretel1891
40,Get your (vintage) groove on,"Granny Takes a Trip-trust me on this. The place to go for vintage clothes and records (no downloads or MP3’s here). The shop is new and ran by a dear sweet lady. She also has vintage concert billboard posters as the decor (not for sale). Great place to slow down and discover what WAS instead of what’s disposable.Afterward, go to the food court and a movie. Best small scale eatery there is the Mongolian BBQ place or Hot Dog on a Stick. They also have a new virtual reality game center and roller coaster simulation ride. Cost of the ride is $7.00 for one, $10.00 for two and the ride is “long” (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes) and have a chose of 11 options. I personally miss playing Defender and Zaxxon in the arcade but that was FUN!",romplep
