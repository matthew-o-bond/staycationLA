50,A surprising treasure nestled in the middle of Hollywood Hills.,"Nestled at the foot of the Hollywood Hills, the Monastery of the Angels is a hidden treasure. The cloistered Dominican Nuns of the community are dedicated to perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Visitors can join the nuns for prayer in a special guest chapel, separated by a screen and central altar. In the gift shop, the famous Monastery Pumpkin Bread is available. Molto buonissimo! This place is a great blessing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EugenioSalandra
50,A Zen and Spiritual oasis right in Hollywood,"First off, you do NOT need to be Catholic (or even religious) to enjoy this little space and meditation area. Ever visit a place that you just KNEW was spiritual? This is one of those places - you don't know why, but you KNOW. You feel it. This is a very tiny garden, prayer chapel, and gift shop. It is a tiny Dominican cloistered nuns' retreat home (and yes, the most delicious pumpkin bread is for sale, it's how they support themselves). It contains a very small garden, a few tiny meditation statues, and a prayer chapel. Inside the gift shop are religious items for sale, some sweet homemade baby gifts, and yes, that pumpkin bread. (it freezes very well -but you'll be tempted to eat it in one sitting, it's that good.)If you are feeling heavy hearted, if you have a sudden need to mix up your day, feel better, overcome a burden, or just need a moment to breathe and reflect in a busy city, then this is it. Tourists and locals welcome.NOTE: this is a QUIET space. This is really deliberately kept quiet so others can pray/meditate/reflect. It is an area for peace and quiet, not an area to let the kids run around or converse.It is a beautiful space for anyone feeling depressed, battling illness, visiting someone at the hospital, or just those seeking a spiritual oasis retreat. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354dorothys
50,Delicious Pumpkin Bread!,This was a very tranquil spot that requires a fair amount of walking if you are using public transportation. A loaf of their pumpkin bread was $12 but so delicious. We spent a few minutes sitting in their courtyard and chapel area - much needed to decompress! The Hollywood sign is also visible from this street for pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture465502
50,But if paradise,This monastery is a bit of paradise in the middle of hectic Hollywood. The gardens are small but beautiful. The nuns make the very best pumpkin bread. They also do great peanut brittle and chocolate candy which can be purchased in their store.We stop at the monastery at least twice a year and always enjoy the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4366ZRjohnc
40,Came here for quiet time and chocolates,"Whenever I find myself around Hollywood I would come to my tranquil corner that is this monastery. Nothing so special, it's a quaint place but helps me unwind and think. I do come here however for their chocolates, which has the flavor and texture of Almond Roca, only flat. These confections are excellent and I find myself buying a lot of boxes. After all they are made by the nuns and purchasing them helps with the upkeep of this little ""home"" away from home. If you have any religious friends that come to LA direct them here, or buy their chocolates as a gift to bring home. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Franzsy
50,Daily Mass...,"There is only 1 Mass each day, but what a beautiful way to start your day. Weekdays at 7 am, Saturday at 6:30 am, Sunday at 7 am this is a Latin Mass. Beautiful Chapel, and it seems that there is Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament all day. If you are visiting the area, stop in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871dianeg
30,Not really worth it,"This monastery is nothing really that special. It is kind of weird that in the middle of LA there is this silent monastery, but you cannot get on the grounds. You can go into a chapel and a gift shop where there is amazing pumpkin bread but that is hardly worth the effort to get there. We bought the bread bc everyone said it was great, but do not go out of your way to get bread.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525karenj
50,Come for the bread and chocolates!,"The Monastery is a lovely little piece of solitude in Hollywood. If you enjoy ""under-the-radar"" food destinations, definitely come here and take home a few loaves of the delicious pumpkin bread. Yes, it's $9.00, but you're helping the nuns keep their cloister open.The bread makes a great gift, and the chocolates are yummy too. It's a unique way to taste your way through Hollywood. I'm glad I went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baconpie
50,"Small, but worth the visit","I loved the afternoon I spent at the Monastery of the Angels. It's not necessarily that close to any other tourist attractions (it's walking distance from, but not next to, Hollywood & Vine and the tail end of the Walk of Fame), in a more residential part of Hollywood where the hills and the sign are easily visible. It's actually at the end of a house-lined cul de sac, in a very quiet area that makes prayer and meditation a lot easier than it would be in most other parts of LA. There isn't much open space around the chapel and the monastery, but there are two lovely, well-maintained courtyards with beautiful religious statues and space to sit or walk around. The chapel is quiet and excellent for prayer. You may not think there's much to see if you're not interested in going there to pray, but I definitely recommend it for Catholics and people of other faiths who are looking to spend a bit of time away from busy LA to meditate.The gift shop is also really nice, run by friendly Dominican nuns who know that their visitors are there for different reasons, so there are a lot of religious items, some of them the same kind of stuff you'd find in most church gift shops like prayer cards or plain rosaries, but also some nice medals, books, and handmade items. There are some nice gift items as well - their antique teacups are really cute. And then there are the sweets. Everything looks so delicious, but I only tried the pumpkin bread after reading so much about it. It's as great as they say it is. It may seem a little steep to spend $9 (yes, now it's $9) on a loaf cake, but it's completely worth the price! So unbelievably good. I should have bought a dozen of them and stuffed my suitcases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thenextkristin
50,A piece of Heaven in Hollywood,"After reading from the different articles mentioning the difficulties that this convent was encountering, I finally took the car and went to pick up the 'Famous"" pumkin cakes.The first time visitor of Los Angeles will enjoy the vista offered at the end of Gower street :the HOLLYWOOD sign.The little convent offer the best pumkin breads on thie planet.Well worth the detour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
30,The Monastery is mediocre,"I was psyched up to go here after reading all the reviews and the place is extremely friendly. The good news was that I was the only tourist there on a Saturday. While I am not religious and I am not Catholic, it was interesting to attend the prayer of the Rosary at 4:00 PM which they have daily. However, you cannot see the nuns pray as they are behind in the private area. You can hear them because they open a door and let you listen in.The pumpkin bread is good, but it is $8.00 a loaf. It really was not worth it for me to go there and spend time there to buy a loaf of pumpkin bread that they make in huge batches. Just my own thoughts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
40,Try the bread.....,The bread was sooooo good. Very interesting place.... tucked away in the middle of LA... Worth a side trip if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babygggeee
