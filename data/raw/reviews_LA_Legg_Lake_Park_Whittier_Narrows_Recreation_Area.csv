50,Awesome huge park,We came here to attend the Chocolatito 5k run event. What a great park and it's huge. I haven't been here in over a decade and I can't believe how the city maintains it. The park is clean and very pleasant in nature. The birds are so friendly and don't fly away or run away when you come near them.,Creeping_Death_LA
50,My favorite place to go for a Jog!!,"Great place to go and exercise! I usually go in the morning and love watching the birds gather. The distance varies, as they have multiple paths to run. In addition to the exercise, you can take out a paddle boat, or let the children play on one of the many playgrounds scattered around.",80JAY25
50,Legg Lake Park,"Distance walk from my house, come here every morning to exercise and enjoy the view of the lakes, love feeding bread to the bird, squirrels and ducks.....easy access to park and restroom.",Sreng L
30,Hand feed the water birds,"Great interaction for children with migrating geese, resident white geese, mallard ducks and coots. Take a couple loaves of bread and have them eating out of your hand.The place is quite a sprawl but the greens are burrowed over by gophers and squirrels. Nice paved walkways for boards, bikes and walks, some kids play structures.Center is a lake that has rental water craft, check before hand.A small military museum nearby with tanks, tracked and amphibious vehicles, a chopper or two and artillery pieces. 5 dollar donation per person, can spend an hour looking at everything closely.",reggie300
40,Large nice park,Legg Lake Park is very large and has a nice 1 1/2 mile dirt and sidewalk path around the park. They rent bikes that you can ride around and small paddle boats on the weekends. Good crowds on the weekends and for Holidays you need to be there early,johnalvarez1963

40,By the lake,"Loved this park, easy parking, lots of shade, picnic benches, and walking trails. Next time bringing lunch & dinner to stay longer. Park closes at dusk. I brought my own chairs to sit & rest comfortably. Worth the drive and the views of the wildlife was a treat. Bring duck & bird food if you like. It is easy access off the freeway. The lake seems endless and its great if your a runner or walker like me. The restrooms are located near the parking lot and for park restrooms surprisingly clean. Did not submit photo because you will have to see for yourself. If you have little ones there are swings and sand. Every little one that I saw were enjoying themselves with their bikes & toys.",Leticia Chavez P

50,The Duck Park,I've been coming here my whole life. During the day it's amazing to walk around the lake and see all the ducks and other animals in the park. Beware!! DO NOT GO AT NIGHT!! It fills up with drug addicts.,Lamberto R
40,Family day,"I usually come here to run or bike either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. This park attracts many people and the park can get full during weekends. I recommend for family gatherings and early morning walks. People fish also but not sure if I would eat any fish since the water looks dark and murky. This park also accommodates for many other hobbies such as small boat racing, small airplane via remote control, boat peddling and other things.",Global647820
