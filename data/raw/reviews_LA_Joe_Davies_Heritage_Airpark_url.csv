40,Plenty of photo opportunities,"Great spot for photo taking, having a quiet time and enjoying a short picnic with someone or just a quick stop by.",Tipmore

20,"Blackbird Airpark Great, Heritage Terrible","Went the Blackbird Airpark 23/06/19 which was great. Got to talk to a great gentleman who flew the SR71. What was disappointing was I waited over 2 hours for the Heritage to open and it didn’t, even though it should have done at 14.00hrs. Not happy,I’d like to thank the staff at the Blackbird Airpark for their time. Great pieces of aviation history on show.",JaygeeH
50,The Sky's the Limit,"A fascinating looik at some of the interesting planes which the area has produced. A couple of years a =go, I met one of the pilots of the SR-71 there.",Robert P
40,Next to Blackbird Airpark,On the edge of Palmdale Regional Airport the museum has about 20 aircraft on show with as the most noticeable the Boeing 747 which was used to carry the Space Shuttle and a B-52.,Fred W
50,Very Kool,"Lots of cool stuff to catch up on if you're into aerospace military and defense. The area is very windy, so if it's cold you might want to dress appropriately.",beenie124
50,A GREAT SIDE TRIP,We had friends from out of town who were in the air force with my husband. This was the perfect destination. They had worked on many of the air craft. Now for me I found it amazing to get so close to the planes. The plane that carried the shuttle Endeavor is here. If you go to the California Science Center you will see the Endeavor close up and it is huge. So imagine it piggyback on the plane here in Palmdale. There are also fighter planes of all shapes and sizes. A small gift shop with more information and it is FREE. Kids were enjoying it as well as the adults. There is a soda machine but no food. Plenty of parking. All level ground so easy walking. Take a camera or cell so you can have friends and family with a super background. All in all a good place to visit.,Sportsmaven
40,Small but interesting collection.,"Located just next to the Blackbird Airpark this is small but interesting collection of US, mostly military aircraft. Of note are one of the B747s which used to carry the Space Shuttle and a B52.Entrance is free but donations are appreciated. Check the opening hours especially if you’re coming from afar.",ADXBS
40,"Be aware, shorter summer hours","I arrived at 1350 hours to find the gate being locked in front of me.I could only view and photograph from outside the fence. The displays I could see were very good, especially for being displayed outdoors.",Steven P
50,Good Planes on Display,Went to this to see the airplanes that were on display and it was worth it. SR71 Blackbirds and NASA 747 Space Shuttle carrying planes are always worth seeing.,Jim K
40,Outing,Wow what a great display of plane . Nice to see them up closes. It was really laid out nicely. And had a great variety of planes to see and take great pictures of. A must place to go.,Janet G
50,Aviation History of Southern California,"When NASA Space Shuttles landed at Edwards AFB, they were ferried back to Florida on modified Boeing 747s. Joe Davies Heritage Airpark is the retirement home of one of 2 planes that flew those trips. The 747 was built in 1973, and flew for Japan Air Lines before NASA bought it in 1989. Boeing modified it with struts to hold the shuttle, and extra vertical stabilizers.This exhibit is located immediately next door to the Blackbard Airpark, which houses other interesting historical aircraft, but under different ownership.",Ernest Kung
