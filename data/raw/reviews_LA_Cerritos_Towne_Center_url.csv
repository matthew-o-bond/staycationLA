It was clean it had recliner chairs in all movies, a play area that has crafts, game consoles and kids options for parents that want to watch a movie that is not for their kids. Basically built in child care. They have a bar that allows you to bring a beer into your movie. Prices for food was way better than Regal with large soda or popcorn a one time refill on either.
