50,SCENIC -HISTORIC - GREAT DINING,"Enjoy beautiful architecture - great dining in the station or less than a block away famous Philippes French Dip Sandwich - or great Mexican Food at Olvera Street. If you have time take a quick trip to Santa Monica or to Hollywood & Vine and dine at Musso & Franks, or Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel by the pool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShermanOaks2019
50,Nice spot,The station is well maintained and often hosts concerts or exhibitions. It is part of Los Angeles history and I would recommend a quick visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannastefaniph
50,A great place to stop for a drink,We stopped but Union Station during our visit to Olvera Street. The art deco design is beautiful. They have a lobby bar that is a great place to stop for a cocktail or beer after you've been walking around downtown. We had some special requests and the bar tender did not disappoint!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccarthk2018
40,A Nice Place to See. Very Clean!,We read about Union Station and had seen photos so decided to make a visit while in LA. We had no travel plans through the station but wanted to see the architecture first hand. The station is a National Historic Landmark and was quite impressive inside. We found the station to be very clean (no bad smells) with a fair amount of security officers and a few transit police officers keeping an eye on the place. There were very few transients on site and the big classic leather chairs were roped off for use by ticketed passengers only.There were a few restaurants on the premises and a beer pub on sight too. This is a great place for photography and worth a visit if you have some extra time. The area is a little sketchy outside around the station and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd would want to be in the area after dark. We took and Uber mid-day and then after our visit walked up the street to Olvera Street (another good place to visit close by) and had lunch. We liked Union Station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs
50,On of Americas historic train stations.,What a huge place. This is one of Americas beautiful historic train stations. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and make sure you know which street you are headed for. It's easy to get lost. A great way to arrive in Los Angeles by train. Lots of parking close by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenotheViking
30,Beautiful station ruined by homeless community surrounding!,"Regular visitor to LA but my last visit was the first time I ever went to Union Station, traffic surrounding it was extremely busy and I was surprised to see how big the homeless community was surrounding it.The station itself is beautiful inside. There's a few refreshment options which was convenient before boarding our train. Only problem I found with the station itself is that there's a lack of screens showing what platform your train is departing from which resulted in having to locate a member of staff (which proved difficult in itself) to ask where to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Decj0791
50,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è This Station,"I absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è this station! This station had Starbucks, Subway, Coffee Shop, Salad Shop, Convenient store, Baskin Robins, and a few restaurants. It also has every mode of transportation. The Megabus, Metro link, Flixbus, Amtrak, Metro bus, subway rail. Plus buses to USC, LAX, and transportation to various sporting events. Only down side is the sitting area is crowded and pigeons fly around unless you have a Amtrak/Metro link ticket üé´ then you can sit in the nice seats at the main entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marie0223
30,Traveling through Union Station,In LA to go to the Rose Parade we took the Metro from Union Station. There were a few helpful station attendants on our way to the parade but in the evening there were few people to give out information on which trains to take to and from the Staples center. The yellow line did take us to the Parade and we only had to walk a few blocks to Colorado Blvd. The trains are clean and the seats though small are comfortable. The station itself is typical of most train stations. The information booth was closed. My guess is this was because it was New Years Day. The station is clean. The bathrooms are typical to those in a train station. There are a few eateries in the station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12
40,Easy arrival into old-Hollywood glam,"We took the last train out of San Diego into Union Station, ahead of our flight out of LAX. By the time we pulled in to Union Station, everything was closed up and the night crew was working on cleaning and mopping, so there were quite a few cones and machines to dodge as we made our way from the tracks to the entrance.Still, I found I loved the feel of this station. It was all wood and gleam and high ceilings, and it made me smile. The holiday decorations were also lovely, with the lights sparkling off of the surfaces - it added to the overall glam feel of the place.It was easy to make our way to the entrance, and to find the spot designated for ride share pick-ups (not that that distinction seemed to matter much at that time of night).They had a few guards roaming the building and the space at the entrance, which was nice to see.I'm not sure about having to wait for a departure, but it was an easy experience for a late-night arrival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimeyTravels

We first saw it at night and it looked wonderful, framed with palm trees.With a number of inherent attractive architectural styles, in particular the Art-Deco tradition is exemplary.

50,Fantastic service in Amtrak Business Lounge,"It was not clear at first where to check in but once we found the Business check in past the normal check in, round the corner and up the stairs the service was second to none. There was one lady organising travellers and she did an amazing job. Incredibly efficient, forceful but extremely polite. I wish I could remember her name as she desrves a mention as the lounge was extremely busy. We enjoyed the whole Amtrak experience on the Pacific Surfliner to San Diego and will definitely use the trains again. Compared to UK train fares it was incredible value for money. Thank you for brilliant service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potterfan10

10,Budget Car Rental at Union Station--Don't waste your time,"This was a pretty bad experience with the sales clerk at Budget Car Rental. I had booked days in advance and when I called to tell them I was running 15minutes late for pick up. The clerk responded, ""Oh, I didn't call you? I thought I called you. Well, we don't have any more cars."" He was flippant and did not care. He told me to call another Budget place or call corporate. I was on vacation mode and didn't want to yell but got the corporate number and had to deal with a lot of ""Unfortunately"" statements. I now know why my friends always choose places like Hertz.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4629MDjenniferc
40,Quite a site but keep your eyes open.,"US Los Angeles is quite a site to see. Old historic architecture and newer upgrades are a good blend of old and new. It can be crowded (L.A. and all) with passenger and commuter travelers but moving around has been made easier over the last decade.I've made connections here a few times going between AZ and WA State. One time I was connecting with the Coast Starlight and I got to wait in a lounge which was nice (For sleeping car passengers) Then rides out to your train.Now for the ""Keep your eyes open"" part...The place is littered with homeless people. You'll see them sleeping in some of the sitting areas. One time, at night, catching a train back to AZ, I encountered a very scary guy in the men's room who said nothing, just tapped me on the shoulder and motioned he needed money. I very quickly moved around him and exited. My advice is if you're waiting for a train just take an inventory of who is seating in the waiting areas and you'll be fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coder

20,Business/First class metropolitan lounge at Union Station,"Traveling with my senior parents, it was suggested that we wait for our train in the Metropolitan lounge (Business class). We left a somewhat quiet, lovely waiting area (for train tix holders) and went upstairs to the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù lounge. Upon entry we were sure we entered the complaint department in a shabby, tight, congested waiting area. Nope, it was the Metropolitan lounge. Luckily, we were only on a quick trip down the coast, but we heard some sad stories about Amtrak missed/running late connections. And the hot, stuffy, cramped lounge just added the right amount of salt to the wounds. Skip this lounge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twill77131

40,Beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright design and homeless in the bathrooms,"Union station is a dichotomy - a reflection of Los Angeles. You can walk around the most beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright design, including the furniture he designed, and then have to see the other side of LA, the gritty side. I travel through Union station frequently. Taking Amtrak to San Diego beats driving any day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/concettah667
40,Took a train ride,"We rode the train 2 hours today to get to LA instead of driving to LA and it was very pleasant.The station is very historic and nice inside. As a rider today I would say pay the small extra amount for business class which is by far worth it. There is a really nice lounge with food and drinks, clean bathrooms and nice seating.As a passenger the station is old and dirty but the historical part of the architecture had nothing to do with this. So really there are 2 ways to review - as a passenger or just a tourist stopping by for a couple photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
50,Great!,Loved it! I love trains and the Union Station building is an absolute gem. Beautiful surroundings.

50,Old school since 1939,"I'm always in this area catching the metro, airport bus, or the bus to Dodgers Stadium.

50,Amazing Architecture and Lots of Trains,"Anyone who likes trains, or architecture, or LA should pay a visit to LAUPT.There are lots of areas of the large station to explore, and tons of angles from which to photograph. The whole place is Southwest Art Deco, and recent restorations have preserved or repaired much.Easy access to Amtrak, Metro subway and light rail, Metrorail commuter trains.Helpful staff, plus a safe atmosphere patrolled by police.There are several eateries, ranging from a pretzel stand to crepes to sit-down drinks. Gift shop and news stand available, too.If using ride share or taxi, take note of the designated pickup and drop-off zones marked at the front curb. There's usually a traffic control officer there to keep things moving.Amtrak passengers - if you're traveling first class or sleeping accommodation, take advantage of the Metropolitan Lounge. It's on the second floor; the elevator is around the corner from the Amtrak counter, after the rental car agencies. Snacks, wi-fi, outlets for charging, and Red Cap buggies to take you straight to your train from the lounge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaggageConveyorBelt
50,Beautifully restored!,"This is a real train station/transportation hub that has been painstakingly restored to its glory days. The painting, woodwork and tile are beautiful. The velvet roped off waiting area for passengers only is something to see, as not all stations have them anymore.

Free loading zones are available if you are dropping off or picking up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgep839

It's an easy destination since its the last one, and it is well protected by a number of officers and guards constantly patrolling. It always smells good because of Wetzel's Pretzels nearby and it even has a Ben and Jerry's store! Also holds a couple of other stores, and even has a piano you can play for a good 20 minutes! They even have a section where they still do traditional shoe shining service!! It's a cool little section and its fun for people watching.

30,Interesting old building.,We were travelling on the Coast Starlight Train up to San Luis Obispo - business class seats got us into the Amtrak Lounge where there were refreshments. Not much signage so you're dependent on getting info from others. Train itself was pleasant but with a fairly rough dining car facility (attendants and food). The station goes back to the 1920s or further - interesting architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diedre_11

50,Union Station is something to see!,"It is truly like walking back in time and congratulations to the LA leaders who have preserved the past. You can close your eyes and imagine the soldiers and sailors passing through this beautiful stricture.Built in the 1930s, it served the Union Pacific, Santa Fe, and Southern Pacific Railroads into one terminal station. Conceived on a grand scale, Union Station became known as the ""Last of the Great Railway Stations"" built in the United States. The structure combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.Today, the station is a major transportation hub for Southern California, serving almost 110,000 passengers a day. Don't miss this grand old lady of a train station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367Advisor
50,Train Station!,"Very nice - similar to an Airport - but it is a train station where all kinds of route connection takes place. I wasn't aware that as many vehicles driven in Los Angeles and other California/US cities, that many people as well ride trains. It was a great learning experience. Actually, since I rode a train via LA Union Station, I haven't driven from my home on a work day. Instead, I always take a train from my home to LA; and to USC - there's actually a free bus from LA Union Center to USC. A very lovely place. Give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnkS1650AW

20,Confusing place,I'm a local in LA and this place is not the best. Workers don't know train schedules and are not helpful. You have to ask around to get correct information.

50,Beautful Monument of Bygone Era,"A great public building from the time when train travel was king. A beautiful building which maintains much of its bygone glory.

30,"Train service excellent, bus service Thumbs down","The whole train experience from Van Nuys to San Diego and back to union station was great, but when we get to Union station to catch bus to Van Nuys horrible. No right guidance to get the bus and then when we finally get to it the bus 4591 at 9:49 we get greeted with, "" where you've been and the words your lucky I'm still here!""And to top it off I am a 25 yr Veteran with 100% Disabilities and was told I could not sit in the disability seats, "" to me it doesn't work that way"".

50,Under utilized,"As a local resident since 1979 it was my first time stepping foot in this place. I was surprised how nice it was. Clean, no homeless, graffiti, and most of all less crowd even during rush hour.If you know where you want to go and let go the gridlock freeway then this is the place to do it. Angelinos love their driving so this is an off beaten path so to speak.One thing though, if you plan to Uber or having someone to come pick you up, you better walk outside the station and meet them on the street corner because this place is confusing to locate both the parking structure and the terminal. Or make sure they meet you at the main terminal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
50,Rich history...,"This place is amazing! The rich history, art work, the people and train make for a very exciting day. Olvera Street is across the street and the Downtown Library is close by.

50,‚ÄúAll aboard!‚Äù,"Six years in the making and finally inaugurated in 1939, a visit to Los Angeles Union Station is a fascinating experience.With construction costs shared, the station was the result of a collaboration between leading railroads Union Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe and Southern Pacific to consolidate their depots at one location.Union Station and its surrounding landscape occupy all of 52 acres, for which large parts of the original Chinatown area were demolished. With rail travel on the decline, this was the last of the grand railroad stations to be built in the US.The terminal has most striking architecture ‚Äì an innovative blend of Art Deco, Spanish Colonial and Mission Revival styles now commonly referred to as Mission Moderne.The most dominant feature of the building is its Art Deco walls. The architects of this monumental edifice were the Parkinsons ‚Äì the father and son team of John and Donald who founded The Parkinson Firm of Los Angeles.Within the building, wood panels, high ceilings, inlaid marble floors, immense 40-foot high arched brass windows, intricate massive chandeliers, colourful tiles, a 110-foot long ticket counter crafted from American Black Walnut, hand painted terracotta tiled floors with inlaid marble strips, travertine clad walls, tall glass windows transport one to a different era.The grand passenger waiting area with its comfortable, large, leather upholstered wooden sofas is one more throwback to a regal and gracious era of rail travel.Two really nice touches at Union Station are:- a nicely polished free-to-use piano with a prominent notice that invites people to ""step and show us what you've got ... all players are welcome"". We saw a young man engrossed in playing out a happy tune that livened up the place- four vintage shoe shine chairs that look as grand and as old as the station - and possibly are too!Please see photographs of both these attached to this review.The station‚Äôs iconic Mission-style clock tower goes up a hundred feet. While that may not seem very tall, the clock tower here is regal and striking in its stark simplicity. It still has its four original clocks, each created in brass with 10-foot long hands on a clock face of 20 feet diameter. Topped with a brass lightning rod, the clock tower remains accessible only by ladder.An important feature that makes all the difference is that landscaping was an integral part of this station‚Äôs site design ‚Äì it was Tommy Tomson who brought in the outdoors in the form of Spanish style courtyards, shady arcades and garden patios. He also chose colourful and fragrant plants to deck the station grounds.The entry to the station is adorned by parallel rows of towering palms and bright flower beds. The waiting room is vaulted and flanked by enclosed patios with geometric, symmetrical gardens patterned with red-brick paths.The North patio has a colourful tiled fountain ‚Äì jacarandas shade the benches here. The South patio is dotted with olive trees, orange trees, magnolias, Mexican fan palms, California pepper trees. Relaxing in these gardens one forgets being in the heart of downtown LA!The famous Harvey House restaurant here has interiors designed by master Santa Fe railway architect Mary Colter (who is also noted for some of the major architectural landmarks at the Grand Canyon) who blended American Indian and Spanish aesthetics with modern influences to which she added her own inimitable personal touch ‚Äì for example, the restaurant floor‚Äôs zigzag pattern that resembles a Navajo blanket.One of the last restaurants of a chain that was ubiquitous at major railway stations, Harvey House at Union station closed in 1967. Fifty years later, this space has been revived and has just opened in October 2018 as the home of the Imperial Western Beer Company, a 400-seater restaurant and bar with its own attached brewery.Union Station has featured in movie credits ‚Äì filmed here were movies such as Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can, The Dark Knight Rises. The station also found a listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.Today Union Station is a key intermodal transportation hub for Amtrak intercity passenger rail, Metrolink commuter rail and Metro rail and bus services. Union Station is at once a reflection of LA‚Äôs personality ‚Äì its history, its melting pot of cultures, its grandeur, its colourful vitality, its pulsing life.As the train conductors would have it, at Union Station its always ‚ÄúAll aboard!‚Äù",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon

There are also original ticket kiosks and seats in the waiting area. There are many ""hidden"" art installations to see.

It's hard not to imagine the days of old, when the old ticket counter in front was sill being used and train travelers were scurrying about trying to catch their trains to parts unknown, or weary travelers were resting in the amazing brown leather chairs in the main waiting area. It's so great that we can still enjoy people watching from these very same chairs! And when you look around, it will feel so familiar, because countless movies and TV shows were filmed here over the years. If you're a tourist, do not miss this place!

30,An unremarkable train and bus station that exemplifies mass transit in Los Angeles,"This place has potential, but the tragic nature of LA's fragmented and inefficient network of buses and trains carries through to this hub, where poor signage and a sub-optimal layout may challenge new riders to make timely connections between Metro Rail (the ""subway"" or light rail system), Metro Link/Amtrak (the longer distance commuter and interstate trains) and the multitude of bus lines operated by Metro and a multitude of local cities and transit authorities, all with different names, line numbers, and fares. The station itself is kept fairly tidy and has a few eateries (the coffee place was decent) but overall, there is a significant gap between where this building SHOULD be in terms of usability and functionality, and where it actually is. If you go expecting a train station worthy of a major metropolis, you'll be sorely disappointed. On the upside, there's some great hole-in-the-wall Chinese food a few short blocks away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SACNORAD

50,"Cool and cult place! A ""must do"" tour in Los Angeles downtown!","The central station is known as ""the last great train stations"". It¬¥s a very charming place, with many design styles. it¬¥s an old building, completed in 1939, and full of energy of mllions of people that use the terminal for their trips everyday. It¬¥s an Historic and Cultural Monument and was the location of the movie ""Blade Runner"" (1982).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GladisCosta
20,Should‚Äôve Driven,"We decided to train trip to Santa Barbara, CA and after reading the reviews chose business class thinking we‚Äôd have beverages and snacks.Strike 1They change the boarding track and while they see the platform filled with people waiting, they announce the change 10-15 mins prior to departure making you have to almost sprint to the correct track.Strike 2Business class cost more, is a joke and not truly worth the extra $$$ since you‚Äôre not guaranteed a seat and they switch additional coach cars to business bc the seats are all taken on the business class car. They had coffee, 1 OJ, no water and bran muffins on that 1 business class car that you had to serve yourself.Strike 3The conductor at every stop along the 2.5 hr trip made it a point to tell us how busy the train was, asking 1 to give up their seat if they saw someone standing who needed to sit, seriously, we all paid for a seat so no one should have to give up their seat.They are out!!!!The train could‚Äôve had better air flow, planned better with the beverages so that those of us who paid the extra $$$ could‚Äôve all had better choices other than coffee and bran muffins.Note:Plenty of passengers were upset they were separated, assigned seating would CURE this issue, think about it Amtrak.RIDE HOME NIGHTMAREWe were scheduled to depart on the 7:02 train and needing to leave earlier, CHANGED and were made to pay a whopping $0.98 to leave on the 6:02 train.1. The train was 1 hr and 20 minutes late (actually never showed up). The train that did show up did so to let folks off and when the conductor was asked if it was the 6:02 initially said NO.2. Once told that the 6:02 passengers could board, we did and after the boarding nightmare and issuance if the ASSIGNED seat, we boarded and were finally off to Union Station just before 8pm3. A $6 coupon was issued for the inconvenience and was a joke, by the time u got down to the car with the ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt food (packaged hot dogs, cheeseburgers and pizza), soda, beer, wine and coffee, the supply was almost depleted.4. We did get bottled water, yay!Very poor customer service, not 1 word at the SB Station the 6:02 was late, no ETA, no apologies and no word which train to board!In summary, never need to ride Amtrak again, a waste of money, we could‚Äôve had more fun in the car with our family & friends with snacks we enjoyed and the ability to stop at the beaches along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel1763

40,Amazing Building,"This is very iconic Los Angeles. The building is awesome. If you can, visit this during the summer (mid July) train day festival. Then you get to see the building and have a really fun event to attend--especially for kids 2-8. What's great too, is that it's right next to (walking distance--cross a street) two other must-see attractions. You MUST go to Olvera street. It's the historic ""pueblo"" of Los Angeles. It's a street filled with street shops and restaurants and bands/dancing and all-things-Mexico. Then, take another 2-3 block hike to LA's China town. It's NOTHING like San Francisco's (it's quite tiny) but it's very cool. You;'re gonna see (cheap junk) in shops that you've never seen. You're going to smell smells (great and awful) and see live sea-foods in tanks. It's just one more fun, different (for typical Americans), cultural experiences. Sure, it mostly panders to tourists, but it's far more authentic than a Disney exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454williammarkl

30,"Beautiful building, but have they heard about air conditioning?","We recently completed an Amtrak train ride at Union Station. We had just spent 36 hours on a train from Seattle. We walked outside from the train into the warm, muggy night. At least we'll get back into a cool building, right? Wrong! It was unbelievably hot and sticky while we waited for our luggage, hot in the restrooms, in the main part of the station. It felt better standing outside waiting for our Lyft.

40,Late 40's Movie Set --Now with a Modern Facelift,"The atmospheric architecture belies the fact that this is the transportation hub for downtown. Trains yes. Metro yes. Bus to LAX yes. Easy to get lost and confused ,oh yes, indeed. But for a work in progress not bad at all. So very little is left of the past here that it comes as a surprise that it was not torn down decades ago. Very close to Overia Street and with parking costs as they are this is a good entry point for a visit. I was just there a few days ago to take a friend to TheBus ---going up to the East Bay. It was a bit strange coming in to park. Lane at the far right--buses only..Middle lane --visitor parking. Straight ahead freeway entrance. Too many signs in one small space where you could easily get the wrong idea,or even several. One pass that we found the path to drop off or pick up parking. No charge if you are only staying for a short time. Around a corner into a new food and covered waiting area. Then up to the bus level one flight.of steps. Very new but fits into the style of the old building and works fairly well. We got my friend set up. Said goodby and was back to the car in a very short time. I would never drive to LAX again knowing how well this works and how easy it is for all concerned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divagreta2016

50,1930s Architectual Gem,Many people pass through LA's Union Station without stopping for a short time to appreciate the architectural design and beauty of the various building components. There is even an architectural tour of Union Station. The 1930s tile work is amazing. They now have a series of information photos showing the refurbishment of Union Station which is an ongoing project. Start at the information desk near the Alameda entrance.

50,"Arrive on the train and depart in taxi's, buses, metro, uber","One of the best ways to get to LA is to arrive on an Amtrak train. I took the Sunset Limited from New Orleans to here. There are some nice sandwich shops, and garden landscaped waiting and eating areas to spend time in.Then you have to figure out what to do next. I wanted to go to the Cal Tech book store. The metro or bus transfer option is very complicated I advise a taxi. Then if you want to go from there to Marina Del Rey, try Uber, it is usually much less than a taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drandrewwharrell
50,The Gate Way To Your L.A. Experience,"Weather your arriving or leaving, Union Station offers a quick exit, or a smooth entrance to the city of Angel, providing. numerous departing times, for multi destinations on the Amtrak Train.

30,Convenient travel hub,Have used this station a couple of times for Amtrak connections. It can be a bit confusing as small and not well signed (especially for international tourists who do not understand the system). Best to ask someone when you arrive what counter to actually stand in as the queues for first class are not clearly marked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenA2853
40,Art Deco at Its Best,"Forgive my biases--I love majestic, iconic railroad stations. Union Station is magnificent. The station is art deco in style and has been more or less lovingly maintained. It is a busy transportation hub that invites a lot of admiring looks: the wooden ceiling, incredibly beautiful light fixtures, Pullman-style chairs, tile floor--all tie together in an aesthetically pleasant and functional style. There is room for improvement in terms of signage which is at best confusing and at worst absent. (I never have found the arrivals board and the destination board has limited information). The traffic flow is also problematic: the Information Booth is in no man's land (though the people there are helpful) and the track assignments are not clear (track numbers with ""A"" and ""B"" entries?) Architecturally, it doesn't get better; Functionally, it could be improved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555NotGreat

Costed 35 cents (senior off rush hour fare!), it took us 45 minutes to do it, no hassles and save us at least USD 90.Less spectacular than NY Central Station, but Union Station still keep its old charm and fulfill its functionality.Duy NQuebec City, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DNCanadaVN

50,An Awesome Expereince,"We booked at the Metro Plaza Hotel which is only a two block walk from Union Station which worked out wonderfully! The station is the transportation hub of LA. We were able to connect with any transit we needed and the subway as ALWAYS on time. The buses were less reliable (you can understand when you see LA traffic) but I found using Google Maps was better than the LA transit app. Loved the architecture of the station, clean bathrooms, food options and just the bustle of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture465502

40,April 2016,"This is one of the most interesting Union Stations around the US. It has good connections to local transit. There us even a Dodger Express on game days to and from the station, really helpful. While the main waiting room isn't very large, the seats are nice and big, there is a time limit. It is real close to various ethnic areas for different food options. If you can use the Amtrak lounge, nice chairs--they have charging stations in them. You also have a nice possibility of getting some air through the back. The bus terminals are through the station. The Red line is on the lowest floor. Normal food options are good. Signage and information are good and eaxy to read.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933reeds
40,Big,"When arriving we accidentally went to the Metro side of the station. I saw no clear sign as we exited the track as to which side is which. It was funny because the Metro side looks really nice and up to date. While the Amtrak side, is clearly outdated and needs refurbishing. The announcements at times can be hard to hear, but there are huge TV monitors that let you know which track your train will be on. I suggest making your way to your track 20 minutes before departure time. We had track 13 which is pretty much on the complete opposite end of where the Amtrak waiting area is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADELAV833

20,Weekend trip,We had never taken the train to LA and thought riding up from San Diego may save time and let us chill versus strain. The trip was slow and boring( no really exciting views after Oceanside.The station was big and we asked the police where to go. We were picked up by an Uber driver who didn't know how to find us at the passenger pick-up east side.On our return we grabed a subway sandwich in the station and went down to the outdoor tracks to wait. Trip home was faster. Or so it seemed. I would never do it again if I didn't have to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickipadula
50,Girls Train Trip,What a beautiful station. The recent restoration of this station is stunning! We arrived early enough for out train trip up the coast to be able to have time to enjoy the details. Everyone we talked to at the station from the Amtrak security to the waiter at the Crepe restaurant were extremely friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancymC8721SF
50,Arriving Union Station via Amtrak Coast Starlight,"Beautiful station. On the National Register of Historic Places. We passed through, arriving on the Amtrak Coast Starlight, baggage in hand, catching a taxi to the Millenium Biltmore. It pays to stop and ask directions to the taxi stand, as we followed a sign which took us in the wrong direction. Alternatively I could have asked the Amtrak Red Caps to help with our luggage, as they had nice little carts that were whizzing folks around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidW12935

40,A spectacular building.,"Whilst I would not have come to Union Station unless I was accessing public transport, I was very impressed by it. The high ceilings, majestic lighting, and the ornately patterned walls make the whole building really stunning. On top of that, the 'approach and use' piano means you get to her occasional ad-hoc performances by some great piano players (and some not so great ones!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/df86
50,Surprisingly Organized Train Station,"Normally, as an American, I don't think of our public transit system as efficient or convenient but a recent trip changed all of that. We took the Amtrak Surfliner from Oceanside to Union Station. As soon as we got off the Surfliner a gentlemen in a passenger cart offered to shuttle us to our connection. By accepting his ride we took 15 minutes off our walk time....highly recommended if you have a tight connection. We took 2 different lines to Santa Monica and returned later in the day. We had almost 2 hours before our Amtrak left so we explored the station. I think it's a combination of Art Deco and some local Mission Style architecture. Worth taking some pictures. For the number of passengers travelling through there every day, it's surprisingly small. Everything was clean in the passenger waiting areas. The toilet facilities were dirtier than the filthiest porta potty I've ever seen. Unfortunately if you decide to eat or have a drink in one of the restaurants inside, your only choice for a restroom is the aforementioned. Lots of police making the rounds and plenty of station employees to assist with directions or an outside dinner recommendation (my favorite is Philippe's Original French Dip.....2 blocks away and an L.A. landmark eatery).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2dogbutts
40,Beautiful and historic train station,"While not worth a special trip, you can incorporate a visit via the metro link and make your way to Chinatown, Olvera Street, and other east downtown attractions. From a functionality standpoint, it is a very well laid out for connections between metro, urban rail, and Amtrak. The main sitting room is just gorgeous and worth a walk to if in the station already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsj5777
50,A downtown L.A. Landmark,"The station opened in 1939, and is a California eclectic mix of moderne, art deco, and mission/Spanish architecture. For those who love to travel by train, it is convinient and easy to buy tickets, and Uber, Lyft, or light rail close to most of the city. Worth a trip just to admire the building and see what America could do in the midst of a Great Depression in terms of public projects. Have a meal or a drink at Traxx Bar and Restaurant, and soak up the atmosphere; it's like stepping into an old L.A. noir novel, only it all ends well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinC4333

50,Beautiful structure,"Easy to navigate.I am a fan of the architect, Mary Colter, who designed many of the buildings at the Grand Canyon. She also designed an area here (The Fred Harvey Room). It is currently being restored and was not open to the public when I was here. However, I could catch some glimpses of it through the windows. Her has an interesting story and the area is definitely worth a visit when it is eventually reopened.This was our first time traveling on Amtrak.

40,A true transportation hub of LA,"Years ago, LA Union Station was rather empty and not really part of the regional transportation landscape servicing only a few trains that were rarely on time. Now it has been transformed to be a true hub of transportation for the region. The rail system is centered on Union Station and you can go out to many locations from there. It ties AMTRAK with Metrolink, Metro Rail subway and light rail lines, Metro Buses and other bus systems, including busses to LAX. It is a beautiful station with more places to eat and is very alive. Close to Civic Center and across the street from the historic Olvera Street and Plaza of LA, it is in a strategic location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

Today, so much growth has occurred around the station, which itself has undergone renovation without sacrificing the Deco charm. When in town, I take the train down to San Diego - it's easy to navigate the station and get yourself to the appropriate tracks; there is an Information booth right at the entry if you need that, and a handful of food outlets. You can buy your scannable Amtrak ticket online. Personally, if you can avail of some train travel over renting and getting into a car, I think it's worth the experience, and this central transportation hub makes things easy and while getting a huge visual treat and history lesson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101

40,Vintage L.A. Transportation Hub Comes Alive,"Born and raised in Los Angeles, it's funny to think that me and my contemporaries grew up in cars, rarely buses, and never even thought of subways and trains. Today's Union Station changes all of that. Its now the up of all of the above.I have a couple of clients in downtown L.A., and I never drive there. Instead, I park in North Hollywood, pay a couple bucks, and 24 minutes later I'm in downtown. Saves on gas, time, and aggravation. And the end of the line is Union Station.I occasionally commute to San Diego. I start out on the same subway, then hop on the Amtrak at Union Station. It's WAY more productive, I can get something to eat, use the restrooms, and even wifi.But I digress, those are the USUAL reasons to go to Union Station, for the transportation (a central bus depot and light rail depot there as well!Want some retro fun? Just take an hour or two to visit. The architecture is AWESOME. Art deco baby!For glimpses of it, think back to movies like Sunset Blvd., Bugsy, and To Live And Die In L.A. Or think of music videos from Fiona Apple, Brian Setzer Orchestra, and yes, Farrell's Happy!Hungry? Casual, there's Subway, Wexel's Pretzel's, and Trimana. There's T&Y Bakery, a Starbucks, and more. For a nice dinner, try Traxx Restaurant after 5 (call ahead for dinner reservations).Get your shoes shined, visit the gift shop, or my favorite, borrow a bike. Yes, there's a Metro bikeshare right out front (fee to ride). Hope the subways or buses to Union Station, grab a bike, and take off for Olvera Street, Disney Concert Hall, of if you have 20 minutes (about 2.5 miles), ride to Straples Center, L.A. Live, and the L.A. Convention Center.Lots of people avoid downtown L.A. because of traffic and parking, but Union Station is a cool place and a springboard into Downtown and all it's museums, restaurants, bars and attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBillyHill
50,An Iconic Art-Deco Railway Station and Transit Hub,"Union Station is an iconic railway station built back when grandeur was in style. It has been fully restored over the last few years to its original art deco appearance, and as the major Los Angeles rail hub it still has a vibe reminiscent of the old days. The building itself is awesome, and there are also pleasant courtyards worth looking at. Apart from looking around, you can enjoy any of several restaurants and fast food places in the building, and many more are available in the nearby Olivera Street district.As for travel, Union Station is the primary Los Angeles terminal for Amtrak, the eastern terminus of the Metro Red and Purple Lines, and eastern terminus of the Gold Line. It is served by numerous bus lines, and if you drive there you can park under the adjacent Patsaouras Bus Center. Hertz and Budget both have car rental offices in the station, very coinvenient for arriving passangers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00

It is a historic building and nicely decorated with Spanish flavor.It is conveniently located. From here it is walking distance to some interesting sights, such as Chinatown, Little Tokyo, and Olivera Street. It is also photogenic.However, as a train station, I do not think it is very user friendly. There are not many places to sit. The selection of restaurants and cafes is anemic. There are also no place for luggage storage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saricie_Q
50,Uncomplicated,"One of the best stations I've been to. There are trains and buses plying from the Union Station. On entering, there is art all around. It feels as if one has entered a museum.

50,You get a taste of LA in a different way,"I am from Long Island originally, and am somewhat used to taking trains in and out of the city. I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Union Station for the first time. It was pretty clean, spacious and easy to navigate. There are different colored lines for where you need to go and machines to refill or buy new metro cards (day passes or just one rides) ... convenient and not difficult to deal with. Trains were on time. There were a few straggling homeless people, but you can always expect that in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicityfeline
30,We only go here if we have to,"I'm not sure why someone would go to Union Station to look around. The signs inside are helpful for finding your connecting train. The bathrooms are really nasty, my husband and I play rock, paper, scissors to see who has to take the toddler to the bathroom because neither one of us wants to go to the bathrooms here. The flyaway bus to LAX is nice and the whenever I have had questions all of the employees here have been helpful. There are always lots of police here but I barely see any police anywhere else on the metro's trains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sruthp
40,"An architectural marvel, but a sometimes confusing travel experience.","A recent renovation and restoration of the ornate lobby ceiling and ongoing art exhibits throughout the tunnels to the trains helps ease the usual anxiety of traveling. You can catch Amtrak and local Metro trains from the station, which is on the near outskirts of the booming neighborhoods of Downtown Los Angeles.The retro station has adapted to modern needs by upgrading the food options, creating designated zones for shared rides and keeping the lobby seating open only to ticketed passengers. However, the FlyAway Bus drop off in Patsaouras Transit Center is more cumbersome than ever, now that cars and taxis have to drop passengers inside the parking garage. From the garage, you have to figure out without the help of signage how to schlep your luggage up a ramp, into an elevator, across a roadway and down to the ticket booth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryValli
40,Great travel hub connecting all of LA!,"I love traveling through Union Station in downtown LA, mainly for its historic beauty. It's also clean and I do feel safe there. The only downside is the bathrooms. They're small and need to be updated to accommodate the level of traffic traveling through the Station. Food options are limited but sufficient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaK321
50,Beautiful symbol of LA's transportation evolution,"Opened in 1939, Union Station was the last of the great rail stations built during the heyday of rail travel. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The interior, decorated in the Art Deco style, is beautifully preserved. Some of the original furnishings are still in use today. In the 1990's, Union Station was re-purposed to serve as a transportation hub for Los Angeles Metro subway, Amtrak and MetroLink. It is a beautiful building and is home to LA's transportation evolution for almost a century. If you are an architect or rail buff, a tour of this historic building should be on your bucket list.Located in downtown LA, Union Station is a few blocks away from Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Japanese American National Museum, Olvera Street, and Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.Within Union Station, you can catch the Metro Red Line to connect to the Blue Line to Long Beach and the Expo Line to Santa Monica. The Blue Line will connect to the Green Line that will take you to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). On the Red Line you can reach Kaiser Sunset Hospital, Children's Hospital, Pantages Theatre, Hollywood, Universal City and North Hollywood. The Metro Gold Line will take you eastwards to Pasadena and ending in Azusa, until the next extension to the line is built.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethB217
50,LAX to Union Station--NICE!!!,"Discovered the fastest--and probably cheapest--way to escape LAX and end up at the gorgeous Union Station landmark. Outside LAX ground transportation is the FlyAway shuttle bus to Union Station. Had to wait about 15 minutes, but I hopped right on and ended up at Union Station faster, cheaper, and easier than having my brother pick me up (especially since he overslept and forgot to meet me at the airport-)On arrival at Union Station, the driver instructed everyone to pay for their tickets and then they could get any luggage stored on the bus. At $9.75, cash or credit, it was a bargain!My brother showed up at that point and we got to walk into the 1920's Art Deco Union Station and admire the high wooden beams that reminded us that even Art Deco had to incorporate a Spanish monastery design...it was so beautiful, I almost thanked my brother for being late...almost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C804BKheatherw

I had the opportunity to look around the place, and admire it's amazing architecture from the early 1900s. I sat in the original waiting room chairs, and imagined what it would have been like back in the 1930s. Travel was glamorous back then. Now not so much.

40,A stunning throwback to another time,"Union Station in downtown Los Angeles is a jewel of a building, designed in the Mission style and exuding an air of casual sophistication from another era. The building was finished pretty much around the time that train travel gave way to other forms of transportation, but the city and Amtrak have maintained the structure over the years. Even if you're venturing no further than Olvera Street just a few blocks away, a visit to Union Station is a treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathantA7224YX
50,A Train Station And So Much More,"A Train Station And So Much MoreYou will love the architecture of Union Station and may well see a film or television show being filmed as you enter the station.

Pop your head out of the station and get to the first street and turn right. You will see this Philippes. Yum. If the walls could talk the stories they could tell. Rich and poor have all dined here. Get their famous French dip with blue cheese and a piece of cherry pie for dessert. If on the other hand you turn left you will after about a nine minute walk arrive at Olivera street which is famous for great Mexican food and some great shirts in the shops there.

50,California Art Deco Masterpiece,"I have many memories from my childhood of meeting relatives at Union Station who arrived by train from Texas each year. This beautiful structure built in the 1930's has weathered the test of time and is now a modern transportation hub for the Los Angeles area. Whether you relax in the spacious lobby or walk down the tiled tunnel to awaiting trains you will be amazed at the Art Deco decor. If you look closely you will find the original train schedule board from the early days in the lobby noting the original passenger railroads serving the station, Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and Santa Fe. On our last visit we noted there are now shopping kiosks in the main lobby as well as a Subway, Starbucks and Wetzels Pretzels. TRAXX, a fine dining restaurant, is also located in the lobby area.

50,"This place should be in a movie! Wait, it is!!","If you want Californian history and culture summed up in one place go to Union Station. This place is absolutely wonderful. If you are on a short trip to LA, take time to visit here as well as the theme parks.Look, the theme parks are fun, but they are 'theme parks'. Union Station is the real deal. It is deeply, fully, solidly, authentic. It is a place of art, but mostly a place of work. Real trains come and go. Real people walk through the halls and purchase real tickets to go on real trains.The leather, wood and glass doesn't come from a 1950's movie - they are from the 1950's. Forget the trains. Just spend some time sitting and watching the life of this magnificent centre. Marble floors, marble walls, decorations, attention to detail, the colours that diffuse through the halls and rooms.Some of my favourite movies (Bladerunner, The Dark Night Rises, The Fabulous Baker Boys, to name a few) have scenes shot here. Californian film noir needs Union Station.I am a sucker for trains, so I'm biased in favour of stations. But I think I'm amongst good company when I say this is an architectural triumph. If you're thinking of taking a train in LA (and you should) then make sure Union Station is on the list or stops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367john
50,Walking tour? You must come to Union Station!,"There was in the 60's something called the Santa Fe Railroad Club for train riding afficionados, and my grandmother belonged. Though we were only small children, my brother and I were just old enough to go on some of the trips with her, and they all departed from Union Station.It was a thrill to go back and see the place. Though it's been spiffed up some since those days, the beautiful art deco-ness survives, and there are now a creperie/coffee place and an upscale dining option called Traxx to entertain unticketed visitors like me. There are also these tall wood-and-leather square back chairs that are are original--I remember sitting in them pretending they were thrones.This time I sat in one and imagined the Simon & Garfunkel song ""America"". Though that song was about a bus ride and not a train station, you can nonetheless be endlessly entertained looking for ""the man in the gabardine suit"" whose ""bowtie is really a camera"".

From Union Station you can catch a connecting train to anywhere in Los Angeles. Plenty of trains headed back to the Inland Empire so we didn't have to rush or try to cut our visit short or have a long wait when we were ready to go.

40,I love trains!,"The fact of the matter is that I love trains. So my opinion is a bit bias. Trains are an AWESOME way to travel, and it all starts with the good train station which Union Station is.Now... I've traveled across Europe, India, and some parts of the middle east, so I really can't give it 5 stars, given that, unfortunately, trains are not the main mode of transportation, especially in LA, it is simply not as impressive as some of the train stations I have crossed in my travels.Having said that, the architecture is very nice, it's easily accessible, centrally located, with a good set of routs (this could be improved but I can't fault the station for it, this is more the train providers, but still). The station itself has all the amenities you'd expect with multiple eateries, bus connections, a lounge area, two gardens to hang out in while you wait, and it even has a rental car facility.All in all, a good, iconic train station. Certainly above average, what would really make it a true five star (and again, I really can't blame the station for this as much as the train companies) is the lack of routs. Union station could be an awesome waypoint for travel via trains, but as I mentioned above, unfortunately we Americas are way to dependent on our cars. Trains provide such a wonderful way to travel instead of driving that I simply don't get why our country is not criss crossed with tracks. There is nothing like sitting in a shared space with people you don't know, striking up conversations while beautiful scenic vistas pass you by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shashaness

50,Like Stepping Into Set of LA Confidential,"Walking into Union Station is like stepping back in time to an era of glamour in terms of its beautiful architecture. Of course, DTLA isn't the best neighborhood, so that part isn't great, but it's worth a visit to marvel at the architecture which has appeared in many movies. I believe key scenes in several movies have been filmed here. It might be interesting to watch them right before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad

50,Decade After Decade!,"When I was little (and the world was, perhaps, a bit safer for kids) I could take the RedCar from where I lived (near the ocean) all the way to Union Station alone. I would feel so tiny sitting in the (then and still) gigantic seats in the waiting area. I would walk right across the street and get some taquitos at Olvera Street (with green mystery sauce on it) and then visit the basement candle shop just to smell the hundreds of fragrances. They say it became a rough and seedy area years ago, but I still go regularly and don't find it anything other than perfectly authentic. Lots of places to eat Italian food, Chinese food, and traditional American food as well. Nobody will be disappointed with a visit to Union Station and Olvera Street (two places, one parking space).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kentennen
50,Making a Big Comeback,"I remember when Union Station was on its way to becoming a derelict. When i was dependent solely on Amtrak -- and Amtrak's service was beginning to dwindle -- things looked bad. But then with the new subways, Metrolink lines, and Metrorail, Union Station has become a happening place. There are restaurants, stores, and even a bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimP988
40,Great to get in L.A. and steps from Olivera Street.,I have used the transit to Union City. I always to Olvera Street and ten blocks down one get get to the Grand Central Market. There is now a little funicular that takes you up close to The Broad and Disney Concert Hall for $1 or 50 cents if you have metro/tap card...there is also a very nice restaurant inside the station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/incageisha
50,Classic LA,"One of the most unique buildings in Los Angeles. Everyone has seen it in numerous movies and commercials.The trains run all day long, and there's a great bar, solid restaurant and phenominal people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielkB5299HI
50,"Oh, yes, there are trains too...","Even if America hasn't quite fully rediscovered the appeals of train travel, it has clearly embraced the love, life and romance to be found in many of the country's most historic train stations. The palatial splendor of Washington, D.C., the meticulous display of westward power in Kansas City (including Pierpont's, its restaurant of classic redwood, brass and leather with an inclining ladder to reach its six tiers of bar shelves) and then, perhaps the best of all, the Union Station of Los Angeles-- a gemstone landmark of the city's downtown renaissance.Unlike the ornate limestone museums of other railway capitals, the L.A. has restored its monastic one-story coolness of Spanish Colonial design from its hand-painted paneled wood ceilings to its waiting floors of over-sized leather club chairs and enormous arched windows, comfortable enough to spend the afternoon people-watching without having to bother catching a train. There are three restaurants, all diamond star quality, clearly favorites of people who never leave Los Angeles: Traxx Bar and Restaurant, stylish dining, and Caf√© Crepe, which turns out crepes for every hour of the day, from breakfast croissants and eggs to dessert savouries, a list long enough to impress any Belgian on his way to the Grand Canyon. There is a variety of smaller bake shops and a handful of recognizable stops like Subway and Starbucks. Even the six-day shoe shine & repair stand, overseen by its maestro Marco, is a throne-like section of leather and brass that makes anyone want to shed their sneakers.And because this is Los Angeles, Hollywood, after all, there is an endless collection of street characters, including people who look like they were or should be in show business: at Traxx, two men in the usual black on black outfits of the movie trade, are trading pitches over white wine and the hostess is so theatrical she looks ready to faint on cue. The only thing that's missing is a body, real or just a prop. If you happen to be passing through Los Angeles, make sure you leave a few hours between trains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1982RLwilliamm

When I know my travels will pass me thru Union Station I always allow an extra hour or so to admire the architect and people watch. There are a few places to get food if want to plan a snack into your travels, I often get a pretzel there. You can train watch if you are into that.

50,LA's Central Station,"Union Station was the first place I visited in the States (after transferring from LAX to my hotel) so it was a memorable experience. A popular Hollywood filming location since it was opened in 1939, especially noir detective films, the classic architecture of Union Station is unmistakeable and you feel like you are walking onto a film set from the 40s.The station gets busy around peak times but the mood is more historical & reflective than fast and furious. There are plenty of food outlets and shops & there is a community piano added as part of the 'Play Me, I'm Yours' program which is often used. They also have paid shows & art exhibitions in the famous Ticketing Hall from time to time.At the station you can get a 7-day metro pass that covers the whole of LA & beyond for $25 including stops at Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and many more which I thought was good value.",
50,"Clean, safe and historic!","We arrived at LAX and took the Flyaway to Union Station. It comes about every half an hour. The limo bus was comfortable and clean and we got to Union Station in about 40 minutes. Catching the Metro was easy. We got Tap cards and just loaded them with fares. We took a train ride to San Diego and were able to wait in the lobby with the nice brown leather old fashioned chairs. There were security guards that checked our boarding passes before entering the area. All around there were security guards at entrance areas, so, even with the crowds of people, you had a sense of safety. There were places you could buy snacks and light fare. There was even a live piano player giving Union Station a real flashback to the 50's. Enjoy the beautiful art deco architecture and the modern art on the walls. You can even cross the street for authentic Mexican food on Olvera Street.",
50,"Grwat Service, Beautiful Achetecture! Get a cocktail in the lobby while waiting for your train!","I recommend first class traveling. It's a tiny extra fee and so worth the extra service, prompt delivery to appropriate train and admission to a tiny complimentary waiting room with free ' average ' beverages and a television. The chairs and tables are comfortable and the windows are nice, large and clean; so is the bathroom. ;)First check out the magnificent main lobby. The cocktails and coffees are excellent. Service is prompt, polite, and engaging. A great travel experience!",
50,Center place for transport,We stayed at hotel near to the Union Station hence we used Metro fairly. This is virtually the Central station for city train services further airport bus also starts here. The building looks ancient but very well preserved.

It would be great if there were quality restaurants inside this station, but for now there are only a couple of low quality fast food stations. For travelers who need to get to LAX there is a low-cost FLY AWAY Bus which is available from the east end of the station.

We went to the Chinese American, the Italian American and fire station museums. They were open 10-3. There are other places of interest including a Japanese American museum, a Mexican American area, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Contemporary Arts museum and others.

He was a real ambassador for Union Station and clearly lives and breathes it with a passion.I would recommend looking out for a Red Cap, and seeking their help with directions or even a short tour.The building itself is historic and dates from the 19th century.

Good news, many interesting food places within walking distance including Phillippe's! The art deco interior is worth the walk around the lobby. The massive train ticket sales hall is now preserved for private events but mostly used for a period movie set. When we visit this area, we plan a multi-location walking trip. Can even take the Metro as Union Station is the Metro hub. Trains are now under mild security so accessing the platforms without a ticket is dicey but we have talked our way thru on occasion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7011UDmichaelp

The man who was there when I was there had some interesting stories to tell about the station's past. Old oversized chairs are still in the lobby, but they only want passengers to sit there (We sat down anyway and they didn't kick us out!).

40,Iconic Symbol of Los Angeles,"Built in 1939, the architecture of Union Station is stunning. The building's style combines Spanish Colonial, Mission Revivial, and Art Deco which is known as Mission Moderne. Massive Art Deco Chandeliers hang from the high ceilings. The enormous waiting room is filled with a mass of leather chairs, and is surrounded by dramatic 40-foot windows adorned with brass. The well-maintained floors are made of inlaid marble. The interior of this structure looks like the setting for an Alfred Hitchcock movie. There are several dining choices including Traxx Restaurant and Cafe Crepe. Also, you will find Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, a Subway sandwich shop, Starbucks, and a few other snack shops. Once you exit, it's a short walk across Alameda St. to Olvera St. and Plaza and El Pueblo Historic Park. Also, nearby is Little Tokyo and Chinatown.

If you get a chance, come see it to view an earlier era of Los Angeles that has long passed by.There is a Traxx Restaurant and Traxx Bar that looked kind of interesting.

Across the street from Chinatown, Olvera Street, downtown LA and numerous restaurants and shopping.

Because a flight from San Diego back home would cost an arm and a few toes, we decided to take Amtrak from LA to San Diego and back. Union Station is like stepping back into time, when America traveled at a slower pace and the trip was more enjoyable because you could actually see the countryside on the way to your destination. Going into the older parts of the station is like walking onto a movie set--you can almost see your favorite classic actor/actress getting on or off the train in black and white, as steam swirls and perhaps the rain is falling. The station even has a shoe shine stand, which I didn't know still existed. The train ride itself was wonderful, but that's for another review.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaI5710FE

The Bolt Bus stop is to the right of the front of the building, and you do not need to get into the building to find the drop off/ pick up location.

40,LA Union Station - Improved Food Choices,"Los Angeles Union Station (LAUS) is in downtown Los Angeles on Alameda street, just north of US 101. It is across the street from Olvera Street, and Phillippe's French Dip restaurant is a relatively short walk away.LAUS is a terminal for long distance and local Amtrak train service, and also has Metrolink commuter train service, and the Metro red/purple line subway and gold line light rail service. There are also two bus bays - one for buses that connect with Amtrak trains, the other with local buses and the LAX FlyAway service.Each service has its own ticketing process; Amtrak has staffed windows and machines; Metrolink and Metro tickets are purchased from vending machines (separate machines for each). Metro has day passes for any day of the week; Metrolink has special weekend passes on Saturdays and Sundays only. FlyAway bus tickets are purchased from a dedicated staffed booth at the east end of the terminal.In recent years the station has added several new fast food cafes and restaurants; the Trimana convenience store (somewhat like a 7-11) also sells pre-made hot food.The station has a large waiting room; there are monitors that list train arrivals and departures but no large screen TVs. On mild or sunny weather days, one can also wait in the outdoor rose garden or courtyard. Train stations by nature are much more ""open"" than airports. There are no metal detectors or TSA lines. However, there are 'spot checks' conducted from time to time. The one downside of the station is the relative lack of restroom facilities. Unlike airports, there are two limited size restrooms available; more often that not there are waiting lines.Short duration parking is available at ground level or on the roof; the cost is up to $14. However, that lot does not enable overnight parking; it closes at 10pm. The nearly underground Metro parking garage is available for overnight or longer term parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmercottage

50,Largest Railroad terminal in the West!,"Built in 1939, Union Station is the largest Railroad terminal in the West. Designed by Los Angeles architects Parkinson and Parkinson (they also did City Hall) the main part of the station is Dutch Colonial revival Architecture. The main hall is magnificent - with enclosed garden patios along the sides and marble walls with terra cotta floors that have inlaid marble - something you usually do not see due to the softness of the floors.The extra high ceilings appear as wood but are actually made of steel.There are places to eat and the station has been expanded. Its mostly a fun place to stop in and see some old Los Angeles history.Right across the street there is a park and the oldest church in Los AngelesAttached to the main building to the south is the station restaurant designed by the famed Southwestern architect Mary Colter. It was the last of the ""Harvey House"" restaurants to be constructed as a part of a passenger terminal. Although padlocked and stripped of many interior furnishings, the topology of its vast rectangular space, rounded central counter, and streamlined booths remains. The spectacular inlaid cement tile floor[16] reproduces the pattern of a Navajo blanket.[17] Colter also designed a sleek, Streamline Moderne cocktail lounge, which is closed now as well. In October 2014, the Harvey House space was leased to leading local restaurateurs for a gastropub.The original ticket concourse has 62-foot (19 m) high ceilings and a 110-foot (34 m) counter.

50,A Landmark and a Transit Center,"First and foremost, Union Station is a transit hub, home to Metrolink commuter trains, Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner corridor trains, and the endpoint of several of Amtrak long-distance trains to Seattle, Chicago, and New Orleans. It also hosts a bus plaza and stops for LA Metro's Red and Gold lines. If you can't get there from here, it's not worth going to.Union Station is also a beautiful historic landmark, the last of the big train stations and, in my opinion, only rivaled by New York's Grand Central Terminal as a working train station. Although usually off-limits to the public, you can still see the original ticketing hall and Harvey House restaurant. There are also a two public gardens, with the Metropolitan Water District's fountain direct adjacent.If you're a traveling from Union Station, there are a number of restaurants and shops. There's plenty of seating in the main waiting room. If you're traveling business or first class with Amtrak, I suggest the Metropolitan lounge on the second floor. The station can get very busy, especially during commute hours, and the lounge is a much more comfortable place to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/This_r_serious

30,Better than most train stations,"Union Station with it's iconic architecture is quite beautiful and even though it is not in the most desirable part of Los Angeles it is not something to avoid. The waiting room for the station is a place of nostalgia that feels like you are really going somewhere. Some say it feels like being in church with it's big marginally comfortable chairs and stained glass and bow roof. I would probably not go there as a destination but it is not something to avoid if your travels take you there. Union Station with all the trains and light rail, bus service and taxis definitely is a hub like most cities have and it is quite clean.

Like the home made Ant Farms in a jar. The inside decor of the building is breath taking, The benches are full of life even if when no one is sitting on them. I read a review that said one thing lacking is the number of restrooms. My response to that is, this was built in 1936, at a time when people were just as busy, but patience was a virtue. So keep that in mind. The food and coffee is Pricey. Bring a sac lunch, sit on one of the benches, eat and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2399MHtims
30,Nice Architecture,Kudos to LA for updating Union Station. They have added some upscale restaurants and have events from time to time.

50,An urban gem,"This is perhaps my favorite large American rail station. In the last quarter century many American rail stations have been brought back from a state of decay and transformed into impressive show pieces. Unfortunately many of these currently have little or no focus on the original mission, serving rail travelers. Kansas City Union Station is a huge station that has been beautifully restored and it even has passenger trains, but not many, and the Amtrak portion of the building is largely an afterthought. L.A. Union Station or LAUPT (Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal) still has lots of trains, actually many more than when it began life. It also has a lot more passenger volume than when built although the nature of this traffic has changed from mostly long-hual intercity to commuter and regional business. Though the station did get rundown it was never abandoned and did not become derelict. Today it has become a true urban transportation hub that hums with activity. There is plenty here for those with architectural and historical interests, for those that like to watch trains and/or people. This is a wonderful people and it will be even better when they reopen the old Fred Harvey restaurant area, hopefully soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayned183

50,Take the train or just pop in for some friendly advice,"Travelling by public transport in a new country can be overwhelming but the friendly guy at the information desk took away any trepidation we may have had. He supplied us with maps, gave out plenty of advice and shared his local knowledge with us which was invaluable. And the metro/ tap card was only $1 to purchase and lasts for years (Melbourne, Australia could learn something from this). LA has a great and affordable train system that has had a lot of money spent on it to try and change the travel habits of the city's car crazy inhabitants but it seems they aren't keen to give up their wheels which means the trains are not overly crowded. It is worth noting that LA attracts a lot of homeless people and the area around the station is inundated with people sleeping rough, even during the heat of the day, with people under the influence of drugs and people with obvious mental illness. We felt safe travelling during the day but I was thankful to be in a group when we got out at our stop near our hotel and even then we walked fast as the number of scary characters increased exponentially once the sun went down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462joannef

50,An Architectural Icon of Los Angeles,"Union Station in Los Angeles is known as the central hub for all things public transportation in Southern California. It's busy much of the time due to the fact that it is the starting and ending point for thousands of patrons every year.There is such a difference between buildings from this era to that of 30's and 40's. The focus seemed to be to not only create a building with utilitarian value, but a building that lends itself to becoming a piece of art in permanent exhibition. The interior of Union Station is stunning. Although the style is primarily Art Deco, there are also other influences as well, chief among them Mission Revival.Union Station has been the scene for many movies including, Blade Runner and Pearl Harbor. I have photographed the interior several times. It's not usually a problem, but every time I've done it an Insta Cop has come up to me and asked me what I was doing. The only ""rule"" about photography is that tripods can't be used. Apparently, they might be disguised as a missile launcher .Besides everything else that's been mentioned, there are several places to eat as you enter and also at the end. Much care seemed to have gone into the floor plan, as it is very easy to get around. I get lost approaching my house by the wrong angle, so for me to say this is saying a lot.Lastly, Union Station happens to be right across the street from another famous, iconic place to visit in the City of Angeles, Olvera Street. If you want to eat some of the best Mexican food this side of the border, simply cross the street. You have many to choose from and all of them are beyond exceptional. Through the years, I have eaten at all of them and have never been disappointed.I digress. Check out Union Station.

30,Not too bad,"The station wasn't bad. I was sort of expecting worst. When I walked pass Ben and Jerry's, and smelled those freshly made waffle cone and thought, ""hmm not too bad""We made our way to the Amtrak lounge where we helped ourselves to coffee, cookies, soda and chips. The lounge could have used an air filter/purifier because it smelled a little moldy, but the chairs were comfy. Honestly, I prob would have rated the train station a half star more if it didn't smell.The Amtrak employee manning the front desk was exceptional. He genuinely seemed to enjoy his work which made it a pretty nice place. His cheerful disposition and willingness to assist us with our questions went above and beyond his job description.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDBull

The maintenance staff keeps Union Station in pristine condition and the architecture, floors, ceilings and furniture transport you to another era. If you want to couple this experience with another, try heading to Cole's in downtown Los Angeles for a sandwich afterwards. Ask someone to point you to the door leading to the back room.

50,Awesome Historical Structure Still Functioning for Train and Metro,"December 31, 2016 - While visiting the oldest section of Los Angeles, we stopped at the Union Station. Actually, we took the metro to Union Station from Pasadena and met our LA friend for a walking tour of the area. Union Station is well maintained and is beautiful inside; the ceiling is gorgeous and the leather chairs in the waiting area are iconic and comfortable. Inside the Station are many restaurants, including a Starbucks. It is easy to navigate the Station to get to the train or metor you desire.One thing that is unique is the live notification of outgoing trains. The train waiting area has very comfortable leather seats. When your train is ready to leave, a train employee comes to the waiting area and announces the train and departure time.Near the leather seat waiting area, there is a grand piano that anyone can play while they are in the Station. You don't have to be waiting for a train. While we relaxed in the leather chairs, we were serenaded by a young man who played several classical songs on the piano.We were scheduled to go on a Union Station free art tour on Sunday from 10:30am to 12:30pm, but, unfortunately, I was not feeling well enough to make the journey from Pasadena.

I just took a train up here for the Night on Broadway event and I love the architecture of this place. It's not the same look as Grand Central Station, but it doesn't need to be (nor really should be). Spanish Mission style and Art Deco combine to form an eclectic mix that is quintessentially Southern Californian. You can see why this place is popular for filming movies and my pictures don't do the place justice. There's also a piano you can play which is really cool and it's very easy to connect via subway to the rest of the city.

40,The jewel in the crown of Japan Town and Downtown L.A.,"During a stay at the Downtown Sheraton last November I visited the Train station to see how it compared to the San Diego Train station. Why? Just because. Turns out it's a great place, full of art deco architectural style and details, as well as people actually using trains to come and go- just as if it were 1940 again. Architecturally its a trip back to a city which came into its early adulthood at that time. The multi-room layout, the high ceilings in the waiting rooms, the shoe shine stands, the information booths- they are all a form of time travel. Its a delightful place and one, on the day I was there, that included a wedding in a secluded court yard. I can't be sure you'll have that type of serendipitous experience but in a big train station, with people coming and going, you never know what you might find going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eh2bh2eh

It has also been the setting for many Hollywood movies, including ""The Italian Job,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and many more. Also a great spot to take some nice pictures. Of course if you're utilizing public transport, chances are one of your lines will hit this venue. I don't think I would take a separate trip just to go see it; however, if you're planning to visit Olvera Street Plaza, which is a must-see when in L.A., then you can just walk on over across the street to this station.

The LAX Fly Away is fabulous to get to and from the airport. There are several places to eat at the station and of course a Starbucks.

40,Second layover at LAX Union Station.,"This was second layover in two years at the LAX Union Station waiting for an eastbound Amtrak. Having spent more hours than desired here last year, this time we were familiar with the layout, the facilities and the Amtrak boarding procedures and location. The station itself, especially the older section has some interesting architecture and there is plenty of almost comfortable seating in the large hall. There are a number of food establishments available. Between the large hall, the central station and the tunnels to the tracks and boarding platforms, there are also several outdoor areas to sit and enjoy the fresh air.Being a large transportation hub, and that the Sheriffs HQ is not far away, there always seems to be a large presence of deputies patrolling the station in addition to the Amtrak Police and the normal security guards. I felt that it was a safe location but without the hassles of the airport.Since we had a 6 hour wait this year, and that this station does not have rental lockers available, we opted to pay Amtrak a baggage holding fee to hold old luggage we planned to carry on board with us while we hiked across the street to Olvera Street. If you have the time, it is well worth the short walk to Olvera Street which is almost directly out the front door and across the street.My only complaint with Union Station this year is that there is a piano in the corner of the central part of the station, which is roped off. Why it is there I am not sure as I have never heard anyone ever playing music on it. However this time, someone must have crossed the rope and sat down and started to play. The Security Guards quickly came running and forced the individual to stop. That was a shame as from the short recital, the individual obviously was an extremely talented pianist which I wished they had permitted this person to continue. Why have a piano to guard if no one ever gets to use it?Overall, I am impressed with LAX Union Station and do not mind waiting here for the next train out of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonH43026

50,Fixed up nicely,"Not sure how one reviews a train station.I come in on the thruway bus connecting to Amtrak's San Joaquin train which goes down the Central Valley of California from Sacramento to Bakersfield. Depending o n which hotel I am staying at, I can board the Metro Red Line to within a block, or I can go across the street and pick up the Dash B bus. The station is clean and well-lit. I understand it is now under private management who keeps the bums from spending the night (unlike BATF in the SF Bay Area). The tunnel out to the trans is lined with photos of local people and places. For eats, there are a couple of fast food places and a convenience store (they have fresh-squeezed OJ). I checked out the restaurant, Traxx, but was put off by the nice white table cloths on the tables. That always means expensive, which the menu bore out. They have fixed up the front ticketing room, refurbishing the walls, the wooden booths, the floor, everything. Now they only use it for big events, but there has apparently been some talk about Amtrak offices being moved in there so people can get tickets there again. There is at least one ATM. There are carts to take you to the trains if you can't walk it. There is a pleasant grassy courtyard with benches which make a nice place to sit and enjoy the sun. Again, what can you say about a train station?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW878

Union Station is not ""Downtown"" and it's definitely not ""Hollywood"" but, overall, I'd say its more ""Hollywood"" than anything else. Okay, yes, it's a train station. So if you're riding the trains, you will pass through to the gates. It is very beautiful. But many a visitor I've had peer though the ""gates"" into the ""old"", really beautiful, ticket area. ""What's it used for?"" is the common question... to which one replies - ""a movie set"". If you are visiting Olvera Street and the LA Mission then, yes, a quick stroll over to Union Station is worth the calories spent doing it.

30,It was an experienced....,"I arrived at the Los Angeles Union Station and it was my first time at the station. My destination was Mojave Ca.....They are very organized and helpful but I had to ask a couple of workers to see what was my next transportation to arrive to Mojave. They looked at me confused and all they said ""I don't know"". I assumed they would be able to help me because they work at the station. I finally figured it out, I checked my phone! I'm thankful for my smartphone. LolAfter I showed one of the employees my phone and the next transportation I had to take... they finally guide me. In addition, be ready for people to almost run over you because everyone is on a hurry, grab your children close to you because they can easily get lost. They have shops where you can grab a bite to eat on the go... Starbucks as well, they are the only location where you can charge your phone, but you have to purchase something.I recommend to keep your belongings very close to you due to a lot of the (the less fortunate) are at the station. They are there just asking for coins. But if you can help and it's in your heart, help one of them.Bathroom are clean, they also have an outside are where you can smoke, if you are a smoker. But you have to be attentive to the time of your departure due to they don't tell you what transportation is leaving the station.

Speaking of phones, I'm yet to find anywhere to keep My phone and laptop charged... There may not be public outlets.They keep the bathrooms very clean, the grounds very clean, and the station.

40,Compares to stations in other major cities,"When travel by train was in its heyday, major cities constructed huge train stations with lots of marble, shops, and stairways or escalators. They all seem to resemble one another in structure and style. Some are more well maintained than others, but it seems that Union Station is maintained and inviting. The halls for arrival and departure are cavernous. There is plenty of signage for Amtrak, the Metro, and local trains and buses. Plus there is an information center which makes it possible for first time visitors to feel safe and welcome. There are plenty of food options for the hungry traveler. Nothing like a Wentzell's Pretzel while you wait on the train. The security has a full time job rousting the homeless, but at this main station there seems to be less of a problem than at the neighborhood stations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron

There are individual seats as well as tables to seat up to four. Juice, cookies, soft drinks are provided. Also available is a private washroom. The location is clean and a very comfortable place to relax prior to catching the train. To access the lounge you have to be a business class customer. It is worth the extra cost.

I happened by when a really great studio musician was killing it with some jazz tunes. Nice touch!Good signage allows you to find our train, and a reasonably priced store sells food and drinks for your journey.I wouldn't really say it is a tourist destination unless you are a trainspotter, but it is a really nice facility to travel to or from.Sadly, LA's homeless problem is all around, and you'll likely encountered a fair number of homeless if you walk to or from the station. I don't necessarily think this is a reason to be concerned about your safely, but it is a sad comment on LA and their large homeless population.

40,"A Vast Transportation Hub for Travelers, Visitors & Unique Dining!","Union Station is the hub of transportation for all of Los Angeles if you travel by train or bus. Los Angeles is a huge city, so it needs a huge transport/travel hub to serve it. And Union Station is definitely huge. A great portion of it is underground, with several train and bus platforms above where travelers can reach via an underground tunnel and individual stairs leading to each. Union Station also serves Metro Rail's subway system which travels to the Valley, Long Beach and several other regions of the city. These many platforms are further underground and help make up one of the biggest transportation hubs in the country. However, on street level, the station consists of several areas where visitors and travelers can sit, relax, read, recreate, dine, shop and even catch some outdoor rays and harmony. Fast food or formal dining and even cocktails can be had at Union Station, as well as substantial gift and travel shopping throughout the mecca. I visit Union Stations often in my travels throughout the city, and I enjoy the busy, clamorous, pedestrian atmosphere of the station. The place is well run, security seems always tight and professional, and the people who work there all seem competent and helpful. Sometimes I hang out there to relax and read a book and soak up the ambience. It's the perfect place for these and other enjoyable activities. You need to go there and check it out.

We didn't stop for coffee but that would be a great passtime to sit in the big comfy sofas and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
20,Dirty Place,I don't understand how this place gets such a high rating. Apparently a lot of people haven't used public transportation anywhere else in the world.We visited there on a hot day 9/29/16. Either this place has no air conditioning or it doesn't work very effectively.The place is dirty and smelly. And I hope you don't have to use the restroom. If you do try to hold your breath the entire time your in there.There are not nearly enough places to get information. You would think for a public transportation center in a city this large there would be lots of information booths. But not so here. If you are confused or have a question be prepared to stand in a long line. I had better luck asking people who seemed to be familiar with the place.And being in the middle of a major city like this it attracts the homeless vagrants and mentally ill. Not much can be done about that. But a larger security presence would sure make one feel a little safer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb

50,Good place to start exploring LA city,"I believe this is the very first place that people would stop by after a long flight and leaving LAX. It's a beautiful station although recently it is on reconstruction for some parts. Nearby, you can easily access Olvera St, China Town, Little Tokyo. These are only 3-5 minutes walking distance from the union station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100chunc

50,Still Used for Trains and Convenient for Tourists,"I go through Union Station weekly as the metro rain has both the Gold Line and the Red Line connections as well as AmTrac. It is a wonderful art deco building and full of history. It merits a visit by itself and is a good place to branch out to visit other places, such as Pasadena via the Gold Line or Hollywood Blvd and the Chinese Theatre via the Red Line. When you exit Union Station via the main entrance you simply walk across the street and you're in Olvera Street and the plaza which tells of Los Angeles's beginnings. Walk two blocks down and you're in Chinatown. Union Station is a great hub for visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bleeson8

40,Cool for movie fans!,Cool place to visit if you're a film fan. I knew that a scene in Pearl Harbour was filmed here. The building interior and exterior is really well kept and clean. I liked how they have a piano for commuters to play some music if they know how. I was watching a guy play the piano for about 30 minutes before my bus departed and it was a nice moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackmoore93

40,Had a visitor,"Had a visitor from overseas and he wanted to see the station.To my surprise it was a very nice place full of interesting things to see and do.While I did not have much time we stayed as long as we could. I was amazed at the architecture as well as at the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We took some pictures, even though I am not the type, got some free map and pamphlets and strolled around leisurely a bit. Parking was available and very reasonably priced.A nice place to see (and enjoy) for almost free. There are even some food vendors if you need to munch on something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504paris
10,Unreliable!!!,"For the second time in a month, I tried to use the FlyAway bus from LAX to Union Station, only to be left waiting for over 90 minutes, when the bus is supposed to come every 30 minutes. I thought the first time was probably a fluke, but then it just happened again yesterday! The last time, they said they were short staffed, but by the time the bus got to my terminal, it was packed full since there were lots of people that had waited a long time. The bus driver, against rules, stuffed us all in (standing and sitting on the floor) to help accommodate angry passengers. You can tell he was stranded by his company. Yesterday, after thinking minute after minute it would HAVE to come, I got one of the other drivers to give me the number of the dispatch (which is impossible to find on your own). They couldn't tell me when we'd see the next bus - or if by the time the bus got to our terminal (the last stop), we could get on. After almost 2 hours, many of us got on the Hollywood shuttle and pooled together to take an Uber to Union Station. It took almost 3 hours!!! I will not be taking this bus again as it's unreliable and the company does not look out for it's drivers or passengers!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milivolt
40,Los Angeles Actually Does Have a Train Station!,"Get a great glimpse of old Los Angeles before a car was an absolute necessity! Ok...it's been completely modernized and re-vamped but the building is great and while most Los Angelinos don't use trains, there are a greats many who do. Well worth the price of parking and a half hour walk thru if nothing else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
50,Icon of LA,This Spanish Mission station was much busier with passengers than 20 years ago when I last visited.Extra Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains and an expanded number of Metro lines and longer distance Metrolink trains have helped to make the station a true transit area.The seating is amazingly good with deep plush 1930s style evident.There is a reasonable range of shops.RedCap porters are on hand to ferry travellers who are tired to and from trains.Amtrak has a Metropolitan Lounge for sleeper and business class passengers with soft drinks (soda) and cookies among the items on offer. It is accessed by an elevator (lift) behind the Amtrak booking counters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victorianlad

40,Great example of a classic old railroad station.,"Union Station is an active transportation hub serving Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Amtrak trains operate out of here. More importantly, it is a beautiful example of classic railroad station that existed throughout the country that operated from the 1800s to the 1950s. The interior architecture exemplifies a beautiful bygone era. If you happen to be in downtown Los Angeles, it is well worth a short visit. It is quite near Alvaro Street, another interesting Los Angeles landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timnr2016

Like all good transit hubs, there are excellent connections to cabs, buses, subways, and I was able to walk to my downtown LA hotel. I felt like I was in a movie as the whole station is so ornate and beautiful. There was some serious renovation in parts of the station, but it is so spectacular, I didn't mind some of the noise.

40,Just Passing Through,"Although the public transportation system in Los Angeles leaves much to be desired (takes 2 hrs to travel 23 miles) I did use it for about 10 months. From my home, I walked two blocks to a bus station, caught the bus to a first train station (North Hollywood) then to Union Station where I changed trains to get to my destination. One time, I was later than usual and had to catch the last train. There were few people in the station and I did not see any Security guards around. There was one other man of Latin descent who began speaking to me in Spanish. Since I don't speak the language, he left me alone and walked away but it was a little unnerving as a woman sitting there alone, not to see any type of security patrol or other passengers. I will say the station is clean and kept up well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajiR_12
50,A walk-in wonder!,Me and my father went in just because of the architecture and initial impressions of the building as we went by. What we saw inside was really something special. It is a 1930's gem that has to be seen. Considering the inside of this place being delayed would advantageous so you could see more of the fantastic room; it's like you've stepped into a time capsule that is beautifully maintained. A art deco Californian real treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smolenski1994
50,Union Station is a lovely place to be while waiting for the next leg of your journey.,"Union Station has many transportation options, and is a lovely place to be while waiting for your next connection. You can get off Amtrak and take the Metro rail, the buses ,especially to LAX or the Westside, such as UCLA and other destinations. Also the local buses called Dash depart to go thruout downtown Los Angeles.There are few windows in the Station in which to buy tickets or seek information, which can be challenging. But there are various transportation personnel about that are helpful. Once you have navigated the process of getting off Amtrak, going to a kiosk to buy your Metro rail ticket, or gone to another area of the station to catch a bus or the Downtown dash bus, it is easy. For the Metro, there are personnel at the departure area to confirm you are at the right place.The architecture is reminiscent of years gone by, and one can imagine lovely theatrical meetings and greetings. The Station is also occasionally an event center, in which fashion shows and other events are held. There is also one restaurant and a food court.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandmere1
40,One of America's Great Train Stations - See It from the Traxx Bar,"Half a million people showed up for the opening of Union Station in May 1939. Looking now at the historical restoration done two years ago for its 75th anniversary, I can see why. What a place! Combining the best of the Art Deco and the California Mission styles, it gleams with bold color and design. This dual character, simultaneously international and regional, makes it especially interesting and engaging. We were delighted by the contrasting decorative elements everywhere in view.Look at one of the soaring entryways, for example, and you'll see sleek, modern-looking brass paired with brightly colored tiles that wouldn't seem out of place in an old hacienda. And that's just he beginning.With ceilings an eye-popping 52 feet high, there is room for everything, and everything is exactly what you get here.If you'd like to relax and take it all in -- the place and the people -- there's no better spot than the concourse seating in the Traxx Bar. Immediately opposite is a large, colorful banner commemorating the 75th anniversary. Loads of tourists stop by to have pictures taken in front of it. From that vantage point too, you have a good view of the busy intersection of the main hall and two side halls crossing to make a ""T.""When we were there, some musicians were posing in profile for a publicity shot. It was fun to watch the interactions between them and their photographer, and IMHO the whole scene seemed to capture the quick, high-energy, kind of artsy ""feel"" of the station. I got it on film and have posted it here along with a few other photos that I hope will give some sense of the great things to be seen in this fine old building. It's a wonderful place to visit, even if you're not here to catch a train, although you can do that too. There's even regular service to Las Vegas.While at Union Station, you can also cross the street and walk to nearby Los Angeles Plaza, site of the original land grant given in 1781 to the city's founders. It's a fun place, with the popular Mexican Market immediately adjacent.A visit to Union Station AND to the plaza will give you some insight into the heart and soul of this fascinating and historic city. Give it a try, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolDM1900
50,A destination in itself,"Union Station is obviously a public transportation hub. However, it is also an excellent example of Art Deco, California style, and worth a visit in its own right.

40,"a waypoint, not realllllly a destination","Unlike other famous stations that union station in Los Angeles is more of a waypoint and a train depot then it is a destination. The exception would be if you had booked a walking tour with one of the companies. There are a few interesting tour companies and one personality, Charles Phoenix, in particular that make a tour stop in Union Station.Located across the street from Olvera Street / El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument it's a great place to arrive to or leave from as you experience LAs metro / public transportation. It's also very near LAs Chinatown.I'm not discounting Union Station at all, it is very beautiful and often used in commercials, photo shoots and filming but it is what it is... In this case it's a train depot.If I were going to put together a day I would use public transportation to get us to union station and take a walking tour, and make a stop in both Chinatown and Olvera St. maybe even Little Tokyo across the fwy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,One of America's last great train stations,"The architecture is very southwest with a Latin flavor. The inside waiting areas are huge with big plush armchairs, and there always seems to be something going on.

You know you want to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKurtB
50,Timeless...,The moment I stepped into the station I was transported back in time. The chairs and even the piano in the foyer were still in good condition. Who ever thought to preserve these fixtures should be commended.

50,Like walking into a blockbuster movie set....because you are.,"This station was featured in dozens of Hollywood movies including Dark Knight Rises and Blade Runner but it really feels like it belongs to the golden age of movies. You can almost imagine a film noir detective hanging out in a dark corner wearing a trench coat and waiting for his connection. The wooden ceiling and floor tile and wall tile are exquisite. Trains seem to run on time and are nicer than many I have been on but the scenery along the tracks is pretty depressing - graffiti, concrete, and grungy landscapes. Nearby is the Dodger Express which is a free ride to Dodger Stadium - worth knowing if you want to avoid parking and driving on game days. Don't miss nearby La Plaza Gallery/Museum and Olvera St.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowlander46

40,Beautiful Old Station Needs Help,"Union Station is a wonderful treasure of California history. I have had to use the trains a lot for work in the past 6 months, and have found myself at Union Station several times power month.The station is safe and secure, mostly thanks to the strong police presence always in view. The food offerings are nice (Subway, Starbucks, a loaded convenience store (Trimana), a bakery and a Pretzel shop). The station is also kept veery clean--EXCEPT for the restrooms. They need a lot of help. The restrooms need to be wholly overhauled, expanded and modernized. The set on the west side of the station seem to be ancient relics from the Hoover era.All in all, the station is well designed and allows for rapid movement of travelers doo gate to gate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5800DTpeterm

30,"Good for tourists, quick walk-through for commuters","I first took the train northbound to Union Station as a tourist on a weekend. It is a historic station and has been a great backdrop for both movies and modern photoshoots. I did not spend too much time there just browsing or taking a tour, so I can't speak to those experiences. I can't see spending more than an hour there looking around, especially since the trains are commuter trains and thus probably wouldn't appeal much to kids anyway. Eventually, I began taking public transportation in and out of Union Station everyday for work, so it lost some of its historic luster with the everyday hustle and bustle. There's a good little convenience store, as well as several fast food places. I probably wouldn't recommend it as a tourist stop if on a time crunch, but if it makes sense to take the Metro or a train into the station, it's worth a look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyJess

40,This is where I usually start my LA visit!...,"I got here on the Amtrak from Oceanside! Since I have been here before..the first thing I usually do is reload my TAP card since I know I will be using the MEtro..this time there was a Metro worker helping tourists like me that do not remember how to buy or reload the card! There is a Metro office but they have specific hours and some bus and train schedules..Union station serves as a hub for Metrolink, Amtrak, and the LA Metro Line! Make sure you buy a ticket or a TAP card from the machine before you board any Metro Line because there is a stiff penalty if caught by the LA Sheriff;s department! Red, purple, and gold lines Start here!There are also different places to get food like Starbucks, Trax Restaurant, a new Japanese take out, and a coffee shop! I usually do not eat here because the restaurant are so crowded and there is no place to sit..however, I do get coffee at the Coffee shop to drink! They are so nice there! I was rejected once at Trax because I had my luggage and I guess my clothes were wrinkled after that hours long train ride so I do not know if I will ever try to return! There is an information desk up front with some handouts and information about LA, but they are only open during banker,s hours!There are really some nice old fashioned chairs that I used to sit down once in a while but now they are cordoned off and supposedly only for Metrolink or Amtrak customers with a ticket. Other items in Union station worth mentioning are two ATM machines. One is from Chase while the other is Wells Fargo..And of course the historical architecture inside and outside of this building since it was built in the 20s is worth looking at and admiring!Taxis are up front ready to take you to your hotel or next destination. Most of the drivers are Europeans that still have an accent! The Flyaway that will take you to LA is now in front of the building because I do not know what they are doing to the back part of Union Station! I believe they only take a debit card and unsure of the cost at this time because I will take it when I leave in a few days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
50,If you love art you need to get off at each station.,At 3each of the stops there is art to admire by local artists. It is worth while to get off at each station admire the art there and go on to the next one. Make a 1/2 days outing out of it. When you get to Union Station take some time to see Alvera Street ( a Mexican area with crafts and food) and if you want fine dinning you can have lunch at the Station in their main dinning room. Good food and a little more expensive than the run of the mill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486vickyh

They redid the outside gardens, which is a nice area where one can enjoy the sunset or nice summer evening. They now have different food sellers and on a Saturday afternoon, they put a piano for those who wanted to play and ,my husband and I were just standing there for almost an hour listening to the passerby's who saw the piano and played beautifully, while the world would go on their ways.

40,A 1940s train station ambience with modern touches,"If you have lunch in Chinatown or Olvera Street, or just happen to have 30 free minutes on the non-sporty side of downtown, take the time to relax in Union Station. There are usually several oversized leather chairs available, as most of us busy businesspeople do not have time to waste sitting and looking around. And we'll probably look at you like ""What are you doing?"" I think that's my favorite part of sitting down and watching them walk past me, while I eat my Union Station ice cream. I wish I could say the architecture is a good blend with the furnishings - it isn't, they don't match at all. I think the station itself was updated, and furniture stayed? Or that the sounds of the trains take you back in time - nope, no bells or whistles or conductor announcements. And the hallway to get down to the trains is not aesthetically pleasing at all, unless you like feeling like you are walking into a large prison cell. I actually prefer leaving the station in the morning to returning at night, because I feel like I've escaped the prison. Shouldn't it be the reverse? BUT if you sit down for a bit . . . . there are tons of windows to allow sunlight to play around you, and you notice Spanish tiles to remind you of the origin of LA, with the ""modern"" exposed pipes and iron fixtures, and the mishmosh cluster of styles reminds you of the mishmosh of cultures and people that make LA the amazing city it is. Ice cream is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Persephone11032
50,Union Station is a must see.,"Union Station is the main railway station in Los Angeles that opened in May, 1939. It's on the National Register of Historic Places.

30,Rail to Bus changes during construction,"I'm reviewing the transportation functions of Union Station, as I am a regular commuter to downtown Los Angeles.Going from Amtrak or Metrolink (commuter train) to the local light rail or subway lines (Gold and Red Line) is convenient, you don't have to go outside the station.Connecting from rail to bus at this time, July 2016, is confusing. The east side of the station, Patsaouras Transit Plaza, has the majority of bus stops, but because of construction (thru October), the stops have been dispersed to different locations. It can be confusing to non-commuters.Visitors taking the Flyaway bus from LAX should know that the bus stop at Union Station is in a temporary location: https://www.metro.net/riding/bus-plaza-closure/Going to Olvera Street is walking distance from the west side of the station. Via the Gold Line, you can go one stop to Chinatown or Little Tokyo. The Red Line will get you to the financial district and beyond. I also take the Dash Bus, Route D, to get to downtown locations.When the bus plaza is refurbished, getting around will be a bit easier again. Also, a light rail connector station being built near Little Tokyo will make getting around downtown much easier, rather than having to get off at Union Station to find a bus or other transportation to get to the final destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Great Place To Catch A Ride,"Union Station's (US) management has made several improvements over the past five years to the facility. They've added a Starbuck's, Subway, along with other eateries on both ends of the station. The Ben & Jerry's is really special because anyone who is passing through US would have a chance to try their ice cream for the first time. What's really cool about US is that Los Angeles has a place where business, education, and travelers can visit one of America's best places to be.

30,Can be confusing place to navigate,"Was here twice in the past couple of months. The first time our train was late and missed our connecting train, even though we had been assured it would wait for those of us who were booked on it.When we arrived we rushed down the ramp into the main corridor to find our train. The boards were not helpful and there was no one around to ask directions. Someone in the group of passengers booked on the train with us, finally figured out where we were supposed to go and we all rushed to the platform to find it empty. We later found out the train had left five minutes before we arrived. Finally found customer service and got booked on the next train. Because I had business class seat I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge. That was a great place to go and relax to wait for my next train. Nice comfy chairs each with power outlets nearby. Plenty of snacks and drinks available too. When it came time to board the next train they directed us out the backdoor of the lounge and down to a waiting golf cart. The golf cart then took us through the back of the train station and right up onto the platform as our train started to pull into the platform. It was pretty cool!My next trip to Union Station last week saw me disembarking there. Trying to figure out how to get out of the station was not easy and then there is not a lot of space in front of the station for cars to pull in and pick you up.Most of the time my train stops at Union Station before continuing on.

Subway and rail lines go from Downtown and its awesome Arts District and museums to Hollywood, the North Hollywood Arts District, Expo Park and the Natural History and Science museums, and north to Pasadena on the Gold Line through China Town and a lot of small, lovely neighborhoods -- and now there's an extension all the way to Santa Monica and the beach!

Amtrac Two years ago it was crazy, today like a well oiled machine with personality. Friendly helpful staff at all areas of the venue. Little diamond in the ruff, there is a piano in this area of the Station, perfect acoustics. Any one no matter what age can come up and play.....marvelous!!! At least 4 people in less than an hour sat down to play really play....what a joy...even the 5 year old.

Very pleasant trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norig30

Take a subway tour, people watch. Walking distance to Chinatown, Alvaro Street - take a day and see lots of L.A.'s history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2435ZKbarbarah
40,Stop by only if you are near by,"While I like our Union Station, it is very underwhelming when compared to New York, San Fran or D.C. So if you are in the area, I would recommend that you stop by. However, if you are coming from afar just to see this, you might be disappointed. But since its close to so many things, you can definitely make a day out of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
40,A true gem,"What is great about train travel in LA is that is really made easy with train stops in more suburban areas like the valley and Burbank. Union Station is not only throwback to yesteryear in style but a functional place. There are several bus service like Megabus which pick and deliver at the station. If you are traveler with time kill and want to get a taste of some Mexican culture, you are literally across the street to taste great food and get souvenirs.The train station also connects with subways that take you around LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystaljayMCCN

You can catch the Amtrak train, MetroRail, the Airport bus, the city bus, the subway train, or taxicab. It's pretty much a central hub for traveling. Everything except Greyhound. It's clean, well lit and secure. There's a nice restaurant inside, a Subway sandwich shop, Wetzel's Preztels, and a small convenient store. So if you're up late waiting on a train there's plenty of food and seats. There's a few power outlets to plug-up your electronics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theLadyRho

On our return, we tried to get the bus to Santa Monica beach, but go hopelessly lost and ended up near our hotel, which was something. Union Station is well run, buut let's face it, who travels by train these days?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619jeffry
30,Beautiful Historic Building,"Union Station is a beautiful historic early 1900's building. It's very easy to navigate for travelers (much easier than Grand Central Station in NY). Union station is right across the street from Olvera st. and only a couple blocks from China Town. The World Market is within walking distance, and Little Tokyo (which is a great place to see) is only a short ride away on the metro train. I only give Union station three stars because of the homeless people that hang around and the restroom capacity & condition.In Union Station there is a Starbucks, Wetzel's Pretzles, Subway, Ben & Jerry's, a mini market, and a bakery; there is also a restaurant called Traxx that seems to be closed more often than not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/211nanag

50,Great Inside and Out,"Every time I take the Metrolink train into downtown Union Station I am just amazed at how clean, well marked, and organized this huge station is. There are signs clearly posted with train schedules as well as staff available if you have any questions. I really appreciate how the restrooms are always kept clean. There's also a ""food court"" available if you want to eat while you wait for your train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRO_13
50,One of the Last of the Great Stations,"This station is one of the treats L.A. has to offer. Built in the 1930's it is one of the last of the great terminals built during the heyday of passenger railroading. The station is large with great indoor spaces. Built in the Mission style, the floors are beautiful with the tile work. There are courtyards on both sides of the main waiting room. Terminals are meant to be crowded to come alive. With the steady expansion of the Metro rail lines, we have seen a steady increase in the number of people passing through and using the station. It now houses 2 subway lines, one light rail (Gold Line), Amtrak and Metrolink. It is becoming increasingly practical for citizens of LA and visitors to use the Metro to get around the City and the region. When you come to visit, take the time to see the station. It is across the street from Olvera Street, L.A.'s birthplace, and a shortwalk to City Hall, Chinatown and Phillipe's, home of the french dip sandwich.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias

40,Beautiful train station inside and out,"I'm surprised by people who say this train station is nothing out of the ordinary. Functionally? Perhaps. And, I admit, I should've accepted the ride offered to me because dragging my luggage uphill to the track was ardouous. But both the exterior and interior of the station, including waiting areas, were simply magnificient. I'll post photos to make my point in ways words can't express. Please look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoPegasus
40,Worth some extra time!,"Usually I'm rushing to get to a connection. But yesterday I allowed myself an extra hour in classic L. A. Union Station. Opened in 1939, this place has beautiful features worth admiration. Sit in the wide leather seats in the waiting area. Check out the polished marble floor designs. Look up at the decor above you. Wander through the manicured garden on the side where there are colorful tiled waiting benches facing the roses and pepper trees. Don't forget to look at the architectural features. Windows, columns, doors, floors, all made more interesting, more beautiful while serving a function. Yes, the rest rooms are not five-star updated, but are frequently cleaned. Signage and security is very up to date. Excellent information booth staffed by enthusiastic, informed volunteers: center of entry hall. Inside the station you can purchase food, from Starbucks to Subway and more. There's also an elegant white linen restaurant, Traxx, but check their hours and make a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrganistaGratciella
30,Nothing Out of the Ordinary,It's a train station. Nothing much to see here. The coolest part or the station was the gazebo area outside. The architecture had a very southwestern vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
30,A crazy busy place,"We caught the Amtrak Southwest chief here. It is a huge building and wall to wall people. We got there with a few minutes to spare in large part to garbage information we received regarding the flyaway bus between LA Airport and Union Station. Someone's relatives wrote some glowing reviews on the service and was just bogus. A hour max between the two? Maybe at 3am on Sunday. It took us hours to crawl through traffic. A bus every 30 minutes? To Van Nuys yes we had 5 buses go past us. We stood out for almost an hour and fifteen minutes before a Union Station bus arrived.They encourage you to use the Flyaway bus and avoid taxis and shuttles. Cheaper and faster. That is just not true, take whatever is there when you get off the plane or you too will get a five minute run from end to end tour of Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelTechPenngrove
20,3 hour delay,"I was travelling up to the Grand Canyon, and the train was delayed by 3 hours. Amtrak staff did not appear to know what was happening, we were eventually told to go to the platform, then to go back to the waiting hall and then straight back to the platform only to have to wait another 20 minutes for the train to turn up. There are a selection of eating / drinking locations. The bar is fairly expensive. There was a classical music performance on during part of my wait which provided a bit of light relief",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJC777
30,A station is a station is a...,"As a station Union Station functions rather well. It is not too busy and it doesn't have a too confusing lay-out.

The seats in waiting area are same design that you will see in 1940's movies. There is a contemporary restaurant and lounge. Plus, there is entertainment (not certain times or day of week).

40,Beautiful architecture and the lovely Metropolitan Lounge,"The station itself is a beautiful piece of architecture and as soon as you step in you are drawn to the history.We were travelling Business Class on the Pacific Surfliner & hence were fortunate enough to experience the Metropolitan Lounge as well. As soon as we entered, we were greeted cheerfully and warmly by an old gentleman (sorry we missed his name). He checked our tickets and took care of our luggage immediately.The Lounge itself is not as fancy as the airport lounges are, but its quite comfortable and provides some basic eats like wafers/chips, fruits, muffins, etc besides tea/coffee, juice & sodas. Its functional, has newspapers that one can browse through or use your laptop or just simply relax till its time for your train to arrive.Once it is time, you are escorted to your platform in a little buggy.

And if you get a chance (Joining LA Conservancy costs only $40 & they do many Downtown tours not available to the general public), take a walk around the shuttered (but not for much longer) Harvey's restaurant.

Finally they've added some shops such as Starbuck (yay!), Famima, Wetzels Pretzels, Ben and Jerry, See's Candie, Subway, and more coming like any legit transportation hub. Good for you City of LA!What an improvement from the days when there were 5 ppl in the station and 3 of them were homeless. Well they are still homeless roaming around, but they'll leave you alone, if you keep to yourself.I recommend you make it a day trip and give this historic destination a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/googlelax

50,Add this to your DTLA checklist,"Are you ready to explore Downtown Los Angeles? Well, Union Station is worth a visit, especially if you love architecture and locomotives. It houses Metrolink trains, and is a stop for Metro rail (subway trains), buses, cabs and the Flyaway Bus that runs to and from LAX. The architecture is Spanish Colonial Revival and Mission Moderne.You probably only need about 20-30 minutes to take a look, so I'd recommend stopping here on your way into the downtown area, or talking some time to look around before you catch a train to leave.For travelers/tourists, I'd recommend briefly stopping here and then stepping outside for a walking tour to see some of LA's cultural history. The famous Olvera Street is right across from the station. If you walk north on Alameda Street, you can grab a famous French Dipped sandwich at Phillippe's.Chinatown is right by the restaurant, so you can check that out before heading south into downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LillyfromLA
40,Historic LA,"I have worked on a project in Union Station about 20 years ago which is how I discovered it's beauty and took advantage of its convenience. I took the train to Santa Barbara to have a girls lunch with a friend. We had a ball walking around downtown Santa Monica, window shopping, wine tasting and had a lovely meal. After a few hours of enjoying the city views including the pier, the lovely succulents, flowers and ocean we walked back to the vintage themed station to ride back to Union Station to pick up our cars to go home. Great way to see the coastal cities and beaches. If you take the train to Palm Springs, you will love missing all of the dessert traffic on the 10 freeway.Highly recommend!",
50,Historic Los Angeles,"Take a step back in time to the beautiful Union Station, with it's authentic Spanish Colonial Revival and Mission Moderne architecture, including gorgeous tile work and vaulted ceilings.

40,Art Deco hub of LA transit system remains relevant in the new millennium for visitors and travelers far and near.,"Once the hub of LA arrivals and departures for many years in the 20th Century, Union Station lost its luster and relevance for a period of years prior to the resurgence of Metro transit and the resurgence of DTLA as a destination since Y2K.

50,One of this country's architectural gems.,"A throwback to the days before you were born, and although the furniture has been revitalized, the interior space rearranged, and many of the tracks have been removed this is one of the gems of this country. Especially if you love the era of steam locomotives and the romance of train travel, this depot is not to be missed. All it needs is some Glen Miller music playing in the background. Plus, it is right across the street from other main L.A. attractions, albeit none of which holds a candle to this place.",
50,Thank God they saved this architectural jewel,"Ever since watching ""Blade Runner"" (which was partially filmed here) I've been wanting to visit this art deco treasure.

Given its importance as a transportation hub it is a great stepping off point for a rail excursion to San Diego or Santa Barbara or even a walking tour of Chinatown, Little Tokyo and the Arts District or Old Town LA.

50,Fast and Efficient!,"Union Station is just one of my favorite places to use for local travel. It is fast and efficient. No longer affordable as everything has gone up.I love the variety of services available. You can use the subway system to travel very efficiently around the area, in the greater Los Angeles area. Just do your homework ahead of time. You can use this location to take a metro to the Inland Empire during the Los Angeles County Fair and they create a new stop at the fair for travelers. If you want to go a little further and visit the low income town of the most awful terrorist attack in California you can take the Metro to San Bernardino, just be careful walking in certain parts of town is not safe. However, if you do come to the area bring your positive energy, prayers and money the City can use it.At Union Station I have often used the greyhound to send my son to Northern California, rather cheaply. I have seen people use the Fly Away Bus service to get to LAX airport. I have also used the USC tram service to get to the campus when I was doing my graduate studies.

You'll recognise the scenes from so many movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul62Canberra
50,Take your time to enjoy it all,"To truly enjoy your visit to union station, take your time to soak in the atmosphere. There is a lot to see, but the most enjoyable part of my visit was to sit in the massive waiting area and watch the people. There is a real cross section of the world passing through the station. Some of them matched the frenzied pace of New York's Grand Central Station, but most were much more casual. Then there is the special perk of walking out the front door, crossing the street, and visiting Olivera Street, one of the oldest sections of L. A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovinlivin53

40,Catching the Amtrak to Chicago.,"We elected to travel by Amtrak Train this year for a relaxed and unique experience. It seems like many cities have ""Union Stations"" but I found the LA Union Station to be a nice one. We arrived midday for an evening departure from LA so we had 4 or 5 hours to spend. Due to medical reasons, a limited amount of walking could be accomplished so we elected just to stay in the station. There are plenty of places to get a bite to eat and the fountains and gardens were a great place to sit back and relax while waiting. Plenty of seating was available, both indoors and outside. The place appeared to be kept clean and although older, pretty well maintained.Unfortunately having been out of contact with the news that day as soon as we walked in I could tell something had happened. Besides the normal in-house security and one or two City or Amtrak Police, there was a very large presence of City Police and Sherriff Deputies there. All the Deputies were heavily armed, several with assault rifles and a couple had dogs with them. I found out later that the tragic San Bernardino shootings had just occurred.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonH43026
50,Still Laughing,We took a group of Chinese visitors on a downtown tour that included the UNION STATION. I knew what their reaction would be.. The Beijing Main station is 100s of time bigger with 10000s of more passengers coming and going. They were amazed that ours was so clean and neat. They were thrilled with the style and upbeat usage of the old train station. They could not see how a station that served so few people could remain active.This is a great place to take a visitor to see how the old and new can combine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassV8048IT

I was travelling midday so it was pretty easy to make my way to the Amtrak Business class lounge. The lounge is great with friendly service, comfortable room and lots to nibble on. Well worth the few dollars more on a ticket to San Diego. Also, you get a free ride in a red cap to the train which was awesome as it is a bit of hike to the platform. If I had a bit more time I would had gone to Traxx which always has great food and service. Can't wait to take a another ride and spend more time at Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sastudio
50,Back In Time,"A beautiful place to visit. A must see, in my humble opinion. Upon entering, you will recognize this landmark from movies, television, and music videos.

50,Convinient way to see Los Angeles downtown using tain and Dasg Shuttle,"This is the central location for all commuters to connect to their destination. I find myself using Union Station more frequently now than in the past. First was using the Flyaway bus shuttle to LAX with Union Station as my drop point, since my wife gets lost going to LAX. The Flyaway bus leaves regularly every half an hour and it cost only $7.00 one way and $14 return, I think they just raised it a $1 more recently. Then the Dash commuter bus takes you anywhere for 0.50 (use to be $0.25 5 year ago), whether you are going to USC, Little Tokyo, China Town or Staples Center. Then there is the Gold line which I love from Pasadena to Downtown when ever I attend a seminar/conference in Downtown LA. It saves me parking fees too. A short walk to Pueblo or the City Hall is a good way to tour the city. Disney hall is a few more blocks away in Grand Avenue.I recommend visitors to experience Union Station, lots of fastfood place and scenic view close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butchrey
40,L.A. TO SAN DIEGO - NO TRAFFIC ANY TIME. QUICK & EASY w/FRONT WINDOW VIEW OF OCEAN!,"I have a beautiful brand new car, and a daughter who lives in San Diego, YET! I love to go by train whenever I can. It's relaxing, easy, clean, with no hassles to drive. You can get off in Old Town (one station before Union - the last stop in San Diego) and see the historic Mexican village, eat, shop, and walk around. There are a few nice hotels/motels there - The Best Western Plus looks lovely on the hillside - but I've never stayed there. The express train is definately the way to travel if you want a quick and less expensive way to go. Great for kids too. Seniors get discounts, and you can pre-buy online! Easy!

The history of this station and Traxx's restaurant is amazing. There is a courtyard that you can lounge in while waiting for a train on a beautiful day.

Also, dig the wiki entry on the architecture: ""Enclosed garden patios are on either side of the waiting room, and passengers exiting the trains were originally directed through the southern garden. The lower parts of the interior walls are covered in travertine marble; the upper parts have an early form of acoustical tile. The floor in the large rooms is terra cotta with a central strip of inlaid marble (including travertine, somewhat unusual in floors since it is soft). The ceiling in the waiting room has the appearance of wood, but is actually made of steel.[15]Attached to the main building to the south is the station restaurant designed by the famed Southwestern architect Mary Colter. It was the last of the ""Harvey House"" restaurants to be constructed as a part of a passenger terminal. Although padlocked and stripped of many interior furnishings, the topology of its vast rectangular space, rounded central counter, and streamlined booths remains. The spectacular inlaid linoleum tile floor reproduces the pattern of a Navajo blanket.Beeyoootiful....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smithachandrabose

30,Los Angeles' Main Transportation Hub,"Opened in 1939 Los Angeles Union Station is the last of the great Union Stations (Served by more that one railroad company)After decades of minimal rail service Union Station enjoyed a resurgence, particularly in 1993 when Metrolink commuter service began operations. There is also extensive bus service from the station.Union Station is served by both Amtrak and Metrolink. The primary Amtrak service are the ""Surfliners"" which run between San Diego to the South and Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo to the North with Los Angeles being the midway point. There are also a handful of long distance Amtrak trains running to Chicago, Seattle, and Texas.Metroling service fans out across the greater Los Angeles area from Oxnard to the North, Oceanside, Ca. to the South, San Bernardino and Riverside to the East and Lancaster to the North East.Additionally there are several light rail lines that serve Union Station. These include the Metro Red and Purple Lines. The Red Line runs to North Hollywood and is a good way to reach Downtown LA and Hollywood. The Red Line continues under the Santa Monica Mountains with a Universal City stop that provides access to Universal Studios. The Purple line runs only to Wilshire Blvd. and Western Ave. by the Wiltern Theater.There is also the Gold Line which provides service to Pasadena making it a good choice for a day trip to Pasadena and avoiding the traffic and parking hassles.Airport ConnectionsThere is direct ""Flyaway"" bus service from Union Station to Los Angeles Airport (LAX). This bus arrives and departs from the East Portal. For those traveling through Burbank Airport there is a Metrolink Stop for trains running North from Union Station.TicketingWhile you can buy tickets from the Amtrak and Metrolink ticket windows there are a number a machines provided. You can use the machines to buy either Amtrak or Metrolink tickets. FlyAway tickets to LAX can also be purchased.NOTE: You can NOT purchase Metrolink tickets on board the trains. If you get on a Metrolink train without a ticket you will be fined. You can buy Amtrak tickets on board Amtrak trains.NOTE: Most tracks have ""A"" and ""B"" designations. i.e Track 8A and 8B. These are the same track. Track ""A"" is the part of the track closer to the departure end of the platform with the ""B"" portion being closer to the end of the track by the freeway.(Tracks 1 and 2 are designated for the Gold Line light rail service to Pasadena to the North East and East Los Angeles to the East.With very few exceptions Amtrak tickets and Metrolink tickets are NOT interchangeable.FoodStarbucks, Subway, Ben and Jerrys, Wetzels Pretzels consist of most of the food options. There is also a Famina market which is basically a 7-11. Overall the food choices are uninspiring. However there is a ""Traxx"" restaurant which offers high end dining. There is also a ""Traxx Bar"" which is a nice cocktail lounge. Both are located near the main entrance by the information booth.Famina tends to attract the homeless and transients. I have seen a few get caught stealing items so be careful with your belongings. That being said Union Station, like most big city rail stations tends to attract ""interesting"" and ""colorful"" characters. Most are harmless but none the less annoying.If you are Union Station for an extended time there is a Denny's I block past the East Portal. Additionally Olvera St. is directly across the street from the station and is a tourist area where you can get Mexican food from the stalls or from the few regular sit down restaurants.OtherThere is limited service from Union Station at night, The station is closed for a few hours each night so an overnight wait for a morning train or bus is not an option.There are numerous people around the station to assist and answer questions. There is usually a heavy law enforcement presence so safety in the station is usually not an issue.There is frequent filming going on at the station so you are likely to see a production crew at work. The station is frequently used for commercials, tv shows, and movies. There are tours going through the station as it is an architectural and historical landmark.In recent years there were problems with homeless people loitering in the waiting area. However the management at Union Station has made progress in reducing this problem. Homeless people can still be found using the bathroom..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28leighj

The lobby was quite warm but large industrial fans did help with the air circulation. There was a constant flow flow of passengers, employees and visitors but the floors and bathrooms were quite clean. We appreciated the friendly service and help from the employees at the Information booth. Parking in the covered parking lot was a bit difficult due to lack of signage for both entering and exiting the lot. But, since we arrived early on Sunday, we just took our time to find the designated handicapped parking and found a great space near the lobby elevators.

It didn't feel unsafe, just a typical busy train station which also encompasses a metro hub. That did not ruin the impression for me of a very fine, beautifully designed train station which seems to be of another era. The station atmosphere really gave me a great understanding of what train travel would have been like in the 1930s. I loved the art deco features and architecture. For architecture, it is one of my favorite stations anywhere in the world.

50,Worthy Walkthru!,"Whether you are a traveller on the rails, or just someone using the Union Station parking lot to get to Olvera Street or Chinatown, you should walk throu the Station and have a seat for a few minutes. In the process, you will see what much of high-class LA was like in the 1930s to the mid 1950s. It is the largest station west of the Mississippi. It was built in the 1930s, opened in May of 1939, and currently serves over 100,000 people daily on more than three-dozen trains and literally hundreds of busses. But a walk through and sit down in the station is curiously relaxing, evoking a more leisurely time. The architecture is a mix of Spanish colonial, Mexican revival, and Art Deco. You will see terracotta floors, wood panelling, inlaid marble, massive light fixtures, luxurious leather seats, interior fountains, gardens, patios, and courtyards. After your drive into or across LA, it makes for a relaxing 15-20 minute break before departing for either Olvera Street or Chinatown. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden

But, many of the truly interesting sites such as Union Station were already there a decade ago. It's a great example of Art Deco that permeated Los Angeles in its early days. Look closely and you'll probably recognize the station from several movies you have seen as it's used often in films. The station is also right next to the old historic foundation of Los Angeles and close to Chinatown which are also musts to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation

40,Worth visiting for the architecture and finishings of 100+year old station building,"We visited partly to look at the architecture, wall tiles, ceiling paintings, woodwork, etc., mostly in the passenger waiting hall, entrances and exterior.There is a small food court but there is no seating in the actual food court area so you will have to go to the waiting hall to sit down. For first-timers the ticket machines were intimidating but we did learn that the lobby machines are not for the Metro. Those are down in the metro area. There are so many options it may help to study them online before attempting to travel. One of the best features was a little golf cart style shuttle that took passengers to the trains for boarding. It was quite a long walk and we really appreciated the helpful shuttle driver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireleefl

After roaming around looking for personnel to help, I ran into a young man that was reporting to work and sent someone to assist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bosco09
30,Nice Place but needs much improvement. The food options are sad. Parking is somewhat okay if you don't stay long,"I like the history of this place as well as the neighborhood.

Good place to link up with Metro, Amtrack, FlyAway Airport Bus to LAX and even Shuttle Buses to Dodger park.",
40,This is LA.,"I think Union station is one of the busiest establishments in LA. Across the station you'll find a Spanish food park. The decors of the station has some Mexican flair in it. Too many people of different races everywhere, young , old ,rich and homeless. This is LA before, now and tomorrow.",
40,Leave the car and hop over to Olivera street,"Lots of tourists ask me can we visit Mexico from San Diego. No need, just take the train to Union Station - an icon itself - and walk over to Olivera street for some Mexican Flair.Train is better than your car since there is absolutely very limited and expensive parking.Recommended MeuterMedia (p.s. or take a trip to Oceanside by train)",

I took it from the Central Coast area down to LA... my husband (then boyfriend) said there were no problems finding parking for him and there are plenty of benches and good meeting spots. There have rollers to roll your luggage if it's a long walk, but it cost. The station is clean and well kept. The train ride was smooth with ample room to walk around and a snack bar. All in all, a good experience and a relaxing way to travel. The earliest date I could select is October 2014, but it's been longer since then. I'd say it was in 2010 or 2011 that I went.

40,"A Grand, Historic and Functional Building","It's easy to ride the train from San Diego to Union Station, taking 3 hrs. Just seeing the station's styles of Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Modern, in this early settlement area of L.A., is evidence of its age and beauty. It's in great shape. The wood/leather furniture, marble floors and grand rooms with arched windows are beautiful. The 4-ft. circular and noisy air fans serve as reminders of how uncomfortable the place must have been in 'the old days' without A/C: they still don't have it so it seems like the old days.

I had booked reserve train seats on-line, because we were told it was a very busy time in SD (ComicCon, 1Direction). Union Station was an unexpected bonus! Even though we were pretty tired, this place woke us up. The architecture is gorgeous - ceilings, walls, floors, furniture, etc., were perfectly restored and maintained. Also with beautifully cared for gardens and fountains. We got our tickets super fast. The reserved seats entitled us to use the lounge - complimentary food and drink, clean toilets, safe place to leave baggage, personal escort to the train by cart (!), and amazingly friendly and helpful concierge. Also free wi-fi and TV. After availing ourselves of the amenities, we were refreshed enough to explore the Station a little. LA generally bums me out - but this place was just right!

40,Interesting architecture,The Los Angeles Union Station is different from most of the other train stations I have seen in that it was built in the California Mission style. The station itself is located near the Chinatown area in the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District. The station is built around an internal courtyard and provides easy access to boarding areas. A comfortable and interesting area to walk in if you have some time between trains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjb19532014

50,Wonderful Train Station!,Although the station has many many trains passing through it still has that small boutique style and generally was easy to navigate!

30,A Los Angeles Landmark and Travel Hub,"Currently under ""remodeling"" which is very needed. Not much in the way of easy access for the elderly or handicapped if you are using the Metrolink trains. Amtrak has ""cart service for passengers and luggage"" but I have not seen any other accommodations in the 10+ years I have been commuting to and from Union Station. Food choices are improving but still not much to choose from. As for the interior, it is a very nice station, as most old railroad stations. It's still the best ""hub"" for getting around Los Angeles. For those interested in ""Olvera Street"" it is very accessible, just cross the street from the west side (Alameda Street) of the station. There you will find Mexican gifts and food; the Plaza also has events and music.The remodeling and rennovations at the Station should provide much improved service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kumonski

I went there twice on two different days and found all staff whether it be the security or the car rental guy to be outstanding in their service Restrooms were clean for such a large place and there were plenty of food outlets .Directions were easy to find with courtesy boards and helpful attendants on hand.Rental cars are a lot cheaper to hire from here and the bus to LAX airport is about a tenth of the price of taxi and half the times from downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354phillipr
20,Stuffy/Old/No AC,Caught the Amtrak here. No AC. Old and hard to navigate. The rental car return is not very welcoming. Hard to find and be prepared for steps to get to the station. Kind of a pain if you have luggage. Did I mention no AC..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cavjock
40,A lovely gem from the train age,"Union Station is a beautifully made and well maintained classic train station, hearkening back to the era when train travel was luxurious and new. The terra cotta and mosaic work is excellent, the air and light flow generous for a building this size. The waiting room is the best example of the architecture and grandeur. The waiting room also connects to small outdoor gardens that you can also pass the time or eat a fine meal at Traxx. Several large timetables tell you where to find your train and where they are going.The rest of the station can feel rather... uninspired relative to the waiting area. The tunnels that lead the Metrolink tracks are utilitarian and are awe inspiring only in their stark symmetry and bustling crowds. The retail options are few compared to similar stations in other cities. There are no waiting areas designed for charging phones or working on laptops. But the bathrooms are clean.I dislike the parking lot, which is not designed for people to drop off or pick up quickly. Traffic police will inevitably yell at your cab driver for stopping where he shouldn't, even though his other options are non-existent. The parking lot is pretty however, with big palm trees contrasting the white stucco and orange terra cotta trim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuanneL
40,Peace of mind in traveling,"I wanted to take my wife to Union Station in LA so she could appreciate the cleanliness, comfort and appeal of an older building yet in pristine condition. We‚Äôve been all over China on the trains and the train stations there are pathetic. It‚Äôs full of filth, people shoving and chaos! Some of the buildings are 5 years old and they are so run down. She admired the beauty of the place, had some Sees candy, enjoyed a coffee and people watched. We didn‚Äôt even get on a train but she observed happy reunions, something not done in China because public affection is a big no no there. She wanted to take a train just for the fun of it but we had many things to do. Next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,Check out the market inside,"I arrived in the station on the Southwest Chief which ran 3 hours late and I missed my connection to the Coast Starlight. Amtrak took care of re-booking me, but it meant I wasn't getting lunch. I was not interested in a Subway sandwich (ironic, huh?) and wandered into this little market across the hall. Not only do they have packaged American foods, but they have a lot of Japanese meals as well.

That describes Union Station in Los Angeles.We took the Metrolink train from Santa Clarita (an hourlong ride), arriving at beautiful Union Station. This old building is so impressive. You need to take your time to enjoy the architecture and d√©cor. Renovation is ongoing, which makes me happy, because they're taking good care of this treasure.Metrolink, Metrorail, Amtrak and city buses use this facility as a hub, so even though we were on a short day trip, we saw many people with suitcases headed off to exciting destinations, as well as downtown workers catching buses to their places of employment.If you're at Union Station, after enjoying this beautiful building, go across the street to visit historic Olvera Street or, just a block further away, Philippe's Original, where you'll find the best sandwiches ever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingrandma91355
40,A Los Angeles Landmark,"I had to pick someone up at Union Station yesterday. Rather than wait at the curb, I decided to park and go inside. I have been to Union Station many times over the years and, like many others, I hardly noticed the beautiful features of the building itself. The workmanship that went into the construction of the building is excellent. The tile and wood work is fantastic. One cannot find that type of workmanship these days. Although I‚Äôve never eaten there, I hear that The Traxx Restaurant serves pretty good food. The signage is enables travelers to get from one place to another with relative ease. I‚Äôm glad I took the time to go inside and look around while I was waiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Magnificent building; amazing tile work,"This is a busy train and bus station. But it's also a magnificent building. The old tile work is beautiful. The courtyards have fountains with koi in them. Traxx restaurant and bar is located near the main entrance. It's pricey ""fine dining"" and very nice. Other than that, there are places to find snacks or bagel sandwiches, convenience store items, that kind of thing. If you appreciate architecture, Union Station should definitely be on your list. If you're catching a train or bus, come early and look around or relax in the courtyard before your trip. I have been here many times and still find it lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hedgieh2015

50,To Train Travel - To Dream,"Old Los Angeles - just stepping into the hustle and bustle of the Union Station is like stepping back in time. There's something magical about train travel - something magical about being in a train station. The idea and imagination of adventures not yet taken, of people not yet met, of new secrets to uncover about you, about the world, about creating something out of nothing. **Attention Scriptwriters - I teach mentor and consult on Hollywood matters - especially scriptwriting - my constant nudge ""Get Out Of The House"" is important - so I say - get out of the house - visit the Union Station - sit in the chairs, have a bite to eat, people watch, imagine the unimaginable, take photos, share, write about it.

40,Interesting train station; take the Surfliner to San Diego,"One of the often overlooked modes of transportation in Southern California is the Amtrack line between LA and San Diego. The Surfliner is a run, excellent and relaxing way to travel. Spend some time prior to the train enjoying Union Station. Great for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB

30,Relatively clean and safe,Union station is clean and looks newly renovated. I have lived in New York city and experienced the hell that is Penn Station so I must say this is definitely an upgrade. One thing that takes away from my daily commute is the number of homeless that ask for tickets and hang around in the complex. It is important to me to feel safe and I think seeing police officers frequently in the station comforts me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradG5207JI
50,LA's iconic Union Station,"An architectural masterpiece incorporating so much of LA's history, style and pizzazz. A wonderful stage, if you will, now used for opera, television and movies, as well as it's original purpose and the city's new MetroRail and subway-street rail. Still busy after all these years, with Starbucks, Ben and Jerry's and kin and the sitdown, bahnhof/gare-type restaurant Traxx.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO

40,The Best Travel Hub in the U.S.,"This is a gorgeous station that is in the process of being restored to its original Art Deco splendor. The gateway to L.A. as well as a convenient way to travel from the city. Here, you can catch a waiting cab, take a city bus, hop on the city's light rail system, board MetroLink heavy rail which travels to the edge of L.A. County on the West and all the way down to Oceanside in San Diego County. Of course there is Amtrak, but in addition, you can take a dedicated express bus to nearby Dodger Stadium for free with proof of your game ticket, or a dedicated bus to and from LAX for a nominal fee. There are gardens, a koi pond, and sculpture decorating the exterior grounds of the property, and if you are hungry, you can choose from yummy Japanese snacks at Famima to fresh brewed coffee and pastry at Starbucks. This station even has a full service restaurant! While waiting for your connection, you might see a scene for a movie or tv program being filmed, or if you are really lucky, being asked to be part of that scene as a bystander, which is what happened to some lucky commuters and travelers in Pharell Williams' 'Happy' video! The cherry on top is the parking - a large multistory parking structure is available for $6 flat rate per day, put short term parking directly across from the entrance to the station is available as well. And if you are just dropping someone off and don't need to actually park? This station has a dedicated place for that as well, but make sure you are really just dropping off or picking someone up without a lot of luggage as agents are there to keep things moving.The station is conveniently located close to major freeways, downtown L.A., Chinatown, Dodger Stadium, and Olivera Street is literally across the street. If you have a substantial layover, you can secure your luggage in a locker at the station and visit one of the neighborhoods above, or if you are already travel wearing, sink into one of the stuffed leather arm chairs and relax until it is time to go. Safe travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PandoraSD

It has been open since 1939. It is open 24 hours a day so you can stop in whenever. This is a gem in the history of LA. The staff is very helpful. I would recommend taking a metro in or out. The courtyards are beautifully kept. I love the fact that the clocks are still working from the 1939 model. So much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JmPOW
50,Amtrak Train Service Los Angeles to Williams Junction (Grand Canyon),"Amtrak from Los Angeles departs 6:15 p.m. for Chicago. One of the stops is at Williams Junction Arizona for individuals who wish to visit the Grand Canyon. One can select a roomette (1st class) which includes private toilet and shower and sink and includes with meals. The next category is the Sleeper which does not have private facilities, or reserved coach, which has a reclining seat. However, each car does have toilet facilities. Shower facility are available and towels are provided.In 2013 Amtrak Los Angeles Station (LAX) introduced a private lounge for 1st class passengers to use while awaiting to board the train. The Lounge offers complimentary soft drinks including bottled water, hot chocolate, tea and coffee. Plus a variety of chips and very large chocolate cookies. The lounge is also has a few large televisions, free WiFi, and shuttle service to the train. Both the Roomette and sleeper include dinner and breakfast Traveling by train is an experience, not like the airlines, or airports. If your travels require deadlines, consider flying.One can be delayed in an airport, know that trains suffer the same. However, the beauty of train travel, is that you can sit in your private room, or in the viewing car, or if you like in the caf√© car. Make ""new best friends"" over a cocktail or a glass of wine.Unlike flying, one can view the country . At night one can see a blanket of stars.Surprisingly, the food on board is much better than airline food. While not gourmet, it is tasty, well presented. As an example, one dinner meal consisted of poached salmon served with Bearnaise sauce, steam vegetables and a rice medley. Breakfast was a standard selection, pancakes, French toast, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs. Steel cut oatmeal. All nicely prepared. Seating for meals is by table. Not by choice but by availability. So, if one is selective about dining with strangers, one might find these arrangements unsuitable. Upon arriving at 3:50 a.m. Detraining passengers are shuttled to the Grand Canyon Railroad Hotel.Amtrak is making an concerted effort to improve it‚Äôs customer service. While American train service lags far behind that Europe, it is still worth the money to experience this mode of travel. Have an open mind and a sense of adventure; enjoy what the trip has to offer.

The scene of many movies, this place is a throwback to a time when America ruled the world and did it by train. Make sure you download some history and check out all the nooks and crannies. The details are amazing if you take the time to notice.

Go and appreciate this treasure. Don't mind the nomads that you can see around, enjoy the station -have a drink or eat in one of its restaurants or across the street at the other LA Marvel: Olvera Street. You can always find a friendly worker who can help get to where you need to go.",
50,We relived Hitchcock's North by Northwest,"In March we decided to travel down the coast by train to San Diego. I've been through Union Station many times, but usually in a rush. This time we arrived a couple of hours early to have a really good look at this magnificent piece of architecture. I had completely missed on my other visits, that next to the booking hall, is a complete replica of the booking hall which film studios hire for filming. There was a film being shot while we were there but didn't see anyone famous!As well as this, there is a ""posh"" restaurant, a comfortable waiting room, friendly and helpful staff, in particular the gentleman who drove the baggage trolley, who was totally up to speed on British Premier League Football, or should I say, ""Soccer"", there is also a Subway, if your hungry, and a handy shop that sells everything from postcards, books, sandwiches, coffee, and my favourite Hot Dogs.Next time you're in Downtown LA I seriously reccommend you take time out to pay this superb building a visit.",
50,Beautiful and Historical,"Beautiful building ....worth going just to see the architecture. Great restaurant inside too - Trax! Had a fabulous meal there after a train trip back from San Diego. (The Pacific Surfliner from LA to San Diego is a MUST!)Olvera Street, the oldest street in Los Angeles, is directly across from Union Station and is full of fun Mexican shops and restaurants. Great family destination!",
40,Magnificent architecture and great to either just visit or to actually use for catching a train,We have passed through Union Station several times while riding Amtrak. Our connection is from the San Diego Santa Fe Station up the coast on the Surfliner and then on to our final destination. We rode the Amtrak Coast Starlight up to Vancouver and the famous Sunset Limited to Texas. Union Station is large but very efficient.,
50,Must see,I thought it's only a station so we don't mean to get there on purpose as we don't need that at all during our trip.While on our last day we went to Olivera so by chance we checked this out and it's so impressive and a mix or different architecture style. Really recommend to go there and have a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WJ_RTW

Deeper into the 'bowels' to Amtrack and Metrolink ticket counters, the waiting area with the lovely leather seats and finally onto platform 8B for the train to Anaheim.Came here several times after, going on either the Red or Orange line trains. It remains a great and functional building that moves passengers well. It had it's 75th anniversary last year and is good for a few more years yet!A finally a departed from here, again via the Flyaway bus from the Bus Plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
30,Fine for an Amtrak rider,"A couple years ago I took the Amtrak Sunset Limited from Union Station. The train leaves at 10 pm, so after checking out of my hotel in Anaheim I had most of the day free. After doing some LA sightseeing I headed on down to Union Station. I was able to have my bag held at Amtrak's baggage storage so I didn't have to drag it with me everywhere, even if just around the station.What impressed me the most is the number of homeless people in the station and on the patio just outside the station. I'll be taking the Sunset Limited again this fall and will be traveling on a sleeper car, which will give me access to the Amtrak lounge in the station. Much nicer than sitting on benches watching beggars and homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoustonianLady

It's a gorgeous piece of the past, a great place to people watch from the comfort of antique benches and seats and just an over-all relaxing experience, even with the bustle of travelers going by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junglegirl777
40,"Not a just stop, but a pretty one",We just visited to see the architecture. We didn't ride a train or check out the surroundings. We parked across the street for a couple of dollars.

We noticed they were setting up for a brunch at the restaurant inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Torte_Sue
50,Must See,Arrived at Union Station to take the Coast Starlight train from LA to San Fran - had no idea about the beauty of this station.

40,One stop hopping,"Ok, it's not exactly one stop, but as stations go, it's pretty convenient. It's a union, (pun intended) for LA Metro (Subway), Metrolink (commuter train), Amtrak, LAX Flyaway buses, megabus, and boltbus. It's got parking too as cheap as 6$ daily, and Olvera street which is a total food paradise is 2 blocks away. It's old in spots, but as good as it gets to a daily commuter. If you're just visiting, be careful to watch out for the signs to Amtrak/Metrolink trains, if you are caught in the platform for these trains, it will cost you a heavy fine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VamsiK859
30,Beautiful Station,"I have traveled through here a few times.The station itself is beautiful. It was always comfortable waiting for a train. I really liked when they added the food vendors.This time I was very glad I had a room on Amtrak and was able to use the Metropolitan Lounge. The waiting area in the hall was roped off, it looked cramped. I also noticed a sign for ticketed passengers only and a two hour limit? I was there well over two hours and wondered if they would have let me stay seated?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNW901
50,Visiting Union Station in the Quiet of Night,"I was staying at a hotel across from Union Station and after working, I took a look at the grand train station at night when there was little activity. The waiting rooms are unchanged with the wood paneling and you can still see the old grandeur of the station,I guess I couldn't help but notice the few people who were riding the train. It was a humble group, cereal for food, and maybe not middle-class. I am not being condescending, it is just my observation. However, this might have all changed as people are choosing the train over car and plane and I was at the station in the pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SacMax
40,"Great for People Watching, but probably not a ""Must Visit""","I'm a SoCal native and I love Union Station. I think it's beautiful and I love learning about iconic movies that have been filmed there. That said, if you are on a short trip to LA and it's out of your way, I definitely wouldn't consider it a ""Must Do."" If you plan on spending a day in DTLA, though, definitely check out Olvera St. and Union Station. It's a great spot for people watching, and has some nice gardens and, as I said, lots of hollywood history. But please remember, it's an urban transportation hub. You will see people of ALL types. If you've spent a lot of time in cities, you know that there are also darker elements to everyday life that don't appear in marketing and commercials. So, yes, if you come here with your family, you should probably be prepared to talk a bit with your kids about homelessness.

Lots of history and well organized. Great people watching too. AMTRAK's Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station is comfortable and their service was great.In fact, AMTRAK in general deserves a chance and some praise. If you haven't traveled by train before you should give it a shot. We took a sleeper car from Maricopa to Union Station. Then from Union Station we traveled up the coast on the Pacific Surfliner to San Luis Obispo. AMTRAK exceeded our expectations on all counts and we will definitely travel with them again!Special thanks to T. That' what she said her name was, T.

One was kicked off after he started 'chatting' up a single woman and would not leave her alone.THEN a police officer brought in yet another who was crying and carrying on because he had an outstanding warrant.The return trip in the evening was unevenrful.

30,Where the trains do NOT run on time.,"Last week my daughter and I took the Southwest Chief from Union Station in Los Angeles to Flagstaff Arizona for a college tour. The tour was a short day - 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. - and the train was scheduled to arrive just before 6 a.m. Plenty of time, yes? As it turns out, no. The train ""broke"" (never really got the full story) and we were parked in.. I think Riverside... for 6+ hours. We arrived in Flagstaff at 11:30, just in time for lunch break at NAU and the final session. The trip back was almost as disappointing, with a 30 minutes delay in arrival time at Flagstaff (10:30 p.m. instead of 9:57 p.m) and we arrived in LA a full one hour early. The only notice we got was an announcement over the PA, and we had to scramble to gather our things, get in the shower, etc. Here's what went well; the staff was amazing - I enjoyed speaking to all of them from our cabin steward to our waiter/waitress and the conductor. I'm SO thankful we got a sleeper cabin, as we could go back after meals and some time in the lounge car. And, if we had to park in a train station for an hour and a half waiting for our ride home, this is definitely a nice one. VERY lovely - rose garden to stroll in, BIG art deco type lounge chairs... you can almost see Bing Crosy and Bob Hope waiting for a train... and a Starbucks to grab breakfast and a coffee. the train station gets four stars, the train ride (i.e. Amtrack) gets 2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tex02mom

40,Good Stopover,"Okay, first lets be clear-- this is a TRAIN STATION. So by giving it 4 stars, I don't mean that it will blow your mind or that it is somewhere to visit for fun. BUT, I will say, it had everything I needed for my hour stopover this week-- restrooms, ATM's (Chase), and food. That was my biggest concern- being able to grab lunch on my stop, and I'm proud to report that they have a few options. Subway, Starbucks, a small grocery store, a bakery for sweets and cookies, and I think a bagel stand too, though I missed it. I noticed a shoe shine stand if you need it.It could have possibly used a liiiittle more signage for first-timers to get around, but luckily I had enough time to figure it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793mc

We celebrated the arrival of the New Year in style (tux and long dress) but did not find others similarly celebrating. The cutbacks from congress have affected the the trip a bit - hard to believe they would even consider eliminating the dining car from cross-country travel! The food was very good, our purser was great and staff really stepped up to the challenge of a full train.Union Station upon arrival was wonderful - even better than it's rival in Chicago in that the great hall was still being used for it's purpose. Other rooms are being used as rental but everything is open to wander around and take photos - it was really a blast from the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565andreaf

50,Architectural gem worth visiting,"In december 2014 I did a guided tour of this railway station with the Los Angeles Conservancy. The 2-hour tour was allright, but the building was really something special. Union Station was the latest build of the Grand Railway Stations in the US, opening in 1939 (75 years ago in 2014), but also the smallest. The architectural design is a mixture of Dutch Colonial Revival, Mission Revival and what they call Streamline Moderne; all complete with marble floors, distinct chandeliers and enclosed garden patios. It's been frequently used as a location in movies, mostly as a Union Station of some place (but for instance also as a police station in Blade Runner). Give yourself some time to walk and sit around to observe and appreciate the architecture (for instance the windows). It's ofcourse free to visit, as it is an active (but fairly quiet) railway/metro station. Or you can do the tour with LA Conservancy which gives you access to some places of the site normally closed to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evwtrip

My high ratings are likely skewed by our late night bus and therefore it was pretty much empty, and also the grotty, dirty, smelly, generally-unsafe-at-night stations I'm accustomed to in Australia (Melb/Syd esp). Anyway, it's still a nice and attractive space :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FeeJegs

50,Train to Santa Barbara,Decided to travel by train from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to visit my brother in Oct 14 on our American Holiday. The station is awesome. We also found out that as we were travelling Business Class on the train that there is an executive lounge tucked away up a corner which was excellent to leave our luggage and go and explore the station then go back to get refreshments with an added bonus that you are collected like royalty and driven to the door of the carriage of the train on the platform. Just like British Rail NOT !!! The train ride was excellent for sightseeing and comfortable no doubt helped by free nibbles and wine. Would recommend this form of travelling at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidayjunkieLeeds

40,Elegant station.,"As an enthusiast for station architecture it was a joy to visit Union Station in Los Angeles. It is a gloriously elegant building blending Spanish taste and style with the railway style of the 30's into an airy, light, elegant and dramatic building. Some of the fittings, lights, tiles, paving, doors etc are superb. A visit could be quite quick but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855JohnP855
40,"Beautiful, historic building","The bustling Amtrak station is worth a visit, even if you're not taking the train. So many movies have been filmed here, you'll surely recognize the interior. If you're taking a train, be sure to stop by the information desk, since there are usually pre-boarding procedures that must be followed, like getting a boarding pass even when you have your ticket.A very helpful young woman came to our aid at the Metro vending machine when we were trying to purchase a TAP card.

40,Great piece of iconic architecture reminiscent of many movies,If you're in LA and have an hour spare this is a great piece of 1930's architecture.You immediately feel transported to an American 1930's era movie on entering the iconic structure.Well worth a short visit while you're en-route to/from LA.In the surround streets there are also some nice coffee shops and tourist trinket stalls.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnP_Wiltshire
50,All Aboard!,"Union Station opened on May 3, 1939 and is located in downtown Los Angeles. It is not far from the historical tourist spot, ""Olvera Street"", which is on the opposite side of the street. You can briefly drop passengers off in a designated area along the curb. The parking lot in the front of the train station is for SHORT-TERM PARKING only. The rates currently are $14.00 daily or $2.00 every twenty minutes. There is no overnight parking in this lot. If you leave your car overnight, expect to be towed. If you need to park longer, there is an underground lot behind the train station on Vignes Street, Gateway Plaza. The parking there is currently $6.00 per day, and you can park there for up to one month. Over the years, I have departed from Union Station on trains going around the country; and I never fail to experience a special sort of exhilaration upon entering the station. I am in awe of its massiveness and its architectural style which is partly Art Deco, Mission Revival architecture, and Streamline Moderne, all of which take me back to another point in time. All Aboard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
50,Union Station to San Diego-Beautiful trip,"What an easy, non-stressful way to travel from LA to San Diego. I was meeting my husband at the San Diego Bay Hilton and it was so easy to get there not to mention the oceanfront views. When I got to San Diego, I got off and walked across the tracks to the local train--I could have walked to the hotel but the train was right there and I think it cost $1.50. The Amtrak train ticket was around $34 so all in all, an inexpensive way to travel what is usually an irritating drive. (The train makes about 10 stops so is convenient to many locales ion the coast.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraF167

It is a beautiful building and I have met interesting people here. The staff have always been helpful when I have been lost or confused. The first time that I was here, they had a garden area outside that you could wait in. The starbucks had outlets for charging cell phones and the Wetzel Pretzels in the bldg. have amazing pretzels with good sauces. I am not a big pretzel person, but these impressed me and I tried others since and they didn't compare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duane52

There's also the Gold Line that can take you right to Pasadena's Old Town. Within walking distance is Olvera Street and Chinatown. L.A.'s Chinatown is run-down. Go to San Francisco to see something better. The Red Line can take you to Hollywood and Universal City with other stops in between.

We eventually got on our way, but the train service left a bad taste.However! Union station itself is gorgeous.

50,A Trip Back in Time,"My last visit to Union Station was 30 years ago, times change and for the better. The station is a destination in itself. If you love architecture, old Hollywood movies, and/or people watching, this is your place. Between Amtrak and the Metro the station is humming with passengers. The building is glorius, clean, tidy, and kept that way by an alert staff. You can just see Myrna Loy and William Powell strolling Asta through the concourse. Every tile shines. The staff are incredibly helpful and informative. I can't wait to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarpBooksFan
50,Nice place for a Metro transfer,"I came here on my way to Pasadena (Metro: Gold Line). It looked very clean and old fashioned, with big brown chairs for passengers to sit on (you must have proof of ticket to be allowed in the seating area).

We had been to New York and Washington DC both of which left us underwhelmed. This one, on the other hand, felt like we were in a movie!

It was a Saturday afternoon when we went and it was very busy, but because of the large open space it didn't seem crowded really. I'm used to travelling via LAX and it was definitely not nearly as congested, although you could feel the rushed and hurried atmosphere that generally accompanies travelers that are trying to reach their destination. There are numerous places to get a bite to eat if you are hungry and the staff is friendly and extremely helpful.All in all, a wonderful train station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel1585

There is also a separate bar Trax. I ride Amtrak frequently and I love just passing through. It's a great place to begin to explore the revitalized downtown L.A. scene.The only downside is that renting a car from there is excruciating. There are only two companies available; Hertz and Budget. Pick up and return take forever. The alternative is to take Metrolink out. After that you can have Enterprise pick you up at your hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pasquinob_13

Like a very cut-back version of the main hall of Chicago's version.Arrive via Amtrak and it's a dreadful mess of tunnels without meaningful directions. You want to know where left luggage is? You want to know how to get anywhere outside? Forget it, you are just left without any instructions. I just can't understand how they can just presume that everyone knows where to go.

40,Station Safety Restored,"Previously, I submitted a review warning night travelers of the security issues. I was amazed at the 180 degree difference when forced to take a night train this past February. Due to weather, I missed my connection from LAX. My options were to stay the night at LAX or find my way via another mode of transportation. I decided I rather deal with the hordes of homeless people waiting for a train at Union station.I was shocked to arrive at a nearly empty Union Station. There was at least three divisions of security on the premise informing the few remaining homeless that the station was closing and they would have to depart for the evening. The bathrooms were clear and available for use. Sections of the waiting area had been completely removed. The rest was closed except for one section dedicated to Amtrak passengers awaiting their bus. We were all given wristbands or had to have proof of a ticket. Union Station actually closed at the designated time.For the first time in years, I actually relaxed and happily waited for the bus. As long as this effort to restore the safety of Union station continues, I purport that anyone should feel comfortable traveling through Union Station at anytime of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTrvl
40,Not just a train station,"There are stations that are nothing more than places to get trains. Union Station has not only history, stretching back to before the many Hollywood movies with scenes filmed here, but interesting architecture. No, you won't spend hours here, but it's worth a visit. Surprisingly busy at all hours of the day (at least daytime). Amtrak trains, Metrolink commuter trains, subways and buses. Interesting place for people-watching. I have not eaten at the Trax Restaurant (went down the street to Philippe the Original French Dip). You won't likely want to spend hours here, but it's worth a visit (and the trains are fun to take or at least watch).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sutter

30,"Interesting, Classic, Comfortable - not so much","Union Station in Los Angeles is the nexus for practically everything that rolls on rails serving the city and beyond. The building has appeared in countless movies over the years, and it's not uncommon to witness film productions in process around the grounds at any given time. If you are taking a train into Los Angeles, no doubt you will arrive at one of the many platforms that serve the facility. It is possible to connect with direct bus service from Los Angeles International Airport through a terminal at the east end of the station.If you are interested in using the Los Angeles subway system - the Metro, Union Station is where a couple of the routes terminate, however access to the entire system is provided by linking one route to another farther out from the station. Bus access to the city is also available from the station, as is a heavy rail commuter system serving outlying regions called MetroLink.Because Amtrak has a large presence in the facility, there is a constant buzz of train riders mingling with commuters and visitors - which is to be expected, and not particularly problematic. As such however, restroom facilities are constantly foul smelling and under various stages of maintenance. Lines can be long for food service or information assistance.One of the truly great aspects of this California Mission-Style building is the concaveness coffered ceiling in the station's main entrance. Leather chairs dating from the stations early days provided comfortable relaxation amid the wealth of art deco glass and architectural details. Sadly, this area is now limited to Amtrak riders waiting for trains for periods longer than two hours. Amtrak posted a security guard at the entrance the seating area, which has now been cordoned behind crowd barriers. It seems that Amtrak believes visitors to the station should stand or be on their way.A great bagel shop adjacent to the seating area is now gone in favor of a Starbucks that occupies a location closer to the subway Red Line entrance. I liked the old bagel shop as it gave the station a cosmopolitan feel. A pretzel shop is just across from the Starbucks, I spent about twelve dollars for a couple of pretzels and drinks. A small shop located on the south side of the waiting area handles newspapers and convenience items typically associated with travel. ATM machines are dotted around the main lobby. If you buy something to eat or read, be prepared to stand with it. The upscale restaurant Trax was not open during my visit. although it is a favorite for lunch or dinner.The entire building was undergoing a face lift during my visit. Scaffolding and plywood covering various areas of the facility along with plastic covering parts of the walls did not impact my travel, but made the building look even less inviting. No information on when this will conclude.Since the station is located downtown, it's an easy walk to surrounding neighborhoods. Alvera street - a Los Angeles landmark - is directly across Alameda street. Chinatown is only a couple of blocks farther.If your visit includes Union Station, be ready for crowds during commuting hours and keep an eye on your belongings. All in all, the building is worth a visit but not worth going out of your way to do so. Parking can be an issue, so it makes sense to ride into the station from a subway stop or even on the heavy rail Metrolink service that ends at Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnC330
40,Going Nowhere,"We weren't here to buy a ticket - we just wanted to see this grand old dame. What a beautiful piece of architecture, a block away from the oldest street in Los Angeles.

Living in New York, the contrast to Grand Central couldn't be greater. I adore the Spanish Art Deco style of LA, and this station is a fabulous example. It is vast and beautifully decorated. I hope one day soon it will be filled with bustling travelers again, and I was glad to see that were quite a few people there midday on a Friday. There are a couple of restaurants in the station and there is ample seating. This is a great place to rest after seeing the sights of downtown LA.

50,Stunning train station,"Let's face it Grand Central Station in NYC set the tone to the hub for all transportation to a big city. LA's Union Station just sprung up from an empty barely used station where underground clubs used to be and Amtrak to a bustling central station for all public transportation in LA. It's an impressive building. It's an historic building. It's a cool lookin' building inside and out.But come to Union Station to do many things: catch your next metro connection, or hop on the metrolink to various cities, the train to all points in the US, the LAX Flyaway ($7 one way, yep, my green alternative to LAX), and eye candy everywhere: architecture, art, deco. Turn your eyes to the ceiling, to the cool period lounges, it's a small central station compared to NYC but it's actually, cool, hip and very El-Lay.Best of all when you are stand up looking of the station and you see the wondrous Spanish influences to its architecture and the palm trees surrounding it, you know you are in the City of Angels.Visits: 200+ and counting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolola

50,"‚ÄúLike the station, Now I CAN stand the regular experience‚Äù - UPDATE - SUMMER 2013","So sorry. Forgot that I wrote a review during summer 2006. Several years have passed since my original review. The changes made are substantial. Somebody seems to have taken my comments to heart and made ALL of the changes. Several large restaurant franchises are incorporated into the visitor / traveler service station interior.Today, upon arrival, you enjoy a full-service Starbucks Cafe, eat at SUBWAY Sandwhich Shop, and enjoy a Wetzel's Pretzel or Dog. Other amenities offer a new and modernized convenience store, located just outside the main ticket area, See's Candies is present, offering confections for special occassions or just for the love of chocolate.Toward the North Main Entrance is a modern and luxurious restaurant that offers a quality dining experience. I noticed lots of folks who stopped to talk and have a quick dinner in such a vintage locale. - Nice! ""The first time I walked in I was completely taken by surprise; almost as if somebody actually read my 2006 and upgraded the amenities.Maybe some day, some smart apple will have Union Station Motion Picture Movie Memorabilia, featuring photos and autographs and other things from all the many movies that have used Union Station as shot location; the way that they did back in 1980-81 with Bladerunner. I'd love to have those kinds of things available to send to friends and loved ones before I depart for the main platform to catch the Pacific Surfliner or Southwest Chief. Amtrak has done much in the last few years to make riding the train ""a whole heck of a lot of fun."" Much has changed even since 2000-2001 when I rode the train every week.Final Comment: I am completely satisfied with the constructive updates and modernization of travel services within Union Station. *Recommended.Oh, P.S., - One recommendation: Travelers from out of town, have absolutely no idea how to make quick sense of the MetroPass, DayPass, Single Ticket price, or what. If you don't know how to get a ticket, make sure to find a local person or a staff person or you'll stand there and scratch your head or pay way too much for a ticket. As a computer person, I can tell you; it's confusing. But hey; that's part of the fun of learning how to ride the trains. Best, MDM. Fresno, CA",
40,Beautiful,"One of the most beautiful train stations I've ever seen. Not because of the building, but because of the small gardens and patios that surround it. Not worth to make a detour for, but if you need to catch a train here come 15 minutes early to wander around a little bit.",

The multicoloured tile designs, the hanging chandeliers an the iron work take ones imagination back to a different time.The logistics of the station are hard to figure out and not intuitive. We arrived by Flyaway Shuttle from LAX and found the Subway to deliver a passable lunch before our trip to San Diego. On the way back- after just two attempts - we were able to find the platform for the Red/Purple line of the subway - which quickly becomes an LRT (surface) line. The large mural (City of Dreams) in the east lobby is definitely worth a look.",
50,Nostalgia,"Union Station, if you go during the off hours or on a Sunday, is worth visiting. The whole place has been renovated. Be sure and look up at the ceilings in the main lobby and the old ticketing counter in the front that is sometimes used as a movie set. I took a tour with the LA Conservancy and we were shown all over. One of the more fascinating things is a waiting area where a stream flows through it. In the stream are artifacts from the area in the 1880's and early 1900's. enjoy this treasure and then afterwards criss the street to Olvera St. or go to Philippe's for a french dip",
50,Easy to get Around...,"Union Station is super easy to get around. The staff are helpful and friendly. Cabs run from the front of the station, buses run from the back. The suway links up here as well as Amtrak, t's brilliant for getting all around Los Angeles.",
40,Worth Visiting,Great old American Station where you can revisit the railway era of the USA.Mostly still in original condition with only minor upgrades to accommodate technology and progress.When it was built I'm sure this was good area in Los Angeles but be warned it is not now.This area is a hang out for vagrants and the homeless with many living in the park across the road.Many of these tramps and assorted filth make the station their home during the day taking over the seats and the bathrooms so keep your wits about you at all times.Big shame how it has turned out as it is a nice attraction to visit.,
10,be careful of crooks there,"i was a victim of an attempted scam on May 31, 2013 at noon. a possible employee (i'm actually not sure) asked me for $50. for the Fly Away bus saying because i didn't have a reservation.if that happens to you, report it to security & just wait for the actual bus driver.",
40,One Of The Last Great American Train Stations,"I am a native AngelenIo and have visited the station many times since the mid 50's with my grandparents and will be taking our granddaughter on her first trip this July on AMTRAK to Seattle. Union Station is iconic with its tower which could be seen from miles around then and is now dwarfed by larger dwellings, but it holds its own and is timeless in character. It has good bones. I am a train buff and had visited this station in the 60's as a kid instead of going to the movies just to watch trains ( including the famed Super Chief) departing and arriving along with people watching. They have gone through great lengths at keeping this landmark in tact and looks very much like it did in the 50's. The people have changed a bit. Travelling used to be a formal affair. Nowadays you don't know who's homeless and who isn't. The men's restroom in particular is difficult to maintain as it is the only public restroom in the building where the homeless will often visit. You can smell the urine before you reach the door...honestly. They have provided more concession stands for travellers. There used to be only a cocktail bar and gift/snack shop with a restaurant on the South wing. Most train stations are situated in the older areas of cities, but I have to say that L.A.'s is somewhat safer with more atmosphere than Penn Central Station in New York. Olvera Street is across the street with Chinatown a few blocks further West or Little Tokyo approx 5 blocks South. Bring comfortable walking shoes. These are long blocks and be willing to walk uphill to get to these attractions. I might also mention that there is quite an incline to the platforms from the vestibule, so if you are older and have heavy bags, get a Red Cap. It's a great place to visit. Architecture like this is hard to find. I have photographed the main waiting area and it won me awards as a student. You can't resist sitting in the oversized chairs which were built to last as long as the building and marvel over its purpose in history.",
50,Outstanding period piece but still functions well,"Built late 1930s by three railway companies, this time-capsule station still functions well. Even if you are set against using public transport while visiting LA, take a walk to the northern end of Downtown and spend at least half an hour marvelling at the unity of all the period design details.This is not a film set but a working rail and transit centre. Built in the Mission style with large and small arches, a squat tower and mostly surrounded by enclosed terraced gardens.Although long distance rail travel in the USA declined decades ago, the remaining cross-country services still leave from here as well as the more frequent daily 'Pacific Surfliner' trains linking the Pacific coast centres (making a great way to travel to San Diego for example, even for a day round trip).The spacious, tiled underpass under the platforms and tracks links to the massive LA bus station at the far (eastern end) via a large semi-circular modern transit hall which also gives easy access to the Metro. Above the underpass one set of stairs/lifts also gives access to the newish platforms for the Gold line Light rail service to Pasadena or East LA.A very nice touch in the underpass is the retention of the period-style lettering but updated for the new services and the metro. There is one bookshop, three or four fast food counter outlets a general food store and a restaurant at the far end of the main hall.Despite a few sad and shouting people sat in them, the scores of period leather armchairs are worth sampling in the main hall, if only to imagine to be about to make a 1940s train journey, Hollywood film style.

40,Beautiful Sation,"When we arrived after a 36 hour long rail journey the main thing that struck me was the beauty of the architecture. It looked like a relic of a bygone age when traveling anywhere had a sense of occasion.On leaving the station the heady scent of the flowers in the well maintained gardens was overpowering.The station lacks decent waiting facilities but i was assured by an Amtrak employee that they are planning on building a lounge for sleeper passengers.There are seats all around but it can be a bit of a struggle during busy periods to find more than a single seat.There are a few eateries with Trax being the most formal place to eat.We felt perfectly safe there both during the day and at night.All the staff we met from Amtrak, Metro and subway transport systems were friendly and helpful and the main information desk was very helpful in giving out subway maps and telling us where to take the train to.Even if you are not travcelling from there it's worth a visit just to look at the lovely gardens and view the classic architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyabailey934
30,"Very historic place. People, are another thing.","I've been to Union Station many times. It's a transit center for the Metrolink trains, Amtrak, and the LA Metro systems. The facility itself, has very cool architecture, a throw back in time!A bygone era! It is mostly clean inside, except for the bathrooms, which are very few, and very dirty! I always see a very long line, for the woman's restroom. I also see homeless people in there cleaning themselves too. Also, you will see somewhat sketchy people here. It is a safe place to be at, you just see a lot of weirdos, as well as normal people inside here, making their connections. There us a subway sandwich restaurant inside, as well as a Ben and Jerry's ice cream, and some other eating places I can't think of the moment. It is a short walk to world's famous Philippes restaurant, known for their awesome roast beef sandwiches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyboymlc

40,Beautiful building,Union Station is a fabulous example of an Art Deco building which has been perfectly maintained.

There are connections to all of the local subway lines.On the minus side --- a lot of degenerate types hang out here. Hold on to your belongings. The L.A County jail is close by and when the guys are released, they like to hit Union Station in search of money. Get my drift?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuppajoe2
40,Interesting Architecture,Our train from San Diego terminated at Union Station. While large it was well signposted and easy to navigate. Our luggage was delivered quickly and the staff were friendly and helpful. There is an information desk there with maps and assistance. Toilets were clean and there were plenty of food outlets. Check out the leather seats in the waiting areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimleyCairns
20,The Once Grand Ole' Union Station is No Longer Grand,"Traveling on a recent Amtrak excursion through NM to LA up the coast to Seattle and back, we had a long layover in LA @ historic Union Station. I remembered it as a child when my parents would travel with us throughout the U.S. on the train. What a shock to see it 60 years later! I couldn't believe how run down and in disrepair the once grand station was. It seemed to be a reflection of how the world in general has gone from people taking pride in themselves and their surroundings to letting everything go to Hades ~ in a constant state of deterioration. We had 1st class accommodations which usually means when you arrive at a major train station you go to Amtrak's 1st class Lounge. Not in LA, all they had in this HUGE station of many abandoned areas was a few crap tables sitting way off in a corner, a pot of awful coffee, and NO BATHROOMS in sight! You had to walk all the way through the station to find ONE public bathroom to service everyone in the entire station. It was pathetic! The once lovely station had also been configured into cheap concessions in a very congested claustrophobic area with red caps whizzing by on their carts, honking their horns and nearly knocking people off their feet so they could get by. There seemed to be no humanity left, no social graces in evidence anywhere, as in the 1950's when people still had some class. The grandeur of the architecture was in a state of ill repair with faded paint, dirty floors & windows, broken doors, and very sad, worn out leather seats reminiscent of a by-gone era. No one smiled or acted as if they were excited to be there or to reach their destinations. It seemed like a sea of people who looked and dressed almost as a reflection of the run down station. Union Station seemed to also be a mirrored reflection of the deteriorating infra-structure of the once great United States of America. I recommend avoiding this disappointing historic stop, particularly if you don't want to be reminded that the 'good ole' days' have long ago lost their luster as time goes by....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldSprinter18
10,Travelers beware! Smelly and filthy,"I've been to Union Station twice traveling by Amtrak. Although there is some historical significance to the area, the station itself smells like urine. I'm sincerely not kidding. The elevators, the chairs in the center of the station. I'm not entirely sure how it came to smell like this...if you do get stuck at Union Station for more than an hour and want to escape the scent of human waste, I suggest going to the park directly across the street on N. Alameda. It is this cute Mexican-themed park in the historic district. Nice benches and very clean. If you're here late at night though security will kick you out. Keep in mind that the bus drivers and general workers in Union Station have very little knowledge to help you get around. They have not seemed to know how late the trains and buses run. Amtrak is open late of course, but workers for metrorail, the big blue bus, rapid red buses, etc seem to be of very little help. Just plan very thoroughly before you trek through!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveljunkie419

Whenever I'm at the Station I feel like I'm part of that era of Hollywood. My husband and I (and our then teenage son) took Amtrak up to Portland, Oregon about 5 years ago. We boarded here, I had my ""I Love Lucy"" luggage with me. I could imagine Lucy and Rickey along with Fred & Ethel boarding with me. Just stopping here to get onto different lines makes the trip all the more special. It's just that kind of nostalgic place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markmom18

Great place to get some good photos. Just have to be aware of all the beggars outside the place or at least be careful of who u choose to give a donation to. It was a bit out of the way for us as we were staying in West Hollywood but worth the trip out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonH553
40,Your gateway in and out of LA,"Union Station is located downtown. It's a central hub in LA for the all local and long-distance trains. From here you can travel to nearby places, such as Pasadena and Hollywood, or further afield to San Diego, San Francisco or even Chicago.You can also make connections with local buses, as well as the LA FlyAway which is the best (in my opinion) of getting to and from the airport cheaply.And, for the film fan, you can take a look at scenes used for filming movies such as (500) Days of Summer and Blade Runner.A piece of advice. LA uses and honour system - there are no gates to trains to prove your ticket, you're expected to buy one on trust. Occasionally the county sheriff will do a check, make sure you keep your ticket on you and easy to hand at all times (not at the bottom of your bag) as there have been reports recently of people being roughed up a bit for not producing it quickly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliottj29

20,Visit Before Nightfall,"I have traveled through Union station for years. The last two visits, I had to catch a train at night. The difference was inconceivable! After nightfall, the station becomes a homeless shelter and chill spot for the prosecuted coming out of county. Three night security are barely keeping the situation civil.Good to Know:1. Try not to wait within the station: Head straight to your next destination or wait at the Denny's across the street.2. Keep proof of your ticket with you. When the security finally comes around they will require proof of a ticket. No proof and you have to leave the premises.3. Don't use the bathroom. The facilities are now temporary housing until the sunrises.4. Don't have cause for passing through Union station at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTrvl

I love it - like all the great stations there was no expense spared in the design and materials and now that it's been restored after years of neglect the quality shines through. Well worth a visit and you can eat there too with a variety of options. It is places such as this, along with City Hall, The Biltmore Hotel, Walt Disney Concert Hall and the unbelievable collection of early 20th c American architecture of the downtown area that are for me the real L.A. rather than the ultra touristy Universal Studios or Disneyland etc. which everyone knows about. Los Angeles is an amazing place with much diversity if you bother to search it out. Of course Hollywood is fascinating and worth seeing but there is so much more to this great city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rc51

40,Los Angeles Train Station Has Made a Return,"When I first moved to Los Angeles in the mid 1960's, Union Station was pretty much dead as far as passengers were concerned. Later on when Metro Rail and Metrolink came to Union Station, it brought life and passengers back to what is a marvelous train station with a lot of character and history behind it. Union Station these days is a very busy train station almost all day. There is also many buses that come right up to the back of the station; there is a big bus depot in the back. Recently, Union Station added a convenience store and other fast food eating places in the station where there was almost nothing available before to train passengers. Yes, Union Station in Los Angeles has made a big come back from what it was decades ago; and it is nice to see the train station being properly used again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance

40,Let Union Station unite your L. A. travel plans,"Several modes of transportation conveniently converge here in Downtown Los Angeles. No matter how you arrive, be sure to take notice of the iconic art-deco architecture inside and out of this fine old train station. You'll probably recall the southwest-ish motif interior from many television commercials and a few movies, to boot.Hungry? If your train and transit schedules allow, stroll directly across Alameda St to grab a snack. You're just a couple blocks from Mexican-style Olvera Street, Old Chinatown and Little Tokyo, to name a few. A few fast food outlets are also located inside the station.Nearly all the major transit and train networks have staffed help desks readily available for you newbies to inquire at. Your fellow passengers are generally quite helpful, too. Large, clear-lettered schedule boards and maps abound and will direct you to the correct track or bus pick-up curb to make your connection. The only downsides are 1) private vehicle parking is scarce and expensive and 2) They need to better upgrade and maintain the public rest rooms.I especially recommend the Metro subway Red Line to the city's commercial centers, Universal Studios or to Wilshire Blvd. Use the nearly-free ""Dash"" buses to access Downtown area attractions like Exposition Park, the Jewelry District or the vast Produce Market. Also, Metrolink trains will speed you to the far corners of the Southland. On my last trip we connected from Riverside to the northbound Amtrak Coast Starlight and were quite comfortable making the transition.Bottom line, explore, explore, and explore the area while you make your travel connections by car, bus, bicycle, taxis, subway, rail, on foot or even to the LAX airport or the docks at Long Beach. All modes seem to unite at Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonkeyOnTheWing

It was the highlight of my USA virgin tour in November and I was looking forward to this experience. Spent countless hours reading reviews, going through forums, websites to get ready for what was lying ahead of me.I was not disappointed. It feels so special to enter the station full of people and activities. Pulling my bag I felt special. Went to the designated area to wait for the rain and when that cart arrived calling us to the platform, I was one of the first to put my bag in the back and get in. I was driven to the platform and was excited to see the whole squad of carriages pulled back to the platform. Got myself on the Superliner carriage number 430 and into my tiny single cubicle.This is a thing I want to experience again. LA, Union Station and three days almost traveling cross-country to Chicago Union Station, afraid to fall asleep and miss the beauty of landscapes, deserts, rivers, townships, fields, towns and cities and people, stopping from time to time and waving to us on the train.

After a few days of seeing the views, watching people act crazy when they've had too much to drink and nothing to do, and having people hit me up for Dr. Phil tickets whenever I got into a conversation with them, I was ready to be home. When we finally pulled up to Union Station, I was kind of in a bad mood, but then I got a look at a station. It has that classic 40's look and is gorgeous. You almost feel like a bunch of sailors in their Navy whites are going to jump off the train for a fun weekend before they have to go to Europe to fight the Nazis. The station is still used occasionally for movie sets because it completely retains that vintage look.

You have to be comfortable with the variety of people that Los Angeles has to offer. And if you're a ""people watcher"" (like me!) this place is awesome.

So we sat in the huge, beautiful lobby and watched the passers-by picking through the garbage, begging for quarters, and sitting next to us smelling like urine. The bathrooms were crowded, so I can understand how those guys didn't make it on time....I will think twice before planning another layover at this station. But in all fairness, if I had been more on-the-ball, I should have realized that my sleeper-class tickets entitled me to sit in Amtrak's Traxx Lounge, where my experience likely would have been much better.As it was, I didn't even notice the lounge till it was time to board our next train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Choudoufu

It's pleasant, dark wood, 2 story interior with gorgeous inlaid marble floors & lots of cushioned (yes!) arm-chair-style seating is well-lit & airy during the day and glamourous by night when 6 huge period chandeliers make the main lobby of the interior glow like a jewel.Its green, oasis-like outdoor areas include a waterfall (yes!) where you can wander around or just wait in the shade and places to grab a quick snack or even sit down for a full meal (unless they're filming in there)!If you have time, walk across the street (literally less than a hundred yards) to Olivera street for the best Mexican food around. It is one of the historic sights that make up El Pueblo de Los Angeles Monument adjacent to Union Station. Be sure to save some time to see some of its many historic museums, buildings & exhibits (many of them FREE!) surrounding Olivera Street & Union Station.All of this makes Union Station a 'must see' if you're in Los Angeles.

10,"LAX Flyaway to Union Station, then Pasadena area via Metro's Gold line","I came back from visiting Hong Kong and decided to give public transportation a try and save my family a trip to LAX. I arrived at LAX and was able to locate the Flyaway easily. I hoped on the Flyaway around 815 pm from LAX to Union Station and that ride was surprisingly descent and non-congested for a Wednesday evening. It was about a 35 minute ride. Once I arrived at Union Station, it was quite dark, the lighting was horrible. We were told by the driver to go pay for the Flyaway ($7, fair deal for a short direct ride). The booth was off in some corner and there was only one way to enter the line to pay. Being a first time visitor to Union Station, the poor signage for the booth was a turn off. If you're like me and you've just gotten off a 14 hour flight, you want things to go smoothly and convenient. I don't think Union Station is up to par on visitor friendly level. The elevator was also vague and non-traveler friendly. I got in one to get down to the ticketing level for the Gold line and the button options were P, P1, P2, P3, and S. No other information on what the these floors lead to. Who the heck labeled the floors and how the heck is any visitor going to know what P stands for?? If Union Station wants a visitor to enjoy visiting L.A., and using the facility, make it CLEAR! There were no obvious signage of where to go. By 8pm all the customer service windows were closed, with no one in sight to ask which level the connecting rail tickets were located. I eventually found someone who looked like they worked there and asked him how to get to the Metro rails. Union Station should have a 24 hour customer service rep on duty as customers do arrive at the station after 7pm. Upon reaching the ticketing level, the Metro Gold line booth was way deeper in the tunnel than expected and confusing. The first ticket booth I stumbled on was for the Metrolink, a completely different rail system. Why can't Union Station or Metrolink/Rail just have all the ticket booths next to each other so you can choose the right destination. After buying the Metro Gold ticket, I had to take the elevator up to the train level. The elevator was quite dingy and small. 1 man had two bicycles with him and insisted on riding up in the same elevator that already had 3 adults with their baggage. Talk about being crammed into a small space. Luckily it was a short ride up. I've experienced much more intelligently designed public transportations in Hong Kong and Europe. The trains stations in New York and Boston were far better catered to tourists. Union Station needs to catch up and update the entire layout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorrrento
40,"Beautiful, classic train station from a romantic, 1940's black & white movie. Best place for a good bye kiss!","This is a peaceful moss covered log, in the downtown concrete jungle.

40,"Car rentals at Union Station, LA","If you are coming into Union Station either by Amtrak or MetroLink there are two rental agencies there; Hertz and Budget. They are right next to each other on the other end of the station opposite the baggage claim area. My recommendation is go to the car rental place FIRST and then go to baggage claim. Why? More than likely you already have a reservation and possibly are a member of one these agencies guick rent programs. I was at the counter for about three minutes. Although it is percieved that SoCal enjoys a faster pace of life, getting baggage off a train and onto the carousel doesn't fall within that parameter. Amtrak has a sign that states something to the effect that it can take up to 30 minutes for your baggage to show up. Ours took 45 minutes or in Amtrak-speak, right on time. Don't worry about anyone walking off with your luggage. Security there is very tight when it comes to luggage retrieval. You will have to surrender your tags and show your ticket stub. Several people were also asked to show ID randomly. The big reason for getting keys to your car first, especially if there are at least two of you (adults) is that the rental cars are parked right underneath that side of the station. Unfortunately there is no elevator, just a flight and a half of very miserable steps to negotiate. Wheeled bags don't go down stairs very well, especially a cross-country pack of them! If you have another person with you, they could take the luggage out to the front of the station (Olivera St side) and meet you. Either way, by getting your car forst, it saves schlepping the bags back and forth. By the way, the staff at both Hertz and Budget are both friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFNBerlin

40,A Hub To All Of Southern California And The USA,"Reading an older review sparked my desire to write my own. Being a regular daily commuter to and from downtown L.A. on the Metrolink, and a native-born Angeleno, I am very familiar with Union Station. A previously mentioned review of a small cafe(The Union Bagel), written several years ago does not adequately describe the wonderful selection of bagel and other sandwiches, and very fluent english speaking staff I'm familiar with. And for the more formal diners, there's always the highly rated TRAXXS restaurant.The gardens and fountains are peaceful and serene in this architectural gem, and always a delightful stopover in between my commutes. And I've never experienced any problem with ATMs here. If you're catching the Redline subway, Metrolink, Amtrak or bus transportation to numerous destinations, this is the place. And if you're a tourist visiting, you're not far from the Metrolink or Metroline to downtown and its expanding list of destinations(Disney Hall, MOCA, Geffen, Cathedral of Our Lady), along with Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Olvera Street and an ever increasing number of fine restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcron55
50,A great tour of LA starts from here...!!,"In the lobby of our hotel, we picked up a brochure for California Tour Lines. We discovered that daily tours departed from Union Station at 9:30 AM. All we had to do was call for the next day and there was availability! We came the next day and our driver was there. The tour maximum is 12 people, so it was very comfortable (there were only 8 on our tour). The driver knew a lot about LA and we learned a lot of very interesting things. One thing we didn't learn was his name. He said it a few times and we thought it started with a ""V"" but he had an accent. No problem though with understanding the tour.Our first stop was in downtown LA at a fountain. It was nice and we took some good pictures. After was the Hollywood sign. It was great. We had about 20 minutes there. We got an hour for the next stop, Grauman's Chinese and the Kodak Theatre. It was great! We took the Hollywood Walk of Fame and got some cheap souvenirs! There were people dressed up as celebrities by Grauman's and it made for a very interesting experience.Next was something we would have never been able to do on our own - celebrity-house spotting. We saw tons of celebrities' houses and he told us what was going on (if they were moving in, remodeling, whatever). It was so interesting! We even saw Jim Bellucci getting into his car! We drove down the Sunset Strip and through Bel-Air.One of the stops was Rodeo Drive. We had gone there already, but we didn't mind going again as it was nice there. We ate lunch on the Santa Monica Pier and had an hour and a half to explore there. We went to the beach and the teens enjoyed the roller coaster over the ocean at Pacific Park. Just fabulous...Venice Beach was the final stop. What an interesting place! Great fun.We had a little extra time, so on the way back we stopped at a peaceful little fishing/boat village called Marina del Rey. It was a nice place to unwind after the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelin3
10,"Like the station, can't stand the regular experience","Dear readers, I promised myself that I would post a review on Union Station this week if the opportunity arose. It has.The typical purpose for a visit to Union Station is not to experience the historical value of the site. Rather, it is to conduct busines and travel. Currently, the AMTRAK shuttles arrive at Union Station, transporting people from everywhere in California to this central Los Angeles hub.My first concern is that the small cafe located on the North Entrance appears to be staffed with undocumented workers that barely understand English. Second, when I attempted to pay with a mere ATM/Debit card from a major bank, BofA, they told me- ""We only accept cash."" Most people who understand small business understand why some small businesses ONLY accept CASH. The bagel sandwiches that I ordered were below average and tasted about as good. Actually, AMTRAK Dining Cars have GREAT food. Thumbs up for that. The mini mini store inside doesn't give cash back on a debit transaction. They also lack the ability to communicate in English, and I am Hispanic!My second concern is CRITICAL. As a traveler, I expect that a huge historic station such as Union Station should have a full compliment of personal and business services. All that was offered in this capacity was a Wells Fargo ATM. THE --- THING WAS BROKEN AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET MONEY TO PURCHASE SUNDRIES, PAY FOR FOOD, MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL, PURCHASE FROM THE CAFE THAT ACCEPTS ""ONLY CASH,"" AND AT $2.00 PER 20 MINUTES, YOU CAN'T EVEN PAY THE PARKING LOT ATTENDANT THE FEE TO GET OUT OF THE LOT!.I had to figure out the problem. I had to take a cab to local Chevron that was down the street and use THEIR ATM. Then, I paid the taxi cab driver who was complaining about not earning any fares for two hours, then return to the cafe, purchase my food, then go outside and pay the parking lot attendant the $6.00 dollars that was accrued due to my EXTENDED STAY AT UNION STATION.Union Station needs to get it's act together - fast. I can recommend the visual appeal to a traveler. It is nice, but do not expect any service beyond the place being a basic destination point for bus shuttles for AMTRAK and other carriers.Oh, by the way. I actually DROVE to the station and was just dropping off my brother for the return trip to Central California. At least in Fresno, California, you can access an ATM and pay for your food with a debit card. But what the heck, it's just that nowhere town called Fresno. What's Union Station's excuse??Mark, Fresno, California and Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markdouglasm2016
50,Beautiful & Historic Architecture,"As many times as I travel through Union Station Los Angeles, I still enjoy the beauty of this historic station. It has the Spanish influence of the old California missions. The chandeliers are iron wrought and gigantic! I have read they weigh 3,000 pounds each! The ceiling is a work of art, and there is also lovely, colorful tile work in the station. On either side there are two, beautiful, Spanish styled patios, each with a fountain.The Redline (Los Angeles' subway) terminates at Union Station. So it is easy to go sightseeing via the clean & fast Redline. Also, historic Olvera Street (where L.A. began) is located across the street from Union Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveLA
