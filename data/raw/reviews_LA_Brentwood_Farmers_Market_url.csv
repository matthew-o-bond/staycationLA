50,More than you hoped for,"From great food, bread, breakfast, lunch, fresh fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants to organic cosmetics and so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsjustamovie
30,Brentwood Farmers Markets,"Brentwood Farmers market is bursting with fresh produce and from what I saw, all of it was of very good quality.If you are in LA for any length of time and you're looking for fruit,veges,eggs and numerous other fresh wares come on down to this market. It's at 799 S Gretna Green Way, LA. You wont be disappointed.Unlike the Grove Farmers Market - which is rather large, Brentwood is much smaller (one street) and nearly every stall deals with fresh food of some sort. Seems ideal for the budding chef or person who enjoys cooking etc.There are no toilet facilities here (at least none that I saw) and it is quite a small market. You would go from one end to the other and back in around 45 minutes, depending on how many times you stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatm27
