50,Gardena Bowl Coffe Shop,"The food is absolutely wonderful! If you are from Hawaii, you would appreciate the food here at the Coffee Shop. I was finally able to talk my husband into going. We have been to Maui about six or seven times in the past ten years. The food here at the Coffee Shop brings back memories. My husband and I went to the Coffee Shop for breakfast two weekends ago - he had the Hawaiian Royal with the Portuguese Sausage, Chashu, Green Onions & Eggs over a Bed of Rice with Teriyaki Sauce and I had the Portuguese Sausage Mix with Portuguese Sausage, Eggs, Green Onions with Rice. Wonderful!!!! Both were delicious!",marshateru
40,"Good food, good times",This place has been in Gardena for many many years. Gardena Bowl food is always good. Has become very pricey though. This is a good place to bowl or play a game of pool. Gardena residents enjoy coming here,delrosariogloria
50,Great food and service,We have been going to the restaurant for years and I usually get the bacon fried rice which is DELICIOUS! And I've also tried the beef teriyaki tempura combo and the egg foo young and they are yummy as well.,euichki
40,Hidden spot for great breakfast or late snack.,Yummy Japanese home style cooking - inexpensive. We've had breakfast there for more than 20 years. They can accomodate a large group.,Sweetpea722
50,The Best Bowling Center,The owners are very involved with the center so it is clean and well kept. We have bowled leagues there for years. The folks that frequent the center are usually drama free.,krarnold84
50,Hell of a Bowling Center,"This place only has 16 lanes, but what a center. You have Dodee Kunz who runs the junior leagues and most of the Vegas leagues. One hell of a lady. You have the owners who help maintain the lanes. League action is fun and they do have a full bar. The food on the restaurant is great. They line up for it. This is a hidden wonder in Gardena Ca.",Craig B
40,Hidden Gem in Gardena,"Small family bowling alley that has a great restaurant and bar inside. They offer bowling, pool, and a limited amount of arcade games. Great spot for family time or even date night.",Kryssy Pooh
50,Great classic bowling with friendly diverse crowd! AWESOME fried rice at cafe!!,"Visiting from Seattle stopped here mid day/mid week while on family vacation. Closest bowling alley to LAX open during the day and had some time prior to flight. Large, clean parking lot. Customer service was awesome, even went to the closed bar to get us a couple beers. Played video games in arcade while we waited for our lane. There are lots of pool tables in a large side room too. Standard rental shoes in good condition, decent assortment of balls (nice being able to find a 10# ball drilled for fingers larger than a 6 year old's). Great high tech consoles, can even take your picture and connect to Facebook. Never any issues with ball return. Had the best fried rice from connected cafe!! We visit bowling alleys in the places we visit along with weekly bowling in the Seattle area and this was a great experience!",alitak
50,Great atmosphere,"Customer service were great, friendly and help when you need it. Clean and fun place to be with friends and family. Billiard room was open and easily got a table to shoot pool.",Gloria W
50,Gardena Bowling Center,Good food! Friendly people. A place to gather with friends have fun and bowl.I used to bowl her when I was a teenager. Lots of good memories.,patches19549
40,Breakfast and lunch awesome!!!,"Safety is so important to me when thinking about bowling solo-this place rocks it. On a part of Vermont that is hectic, the lot is spacious and well lit. People are everywhere so likelihood of any incident is minor to nil.Clubby atmosphere, everyone knows others. Now to the food- asian-type breakfasts in addition to diner fare. All so good. Large portions. I come back often.",bugnurse56
40,Pool Tables,"Good place to play pool. There are eight tables. You can rent a table for $4 per hour, per person. They play '80s music always.",ASega2011
50,Ono,"Everything is delicious, especially the portuguese sausage mix and saimin. Sometimes difficult to find parking. They always remember faces.",Patricia R
40,Good Ol' Hawaiian Japanese Food,"I love their restaurant. They have been there for years and the food has not changed much. I love their chashu. It reminds me of the old Cantonese chashu. Most of the time, I have chashu and eggs with rice. Their loco moco is good but it depends on the cook how the gravy is made. Same with the egg foo young. The bacon fried rice is so good. I always have a problem which fried rice to order, bacon or chashu. Service is good most of the time but I try to avoid Sundays. The good waitresses are off that day. You compete for parking with the bowling patrons.",Diane H
30,It's alright,Came here on recommendation of a co-worker who bragged about it all the time. Nothing special about this place other than the pancakes. You want Hawaiin Food go to Terry's Teriyaki. I ordered the garlic chicken. It was ok but the value was good so can't complain. Service was a bit slow but it was lunch time and there was a bit of a crowd.,cloudb310
40,Great Morning Specials,"Great bowling center for the price! This bowling alley only has about 15 lanes, but they do a great job of maintaining it. The morning specials are about $2 a game before the evening. Great for family, friends, couples, or just to practice bowling in general. Highly recommended.",Brian V
