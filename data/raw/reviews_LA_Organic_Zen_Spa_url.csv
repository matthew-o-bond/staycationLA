50,A true place of healing and meditation,"I have been a client of Organic Zen Spa since 2015 and had massages and Pediâ€™s done at the Spa. For me what is really special about this place is it does not have the typical atmosphere of being in a hurry, it has the vibe of a space where meditation happens, where you can feel safe to let go and relax. Just this alone is healing. I like that it is comfortable, well run and cared for.Frances Chau, the owner, strikes me as somebody who loves to have a clean, clear comfortable atmosphere for us. She gives off the energy of somebody who is calm, relaxed, and at home with herself. What I like is that she is attentive, caring and cheerful. She likes to laugh and enjoy the day.Recently the Organic Zen Spa has started a new program called ""Road To Love"" which is centered around meditation and healing. So the Spa now offers a new layer of care, spiritual self-care, the opportunity of inner balancing. This means taking the next step, taking conscious care of our inner world, as well as our body and our beauty. This feels good to me. I see the Spa offering something new and of high value which no other Spa in the area is offering in this way as far as I know: appointments & consultations for spiritual and mental well-being. Check it out, and check out the Road To Love, and enjoy this tranquil well cared for place of rejuvenation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulwelch
