50,Bucket List Must Do,"Experience word is a understatement! This is a Gallery, Simulator, Auto-Shop, and an all around driving experience.The pro instructor Hunter Feldman was so calm in giving instructions at 24 M/H, 60 M/H and 101 M/H.The Porsche cars offered are the entire array of Porsche line up, From Boxter to Panamera to 911 GT3 and 911 S4 all wheel drive.The designers that put together this center clearly spent time learning history of famous tracks like Nurnburg Ring and Le Mans. They've also created challenging conditions such ice, low traction pad, slalom course and drifting circle.If all of the above doesn't impress you, then sit tight in your $7000 per carbon fiber bucket seat, and activate Launch Control, them get catapolted to 60M/H in 3 seconds and feel the G force pull on your body.Highly recommend this to every car enthusiast. If you love Porsche or just German cars, this is a must. If you love speed ..well you get my DRIFT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada
10,"Could rip you off for up to $10,000 unless you can drift a Porsche next to concrete wall...","So they make this sound like you're going to drive a Porsche (costs at least $400) around a track and see if you like it.In reality they will want you a) drift the car on wet track b) in fact a wet track with concrete barriers IMMEDIATELY next to it c) and ""mulch"" as a run off on the other side.Except the ""mulch"" will damage the car if you slide off.So in other words, they want you to drift the car (something I don't normally do or want to do) on a ""low friction course"" and if you slide off you'll be guaranteed to do thousands of dollars of damage.Why are you doing this?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjbecker
50,Matt’s Birthday,"Took my son for his birthday, he is 15 got him 30 mins on the simulator then he rode in a GT3RS with a pro driver around the course. After we had dinner at the cafe!

50,Wonderful 3 course dinner,"The first course we all skipped but the second course was excellent. I had king crab and although the portion was small, it was very tasty. Third course was 4 oz. filet mignon on whipped potatoes. Outstanding. Dessert was unbelievable. Caramelia cremeux was little banana cakes, passionfruit sauce, cocoa streusel and smoked vanilla ice cream. The passionfruit basically exploded with flavor. One of the best desserts I’ve ever had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gasbash
50,Unleash Your Inner Racecar Driver,"I bought my very first Porsche last year (Cayman 718) and my husband surprised me with a reservation at the Porsche Experience Center as a birthday gift. I reserved the same car I own so I could see how it handles on a track and under different conditions.My assigned instructor was Troy, who was very friendly and taught me so much. I told him how apprehensive I was about some of the track elements (the ""ice hill,"" for example), and he told me by the time we were done, I'd be way more confident in my driving abilities. Troy wasn't wrong.We started off on the skid plate. My first time I slid, I did a complete 360 and started screaming. Troy took his time and we kept practicing, learning where to focus my eyes, how to brace my shoulders against the back of my seat, and when to turn the wheel. By my third try, I was able to steady the car and take immediate control. I practiced this half a dozen times and I felt so accomplished when I mastered it so quickly!Some of the other tracks I wasn't so good at mastering. There's one where you have to hit ""marks"" back and forth, and the course is coated with flour so your wheels will slide everywhere. I did not enjoy this aspect of the PEC. It was difficult to hit the marks, and the feeling of a loss of control messed with my head. Ditto for the ""ice hill,"" I was just too scared to enter it fast enough. Troy kept encouraging me to ""accelerate!"" and ""don't brake!"" I was supposed to enter the ""ice hill"" going 70 mph, but I don't think I ever got above 50 mph.It was clear I was much slower and cautious than the other students on the track that morning. I was the only female driver, most were 35 - 55 year old men who were driving like absolute maniacs! I sometimes had to pull over and put my flashers on. I never got going super duper fast, even on the track, because there were so many curves and obstacles that I would just instinctively slow down. I think this frustrated Troy, but he remained upbeat the entire time.I wish the PEC had a straight up NASCAR style racetrack, like many of the popular places like SpeedVegas, that doesn't have little dips and curves. That way, I could've gone a lot, LOT faster. I love to drive fast, but the little obstacles here made it impossible for me personally to do so. Now give me a flat, straight stretch of road and I will be outrunning the cops like Burt Reynolds in ""Smokey and the Bandit.""I also wish you had more than 90 minutes of time because I wanted to practice more slides, slips, and turns. The class time is far too brief.My two insider tips:One: Bring your own driving gloves if you have them. I drive with my Italian leather gloves every day, and they helped a lot here. The facility does not provide gloves for your use, but you can bring your own.Two: Take a couple of Dramamine or Bonine motion sickness pills before you arrive. I was so happy I did because I got queasy several times and without those meds, I might have puked!The facility itself is world class, with a dozen or so vintage and racing Porsche beauties on display. The restrooms are clean, and there was a cool outdoor elevated observation area for my husband to watch me in action as he grabbed an espresso from the snack bar.Was it worth the $350 (plus added insurance) that I paid? Not really. But would I do it again? You betcha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moviegal226
50,Ask for Taran!!! What a fun experience!,I spent the entire day at this place and it was worth every penny! I still have a smile on my face.

The launch mode straightaway is a kick in the pants. The circle slip track is also flat out FUN. But putting the car thru the race track is the best, with a little instruction from your coach, you are pushing the car to the max. Full,throttle to full brake, hard smooth turn and back to full throttle. If you ever get a chance to go drive one don’t pass it up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davek705

50,Best Hidden Gem in Carson!,"This is such a hidden gem in Carson! I'm not personally a car enthusiast, but I had a wonderful time viewing the showroom floor and having lunch in the restaurant overlooking the track. The service was excellent as was the food. Things I really liked: black dinner napkins instead of white, variety of entrees on the menu (burger to scallops), reasonably priced lunch for an upscale restaurant, view of the track, bright and well decorated, car shaped butter, hot bread and my short rib was delicious. I wish I had come here sooner!You can walk around the showroom, you can see the track from the 1st floor, and there is a casual cafe on the 1st floor as well if you don't want to do fine dining. The restaurant is on the second floor and has a bar and a private dining room for events. It is adjacent to a viewing deck. Just about every seat in the restaurant has a view. Plenty of parking in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,All out Awesome,"I'm not a huge car freak but my husband and two of our friends are, so we ended up at the Porsche Experience for lunch overlooking the track. I am now a convert if for no other reason that this place delivers what it promises - an experience. We were greeted as if we were honored guests at the check-in desk, given a visitor lanyard and directed through a showroom of stunning Porsches (yes, even I started lusting after one until I saw the $293,000 price tag. I have such good taste). We went on through the gift shop, passing Porsche bicycles, the cutest jackets, and sexy sunglasses on our way to the elevator. The dining room is as sleek as the cars and we were seated immediately. Our waitress Mary was fun and efficient. The luncheon choices were excellent. Most started with the leek soup - fabulous. I chose the ahi starter. The ahi was delicious but there were a ton of onions in the dish. Not being an onion eater, this was disappointing. However, my husband had it as his main and he adored the onions. The Kobe burgers were impressive. I had the flank steak lunch. All the while, diners were up and about, watching people on the track, coming back in for their food and out again with a drink. The day was bright and beautiful. I only had one reservation. The food was not hot. It wasn't even warm. None of us minded but it was interesting that we all had the same observation. When we retraced our steps we all noticed a large, glass enclosed room. It appeared to be a training area for Porsche mechanics. The place was spotless, reminding me of the JPL labs. it was fun to watch them going through their paces. Top to bottom, this is a place to visit if you love cars and a great dining experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
50,Awesome,"It was so exciting watching the drivers on the different tracks, theres the Launch where they take off Zero to 100 plus 😱 and the Four Wheel Drift looks like a lot of fun there are a few more tracks but I don't know the names. The experience must be something you'll always remember. They have a very nice restaurant up stairs with great food and an outside area where you can eat as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432aliceg

50,GO FOR IT!!!,"WOW!!! Outstanding 90 minute on the track experience! Expensive? Yes. Worth the cost? Yes!I drove a Macan Turbo and Steve V. was my driving coach. He was explained everything and rallied me on when I was hesitant. What an amazing car and who knew all it can do and handle! The 90 minutes on the track went by quickly. I would have liked to have done the straightaway Launch Control a few more times and the Carousel. I wasn’t a big fan of the water and ice sections, but did them a few times each and was glad I did. The Macan was awesome to drive. The problem is is that now I want one! 😂My husband drove a 911 to make sure that is the Porsche he wants to own. He also had an awesome coach and his driving experience was everything and all he hoped and expected it would be!We were warned that you can get queasy doing some parts of the track. We took a Bonine for motion sickness the night before and it definitely helped. Drinking a little water during your track time will help, too. The coaches will go over it with you before you start.We followed up with lunch at Restaurant 917. (I suggest making reservations when you schedule your driving experience date and time.) It was the perfect way to finish your day at the Porsche Experience Center!GREAT EXPERIENCE , GREAT DAY!

50,"Amazing ""Grown-Ups"" Disneyland - Not just for Porsche Enthusiasts - all need apply!","This is one of the easiest and yet most difficult reviews to write... It is easy, because the Porsche Experience really is AMAZING! (but capitals and exclamation mark just don't seem enough)... It is difficult, because they do so many things right, and I feel they ALL need to be mentioned - where to begin...Not so easy; from the moment I got through on the phone with Jeffery, who most surprisingly found me a cancellation just a few days before my desired time to visit (I only had a one-day window), and he was patient in listening to my excitement, actually adding more of his, to make me even more excited - and I would be even more excited as my experience approached...To the on-line communication when I did not realize my confirmation may have been processed by my e-mail as spam - and when following up, getting the most reassuring reply by e-mail from Simi - assuring me my ride is secure and my credit card accepted...And the all smiling reception staff, and security member, when I may have just got there pretty well at opening - hoping to get a glimpse at some of the nicest Porsche vehicles, both in the reception hall, and the adjacent vehicle maintenance facility - the glass windows provide unrivaled views.The initial contact with my professional driver, Ricky, was so genuine, so sincere, and so enthusiastic, I thought he was more anxious to go for a drive than was I - all my anxiety, fear and apprehension left in the ""pits""... This was a driver, ready to share his wisdom, respect for the sport and obvious love for Porsche... I suddenly realized I was in for the time and drive of my life - and when we got to the Porsche 911T - the ""basic"" model in some ways, even being equipped with a 7-speed manual stick, Ricky's immediate tour, highlighting of the car's features, it's design to make it a driver's car - I suddenly realized why ""there is no substitute""An explanation of the gauges, seat adjustment and settings; and we were off, Ricky (grinning ear-to-ear) at the wheel to get me used to the track layout. Immediately he shared his extensive knowledge about the track's acceleration, braking, shifting and apex positions - so simply, so convincingly and so confidently; I was ready to take over with no fear (or just a little)... There was a lot to think about, but once I was behind the wheel, his calm yet deliberate voice made my speed keep climbing, my braking seem effortless, and my corner apex positions confident - and I have never been on a race track, and even though I do own two Porsche, and drive a lot - this is totally different, and legal... You CANNOT duplicate a track experience on a road - the short, precise motions of the car are unique to such a closed circuit - some may say, the ""car is the star"", and so, in that case, Ricky was its ""soul""...The 90 minutes flew by; besides the track (handling circuit), there are some 6 other driving experiences - all uniquely different, and all more fun than the last - my cheeks are still hurting from all the grinning, and I write this 6 hours later! The most amazing part is the confidence you develop; needless to say, the professional driver makes the experience one you will never forget. When the experience was over, the sheer joy of Ricky's enthusiasm as to how much fun we had was almost another highlight, and perhaps a further ""experience"" - I felt like we had just conquered Le Mans, and won... If there had been a podium there, I would have stepped on it! Ricky was that GOOD! Of course we would have shared it...BUT it was not over - the professional drivers went for a quick break, prior to the next lot of ""champions"", and I went to take pictures - lucky enough to run into Dave, head of Experience bookings. I noted the missing email and its have going to spam, and he enthusiastically and understandingly explained the reason, but so delighted it had been worked out so well by Simi. He knew I had fun, my smiles and enthusiasm were now contagious, as were Peter's, head of the pro divers - so happy and sincere! - and I'm out of space ... ;-)...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaymanMartin

I ate at the restaurant upstairs call 917. I was part of a large group from the Porsche Clubs annual board meeting out in LA. Dinner is a most joyous occasion there with every detail taken care of. Something I thought that was unique and clever was the shape of the butter patties...911 Porsche sports cars! Very cool. I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.

There is also an expensive gift shop for the avid Porsche enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
20,"Good place, just not for me","I went here with a group expecting to just see some cool cars and tour the facility. I wound up winning a driving experience with an instructor, who was a great guy. So nice, he ended the ride early at my request.To be perfectly honest, I hated every second of it. In fact, I made them stop prematurely. Riding--not driving and being in control--at super high speed is just not something I can apparently do. Just a word to the wise; you have to be the kind of person that LOVES roller coasters and has no motion sickness whatsoever to enjoy this. I'm negative on both, so just not the place for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenespace100
50,Only for the driving experience...,"When we planned for our visit we only took our time to decide which vehicle to drive. The location is ideal and distant from the main areas. Because of this we arrived quite early with comforting smile and warmth welcome whom showed us the way to the simulators. From this point onward a competition aroused between the four of us. There are six simulators, a well trained technician and enthusiasts of racing cars Aaron Clark, more than 10 cars and famous circuits to pick from. We ended up racing twice. We tried the virtual reality, which happened to be my preference, yet one of us felt unease (dizzy) with the VR’s and has to take it off.As for the main event on the road and off-road. The several courses were quite fun to make us of intriguing potential the Macan has. Turned out to be hard going against one’s natural reaction, yet Patrick Mordaunt, the instructor’s expertise and guidance led the way through the downhills, ice-replica and fun-to-do launch control.The store is relative small, although bares the essentials.The restaurant was pack, we had to wait.

Nonetheless, there are a handful of important Porsche cars to look at (the 917-30 Can Am, the GT1, and a few others). The highlight of this visit was the store, where I found many vintage posters (which are not sold at the Stuttgart museum). I got several of them. The place is very clean, well kept, and the attendants were very polite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosvelascoteran

I have done ""racing"" and ""driver education"" experiences all over the country, and I have to say, PECLA is my favorite.I HIGHLY recommend doing the GT3/Turbo. If you're looking to go as fast as possible, while remaining in complete control, this package is for you. You get to see the difference between a Naturally Aspirated RWD 911 VS a Twin Turbo charged AWD 911. This experience included the handling track, launch control, drift track, ice hill, g-force on the kick plate.With PECLA, you spend 90 full minutes on the track. When you go to Vegas and other venues, you spend nearly the same money and spend about 1/3 of the time on the track. I did Dream Racing in Vegas, which was AMAZING.

The coach was initially nice at explaining and providing details instructions, topics such as cornering, braking, acceleration, etc.However, at half way of the course, he seemed distressed by sounds from his earphone and yelling for an emergency stop with anger tone. I have a very serious concern of his unstable irregular tone and heavy breathing sound. That behavior was unexpected from a professional driving coach.Then, later on, he even told something that I can’t even write it here to Porsche gift shop worker. It was not a pleasant experience at all.I’d recommend people to go to other racing courses/program in Las Vegas race track instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericlA4529KE
50,Most exciting 90 minutes you will spend in LA,"This was the second time I’ve driven a car on a track and absolutely amazing from start to finish. I drove a Cayman S.My instructor started by asking me about my driving experience (I’ve ridden motorcycles, been on a track once before, do a lot of winter driving, am a car enthusiast) and tailored our track time to make the most of it. I got through all of the modules (low friction mini-track, low friction hill, low friction skid pad, launch control strip, kick plate and track) and was able to do each one as often as I wanted in the available time. They were all challenging and educational. I came away with a better appreciation of my driving ability and what the car is capable of.By the end I was sweaty and exhausted - 90 minutes on the track is a long time. But to end it off my group was able to take a lap in the brand new Panamera E-Hybrid.If you are in the market for a Porsche this is a total no-brainer - you can try out different models to see which best suits you. And if you aren’t in the market to buy but want to just the experience, it is $425 well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2306JSvictorh

Porsche has done an excellent job in creating an experience center for both current and future owners of their cars.

The ""coach"" who rode with my husband was very experienced and made the drive a great time. It was one of the best gifts I have ever given him. For those who want to watch the track, there's a balcony to view almost the entire set-up, a very exclusive restaurant with a view of the track, and a patio with seating on the track level.

50,Driven how it was meant to be driven....,"What a day... I know many have written about this place and we say the same thing. But, let me say this, if you are a fan of fast cars and want to better understand a cars capability.... this is definitely the place to visit. Pushing the car to its limits in the turns was AMAZING. The key to the whole experience is to listen to the instructor. These guys know this track like the back of their hands. Patrick was my instructor and did a phenomenal job of breaking down the course which allows you really get the most out of this experience. For reference I did the 911 Turbo and the GT3RS.

40,Nice course,I may be too biased having done the amazing Segway raceway track in Sonoma and given an all day experience... much more exciting than the 90min over in a flash experience offered by Porsche.I would have LOVED to do an All Day experience- with Lunch included- hours rather than minutes focusing on each move.The course and training was Amazing! i just wanted more time! And for the Price- it seemed a bit of a premium for the time given.The course is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LookattheBRIGHTside

50,"Great fun, this is one of only 3 in the world !","It is free to come and visit the boutique, and walk around the showroom of various Porsche models. The activities are best reserved in advance.....for the younger set there is a virtual room with a great driving experience a little pricey for 30 minutes but worth it according to our teenager. There are driving experiences for 21 and older that need to be booked in advance also pricey (ours was entry level at 495.00) for an hour and half with a professional driver beside you while you drive the Porsche of your choice (car selection varies by price when you reserve) on a professional track. There is a nice restaurant with decent food and great observation deck for the rest of the family to watch you spin out as you try to manage this quick little car...So fun we will be back to partake of the other offering for the younger set...it is called a demo lap you ride as a passenger with a pro driver...super cool for young boys with a love of cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingfam2000
