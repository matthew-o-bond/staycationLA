50,Wonderful and fun,"Wonderful and fun! My wife and I went there for a date and had a great time. I loved that each room engaged all the senses and encouraged interaction. We got lots of awesome pictures there! The staff were helpful and explained the ideas behind each room to us. I also appreciated that they scheduled visits so there were never too many people at a time. There are lots of restaurants on nearby Melrose and La Brea, so our visit was easy to combine with lunch or dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bamiller59
50,A.Ma.Zing.,"FLUTTER is so wonderful. Immersing yourself in the art installations at this place is incredibly fun and inspirational. I've been there 3 times now, and cant wait until the next wave of art installations comes in December. If you're in LA... GO to this place. You'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllysonRice

50,A MUST SEE!,"This is an immersive art experience that has multiple amazing and colorful rooms that let you interact with the art! Such a fun thing to do on the weekend or if you are visiting LA from out of town, I highly suggest stopping in.
