10,Mall?,"I cut through here walking back to Union Station. Downtown has stores such as Macy’s, Ross and Burlington but NONE are in the mall! The anchor is a tiny CVS drug store. There is a food court, credit union, cleaners, shoe repair, and one government office. That’s about it. The location will be valuable some day for an office building but for now there is no reason to visit unless you want a sub sandwich etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spacepilot500
10,Don't Bother Stopping,This is a very sad mall in the middle of the civic center area of Los Angeles. It is not very big and it lies below street level. It is more like an elongnated underground strip mall. Many of the stores are closed and boarded up. The grounds are not kept up...there is trash on the ground. There are a couple of chain stores here...CVS and Quiznos. The other eateries are independently owned and look like they are just holding on.This is downtown so there is limited parking (and very expensive).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
