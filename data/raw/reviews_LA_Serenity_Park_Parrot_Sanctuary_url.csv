50,Magical place for veterans and parrots,"Serenity Park Sanctuary is open for free to all veterans of the military with their VA ID. I went with my husband who is a veteran. For others who want to visit we were told they need to plan in advance and schedule a tour through the sanctuary's website. It is located at the VA and is a work therapy program run by veterans and for veterans so it is not really a place for the public to visit unless you are with a veteran. The parrots have it made, though, and it is glorious to see them fly in their big aviaries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1461CGjenniferr
50,A hidden gem!,"Few people know about this delightful spot- and it's not easy to find the first time - but, definitely worth it.. A small place to get up-close-and-personal with a wonderful variety of beautiful parrots who love having visitors and, nosily, let you know that. The staff is lovely and knowledgeable - and most willing to share their expertise. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357dianer
50,Up close with parrots,"I visited this sanctuary after reading the New York Times article ""What Does a Parrot Know About PTSD?"" It is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to noon (weekends by appointment) and it is free. It is a small area that allows for close-up contact with the birds, many of which are very social and will hang on the cage inches from you, fluffing their feathers, making eye contact, and calling out. I have never gotten this intimate experience at a zoo.The staff is on hand to answer questions and there are educational plaques. It is a win-win situation, as veterans take care of the birds and both benefit from the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heidi-LA
