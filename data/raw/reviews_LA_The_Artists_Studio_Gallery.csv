30,Small shop,"This is a small shop in the newer part of the Peninsula Mall. I've been there a few times to walk around. Never have seen anyone inside other than the person working there. This is a co op run by local artists. There are paintings, jewelry, pottery. Don't bother going out of your way to stop here.",ncjc2013
30,Gorgeous but not many people( Jun-Jul 2013,"Wow! It was 4 years ago when I went there...I really liked the artists' paintings both oil and watercolours. However, I tend to feel very isolated due to the lack of spectators and bad services...it was quite boring as well. Therefore, I can't give it a full rating.",Laxiaozi08200912
