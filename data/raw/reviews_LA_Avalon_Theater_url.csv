50,Awesome,"The only theatre on the island and well worth the trip, Catalina is a whole experience in itself. nowhere like it in the US, The theatre is the icing on the cake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vernettab2020
50,A beautiful piece of history,"It is so wonderful that the Avalon Casino (not a casino as we think if it--no gambling) has been quite well preserved. It is an art deco masterpiece, consisting mainly of a theater and a ballroom. The history is fascinating. I was fortunate enough to have attended an event in the ballroom many years ago. It is gorgeous, and the list of stars who have been there is amazing. This trip, we visited the theater, which still shows current movies. On Fridays and Saturdays before the movie, a concert is presented on the 90-year-old theater pipe organ. It has not been perfectly maintained (the organist told me it is a bit of a struggle to play), but it is a thrill to hear it and imagine what it sounded like in it's day. My one regret us that I wasn't able to take the Behind-the Scenes tour--next trip for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiceo898
50,Come see a movie before it closes!,"This is a fantastic, historic movie theater. It’s like a step back in time to another era. There is even a organ which is played before the movie on Friday and Saturday nights. Then you can settle in and watch a first-run movie.Unfortunately, the operators of the theater plan to stop showing nightly movies there at the end of 2019, unless they can figure out a way to make it profitable. They plan to just use the theater for special events.Many people want to keep the theater open, so maybe they’ll come up with a plan. It would be a shame to close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avalon2020
30,Simply amazing Organ,"Prior to seeing the latest Avenger movie in the theater, we listened to the masterful organ player. The organ music was better than the movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billm247
50,Fun to see a first run movie in this classic theater!,We walked up to the Casino while exploring the island. We noticed a flier advertising a first run movie in the Avalon Theater that we had not yet seen. (Note that the Avalon Theater is inside the Catalina Island Casino. It took me a minute to figure that out!) The flier said there was a showing every night at 7:30 so we returned just in time to catch the show. There were no previews so don't be late if you go! We were so pleasantly surprised to see the beautiful decor inside. Folks of the older generation will be taken back to the days when more theaters were this ornate and will certainly appreciate it. Snacks were served at the concession stand. It was a wonderful way to spend the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
50,"Lots of Waling, but Fascinating History","Took a tour of the Avalon Casino. Tour included construction, history of the facility, the theater, the projection room, and the wood floored ballroom. Tour guide was a character with lotos of stories, possibly embellished, but interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrb881

50,"WOW,neat place.",We toured the place in 2010 and this year(2018) we watched a movie. Awesome place. well worth the $ Don't forget the popcorn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsotinKid
50,Beautiful Movie Theatre,"The Avalon Theater is enormous and the artwork is beautiful. The theater itself has stunning paintings and the ceiling is designed with twinkling stars. Throughout the summer months, they show movies there every evening, usually starting at 7:30. The art and detail in this historical building is so worth going to check out.Before and during the movie there is popcorn and snacks for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrea6888KD
50,Avalon is a must see destination!,"Take the tours, read about the history of this little island and enjoy the visit. It is a great weekend trip! If you like to scuba dive, take to the water. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasVegasPatti2018
40,Fun evening,No moviepass so I had to payup! I asked in advance so it wasn't a surprise. Beautiful theater! Fun to listen to organ music. No movie previews or ads which was different. I can't help but wish the walls of that building could talk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolccCNA
50,Love this Movie Theatre,One of a kind amazing theatre! Historical casino building recommend going to the movies nightly at 7:30 pm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjoc738
50,One of a kind,"In addition to the one-of-a-kind, highly ornate maritime murals on the walls of the theater, the vacation town crowd that generally comes to the movies here has a friendly, festive vibe. This enhances the viewing experience, whatever film happens to be showing. And you cannot beat the post-show nighttime walk back down Casino Way, with lights twinkling on the hillsides and the soft night breezes gently rocking the moored vessels in the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690
40,Definitly worth a trip! But don't expect to gamble!,"When I got to Catalina I was really excited about all that the island had to offer. Its off season so I was really looking forward to spending a late night out at the casino. Therefore, I want to be clear with anyone who had the same idea as me that there is no gambling at this casino. The word ""Casino"" Merely refers to the building being a public gathering place for events.However, It is a beautiful work of art and piece of history that is well worth the visit. They had 3 different tours of the property when I went. We were able to get the base tour as a package with another tour for just 1$. If you go to the tour booth off the main strip in the center of town they can offer you a 1$ tour of the casino if you book along with the ""Skyline Tour""Every weekend they do a movie showing in the evening at the casino so that might be something fun to check out for a relaxed evening or in the off season when things close down earlier. The week I went it was the new 50 shades of gray movie. They were also offering a tour option which allowed you to take a dance lesson in the ballroom which seemed nice too.If your the type of person that likes learning about architecture, history, or likes going to events this is a really nice thing to check out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320brandyr
40,A Blast From The Past,"Huge theater with great murals....and a organist playing before the show starts.....Sophie Tucker wasn't there!!!! We enjoyed a movie in this movie theater that still keeps the flavor of the 30's/40's.......Only one movie shows so you have no choice, but we wanted to see the movie that was playing. Seats are relatively comfortable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovevacationtime
50,A work of Art!,"This amazing theater is located in the Casino of Catalina Island.We had a tour in the casino, and had a chance to watch an informative documentary film about the Casino's history in this beautiful theater. The theater is still operating, hosting film screenings and other events.The room is decorated with ""art nouveau"" style paintings all over its walls. Also when the lights turn off, the ceiling transforms into a night sky filled with sparkling stars that create a magical atmosphere.We highly recommend you to take a visit in this theater, and if you are lucky enough, you can even watch a real play or music concert there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalaki-Papaki
40,Fun place to catch a first run film,"Beautiful theater with an old school feel. Elegant design and historical feel to the expansive one room theater. We arrived early and were entertained by the organist for approximately 30 minutes before the film began. There is a small snack bar, but not a huge selection of food items. Employees were friendly and polite. Sound system worked well and screen was quite large...we had a terrific time. My only (small) complaint would be the seats are not as comfortable as one might enjoy in a newer theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351MarkB351
40,Historic theatre --- movie time,"We enjoyed seeing ""Sing"" here --- scenery around is historic and enjoyed walking around it and in it -- walk to theatre is also really neat -- only negative is screen is small for such a big theatre -- but again fun place with great history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hibby922

40,Magnificent!,Beautiful architecture & a charming tour guide who even taught the ladies to swing dance at the end in the grand ballroom. We loved seeing the inside of the casino & hearing all about the history of Catalina & the Casino (gathering place). It's truly a Catalina landmark & a southern California gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afouquette
50,Anniversary!,"Must see! The architecture...iconic historic building. Theater seating is OLD, cramped and truly NOT comfortable; but, look around and the pain is totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamsLoveToTravel
50,Fabulous theater to visit,"I mainly wanted to see this marvelous deco theater inside so I went to a movie. I've been in many old and restored theaters but this one is among the finest you will ever see. They do not call it restored because it has always been maintained.The woodwork, walnut panels in the lobby area are the best example of high style walnut I know of. Outside there are huge mosaics of sea life, inside tall arched porticos, an incredible thing to see. Mosaics of this caliber are generally only seen in Italy. This is a must see piece of architectural history, a treasure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856larryf
50,I sang at the Avalon Theatre!,"This building is awe-inspiring and the tour was excellent. We took the behind the scenes tour.

50,Oh what a night!,"OK so my boyfriend and I decided to go to canceling Island for the day. We have never been and so we were looking forward to this. We went to the theater and saw a movie. It was really very interesting with the organ player. I took a lot of pictures and I absolutely got some energy flashes and a lady in one of the shots. No, The lady was not in the theater but she showed up on my camera picture. It was a little eerie. It didn't help that the organ player played really old organ music. The art is beautiful and the ceilings are beautiful also. This theater is really a true treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001
50,One of the most beautiful places to see❤️,"This is the coolest way to spend your evening :)) seats are comfy enough and the painting on the ceiling is breath taking.. Usually they show one movie at a time and if you are lucky, you get to hear the organ.We loved it ... It's a must see when in Catalina 🙈",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395faranakm
40,Beautiful.,"Worth just paying the money to walk in and see it. The acoustics are interesting too. Depending on where you sit, you can hear other people talking far away as if they are right next to you. So beware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/182AnneN
50,"Spectacular architecture, murals and tile work!!","I LOVE seeing films inside the Casino and make a point to every time I'm on island. The architecture, the amazing art deco murals and the spectacular sound within the theatre is something to behold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGoddard
50,A step back into a beautiful past,"A great way to spend an evening on Catalina. Gorgeous, old-fashioned movie theater with colorful art deco murals inside. Some nights, there is an organ player performing an hour before the movie. The seats aren't uncomfortable, but they are not the large modern seats of modern theaters. (Though, really, you can go to those theaters and sit in those seats anytime.)Theater shows just one movie at a time for one week (sometimes for two weeks), starting on Friday. They are first-run movies. You can find the schedule on the visitcatalinaisland website, but tripadvisor rules do not allow me to post a link here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avalon2020
50,Fascinating Historical Venue,"We did the basic tour of this casino (no gambling) on our anniversary trip to Avalon. I would highly recommend! It's a really great way to learn about the history of the island as well as the venue itself. We enjoyed seeing both levels of the building and learning about the process of its contraction. Avalon can get bogged down in the cruise culture, but this is a great way to peek back in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eshults11
40,Beautiful classic architecture. Take the tour!,"Took the 1:15 tour. Beautiful building. Fun to go backstage to the dressing rooms, into the projection booth to see the antique arc-lamp projectors, and learn the history. Well worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancP3349MA
50,Historical greatness,Seeing a movie isn't usually on your to do list when visiting Avalon...but this is so beautiful inside and the wind Oregon is amazing if you're lucky enough to be there when the gentleman that plays is around. Very art deco & a beautiful piece of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Memphismonkey

30,Movie in Avalon,"Old, eclectic,but we still enjoyed the show here. There was an organ player before the start of the movie. The prices for the popcorn and sofas were not bad. The chairs need to have new foam put in and they need to put cup holders. We had to put our snacks and drinks on the floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878cheyennep
50,Our tour guide was the best....a must see while at Avalon,"I've been to Catalina Island several times, but this was the first tour I had taken of the Avalon Theatre. Maureen, our tour guide, is a former history teacher, and has a wealth of knowledge about Catalina, the Wrigleys, and of course the Wrigley Theatre. The Theatre has the original organ near the stage, and the organist was practicing while we were there. Very informative and there is a lot history in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CbinBigD
40,Beautiful old-fashion theater,"Go there for the beautiful decorations inside, and just to be able to tell people, ""I've been there."" As for the movie watching experience, it's not on par with modern theaters (so so seats, smaller screen). Tuesday is $8 vs. $15 other days. But it's not full even on Tuesdays since it's quite large.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer921
50,An Art Deco dream come true,"Located inside the ""casino"" - it's not a casino as defined by Americans. It's a gathering place. In this instance, it is a drop dead gorgeous art deco dream come true from the walls to the ceiling, the floors, the furniture.... The original art is amazing. The behind the scenes tour of the casino/theater should not be missed. The movie theater is old school, playing only one movie at a time (not a multi-plex). Get there early for an old fashion organ playing treat by a local musician. It's a short walk to the theater from the green pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiaPazita
40,Love this place,"The boat ride alone out to Catalina is enjoyable but the Island is pretty much a ""must do"" if you visit Los Angeles. The Avalon Theater is great along with shopping, tours, boat rides, scuba diving and many other activities this gem of a place has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinBromagen
50,Avalon Movie Magic,"Whether we like the movie playing or not, we never visit this lovely island without going to the Avalon Theater. Inside decor is fantastic and a wonderful trip to days past. Go 30 minutes early to hear the live organ music and you have to hear 26 miles across the sea played on an organ to really get the feel of the times they have done so well to keep alive. If you are staying overnight, not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaP458

50,Old Time Movie Theater Charm,"I convinced my wife to attend the theaters Silent Movie Festival for this year, 2015. They were going to show the silent Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney with live organ and orchestral accompaniment. They also had a talented actress/singer who sang aloud the opera songs that the two female stars of the movie sang onscreen. It was fantastic, all I could ever want in a presentation of this film. The theaters history with the island and visiting film stars of the 1920's to 50's had me star struck and the décor had me was equisite. Now I just have to convince my wife for next year's Festival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjbncc1701

50,Stunning,"The theater is a must see. The art alone is breathtaking. A huge stage and screen for movies. The theater only has 1 screen and the movie changes weekly.

50,Classic Elegance,"Beautiful theater. Take the tour if you can, also visit the museum downstairs. So much history, stories that need to be told and listened to.

It's absolutely fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrisfjw

40,Historic theatre,"It's not as comfy at the new theaters with wider seats, leg room and such, but for those of us who have experienced these old classic theaters it brings back memories. The wood work if magnificent We went on a night the organ player was playing. It was fun to listen to. I would choose to go closer to the film time and have less organ music, but it was fun for nostalgia sake.We saw a new release, Jurassic World which was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finesail
50,A Classic Cinema,"This has to be one the few theaters left that can bring you back in time. I understand that it is the only local movie cinema on the Island but if they would show some of the movies from the Golden Age as does Turner Classic Movies, many of the tourist as well as the local's would jump at the chance to see some of these classics in such a beautiful theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicCouple
50,The theater of your dreams,"The Avalon Theater is one of the highlights of what is already a spectacular historic building, the Avalon Casino. The theater has so many things to see and talk about, and many reviewers have already covered some of them. However, I love tho main things about it: (1) The organ, with its bronze pipes and unique sounds, played by a volunteer musician that comes over on weekends from the mainland. It is a wonderful experience to sit in the comfortable chairs and let the music take you back in time; and (2) the ""sweet spot,"" a special location at the center of the theater where you can experience the brilliance of the domed ceiling design. Stand in this spot (you can find it by walking slowly towards the center on the main aisle while talking to yourself) and suddenly realize you are at the tip of a parabolic dome, and all the sounds of the theater and your own voice magnifies and spreads outwards. The decor, the paintings, the beautiful mermaid over the entrance, the curtains, and the behind-the-scenes tour are all part of this trip back into the history of California, Los Angeles and Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
50,Loved the Ambiance!,My hubby and I decided to take in a movie at the Avalon Theater. We went to a matinee on a Saturday. There were only 9 of us in this massive old time theater so we had our choice of seats. Loved the wall murals and decor. We had to wait to get into the theater as we chose a day where they had a silent Film Fest. It looks like they use this venue for several kinds of activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Granenaid
50,1929 at its best,"The Casino was finish in 1929. The Wrigley's did it right. The art work was done by John Gabriel Beckman real silver and gold was melted for detail. Mr. Beckman other claim to fame is the Chinese Theater in Hollywood where the Movie Stars put their foot prints and hand print in cement. Mrs. Wrigley designed the Theater furniture to look like waves and clam shells, Real Mahogany walls and real Marble that still stand today. The Page organ one of only a few still around for Silent films is demonstrated on Friday and Saturday Nights. It takes you back to a simple life. The upstairs Ballroom Floor is real wood floated and the building was cantilevered so no support beams in middle. The dances floor value is said to be worth more then the building and land itself. The Silent Film Festival was last weekend and People come dressed in the 1920/ 1930 attire. It is worth the tour or just a movie not like todays shoebox theaters, the back row seats are big and plush the others are simple. The sound system well you can hear a pin drop in the front row all the way back to the doors. Casino means gathering place not gambling house so many are surprised at this. This is one place you do not want to miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648melindas

20,A marvelous building,"We took the behind the scenes tour and the tour guide was extremely nervous and lacking in knowledge of the facility. Her colleague Rebecca only seemed concerned with hurrying us out of the place. If they would allow you in we could have done the tour on our own, but understandably with the beauty and value of the place people have to be escorted. The building is full of Tiffany fixtures, gorgeous black walnut paneling gold and silver leaf. Hand painted murals, it is a beauty. The beautiful Pages theatre organ is in excellent working condition and is a beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenB982

Great place and a must see on the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rose_Amelia77
50,Wonderfully restored theatre,"We wanted to see the inside of the theater anyway so we came to see a movie one evening and were pleasantly surprised on how comfortable and impressively decorated the interior of this historic building was. With what appears to be fully restored antique murals adorning the ceiling scattered with some twinkling ""star"" lights and combined the rich and saturating music from their antique pipe organ, you'll feel like you've been lost in some sort of time warp as you contentedly await your movie. But even more surprising is how spectacular their sound system is in this theater during the film - one of the finest I've ever experienced. Admission is a very fair $15/person for such a unique and enjoyable experience (I think it costs $10 just to tour it during the day w/o the movie!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TR182Flyer
50,High point of our visit to Avalon,"On a whim, we went to the theater to hear the Wurlitzer organ concert and we are so glad we did! The theater has been restored and it felt like stepping into the past. The very talented organist showed off the full range of the organ and played crowd-pleasing favorites. The theater itself, it is work of art. We had so much fun, we stayed for the Disney movie and just enjoyed the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengirl805

30,Eerie but unique,"I liked the different approach to your typical movie theatre, however, because of that the sound wasn't as sharp as I'm used to. But, it wasn't horrible either. The organ player is amazing! Come early to enjoy his performance. Avoid going to the restrooms by yourself. I get scared in there thinking I'm in a scene from a horror flick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islanderinheels
50,Catalina Classic,"Classic theater. Loved the architecture, the ambiance is something everyone ends to experience. Sound was tough and sears were uncomfortable but totally worth it as long as you temper expectations on those. Staff was very nice, especially appreciated Eric, who had lots of knowledge about the island and recommended the avalon grille for dinner which my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bman123456
50,Absolutely Stunning Classic Piece of History,"PRO:Well worth a visit. Even if you can't fit a tour of the whole casino in, try to catch a movie.

50,Paradise on Screen,"Even when the movie isn't very good (but Hercules had a fine vintage feel for fun this past September), this is one of the greatest of American movie theaters. Huge theater, with superb decor finely maintained. A friendly devoted staff. Good cheap popcorn! And an organ that still play. The glorious setting facing the ocean is like no other theater. Plus it's under the classic ballroom (take the tour). Having once worked in major Chicago theaters, I can testify that this is one of the finest, living monuments to the classic era of moviegoing. May it keep on screening forever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideY4045RM
40,Cool old building,"We did not enter the theater, but the building is very impressive from the outside and the lobby. Good little bar right next door to grab a small bite and a drink while watching the locals on their boats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBBeachGal
50,Dinner and a Movie,"The Avalon Theatre is located in the lower level of the Catalina Casino. Beautiful art deco murals thought out the building make this a one of a kind, must see. The night we went they played the old pipe organ the hour before the movie. We received movie tickets from the Avalon Grill with our meal (Dinner and a Movie promotion).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GGBeachTraveler
50,Love this theater,"The tickets are slightly pricey at $15 each, but the ambiance in the theater is well worth it. It's been maintained very nicely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenry3
50,Great ☺,This is really great place to go to check out. It's really nice and the your guy is super friendly and nine and funny. The balcony of the casino have a killer view of the ocean. Got to check it out while you there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879minhl
50,A must see,The tour is a deal! We could not believe how magnificent this little gem is! Absolutely gorgeous and the museum is great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarjorieStaysHere
20,Disappointed,We went to a matinee and the screen blacked out twice with no compensation and no employees were being helpful. It's always something there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferB6792
40,Nice to see a movie in a historic venue,"A visit to Avalon for a weekend should include a visit to the historic Casino, and if time permits, to see a movie in this historic venue. The grand old interior of yesteryear is not in its former grandeur in the days of real casino gambling and parties, but is still a glimpse into that past. With Catalina Island being largely a nature reserve except for the small city of Avalon and the permitted campgrounds at Two Harbors and that isthmus end of the island, the visit to the Avalon Theater is a unique glimpse into Catalina's past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasH_traveling

40,Pleasant Evening Experience,"While we were on our vacation, we had 2 movie tickets included in our hotel package. Nice evening walk to the casino, and the inside has a nice large screen to view the movie and has beautiful artwork on the walls on we believe was canvas. will come back next time we are on the island :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxy988
40,Good theater,"The outer tile mosaic, foyer, murals, and twinkling ""stars"" are definitely unique. This building has a lot of history, almost one-hundred years of it!The sound system is only in the front, and they don't turn the volume very loud. There are no 3D movies shown here, and their new ""screen"" is a series of long panels which become visable during some scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderLust_Mike01
50,Beautiful!! Must See,"This is such an iconic place, how can you not go...we had such fun here...just walking around and looking. It really is a must go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravlingAZGirl
50,The Avalon Casino movie theatre great place to see a movie!,"Wonderful ambiance, old California design, pipe organ concert before the movie on weekends, fantastic sound, reasonable price",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaxmanLG
30,"Beautiful theater, but horrible sound quality.","The Avalon Theater is located in the Casino and is beautiful and worth a ticket price just to get a look at the architecture and mural inside of the theater. The sound quality is very poor, but depending on the movie, may not matter too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLH89Martin
40,"Superb murals, great view","We arrived at the Casino after touring the island in a golf cart, then with a tour guide in a small bus. Everyone said we needed to visit the Casino. Unfortunately it was late in the day and the inside was not open to the public. However the murals on the outside walls and the plants in the gardens around the building were worth the trip. There were also wonderful views on the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marquisman

50,Small venue,"Great little movie theater. Wait it seats 1200 people!!!! Organist is wonderful before the movie. Liked having one showing, and a nice walk to and from the theater olongapo the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cisnerostg1
50,My Favorite Movie Theater,"It's the only show in town so we always hope there will be a great movie playing here when we visit. Even if there isn't, we typically go anyway. Can't say that about any other movie theaters today! Being a New York native, this place reminds me so much of Radio City Music Hall. Make sure you go early to hear the organist play before the show. Go down front and stand right behind him and marvel at his keyboard wizardry. The interior is a piece of art with gorgeous lighting. OK, the seats can be a tad uncomfortable--and hope you don't get seated next to a ghost! (The place is haunted, ya know!) And when the movie isn't playing, take a tour of the place. It's well worth your time. A glimpse into a long gone era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueBoots92008
50,Stunning theater,This theater is gorgeous. It seats 1200 people. There is a nightly showing at 7:30 pm. Inside secret -- if you have dinner at Avalon Café they include a movie ticket with your entrée. How great is dinner and a movie?!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalIrish
50,Beautiful,"Showings are only at 7:30 pm, except for matinees on Wednesdays and Sundays at 4:30 pm. It is a little expensive at $15 for adults, but the interior decor (murals and decor) are beautiful. The concession stand had reasonably priced items with little tubs of popcorn for $3 like when I was young. There was a man playing the organ for entertainment before the show started, and there were no previews!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michele85
50,Such a beautiful theater!,"This is a beautiful old theater. Some parts have been restored but many are original, like the ceiling in the lobby. It is beautiful and has never been retouched! On Saturday nights beginning at 6:30 there is a movie organ concert prior to the actual movie. Make time to attend, it was fantastic! The last 6 rows were originally considered premium seats. We choose one of those rows to sit in and the seats were nearly as comfortable as the modern theater ones. One tip, the box office only opens RIGHT before the concert begins at 6:30. We saw many people walk up and then leave because the doors were still locked and the box office was empty. Just be patient and enjoy the beautiful theater. Oh, and the theater is HUGE there is no reason to buy your tickets in advance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29kindergartencuties
50,Nostalgic and gorgeous,"I went on a tour earlier on my first visit and learned of the history and background which was very interesting and beautiful. In the evening I went to see the movie - Maleficent, and there was an organ concert before the showing. A lovely surprise, to hear the organist playing not only Disney themes but a bit like I would imagine would have been played for silent movies. I understand that is an authentic organ that was used for silent film. Very elegant and beautifully architecture. Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelLadyK
50,Art Deco Beauty,"Huge 1200 seat theater with state of the art media AND original Art Deco murals of Spanish missionaries, Native Americans and wildlife adorning the walls, plus an organ recital before the show instead of previews and ads:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanDiegoborn
50,Come early on weekends to hear the organ!,"We saw a movie here. Hated the movie, loved the experience. The theater is stunning, and we enjoyed the pre-show organ concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaelsne
50,An Art Deco Jewel -- with a Silent Film benefit every May,"We were on Cataina Isand the weekend between Mother's Day and Memorial Day weekend and learned there was a Silent Film Benefit going on. (Though the theatre normally shows 1st run movies.) It was actually the 27th annual, with proceeds benefiting the Avalon Museum -- an interesting little place in the same building. We went since we wanted to see the theatre -- but we got SO much more than a normal film experience! As the museum's largest fundraiser, they had engaged a 40-piece LIVE orchestra to ""narrate"" Charlie Chaplin's ""Bright Lights"" (a charming film!), and the glorious room, which feels smaller than it appears in photos, charmed everyone with it's original Art Deco trees and trumpeting centaurs -- all for $18. Perhaps the MOST fun was that the L.A. Art Deco Society was holding a ball that evening upstairs and anyone who came to the silent film in costume was granted half-price admission, so the town was filled with people in 1920s costume, making one feel as if you could be rubbing shoulders with Daisy Buchanan or Chaplin (who did frequent the island in his time and watch movies there). It's an ANNUAL held the same weekend each year (2015 will be Lon Chaney's ""Phantom of the Opera""!). Get your white linen and straw hats and GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGirl30501
50,Gorgeous deco art!,We attended the Silent Film Festival and it was delightful! The orchestra brought this silent film to life! Looking forward to next year!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chollabay

40,Beautiful theater,We went one night and watched a movie at the 4:30pm showing. It is a beautiful building. The theater screen is nice and big - seats are just ok because they are older but neat experience to watch a new release in a historical building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine2120
40,beautiful theater,"I must say the seats are terrible, but I guess since it was built in the 1920's they can be uncomfortable. Back in the day, the last 5 rows were the premium seats. It is truly a beautiful theater. Amazing murals on the walls and a silver leaf ceiling with twinkle star lights.If you take a tour, you can hear the organ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougrh
40,beautiful art deco theater,"go just to enjoy this beautiful theatre, regardless of what is showing. Seats are old style, so not big and comfy like newer theaters, but in excellent condition. And snacks are cheaper than on the mainland!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickyguest
50,You've got to see a move here!!,"This theater is really a treat to visit. You pay a little more for your movie ticket, but it's really worth it. It's not like any theater you can visit on the main land. It's like stepping back in time. They only play one movie and it usually runs for a few days. We've been lucky that the few times we've visited Avalon, a movie that we wanted to see was playing. While you wait for the show to start, you're treated to fun organ music instead of watching 20 minutes of ads and previews. The seats are plush red velvet and the walls and ceiling are painted with interesting murals. This theater is worth seeing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheillaD_12
40,More to see than you would expect.,"I have been inside this building a few times before to see movies, but I only recently did the tour for the first time. I was very impressed. There's a lot more to this building than just the movie theater area. If you have a little time, it's definitely worth doing the tour.Keep in mind that the tour is not intense or amazing, so if you are looking for action and excitement, this isn't it. I suspect young people in particular might not be entertained. It might be better to send the kids over to swim or zip line, while you and your spouse enjoy the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_and_Barbie
50,Beautiful property,"After dinner one evening, we decided that rather than tour the Casino, we would see a movie there instead. What a beautiful building this is and to be able to watch a first-run film in it was wonderful. We also found the staff that works there to be so helpful and friendly. Next time we will tour it. Now we are so interested in its history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779maris
40,Robocop,We had a nice walk to the theater after dinner on the waterfront; the movie was Robocop.....but the ambience was still wonderful :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaSue56
50,Too Much To See,"This is a stupendous theatre, but the 1/2 hour tour is way too short to study the fabulous frescos. We didn't see the curtain or hear the organ which was a pity...but one can imagine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409GD
50,Fascinating architecture with wonderful guide,Our guide was extremely knowledgable and entertaining. This magnificent building is awe inspiring. Great tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdncarol1
50,A MUST see!,"This theater was like stepping back in time. The seats were intricately painted, there is a huge old organ which gets played at certain times by a local. The ceiling and side walls have breathtaking décor and old painting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiAnnesInLove
50,Great for history or architecture buffs,The walking tour of the casino was great. The theatre was the first built for sound in the United States and is a true wonder. The ballroom was very impressive. It felt like walking into a different era. The building itself is a true marvel. I would highly recommend for film/history/architecture enthusiasts. If that isn't your thing you might be bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthwestRK
40,Historic Theater,"Very historic and the murals and lighting are beautiful. Nice restoration and the movies are cheap. Feature films, plus I saw the old ""Bullitt"" with Steve MacQueen for $5!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811kathyd
40,wonderful art deco theater,"They show a single movie at 7:30 pm, preceded by an organ concert at 6:30. Comfortable seats. Take some time and appreciate the lobby and entrances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/overbid2002
50,Our favorite places to take the grandkids,This theater is amazing! Whenever we visit Avalon we go to the movies. The art work is from the 1930's and its a must see. The organ player plays before the movie is run. At Christmas you have all your favorite Christmas songs and when we go in July we hear patriot songs about America. Just go........,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacificstar
40,Takes you back in time with the decor but still with great sound for the movie,Very pretty theater from the early '20's. Interesting to see the grandeur of yesteryear. Pipe organ before the movie if you go on Friday night. A bit expensive for a movie but you are paying for the beauty of experiencing the theater. Would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVandT
40,A great experience and well worth it,"Two tours of the casino are offered. The short version lasts 30 minutes and the full tour is 90 minutes. We reckoned that the brief overview would suffice and so that was what we booked for.It was quite a large group but our guide, Rebecca, managed the visit very well. She walked us through the place, taking us up a wide ramp. The casino was built in 1929 but was never a working casino! The building is very impressive and circular. The ground floor houses a museum which you enter from the side. The ground floor is however mainly a huge theatre with superb acoustics. We were shown a DVD of the history of this building and then led up the ramp to the very top which boasts of a magnificent dance floor. The view from the balcony on top is simply magnificent.In the evening we returned for an hour long organ recital, included free in the price of movie ticket. The second part of Hobbit was showing and was a treat to watch on the mega-screen.If you are taking the tour, please be mindful that toilet facilities are limited. One cannot use the facilities inside the casino. There are restrooms on the side, next to the museum but these were closed. There were signs pointing to portable loos round the back. It was quite a trek there and back and the visit (to the portable loos) was not too pleasant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imliooper
40,Amazing Experience,"The ambiance in the theater is amazing. It would be excellent, but the seats are dated and the sound is not at the same level of newer theaters. However, if a movie is playing that you have any desire to see while in Avalon, this is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564barakb
40,Theater Tour,We did the 30-minute tour and it was all we needed to see the main highlights of the old Casino/Theater. Enjoyed it very much and the 2-hour tour would have been overkill for us!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missheidi
50,Love this theater,"So beautiful. A special experience. Great sound and you feel like you are stepping back in time. You just have to see a movie here. Or better yet, movie and a tour of the entire casino. Yep, do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriD373
50,Beautiful architecture,"This former casino, turned multi purpose attraction (theater, museum etc) is a charming landmark visible when you approach Catalina (Avalon) island. It is an easy, flat surface walk from the pier and worth checking out even if you don't go inside. The ocean side of the casino faces some of the most beautiful kelp beds that feed our California state fish, the Garibaldi. These bright orange fish can be seen along the coast of Catalina, especially near kelp so keep your eyes for these beauties. From the pier allow an hour to walk there and back. I mention the time because most visitors to the island have to catch a ferry or tender back and the Casino looks close when you start walking but it's actually a 20 to 30 minute walk there. Take a camera for some of the most picturesque shots on the island and a bottle of water in the summertime. Finally, exploring the outside of the casino is free, touring inside or visiting the museum will cost you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399
50,Went for movie!,The theater area was amazing. Beautiful murals with lights on ceiling. It's like walking back in time. We got our popcorn and drink and took the whole experience. A must go see. Heard they do tours but haven't done the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Welsheyes
40,Blast from the Past,"The Casino and theater are a must do in Catalina. The lobby and interior of the theater are filled with beautiful murals of the sea. You won't get the ""stadium recliner seating"" as in theaters of today but a trip down memory lane for how movie theaters used to be. One screen, one movie. We saw ""Gravity"" and enjoyed every minute even though not in Imax 3D.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/movinout
40,beautiful place,"My son and I attended when ""Inception"" came out. The theater is beautiful, historic, and inexpensive. The only thing I didn't like were that the seats were too close together, barely any leg room, and the seats sat straight up. Inception was 3 hours long and my back was sore after. They also had no cup holders. But the atmosphere, the screen, the staff, and the movie were all excellent. I just wish they would have more comfortable chairs. I guess it is keeping with the historic side of the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brandee74
50,Not to be missed,Take the tour of the theater and ballroom if you can...this is a unique and wonderful place designed by Chicago architects and used as the model for Radio City Music Hall. Views from balcony outside ballroom are stunning. Easy walk from center of Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SadieMT
40,Fascinating History!,"This is a Must Do while in Avalon. The history is fascinating, the architecture is beautiful, but the tour is very short. You get to see the theater (gorgeous), where they show you a short film and you are taken to see the ballroom. The view from the ballroom is spectacular! The cost is $10, which is reasonable, but again, the tour is very short.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCAngel

50,EXCELLENT,"I went here with a friend on 9/15/13 and had such a nice time. This movie theater brought me back to my childhood and the movie theaters that I used to go to w/my parents in Boston. The plush burgandy seats with patterned carpeting, murals on the walls and stars on the ceiling...!! Quite nice.!! Had popcorn which was very good and made with REAL Butter not the fake stuff. We saw The Butler.!! All in all a fabulous experience and the walk back to the hotel at 9ish was so relaxing.!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolk148

50,Movies,To be able to experience a movie in this grand theater is fun. The grand old of yesteryear. The acoustics is fantastic and when you stop to think that this building was built in 1929 is amazing. On the weekends there is an organ that plays for an hour before the movie begins which is a bonus. Being able to experience is well worth the ticket price,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snookiet

50,Fun Place to See a Movie,"The ""theater"" is the Casino. It was named ""The Casino"" before a casino was a place to gamble. Years ago they would have shows and other productions. It's a fun place to watch a movie during a stay in Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kansasboy2011
50,Beautiful Theater!,"No wonder Charlie Chaplin used that theater to premiere his films! It's gorgeous! The acoustics in there are wonderful as well. They keep it clean too, b/c they don't even allow any red wine in there. Only clear liquids when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staceofbase13
50,Fantastic Behind the Scenes Tour,"Joe, our Tour guide, was so knowledgeable about the history of the Casino. He took us behind the scenes, to the theatre and the ballroom, dressing rooms and projection rooms. We saw the Marine Bar and learned about the many stars who have graced the halls of this magnificent building. We learned about the architecture of the building, which was built in 1929. The view of the Avalon Bay is fabulous! I had been here nearly 40 years ago and never had the chance to tour the inside of the Casino and have been wanting to do so ever since. The tour was worth the wait, but if you can, don't wait 40 years to take the tour...do it now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444katherinej

50,The Sound Of Music,"The theater is so beautiful, the Art Deco Style is just amazing to see! There is nothing better than settling into a comfortable red cushioned seat with an extra large hot buttered popcorn to watch an American Movie Classic! It was great to see and hear ""The Sound Of Music"" on the big screen. The audience was so into the movie, applause after each song! A night I'll never forget!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caldreameryeah
50,Dinner and a Movie,"You're on Catalina Island anyway, so you have to eat at one of the many excellent restaurants and then hit the Casino for a movie. If for no other reason, the ambiance is worth it. It's a beautiful and well preserved period building that is a marvel of construction. The behind-the-scenes tour is also recommended. You can still feel what it must have been like back in the 30's and beyond. The movie star years when it was their playground to see plays and big bands playing in the ballroom above. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desertclone
50,Worth the price of admission,The interior was beautiful. It was like taking a trip back in time. Catch one of the matinees during the week (Tuesdays and Thursdays I think) for a discounted price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicago_traveladdict

50,Beautiful and original!,"We took the ""behind the scenes tour"" and it was well worth it! They tell you about the history and construction of the casino, as well as about Catalina. We got to see all the back rooms and little things were pointed out to us that you would never notice, or if you did notice, you wouldn't realize what they were for. Our 9 and 16 year old kids loved it, too! We also saw a movie one night and were provided with a beautiful concert on the Page Pipe Organ before the movie...highly recommend people do that for the experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crvd
50,Beautiful Theater,"We stayed for a week and decided to do the Free Movie with dinner deal associated with Avalon Grill. It was a beautiful theater and a great experience to see. Since the building is old, it doesn't have all the latest technology, of course! We enjoyed the feel there and the live organ player was so much fun to listed to as he entertained the crowd before the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itzarosielife
50,The most beautiful movie theater anywhere!,"If you just went into the Casino Theater to sit and look at the art deco paintings, entry mermaid mosaic, spectacular curtains and opulent trimmings--you'd be entertained w/o even seeing a movie. It's a unique Wriggly-rich, Catalina-design, fantastic atmosphere, well-worth the price of admission.NOTE: to SEE the movie best -- sit up kinda close. The huge theater layout dwarfs the screen a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthotelpatron
50,Blast from the past!,"The casino theater is just beautiful. I spend a lot of time during the movie looking up at the ceiling paintings and the blinking lights.

50,Great place to see a movie!,"We always go to the movies when we come to Catalina for a family stay.

It just takes you back to another time, and the kids really love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristik146

50,Today's Movie in a 1929 Art Deco Theater,"Beautiful theater. All lovely wood and art deco. Seats 1,100 people. Great sound system and of course the organ. For an hour before the movie they do an organ recital. Don't miss it. Downside. Seats date the theater and are a little hard. The surrounding makes up for it. $15 for a movie? Worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWS55
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful theatre inside, very classySaw a movie here and enjoyed the organist before the movieCome early",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922ronnief
50,Modern Movie in a Classic Setting,"Wife and I watched a great movie in the Avalon Theater. But what we remember wasn't the movie it was the setting. The organ music payed live before the start of the show was worth the entire ticket price. Make sure you show up a bit early to enjoy the great talent on a great machine. Sound System was great, and picture quality perfect. With less than perfect eye sight we set up close, but could see without neck strain and the seats were comfy. The building is amazing and we enjoyed the Art Deco decor, murals, and light fixtures. The evening stroll back to the hotel at the movies end showed the lights reflecting off the water and was a perfect ending. Were headed back to Catalina and will take in another movie, no matter what the movie is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864michaelr864
50,I go everytime!,Love this theater. It is the only one in town. There is only one showing per week. When all the boats leave you and the rest of the people who stay have the island to yourself and all rods lead to the theater at 7:30pm. Is a bit pricy but I love the art decco on the walls and the screen is gigantic. Its old fashioned and a pleasure to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenaiMorehead
40,A unique experience,"We did both the tour and actually stuck around to watch the movie in the evening. The tour was fun to do, our guide stuck pretty much to her script",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudiaH591
50,If The Walls Could Speak They Would Say: Buy More Wrigley Gum!,"This theater is a historical haven and an authentic beauty. The murals, the light fixtures, and the chairs are all authentic creations. The art deco murals capture the essence of the indians that once lived on the island -- just absolutely beautiful. The dome like ceiling feels like you are being engulfed in the universe because it is covered with golden stars. The rare wood used to build the theater cost at todays price four million dollars. The Wrigley family really wanted to build a historical theater when they built this theater. Furthermore, at that time, it was the tallest building in all of Los Angeles. This is a must see attraction and a must do tour. The best part of the tour is the journey up a hand full of ramps to the ball room. The view from this area of this city is memorable. You cannot go to Catalina Island without viewing the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraM769

50,Nice,"The movie theater in Avalon is very nice. It is spacious and has a ton of seating.

Joe combines history, humor, and helpful hints to visitors who want to explode all facets of Catalina Island. Don't miss this terrific tour where you'll be entertained and educated about the island's history and current events that take place in the building throughout the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneyD

50,A Must See,"This is one of the original movie theater palaces of yesteryear. No matter what is playing there you have to go. It is a wonder just to sit in that theater and look at the paintings, the ceilings, the stage, and the seats. The entrance and the lobby are a step back in time. You are surrounded by paintings that should be in a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YAYASister70128
40,Large Venue,"Great Paintings inside and the place is huge! Sorry, no nachos or hotdogs but it has everything else. Last five rows are newer seats, audio and video systems were great.

40,A novel experience,"We stayed late to watch a movie in the Casino, because I've been obsessed with it since I was a child. There is only one movie a week, and it was not one I really cared to see... but you do what you have to do. There was an organ concert before the movie started (worth the price of admission alone) and then the lights dimmed, the starry sky lights twinkled, and the movie began... about a half hour in my legs were numb from the rather uncomfortable seats in the theatre. By the time the movie was over my back had spasmed and my legs were on fire. I'm a big guy (~6'4"") and there was just no flex in the seats. All in all, i'm happy I did it. It was a chance to see a film in a neat setting with an awesome organ demonstration before hand. All things considered, I may go again and leave after the concert...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctamale
40,Worth seeing,"The Avalon theater is a truly unique place to show films. It is on the bottom floor of the Avalon casino building. There are many beautiful murals on the walls and a gorgeous antique organ sitting in the very front. If you want to see the theater, buy a movie ticket and go inside and see it. Do not purchase the tour of the place which I found to be nu-informative, boring and a complete rip-off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Saul

40,"Average for a Theater, amazing for the extras","On certain days of the week, (I think it is Fri/Sat) there is a ten minute pipe organ concert before the showing of whatever movie you go to see. If you are going to pay 15$ a ticket, show up early and admire the art deco murals on the wall while you listen to one of the only pipe organs in the world.The theater aspect is about what you might expect- nice seats, basic concession stand- it's the architecture you should go to see. If you aren't as interested in the movie, take the behind the scenes tour offered during the day. Skip the basic tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonesanaya

50,The Hobbit,"We all went to a movie at the Avalon Casino Theater, this place is beautiful! The art is magnificent and the staff is very friendly.

Make sure you get there early enough to listen to an amazing organist! We were there 30 minutes early, with people trickling in. The interior of the building is massive and impressive, beauty overwhelming, the organ takes you back in time. The sound system for the movie and organ is fantastic!

50,beautiful Avalon Theater and Casino,"This building is not just a theater--it is practically Santa Catalina Island's (and the town of Avalon's) symbol. I didn't actually see a movie here, but I took the ""behind the scenes"" tour of the building, which included the theater. The Art Deco style building, finished in 1929, has been completed restored. There are gorgeous murals on the walls and ceiling of the theater. The acoustics are so good that Radio City Music Hall in NYC copied the design of the Avalon theater's. There is no gambling at this casino, by the way. Here, the definition of the word ""casino"" means ""gathering place."" I recommend you take the tour. There is a shorter one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineN813
40,Organ concert included in movie ticket,"I found out during the Casino tour that there would be an organ recital for an hour before the evening movie given on the organ installed for playing during the silent movies. (Built in 1929).Later, I was told that sometimes the ushers will let you in for free if you can't stay for the movie. I had to leave before the movie to catch my return ferry, but had to pay the entire movie fee anyway. I really enjoyed the organ music and then just gave my ticket away to someone about to buy a ticket for the movie as I left.

50,High class theater just for movie,"This place shows only one movie (that's recent), at only one time, for only one week. Luckily, the week I went, they were showing a movie I've been wanting to watch, The Hunger Games.This place is amazingly beautiful. It seats 1,900 people, so when there were only about 50-75 people inside, I had a whole row to myself. The walls are beautifully designed, and they have different color lights reflecting off of it. The entrances are amazing.I honestly felt like I was at an opera instead of a movie. The history behind this is that this was THE place for hollywood actors to go to way back then, and this is where they would have some of their movie premiers.The ticket for an adult is $13. Senior citizens and kids up to 11 years old are $12. The price on popcorn and a drink is not too bad compared to the over-priced movie theaters back at home. I got a large drink and a medium popcorn for $7.I read a review earlier saying that you should sit around the middle to the front so that you can hear everything, and it's true. I sat in the middle, but closer to the back and I missed a few words, but only a few, so it's not a big deal.I wish I had a place like this back at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FBST

50,Old Time Luxury,"The theatre is a must see. Great guides! It is the only theatre in Avalon built by William Wrigley in 1929 and has whisper acoustics though it is huge. Elegant all around! The wood paneling in the lobby would cost $4,000,000 today!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngerone
50,Beautiful Art Deco,Worth a visit to see the decor especially if you love Art Deco!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VTtraveler_72
50,Gorgeous art deco theater,"What a wonderful place to see a movie. This is the most gorgeous old theater I've seen in my life. They play the beautiful old pipe organ at 6pm then the movie started at 7:30. I strongly recommend taking in a movie at this theater. Prices are $13 for adults, so it's really not any more expensive than your boring run-of-the-mill theater. Soda and popcorn seems unusually cheap. Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stockjock

40,"""Date Night"" while on vacation!","We had a blast at the theater! We saw Sherlock Holmes while on our anniversary vacation in Catalina. The organ was playing when we got there and the murals on the inside are beautiful! There are a ton of seats and we only shared the theater with maybe 30 other people.My only complaint is that the seats are NOT comfortable enough for a movie. Not a lot of cuddling options with hard wood armrests between each seat. The seats are pretty springy without much foam.All in all though, an excellent date night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahSmile0108
30,you might need to sit close to the screen,"I have taken the tour of the Casino twice and found it very interesting. The concert on the theater organ that precedes the film showing is also enjoyable. However, the acoustics of the theater for those sitting halfway back blur dialog badly. The next time I attend a film I'm going to sit close to the screen and see if that helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lightseeker001
50,Breaking Dawn a real yawn,"This theater is an awesome example of the Art Deco era. Unfortunately, the rows of seats are very close together, making long-legged folks shift from side to side to not kneecap the seat in front. Seats were uncomfortable, too, or maybe the boring movie made them seem hard to bear?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokitlady
50,Beautiful,"Have to view the theater, it's amazing. The mural on the ceiling is wow! The feeling is like your back in the 1930s from the seats to the wooden floors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StraightBlue2

30,"Quick, Easy Tour - Avalon","Here's a way to see Avalon on the cheap. Take the trolley ($4). It has a loop route that runs from city center, to The Casino (museum), the Botanical Gardens and elsewhere. Includes one re-board ticket. You don't get a tour guide, but you can pick up a guide brochure at the pier, then see the area in an hour. Stop where you like, then reboard for the return ride. Very picturesque and a paltry fraction of the cost of a guided tour (about $45).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJGuy42
50,Romantic History in a beautiful setting,"First, let me say that Catalina Island is one the the loveliest places in (or near) the US. I have heard of the Casino Ballroom at Avalon for many years, and going behind the scenes was very interesting. Because I love big band music, theater and history, this tour was well worth the cost. And I can now say I have danced in the ballroom at Avalon. My 90 year old uncle said he'd been there and danced many times in the 1940's while he was a marine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJ56Mc
50,Beautiful!,The murals are stunning! I could watch those for a couple hours if I didn't like the movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaTye
40,Amazing Place,"Everything about this theatre is fantastic. The art is so beautiful. The seating is abundant (it's a really large theatre for such a small island) with crushed red velvet upholstery plus it's very comfortable. If you can do a tour of the casino, the theatre is part of the tour along with the ball room. It's something not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lousviews
50,well worth an hour,"We did the group tour of the Casino with tickets to the museum, met at 2. Cost was about $18 each which was a little pricey but it was a very good tour that covered a lot. You do have a bit of a walk up the ramps inside. They show a little film in the theatre which was fun. Good sense of humor on the guide. We also saw a movie in the evening in the theater, Princess & the Frog was showing but they have a new movie each week, shows usually at 7, on fri & sat also at 9.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbles911
