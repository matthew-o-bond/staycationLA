40,Best manicure and pedicure around,"I've been coming to Swan Day Spa for over five years and always use Jane for a manicure and pedicure. I've been to other places because I moved out of the area, but non compare to the detail Jane gives. I drive a long distance to come back to her. The polish lasts just as long as any ordinary polish. They carry Opi which last longer than some other cheaper brands other spas carry. The owner Harry is very nice. They give you a discount on your birthday.",Janalee C

10,Rip Off - Wouldn't Honor Gift Certificate for Mother's Day,"I must say I'm deeply disappointed. I bought my mother a package including a massage, facial, manicure, pedicure, and light lunch. She went to redeem the gift certificate and was not given a manicure, pedicure or light lunch. What a rip off. It made mother's day a bust!",natalie b
50,Great spa!!!,"This is a fantastic spa! It's open 7 days, run by very professional, nice people. I go there a lot for manicures and spa pedicures; Jane is wonderful. But I also go for the full body aromatherapy massage, with the essential oils that stay in your skin and smell nice even after a shower! Speaking of which, you can shower there if you want. They also provide disposable undies, robe and slippers, plus locker. Complimentary steam or sauna before any treatment. Nice relaxation room with massage chairs, which you also get to sit in for your spa pedi.Many options available for services. You can also get coupons and specials.
