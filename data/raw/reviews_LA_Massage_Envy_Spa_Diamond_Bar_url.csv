50,Best massage in Diamond Bar,I have been going to the same massage therapist Ana for about 3 years. I would recommend her if you want a deep tissue massage. She keeps me going since I am over 66 years old that is very important.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renee_Tally

50,deep tissue heaven,I am a member in Florida and called this location on short notice and was able to book for the next day. It was easy to find and had ample parking. I paid my member price of $59 for 90 minutes which are very fair. The location was the typical layout for Massage Envy...clean and comfortable.What was special was that I was late arriving (30 minutes) and did call and say I would be late. Totally my fault. Nevertheless the therapist gave me an extra 12 minutes of her break time (same for my wife from a different therapist) to help make up the difference. GREAT service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pompui
