50,Powerful Fun over in a flash,"Everything about this facility is professional. The reception staff, the briefing instructor, the on field staff and especially the ""eye in the sky"" spotter helping you to finess your driving skills every lap. Even at 60, the thrill of driving fast for short bursts to get around the track was quite inspiring. Will definitely take this adventure again.",hungrynomore2016
50,Took two Friends,"WOW - Easy to get to , Low key staff , All you need is there . Helpful . I could fit in the car so i watched :( . But it still was a great time . amazing very worth it",Fun2011
50,Pure Adrenaline in a Stock Car,Well it’s been a year since I started turning laps at LA Racing and it has only gotten better each time. This very professional facility really looks out for your safety and the spotters really work with you to get you faster every laps. Even if this isn’t on your bucket list you need to come out and strap yourself in to experience this adrenaline rush. Don’t forget to buy another pass before you leave. If you don’t you’ll be online buying more due to your new addiction. Thanks LA Racing,igsainfo
50,What a rush!,I have not been on a track for 45 years.It all came back I was allowed to pass all the other cars.Saturday morning on Irwindale Speedway I went our with the first group and got to drive 20 laps in a stock car.I brought my son he also had a blast.I plan to return soon!RSE,Steve E
50,Pure adrenaline,"Yes, you actually get to drive a NASCAR by yourself. Everyone should do this once in their lives. It's also a good educational experience on some of the basics of racing. The class instructor David is excellent.",MikeMc666
50,Bucket List Item Checked Off,"Unlike other racing experiences where you're riding with a professional driver, LA Racing puts YOU behind the wheel of a Super Late Model Stock Car on a half mile oval track for 20 laps. After a short class on safety, vehicle operation, and track strategy, you go out to the bleachers. The class is broken up into groups of four who are on the track at the same time. At all times the emphasis is on SAFETY so yes, you do have to wear a helmet and fire suit. You'll wear a disposable head cover under the helmet and the fire suits are clean. Cars are assigned based on driver height since the seat positions are fixed. If you're short, climbing in requires a little creativity, but it can be done. Spotters in the skybox talk you through the race and let you know when it is safe to make your pass.I had an absolute blast. Good thing I live half a continent away or I would have gone back the following weekend.The website shows $399 for the class, but check with the track, they offer a lot of specials and you can get deals for less than half that. They offer insurance - which you don't have to buy - for $90 but when you start hugging that wall on the turns you'll be glad that you don't have to worry. For a few extra dollars you can buy a video of the experience that has views inside the car and out the window onto the track.AN EXPERIENCE NOT TO BE MISSED!",casadei
10,Don't crash the car!!!!!,Expect to pays 90 extra after you initial fee of 2or 3 hundred the car I had was so slow I thought I was driving a scion and expect to get yell at though out the lecture how fast these cars are which is a lie gee I was so bored I wish I had a refund,jiner666
50,NASCAR racing thrill!,"I’ve done the 20-lap class 3 times (twice solo, once w/ friends). It’s a RUSH! The car seriously growls and wants to go fast. Awesome “bucket list” experience.Excellent: check-in (improved over years), safety training, coaching, photo and racing video, 20 laps, driving the car without an instructor, getting to pass three other cars.Tips: fire suit gets hot so choose an early class or don’t go in summer, if you want to race again wait until race day to get the repeat student discount, if you’re smaller you can ask for a seat cushion, you’re strapped crazy tight into the tin can so not for claustrophobics, $100 optional insurance might not be necessary but good peace of mind, bring a friend to take pics",C S
40,Good experience at a fair price,"Most people buy for a first time with some sort of coupon deal, a little complicated to get the reservation, called to see if available, then wait for a confirming email then can reserve the time. You should be able to do this with one step. They do push the insurance, but not forced so you can decline. If I would go back would forget the insurance. They go through a 50 minute instruction class and stress safety for you and the other drivers. There is only four cars on the track at a given time so unless you do something stupid you should have no problem doing this safely. Let's face it they don't want you to wreck the car either. When on the track they have a ""spotter"" for each two cars, a big ""thumbs up"" for these guys, very encouraging, they talk to you the whole time to try to get you to do better, but never more than you feel comfortable with. They push the pictures and in camera video, a little pricey, Overall a good experience at a fair price if using a coupon.",funtotravel4926
20,"Good concept, could be better executed","First the positives, Good appropriate emphasis on safety from the initial briefing to the spotter communication. Initial cost is reasonable, good cars.However let down by horrible mandatory safety suits and helmets, just plain dirty and disgusting. Heavy sell on insurance that did not do very much. To much waiting around to drive.I wanted to enjoy this more than I did.",DavidGB
50,do this at least once in your life,Twenty laps around the race track at over 100 miles an hour is one of the most thrilling things I've ever done in my life. I would do it again and again if it wasn't so bad for the environment. They really train you well and emphasize safety so that when you slide into that driver seat through the window you feel ready to go fast.,CatheLaw
40,drive stock cars!!!,"I did this after finding a Groupon. You get to drive 20 laps around Irwindale Speedway in a stock car. They do a brief class beforehand so you know what you are doing. The cars are automatic. You wear a racing suit, flame retardant hood and helmet. You then get in the cars which are quite hot and have limited visibility. Those prone to claustrophobia might be a bit uncomfortable. Don't go on a hot day or you'll roast. They scare pretty much everyone into buying their insurance, but I'm not sure if it's really needed. A great experience overall!",Andy B
50,Fast Times,"It is right off the 605 fwy, so close to offramp, which is good. They have food, bands at times, car shows, motorcycle, and bike events. Very exciting place if you love fast times. The X games is being held here now.",Christina M
50,what a blast you got to do this for all petrol heads,"I did this in june on a trip to LA and it is up there on the best to do list,I have had the luck to drive lotsd of super cars such as Ferraris, Lamborghinis etc on race tracks but this is one hell of a buzzif you are a petrol head you need to suit up in go for it ,they are very professional from the minute you arrive, full driver briefing and training session then suit up and jump in 20 laps of the Irwindale speedway at full noise,there is a spotter feeding you info through your ear piece all the time to keep you aware of your surroundings and you are free to drive to the limit,a strong suggestion take the insurance option because if you do crash these are very expensive cars to repair and it does happen time to time",acquirer
40,A lot of fun!,"LA Racing was a great experience! The company was well staffed and very organized from the moment we walked through the door. The 45 minute classroom experience covered what we needed to know before going out onto the track. The spotter, the voice in your helmet telling you what to do, talked us through each move while racing on the track. We raced 20 laps and had a great time. We arrived early, 7:40 for an 8:00 appointment. We are glad we did because we were 5th on the sign in list which made us in the second group to race. The only complaint we had was when you first walk through the door there is a hard sell to buy the $89 insurance. When we go again we will not purchase the insurance. It gave us piece of mind, but it was not necessary.",travelwith2kids_8
40,Absolute blast!,"My husband and I completely enjoyed our afternoon at LA Racing yesterday! They were well organized upon arrival, started the 45 minute training class promptly, and gave personal attention during dress preparation. I am 5'6"" and 120 pounds and was worried about control of the car and ability to handle the steering. It was no issue and just an absolute blast! They push you on the track via a in helmet one way radio but never take you outside your comfort zone. My husband really pushed the car and never felt unsafe or out of control. Could not recommend the experience more... for both guys and girls! If you like fast cars this is IT!",seegirltravel
