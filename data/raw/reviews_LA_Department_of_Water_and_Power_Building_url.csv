10,Worst company ever,"This is the worst company ever I'm low income and my credit is good, I called to get a connection of power, They charged me $300 for a deposit, Even though I'm low income they didn't want to help me be aware of this company they are crooks they take your money, They have a revenue of 6.5million and they charge $300 for deposit on new account even if your credit is good that's robbery this company should close",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533davitt
20,Horrible Architecture,"It's huge and takes up a whole block. Blah modern architecture. Creates nothing but dead space on the street around it, so very unpleasant place to walk. Just a lot of traffic buzzing on its way to the freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Headquarters of LADWP with a ground floor lobby level display of the history of Los Angeles water and power systems,"The LADWP John Ferraro Building is an iconic and historic building in the civic center of downtown Los Angeles. Of interest is that it was designed by the firm of Albert C. Martin, whose office is also responsible for classic architectural designs in civic buildings throughout Southern California, in particular, the Los Angeles County Music Center, located directly across from the Department of Water and Power Building. The lobby level of the Building is restricted to the public, but by registering for free as a visitor, the public is allowed to enter and view the interesting displays, scale models, and historical panels that describe the history of water and electrical power to Los Angeles. Visitors are required to have valid photo ID to register with the security desk just inside the main entrance. The exterior of the lobby is surrounded by a striking reflection pool, with good views of the civic center from that vantage point, a location that is frequently used by photographers, news media broadcast, and even appears in movies, such as the movie Inception, which features the area processed with CGI effects to achieve the surreal appearances in the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasH_traveling
40,H20 History!,"Sure, you can go pay your water bill here, but if your a tourist, why stop at such an industrial service building? If your a tourist with a love for history, then there are few reasons you shouldn't. The exterior upon close inspection is surrounded by water and fountains that light up at night! And the interior reveals the neat history and incredible achievements taken to get water to the city that was and still is so thirsty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
30,The Tower of Power ...,"Being an Angeleno I look at the DWP (Dept. of Water & Power) building as just another downtown structure, albeit one with a dated modernistic facade. It just kinda stands alone near the Freeways and near to Our Lady. We do like seeing the flat reflecting pools out front. Interior tours are not available, to my knowledge. Not worth a special trip. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,I didn't even know this was an iconic building,My longtime friend worked here for many years and I took my wife to see it. I didn't know it was iconic? I don't think it should be. Perhaps it was nice many years ago but not sure why this place is even listed. Don't bother to go out of your way as there is nothing much to see here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
20,Ironic,"When this very attractive mid-century modern building was built, when lit up at night it was like a beacon to the future, and its black-bottomed pools a symbol of plenty. Not any more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Mid 60s building with moat/reflecting pool,Unique building with some historical artifacts inside from the larger water and power construction projects in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
50,Free electric vehicle charging for 4 hours,"Drove a friend to an eye surgery appointment nearby and was hoping to charge up before the long drive back up north. All the area garages required a small fortune (up to $4 per 10 minutes) to park and not all offered electric vehicle charging. I drove around and around until I finally found this place. Very nice and helpful security guard handed me a pass for 4 hours. After that, there's a fee, but that was all I needed. Thanks Dept of Water and Power for supporting clean air!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLA1966
