10,Cleaning crew stealing cash and manager backing them up,"GO TO MONTEBELLO AMC or PUENTE HILL MALL they won't steal from you. I been to many AMC due to being a stub member but been here constantly but I misplaced my phone and keys numerous time and the cleaning crew always were honest on returning things. But This review is to give a full account of my experience with the AMC staff and my cash theft. I went with a friend to the movie 'Fantasy Island' on 02/17 in theatre 13 at 3:40pm of the Santa Anita AMC in ------ mall. Our seats were G5 and G6. I forgot my wallet in the cupholder which I only realized when we were at the Gas station after the movie was over. My friend immediately called the theatre to tell them about the loss of my wallet at 6.23pm. We headed on our way back to the theatre and reached by 6.40pm. My friend went to the AMC and told the person in charge about the lost wallet. Initially, the girl went to the office and told me she'd get the wallet from upstairs. She came back 2 minutes later and asked me if I had gotten a call back from the AMC saying that they had found the wallet. My friend said no, coz he didn't get the call. He came back.We then went to other places we had been after the movie to see if I had dropped the wallet there. I went back to AMC and asked on the ticket counter outside. The lady with a English accent told me that they had actually found the wallet and I went inside to ask them. The same girl was there inside when I went to ask again. I told her that I distinctively remember that I forgot my wallet in the cupholder in the theatre. She said there was a movie going on and she cannot send or go inside in a ongoing movie. I said I may have dropped it under the seat. But she said, the cleaners have checked everything and the seats have a pusher thing, so that whatever is dropped under the seat is pushed forward and the cleaners would have found a wallet if it was there. I said I'll buy tickets for that movie and find the wallet myself. She then went to check the details about the movie playing and we saw that the movie playing was 'Knives Out' and also the theatre was mostly empty including the seats G5 and G6 which was the area we wanted to search. I told her that my wallet has a tracker and that I just need to be couple feet from it and my phone will detect it. She said she cannot let us buy tickets, instead she will go inside and search for the wallet. She went and came back within 2- 3 minutes and said she found the wallet, that the wallet was pushed onto the row in front of our row. She came back quite early considering the theatre no.13 is quite inside and our row was in the back. Just pointing out that it was really fast for her to have travelled to the theatre and to the back of the row, find the wallet in the dark and come back so fast. After she gave me the wallet, I checked for my cards and cash. All my cards were there, but my cash was stolen. I don't understand why people have to steal! After spending money on tickets, food and drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tranman4000
30,Big selection of movies,"The cinema has 16 screens, so there so many movies to pick from. Inside the Santa Anita mall, allows you to explore the mall while you wait for your movie. Many restaurants as well. I experienced the self-serve kioskâ€˜s not to work. There were six of them and I tried three, and all three said at the end of the process that they were for viewing only. What a waste of time. Then you have to go wait in the regular long line to buy a ticket. They should either fix their machines or get rid of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
10,Never go there again. Treated as 3rd class citizen,"I just went to watched the movie this morning. We bought the tickets at machine. Machine didn't do right. My friend went to refund the tickets. The guy name Nick wasn't nice at all. He didn't apologizes or no explanation at all. He refunded but he followed my friend where my friend goes. (The tickets machine charged for IMAX tickets)Then after the movie,the manager looked at us and asked ""do you need help?!"" How come he asked only us but no other customers. We said,"" no"" and went to restroom. The manager was there after we came out from restroom and seemed to me he was following us and asked again whether we need anything or not. Before the movie started my friend did survey for AMC, he checked his phone my friend and noticed that they called him right away. Hey ! Isn't that their policy to turned off the phone when the movie started? We are the one following their rules ! Stupid! We were watching the movie. Why you want talk to us during the movie? Since the manager asked so many times, I decided to talk to him. ( I was going to forget about this bad experience he made us so upset) the manager said we didn't choose a.m ticket. I told him only one selection for the movie but he didn't listen to me. He gave us two complimentary tickets but I am not going back there after I was treated as the 3rd class citizen treatments. Poor customer service. I'm going to Kikorian at Monrovia where is the best customer services are! So uncomfortable experiences at AMC Santa Anita!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashamta
30,"Theater is nice, parking is horrible",The theater is clean and nice. Concessions are plentiful. The only problem is parking at the mall is terrible. Arrive early so you can park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneg244
40,Cool Place To Beat Summer Heat!,"Great mall food court below the theaters. Long lines only for most popular and latest films. Clean, comfortable and safe place to beat the summertime heat. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler0109
40,"Clean, well maintained","Nothing out of the ordinary, except they recently installed a bar area for alcoholic drinks which I have not used.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitforever
40,Great place for locals to watch a movie,"It's located at the Santa Anita Mall, so it's very convenient for people to shop, eat, and watch movies at the same place. They always have the newest movies in theaters and the choice of snacks is sufficient as well. The seats are in good conditions, however you cannot pre-select the seatings you want. Tickets are cheaper in the mornings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunchayz
40,Surprising admission fee,High standards at the AMC Theaters .... along with their high ticket prices! Have you ever paid $11.49 for a matinee .... as a senior?!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DML50
10,From Bad to Worse,"For us, this place is convenient. But the service, the food and atmosphere are nearly so poor I think driving another 15 minutes may be wiser. The automated ticket dispenser have been jammed for months, but the guest service reps never respond to cries for help. The food lines even for premiere showings are only staffed by a couple kids, who dole out burned popcorn and the like at outrageous prices. Want an Icee! Get it yourself! We are done with AMC 16 Arcadia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Padrino62
40,Fun Place to See a Movie in Arcadia: AMC Santa Anita 16,We have gone to the movies at AMC Santa Anita 16. Its a well run movie theater that shows current releases and other movies.It is located at the Santa Anita Mall. The food court is nearby for dining before or after the movie.We went mid week during the day so was able to find a parking spot easily. Parking can be a factor if going during more busy days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
