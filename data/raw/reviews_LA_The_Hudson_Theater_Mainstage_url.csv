50,Game of Thrones Parody,This is a great little theatre to see local productions. There didn't seem to be a bad seat and tickets were easy to get online. Parking is a pain as usual in LA but it looked like there was a pay lot next door. We had a great time at our Game of Thrones parody show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trishyco
50,"""Generation Me: The Musical"" Returns to The Hudson Theater","The Hudson Theaters are known for providing opportunities for new and upcoming playwrights to showcase new material. One of the best shows I have ever seen there is returning for a limited engagement: ""Generation Me; The Musical."" The show returns this Friday evening September 16 and runs through October 9th.The musical features an all-teen cast and tells the following story: ""At age 15 Milo Reynolds had it all - a seat at the popular table, the perfect girlfriend, the “coolest” parents, and friends who worshiped him. So, when Milo kills himself on Monday morning, his friends and family are left questioning everything they thought they knew about him.""Generation Me explores the heartbreak, confusion, and survivor’s guilt of the effects of suicide on those left behind. Told in flashbacks that open Milo’s story to the audience like a mystery, Generation Me identifies a generation more privileged, self-interested, oblivious, and lonelier than ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieGB
