30,Just a baptist church on Pacific Coast Highway.,"When I visited I could not get into the church, so I can't comment on its interior. From the outside it was a pleasant enough looking church and is a landmark in its position on PC Hwy in Redondo Beach... But as churches in general around the world go it is rather ordinary. I went to the church website to get some history on the church and their website was just all about the services, pastors, bible readings, etc. They should provide some information for those who are not only interested in the church as a place of worship... It is a historical building and a landmark too!",Roberts69
