50,Art At Its Best,"We went to the opening of artist David Kassan's ""Facing Survival"". It honors survivors of the Holocaust with realistic portraits of them in the present. It honors their survival by its realistic portrayal of them as they are now. There is a life size mural of them as a group in addition to individual portraits. Also fascinating is the lifesize holographs to whom you can address questions. The exhibit is interactive and heartfelt, detailing the 5 year plus journey the artist traveled with his subjects who became much more than just subjects. It is a beautiful and important exhibit, especially in these present times. It is rare to see an artist step back and let his subjects have center stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelers2013
40,"On USC's campus, changing exhibits","One of the missed gems in the shadow of the LA Coliseum. On the University of Southern California's campus, this small gallery shows changing exhibits. Last time we were there, the Fisher was showing (in conjugation with the Getty Gallery) a James Brown retrospective. Very modern and multi-media that showed the artist development over a period of time from his youth to today. Exhibits are normally topical and modern and free of charge to visit.The permanent collection is rarely seen, but can be accessed for research purposes. It would be nice to have a a piece or two on display and changed each month to broaden visitors horizons beyond the current exhibition. There are some great artist's works hidden away in the permanent collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBTravelstheWorld
40,Hidden USC attraction!,"Located on the University of Southern California campus, this small museum can complement your visit to the other museums that are located nearby. It is a small gallery that has rotating exhibits of high quality. During our visit, the museum was showing ""GYRE: THE PLASTIC OCEAN"". which makes you contemplate the amount of rubbish that is found in the waters around the world. It transforms them into works of art, but it is incredible of what can be tossed in the waters today. There is a small tranquil garden in the front of the building with small benches.Admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepperNewJersey
