40,Where the locals go - a hidden gem for ski and snowboarding in the San Gabriels,"I've been skiing this hill on and off for 40 years, and even though little has changed over the years, it still remains my go-to place for a last minute trip right after a snow-fall. It's always been a small family type operation with only 3 chair lifts and not many runs, but there's enough to keep skiers (and boarders) of various skill levels busy all day. There's no equipment rentals and only one restroom building, but the warming hut is cozy. There's generally burgers, dogs, and drinks at the warming hut, but but it's always good to pack a sandwich just in case.They're not always open because they rely on natural snowfall, so check ahead of time on their web site or by calling their snow-phoneIt's a straight shot up Angeles Crest Highway (Hwy 2), which is almost always plowed clear to just past the mountain. But be careful, it's easy to miss your stop. Parking is on the highway and the turnouts near the first chair lift (on your right going up the hill). You have to take Chair 1 up to the warming hut. Skiing ""the face"" under Chair 1 is challenging, with plenty of moguls, rocks, and trees, but the upper mountain is better for beginner and intermediate skiers and boarders.This is not the place to go if you're looking for amenities and lots of runs, but if you want skiing and boarding that's real close from the LA basin for a reasonable price, this is it! Come early to find a good parking spot and avoid the rush. Generally open only on weekends these days, but if the snow and crowds are good, who knows, they may open some more. Always check ahead of time for mountain and road conditions.And by the way... they also have mountain bike trails and a rated Frisbee Golf course for the Summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4859BAjohnm
30,Drove right by!,"I had always wanted to see this place. It was my destination and I drove right by. Granted, no snow yet. But the signs are lacking, ESPECIALLY coming from LA. I was expecting more from something that has been talked about my whole life. Parking was super small. I would imagine this would be a great hideaway during the season but I think it needs a fierce facelift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
40,real advanced ski terrain in socal,"Now that I've skied at this resort there are only two ski resorts in socal for those looking for off piste and advanced skiing that would be mt baldy and this place mt waterman. Both places depend on natural snow to be able to open. The drive up to the resort on hwy 2 is pretty easy mountain driving but alot of twists and will have to watch out for the motorcyclist who enjoy riding this road.The runs are short here, but the trees are very wide apart so you can make your own ski run. I would suggest getting an early start here because the parking lot is very small also there is no lodge here so bring your own equipment and either dress ahead of time or change in the car.The advanced terrain is steep here in fact it reminded me of snowbird, ut.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
10,CROOKS!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY GROUPONS for this place as I have groupons for that place and in TWO YEARS i was not able to use them and they WILL NOT GIVE YOU REFUND. CROOKS that's what I say, CROOKS!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOCSantaClarita
10,"Warning, read before you buy ticket from coupon site.","Warning: Groupon is selling the mt waterman coupon again. Consider the following condition before you buy, and there is no refund or exchange.1. check how many days Mt. Waterman open during 2011-2012 or end of 2012 ski season, the answer is ZERO.2. Groupon or others has fine print say ""subject to weather"", they will not responsible if they don't ever open because the weather condition. if Mt Waterman never open during the season, good luck with the groupon and they will not care.3. Since Mt. waterman DO NOT make snow, like there web site said ""pray, pray, pray"", beside pray, you can't do anything, 'cos money is in there pocket.4. If you don't have a SUV or larger car, make sure your car fit all the ski equipments before you buy groupon, because mt. waterman don't have equipment rental, you need to bring your own, buy your own, or rent it from sport chalet or else and drive all the way from your rental place to Mt. Waterman. if you forgot to check Mt. Waterman condition before you rent, good luck, after you rent your stuff, bring it to Mt. Waterman, and they said they don't have enough snow and not open, then all you can do is bring it back to the place you rent, return the equipment and lost 1 day equipment rental fee, then pray.5. if you go to school or work like me, busy during week day and maybe some weekend, you should prepare some vacation off, because weather don't come in every weekend, if they open during weekday, you better take a day off to go, otherwise coupon site said, mt. waterman did open, and you can go during those days. you need to be very flexible on your schedule if you ever buy those coupon, because mt. waterman pray for snow storm, and snow storm not necessary come in holiday or weekend.6. Road condition is not so easy to drive like the way to Mt. high or bear mt., bring snow chain all the time in case it snow after you ski.7. LA has several very cold storm in the last few weeks, it's less than 50F or in low 50F during day time, everyone else like mt. high, snow valley, big bear are opened, but Mt. waterman can't open because they don't have enough snow, pray, pray and pray.Think of these condition before you buy a contract from the coupon site, i am so disappoint because i bought groupon in late fall in 2011, i was never able to use it because they never open, and groupon has been very helpfull to suggest to give it away to someone else and won't do anything else. i was so excited when i bought it, but after one season, i already give up my hope on my $$$, and bought a ticket to mt. high and big bear during winter break. Good luck everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Traveler_88
50,Favorite local ski area,"Spent many, many ski seasons at this resort. Loved the uncrowded conditions (might have changed since I was there last) and enjoyed the food, warmth and companionship at the warm up hut.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargeD412
50,Angeles National Forest,"The road is amazing, well done Cal-trans. Now its time enjoy clean crisp air, just waiting for it to snow! Steep, steep just need the deep powder and we will be skinning there! In interim, great hiking trails from route 2 to the top of Mt. Waterman, 8,030' or about. Views all the way around from Mojave to the O.C.See if you can find the marker on top of Mt. Waterman on a day hike?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyM164
