40,Something to do,Pretty much the same as all the other ripleys across the world but good value in the multi pass attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
30,Ripley's Believe It or Not!,"Ripley's is a waxwork museum where you can meet your favorite movie stars. It has other attractions such as mirror maze, torture devices, a human skin mask, four-eyed man, etc. Can be scary for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
30,Definitely not a must go place in Hollywood,"One of the most hyped places in western Hollywood. Its right on the Hollywood walk of fame, the museum is a trio with wax museum and hollywood museum with combined tickets of $35.This is no where close of the Ripley's at New York or London. There is really noting that sticks out in mind. It is definitely not a must visit when in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aninda_mukherjee
40,Not as good as London but still pretty cool,The Minas Tirith exhibit really made it for me. That was incredible. And all the old Superman suits!It's quite small as Ripleys go but still worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBRoxx
40,Interesting..,It was an interesting stop. I think it's a staple stop for tourists. Finding a parking area wasn't too hard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glitter_In_My_Soul
20,Might have been fun 40 years ago,"This place reminds me of a recent visit to Mel's Diner. They still have old jukeboxes but the tracks are from the 80s. It's the last time people actually used them. Likewise Ripley's is filled with artifacts collected up to the 80s and mostly 1950s era stuff. It doesn't help that the place feels like an undersized basement. There are a couple of interactive exhibits that were kind of fun but they can be easily spoiled if you are following others. This place would be worth it if it were $8. But anything above belies the value of a 30 minute visit. Also, there's a pervading sense of 'did I really spend good money on this!?' from your fellow visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9444FTpatrickc
50,"Fun, interesting and definitely weird","My wife and I bought the triple package (Wax Museum, Guinness and Ripley's) and it's a pretty solid deal for the price, especially considering the individual pricing. This is the location that was featured on Ghost Adventures, so if you're interested in the paranormal there's kind of a little bit of a sideshow to that. A lot of the stuff featured here is the same stuff that's been featured on the TV show as the books, but there's also a lot of other interactive stuff that makes it worth the visit. If you're looking to burn a few hours, I'd recommend getting the triple package ticket and coming here to bask in the weird wonders of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
50,Interesting things,"For people interested in freaky, weird or particular things, it IS the place, so interactive, you will no just walk and read, you can touch and play, it is really interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danquinb
10,Waste of money,It's a terrible waste of money. For the price they charged I was expecting it to be bigger and have more to view. I'd like to get my money back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindispooner
40,Fun time at Ripley’s,"There were many interesting exhibits at Ripley’s. They had a really neat room of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia, several odd animals, lots of interesting art, autographs of past stars, etc. it was a good time for both of us. Good value for the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalchat
30,Fun,This was my first visit to a Ripley's Attraction. There was a lot to see but I noticed some of it was redundant. Still a fun place to visit. Get their three attraction VIP deal on line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamedlovers
30,"Packed, but Interesting","Went with grandkids (7, 10, 12). All found things they were interested in. The building is pretty crowded. Lots for a patient person to see. Kids zoomed through. Bought the VIP Package so Guinness & Hollywood Wax as well. With lunch and the 3 venues, we were occupied for about 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
30,Good visit,"This is an ok place to visit, but definitely best when purchasing as part of the 3 museum pass. I don’t think I’d be worth its separate admission price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim723
30,Just ok,"Got a combo ticket to this and Guinness world records museum and some other place that we didn't set foot in. They had a lot of stuff of interest, but it won't be for everyone. We didn't read everything so we got through in 45 minutes or so. It wasn't too crowded, but the cost probably cuts down on that. We got tired of all the walking in Hollywood, so keep that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705matthewy
30,Interesting,"This was a normal tourist trap. They had some interesting things and interaction for children and family. Wasn't as long as I thought it would be, I was expecting more out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214KLkimberlyd
40,VIP pass,"My girlfriends and I stopped at Ripley's first for a tour and decided to get the VIP pass. The deal is you get to stop at Ripley's, Guinness Records, and House of Wax for $37! I think that's a great deal and it's a self guided tour so you can go at your own pace. They had your typical displays. Hope you enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinhv0803
30,Okay 3*,Staff were nice. It was short and it didn't go on for long. Location is okay. I was expecting a little bit more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gexway
40,A pricey yet priceless experience,"This museum was a great stop for my vacation in LA with my boyfriend. The museum was full of fun and funky exhibits. Neat activities, fun facts, and a bunch of cool sets. I think my favourite bit was the station where you roll your tongue at a mirror. I won't spoil why this was my favourite, but it was for sure the activity that I got the most fun out of.Not to mention, it's smack dab in the middle of hollywood! Take a trip on the walk of fame, visit this museum, have some food at the hard rock cafe and it makes for a perfect evening.My biggest issue was the price. The museum did take about an hour or so to experience, but it was real expensive. You're in hollywood though, so you should be expecting some pricey fun. If you've got the cash, this is a good spot to hit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilBlueJay
40,Very cool attraction,What first got my attention in this museum is that it's a haunted museum it came out in an episode of Ghost Adventures. My boyfriend and I went to check it out and it was pretty neat pretty cool! The worlds tallest man is right as you enter and there's cool creations and animals you would have thought never existed. There is musical stairs that play a piano note when you step in them. Honestly it's really cool I would totally recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vcruz7597
50,Amazing & Amusing,Had some neat attractions. An automaton of the tallest man in the world who stands up when you step on his footprints! A musical staircase. Pause your own shadow. I think the tickets were $20 apiece.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethD108
40,Fun visit.. overpriced tickets though,This is an unusual museum and is full of oddities and unique pieces of art. Some of the interactive exhibits are really fun and can be very enjoyable for a group. Lots of photo opportunities as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NidhiC_12
30,Usual oddites,If you have never been to one it is worth the stop in to see. I have been to ones in Tennessee and it had a lot of the same things from there. There is a lot of strange and weird things and information all over the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako
40,Interesting weird museum,Enjoyed the visit took many pictures inside. Some interactive elements that made the experience fun. Only wish the ticket can be cheaper. Can spend up to 2 hrs there. One of the highlight at Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirleyho13
40,Fun !,Good time! Go at your own pace and it had a clean restroom. Hard to find on the blvd. Cost seemed average for the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413brandig
40,Family trip.,"Great place, shocking location. Some very interesting items, subjects and facts in here. I would definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonrB1253YW
50,Great!,Expensive entry but great experience. Not for children under 10- scary stuff. Great Marilyn Monroe exhibit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z817BMleslieb
40,Kids loved it!,"My 14, 12, and 8 year olds loved Ripley's. It provided a couple hours of interactive fun and cooled us off after being out in the heat for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/925brandyl
50,Things to see everywhere,"A lot of content. The visit contains many interesting things, even in the restrooms! A fun visit for a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acha42
40,Great Place for Familiy to Fill in Time,"After visiting the Guiness World Records we found Ripleys to be much better, much more interactive. The kids and us really enjoyed Ripleys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay343
50,Good place to visit,"Fun place to visit, the exhibition is interesting and self explanary. Recomended not only for kids, adults will enjoy it as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oritv2015
50,Believe it!,"Great place to visit either as a couple or a family! Some great, scary and weird attractions! Fun for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DemiB110
30,Interestoing,There was a lot of reading on the displays. Some of the facts were interesting. Don't think the kids were that interested in the museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtjjeda7
40,"Nice visit, Interesting, Similar to Other Ripleys","If you are looking for something to do around the Hollywood area, this is probably the better choice over the other places like Wax Museum. The prices were a bit too much for what you get in the museum, as it is kind of short. However, our family still enjoyed ourselves. If you ask the clerks for discounts, they will give them at the door, so it will be a little cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959MichaelB
40,Good way to spend an hour whilst on the Blvd,"We were having a walk along Hollywood boulevard and came across ripleys. The 3 x combo VIP tickets were great as just one attraction would be over within 20 mins so it’s worth spending the extra $10 or so to upgrade to the 3, this includes the wax museums and ripleys.The staff were great and the kids loved it. ( 8 and 13)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarskye
50,Very Interesting Place,When I went to Ripley’s Believe it Not I had a great time with my friends. There was a lot of cool stuff there especially the mummy foot and the was my favorite thing that I saw. I would definitely go to Ripley’s Believe or Not It because I had such a great time there with my friends. I would recommend this place to my family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelk924
40,3 Museum,"It was fun, I got the ticket to go in to Ripley's, Wax Museum and the Record Guinness, Ripley was my favorite, Record Guinness was my least favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaViz
40,Fun But A Little Short,Ripley's Museums are always a lot of fun and we've been to many of them around the US. This one definitely seemed like the shortest one we'd visited. Still lots of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
40,Buy the pack! Visit 3 museums,"You can find all kind of weird things. It's really funny. I recommend you that buy a pack that sells in the museum, you can visit Ripley's, wax hollywood museum and record guiness. Go with your children...probably they'll enjoy them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cote-Va-Chile
30,Ripleys,"It’s okay,bit costly for what you get. We really didn’t enjoy this as much as we were hoping for. Parking isn’t available.The staff was very nice, there were a lot of people from around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
50,Love going to Ripley's,"My daughter's and I were here in LA for a couple of hours and trying to get as much done as possible as we had a three hour drive back to Vegas...after seeing the American horror story house and the Walk of Fame ,I spotted this museum and couldn't pass it up... I'm from the Dallas area and we have a huge Ripleys there but this one was great as well, wish we had more time to spend but we'll worth it none the less",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kittenlivesmatter2
50,Very interactive,"I have been to several Ripleys Believe it or not Museum. My two girls age 3 and 7 had a blast. This was our first visit to Hollywood and we all had a blast. Several things to see and take your time. Museum is very clean and the staff at the entrance was very welcoming, even providing us info about the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike2009SanAntonio
50,Great fun for a few hours,"Really good fun, we went on a random spur of the moment visit with a few hours to kill and really glad we went. So many interactive things to do and also other facts about all kind of weird and wonderful things. Make sure you try the tongue task in the first room, not many people can do it but its really great if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
30,Worth a Visit if Nearby,"Lots of weird and wonderful things are included in here. Having been disappointed with the Walk of Fame, we decided to pop in here on our final day in Hollywood.There was plenty to see, and some really great pieces - I especially loved the Star Wars items they had on display. However, it's not somewhere that I'd recommend you go out of your way to see - it's worth popping in if you are in the area, but not worth a journey for all there is to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893dave2019
40,All things weird and interesting,"Whilst visiting the walk of fame, which we found disappointing, we saw Ripley Believe it or not and having been to a couple of others took our family of six.There was much to see and do, lots of interesting finds and facts. Some really quirky exhibits and our kids had fun looking around and being able to interact with some of the experiences.We also paid to see the Hollywood wax museum as part of the entry ticket. The piano stairs were a real hit with the kids. It is a quick, safe and fun thing to do with a family or on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot
30,Included,My family of 4 came here while vacationing in California and the only reason why we did was because this was included in the first purchase for the wax museum but we all thought it was just ok. Nothing special. There was only a couple of cool things to see . Wouldn't recommend or return. There are much better things to do in this area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
30,More fun for families with kids,We visited this Museum because we paid 1 ft at the Wax Museum and got entrance to the Ripley's Museum as well as the Guinness of World Records Museum. It was interesting to see some of this stuff. I think it would be more fun for families with kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
30,Ripley's,"Ripleys staff were very nice and helpful,our wheelchair broke down and they went extra mile to make our visit workable for all four in our party. We almost missed part of ripleys and one the staff asked as we were leaving did we see something we said know she walked us all back to that area and we sure did enjoy and glad for the extra help as we had fun together in that area. Glad we didn't miss thank you to great staff last Tuesday.They helped us go to all that was in each exbit.We went to all 3 site combo 3 museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
30,A Family Adventure,Families especially young ones will be more entertained with the museum. Many interesting facts. The staff was very nice and attentive. A better deal if you can get discount tickets or you can combine all three museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekingofswapmeets
40,Fun place to visit but I liked the NY one more,"It is much worth a visit. Some fun interactive tools, many interesting facts and pictures. I think the New York one is better equipped but this one was OK too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pengemex
40,good with kids,We visited on summer and it wasn´t all that crowded our kids 9 years old enjoyed the exhibits. we did their combo of 3 museums and thought it was great value and a good way to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moisesgr
50,fantastic,"This is really interesting! Such great collection of special people, animals and stories from all over the world. Real MUST SEE in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577jannat
50,Fun family trip!,"We purchased a ticket for Ripleys, The Guinness World Records museum and Hollywood Waxworks. The cost was $30 per adult and $20 per child, and we felt it was great value for money!It was really fun for our whole family (ages from 8 to 70), my kids favorite part was the music stairs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superdella
40,Fun stop on Hollywood Blvd,Our five year old really enjoyed this. Lots of unusual things to see and lots of interactive exhibits. Very clean bathrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hthrbug
40,Worth the visit,"We are a family of four and we saw ripleys on the internet and thought to give it a try. We went to ripleys on 3rd July. The entrance was nice with a few artifacts on the top-left hand corner. The staff were friendly and guided us to take the appropriate tour. we, however took the ripleys tour only.The museum is nicely designed and has loads of oddities and artifacts(though not old). It also has a number of pranks also and that were the most fun. It has a number of great designs by people from all around the world.i wont write anymore as to spoil the experience. All i can say that it is worth a visit and a must see attraction for people of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hussain_Abbas72
30,BEWARE OF PARKING LOTS - MUGGERS!,"We parked up in an open air, off-street parking area somewhere off Hollywood Blvd so that we could walk down to Ripleys in April whilst on a family holiday. There was a group of teenagers sitting on a few of the cars. As we pulled in they started moving around - they positioned themselves at various points of the car park and 2 seemed to be ""on the lookout"" by the street, one was talking on his mobile phone. We had been given an upgrade to a pretty nice SUV and my husband was instantly aware that they were up to no good. We didn't get out. My husband drove back out of the car park and they just started walking down the street. Pretty sure if it wasn't for my husband's instinct, we would have got mugged/car stolen/worse!BEWARE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932jessa
40,Very entertaining,"The first impression was not great, but once you get to the interactive parts, it is worth every cent. We had a lot of laughs and enjoyed doing all the fun activities. The art is fascinating.The kids loved the restroom farting noises, the dancing and solving the puzzles.It was a fun hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
50,Nice artifacts,Nice display of weird history and the piano stair case was a hit with my 9 year old boy. Typical ripely museum with a Hollywood flair. Close to strip and next to best place for breakfast and lunch. Hit was the light game at the end or the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaughnj_11
40,Fun,We had some time to kill and decided to visit the Ripley's museum. it was a whole lot of fun and our 4 year old enjoyed it a lot.Lots of interactive and interesting exhibits. The little fellow was also given a book on entry with pictures and explanations of the exhibits and he has took it to kinder with him as he found it very interesting and waned t share it with his friends:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpunja
40,Fun if you have some time to spare,This is not for me a top attraction.It is very similar in some of parts of the museum with the Guinness museum.If you have spare time to spend you can do it but if not in my opinion just leave it.The museum is fun but nothing spectacular.In my case i saw this museum during the night after a busy day i just wanted to relax a little bit and the museum serve it's purpose.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaov184
40,Fun,"I hadn't been to one of these in years, and it was a fun return. There is so much to interact with, and so many neat facts. I particularly enjoy the optical illusions room and the artwork",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
40,Interesting museum,We had 9 hours to kill before our flight so ended up wondering around here. Lots of interesting items and interactive stops. I loved the musical stairs!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sianarealla
50,Fun things you never knew you never knew.,We had a great time here. We did this as part of the VIP combo and loved it. The musical stairs were the best surprise ever. We had a group of five including my parents and my teen kids. I saw other reviews saying less than stellar things about this place. I think it is all in the attitude you take with you. We all enjoyed this thoroughly and thought this was a fun adventure to add to our memories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/routetoa
40,Fun!,We enjoyed walking through and seeing all the displays. They have a good number of interactive displays as well. It was fun for the family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasrob
20,Waste of time,We only came here as we got entry for free after purchasing a ticket at the Hollywood Wax museum. Total waste of time really. Tacky & boring. Glad we didn't pay for it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
50,"Great, educational museum!","My family, my husband, 40, my daughter, 10 and myself, 40, visited Ripley's Believe It or Not museum recently on our vacation to Los Angeles, CA. The museum was amazing with plenty of educational exhibits and items. We will definitely be returning to this great attraction. Thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravvenesque
40,Fun place!,"This was fun, lots to see. You can take pictures, they encourage you to. My son wanted to go to Hollywood and so we went, it is a little strange down there but lots to see. We parked at the mall there, Hollywood and Highland and walked. Tips are to hold on to your stuff and don't hold your hands out because someone will put something in your hand and then ask for a donation to buy it. Lots of souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805tammiep
50,Fun and interactive,My 11 yr old daughter and I had a blast exploring and playing with all the attractions... try the tongue trick at your own risk!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11sadied
40,Great place to discover new facts and extra ordinary hapenings,"There are lots of record breaking facts at display. Wife, kids and I had a great time reading about the tallest man lived ever to how long it took Maryline Monroe do her make up every day. It's worth seeing !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aldo3571
50,Enjoyable and fun!,We had lots of fun here. I played and enjoyed going up and down the piano stairs :DWe bought the promo ticket that gave us access to the Wax Museum and Guiness World Records Museum. It was really good value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAROTZAMM
50,Excellent details ..,The place has some really really interesting things for us to look into. You just need to stop and look at the writings ... there are many many details ... !The only thing we didn't like was the paid shooting game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gauravarora22
20,Such a total rip-off.,"Maybe this attraction is better suited for children and younger folks, but I felt like they crammed together things that Ripley 'may or may not' have acquired over the years into the space. Some of them were interesting, but a peacock made of acrylic fingernails? Come on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bear187k
30,Part of the deal,"This is part of a three in one deal that we elected to see with our 9 year old. The place is full of a lot of stuff collected by Ripley with a lot of photos of him and others at various locations during his life. There is a lot of head hunting gruesome stuff, so my 9 year old was in heaven. However , this is the least interesting of the three venues on the ticket, the guy at the front counter is really a good guy though and was doing his best to show a lot of enthusiasm about the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBelyndaJosh
30,Ok but outdated,"This place is fun and has some interesting stuff, but it's outdated. The museum still shows old clips from a TV show that's been off the air for a decade. I feel like this place would be a lot more fun if they updated it.It's not a bad time and probably worth the money if you really like oddities, but it's got a lot of things that are D-grade oddities (example: stuff built out of matches or license plates).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattwA642GO
30,Nice attraction to kill time,"No plan to visit this place, but my friend wanted to visit it cause he never visit it before.It was interesting to see and read many weird things. There were some surprise and it was really funny. There were also some interactive attraction. I tried to take picture of my shadow. Anyway, I enjoy my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samuelpas
50,better than expected,I thought this would be gimmicky and not worth my time or money. Was I wrong. My 12 y/o daughter motivated the visit and I am so glad she did. It was fun informative and occupied our interests for over 2 hours. The museum had facts artifacts and memorabilia. Even a little science with optical illusions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sageandsydney
50,Seeing IS believing...,"Don't base your decision to go in on the brochure...I almost did but the daughter talked me in and I DID NOT regret it...3 levels of fascinating displays, inc interactive, and spent well over an hour wandering through a well set out Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996ronw
50,Loved it!,"I'm a huge Marilyn fan and came for the Marilyn exhibit but was pleasantly surprised with the place itself. Upon entering there was a woman minding the door. A petite woman with glasses and she was the most nicest woman ever. She was all smiles and allowed us to take a picture with the bumblebee transformer attraction at the very front.We bought a VIP ticket from the wax museum and after that experience we came straight here. We viewed a lot of weird things including a Cyclops lamb, a man with double pupils, and a cow with legs growing from his back.Definitely a must see here in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
30,If Your Bored Its worth a Stop,"I bought the VIP pass for $29.95 which includes admission to the Hollywood Wax Museum, Guinness World Record Museum and Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum. This was the best of the three. I spent about an hour here looking at the exhibits. It was worth the $10 (barely) and open late.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
40,interesting musium...,"Lots of fun, especially all the believe it or not facts! I recommend bringing friends or family members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilyq237
50,Great fun,"This place was fun, lots of interactive things to see. Please don't pay full price, when we went there was a 3-in-1 package that included Ripley's, The Guinness Book of record museum and the Hollywood wax museum for $30 USD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846samanthaf
40,Fits right into the Hollywood atmosphere,"Hollywood accepts all comers so what one person might feel is weird, the next person might find fascinating. We had not been to Ripley's in many years so since it was part of our Explorer Pass, we had no reason not to check it out. There were more interactive exhibits than we remembered. Good for children elementary age and up. It is located right in the busy Highland and Hollywood Boulevard area so you can make part of a day out in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron
30,Tired and old!,"Seen these in Sydney and Gold Coast and this one in Hollywood is almost identicalI think the museums need new attractions cause we all decided we were over Ripleys nowThey haven't changed much at all in the many years they've been aroundOnly took half hour to go through, it'll be a novelty to younger visitors I guess, who haven't been before",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulfR2MU
40,"So Corny, Unless You Have a Kid With You--Then You Must Stop","Ripley's is in a cool location, in the heart of Hollywood. The street is great to walk and it is safe. As to Ripley's, if you have a kid, maybe under 13, you will want to take them there. They will love it.They have cool lights, and stories, and facts, and silly stuff that any kid is going to enjoy. So take them and have fun. Use the net to get a coupon so you are not paying full price.If you don't have a kid, I would skip it, there are many other things for you to do on vacation.The service is very nice, the place is super clean and it is a lot of fun, with a kid.Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Ripleys believe it or not,"Loved it. Suitable for any age ,, a must see for any age,well set out and amusing items on display ,the collection gets bigger all the ti e reasonable cost for entry but well worth it ,so. I have to see and interactive activities for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128lynettea
40,VIP Pass only,"I wouldn't pay full price just for this attraction, but with the ($30) VIP pass that includes the Hollywood Wax Museum as well as Guinness, it's a great value.The 'problem' with these types of attractions these days - and Guinness is included - is that with the internet and all that has to offer it's no big deal anymore, not a lot is 'new' or exciting as if you want to see or know about weird stuff, just log on. When I was a kid you'd have to get a book to see this kind of stuff or maybe wait for a TV special. Now it's kind of all old - tired. We've been bombarded by this strangeness for years, nothing we haven't been exposed to before. That said, for preteens I'm sure they'd get a big kick out of this. Certainly, if you want to get your 'money's worth', you can spend a lot of time here, just read each and every exhibit description, do the hand's on, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
50,Amazing,An amazing place for kids to visit. So many different things to see. Very mind opening. Fun games to be played and you never know who will win,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892craigf
40,Vacation,Enjoyed this touristy stop. Lots to see inside. Loved the musical steps. Fun staff helped along the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599kristinh
40,Entertaining Facts and History!,This is our second Ripleys as we also went to the one in San Francisco. Still a lot of amazing things to view and one can pick up history trivia along the way. Take your picture next to the tallest man at the entrance who also moves - sits down. See how you measure up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lm512014
30,Do you believe?,We went to this museum because my son is OBSESSED with the books about all the facts/myths/ and he loved it. It brought the books to life for him and he was pretty convinced by all the artifacts and displays. I personally did not believe everything I saw but that is okay. It is fun to debate what might be real or not with your friends in your group. It was small but full of stuff to see and explore so I think it is worth it if you are a big Ripley's fan!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiaceleste
30,Average,Visited with my daughter in August 2016 and I found it a little boring and irrelevant and don't think I would come again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
50,Perfect indoor tween treat,"Wow! This side trip ended up being my 14-yr-old's favorite thing about visiting southern California. It has something for every age. We'd had enough of the beach & sand, we'd done two amusement parks, & I didn't want to sit around the hotel. So I drove through L.A. traffic to get him & his sister to participate in this staple of Hollywood culture. My daughter found out she's 1 in a 1000 who can fold her tongue, & my son loved the musical stairs. Spent @ 2 hours there. We saw some stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, saw some characters from popular movies, got bamboozled by Mr. Muscles (who charges for photographs that you take with your own camera), enjoyed some ice cream from the Ghiradelli factory across the street, & simply enjoyed our time together. I recommend parking in the garage located diagonally from Ripley's -- it is safe, easy, cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmbdmp
40,It is what it is...believe it or not,"Went here partly for my youngest girl who enjoys the books, and part of a museum package. This place was cool. Spent 40 minutes looking amongst the odd facts and strange displays. Not a must, but we enjoyed ourselves. A place to beat the heat, and a good deal when you buy the combo museum package....need two hours to do three museums, but could of taken longer...we were a little rushed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
40,VIP Pass is the only way to go,"The VIP pass is $30 for three venues: Ripley's, Wax Museum, and Guiness Book of World Records. If not it was like $24 just for Ripley's. Fun way to get out of heat for an hour while walking down Hollywood Blvd. Right down the street from TLC (Chinese Mann Theatre).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeboo16
40,Fun Time,Did the VIP pass. It was a fun visit. Took about an hour to get through it. I'd do it again. I lived through the Berlin Wall collapse in high school. Seeing a large piece of that wall was very cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyTheITGuy
40,Much more fun than expected,A great way to get out of the heat for a couple of hours and have some fun. See the height of the tallest man and film of the smallest. Even just going into the exhibits had some fun jokey stuff - won't say what cos that would be a spoiler!Put aside your adult and be a kid for a while!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmornag
50,Awesome place!,It's the first time I've been to this place and it was an awesome spot. Too bad it was almost closing time when we got in so we didn't get to roam around the place for long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ylayne
20,"Not for Kids, Not for Adults - not very interesting","We were a group of three adults and two tweens. None of the exhibits were age appropriate for all groups, some were too loud for very small children, others like the shrunken heads and animal oddities too disturbing and grotesque. Many of the exhibits were very thread bare. Not a great use of over $20 per ticket. Better to go see a movie at El Capitan and see the show before the movie starts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Light_33
50,Like Warehouse 13,"This museum is really funny. A lot of stuff a one can collect - from crazy to fun and amazing this place is for all ages. Artefacts, Facts and more. There is a special offer for 3-1 ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseBlue
40,Part of a deal with Hollywood wax museum,Lots of info and things to read and learn and see. Very kid friendly has some interesting interactive events cool photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicarC2448MO
50,Unique and Interesting,For 20 dollars this place has plenty to offer. Most exhibits are unique e.g. genuine shrunken human heads and there are many. The tour is interactive and is loads of fun too. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowan548
50,Offers a lot,This museum has a lot of different exhibits so everyone can find something to enjoy. They are reasonably priced and have interactive exhibits featuring everything from Monroe to Star Wars. They offer a discount if you buy tickets to the wax museum too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennesseePostcard
40,Interesting,"Lots to see and read. Very interesting. many things inside were not what I would call ""unbelievable"". It is a fun activity to do and I would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbirViews
40,PRETTY COOL,It was pretty cool to go because my daughter has always wanted to go and she love love love love love love loved it thanks Ripley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/337taylorb
40,Good attraction considering location,If you've been to one you've been to them all but this one had a couple surprises. The staff were friendly and not pushy at all. We liked it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/percellas
20,Below par,Visited Ripley's in London and it was wonderful. This was NO comparison. Such a waste of money. Skip it! Crowded venue with few interesting displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovemyAcura
50,An super suprise at Ripleys!!!,"Day one on my first visit to the United States entailed a visit to Ripley's Believe it or not!!!After a waxy affair at Madame Tussauds, what an amazing collection of fun and amazingly real facts!!!And it was super great to see the memorial to the best Superman ever - Dean Cain!!!! WOW!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543natalier
20,Skip It,"I've been to Ripleys in other areas and not sure why this attraction is still around. My son wanted to go in and check it out. There was a Bumblebee transformer in the lobby which drew us into the storefront. It was $25 per person and we were in there for about 15 minutes. It's quick to go through and most items are not very interesting. There were a couple of items we noted, the unlocking gate was interesting. The worlds tallest man was super creepy and we got our fortunes from Zoltar (you pay extra for this). All and all we spent $100 for a family of 4 and I wish I had it back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iberostarnightmare
40,A cool but weird experience!,"Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum was really cool but sometimes creepy, especially when they showed us the shrunken heads and the two-headed animals, as well as the one-eyed 'Cyclops' lamb. I found the matchstick creations quite beautiful and very skillfully made, and I enjoyed the shadow exhibit where you could actually 'see' your own shadow and the portraits made of candy. But as I said before, it was a bit creepy in certain parts of the museum, so I don't recommend bringing very young children here!However, Ripley's was a very interesting experience and you should try it if you go to Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homelover69
20,Outdated,This place is totally outdated. It was so boring to go around. I do not recommend anyone to visit this place. Waste of time and money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhatPavan
30,Mildly entertaining,While there were a few interesting tidbits here and there it was not very big and did not take very long to get through at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ISONirvana
50,Fun and creepy!,"This was an interesting experience! You will learn quirky information about some of the world's most bizarre recorded information, talents, and experiences people have had all over the world, so bizarre you question whether or not it's real! Definitely a must do if visiting Hollywood Blvd",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmileySprite
30,Something to do in Hollywood,"Our family of 4 including two boys aged 8 & 10 visited Ripley's for lack of much else to do in the Hollywood area other than walk around. There were some fairly interesting exhibits that make you feel like you're getting some value for the entry fee. The boys were somewhat entertained but still hustled through the place like they do at all museums we visit. We all really liked the optical illusion section. Be sure everyone in the family tries to grab the ruby out of the tube in the Marilyn Monroe section. It only took us about 45 minutes to an hour to walk through the entire place. That duration was perfect for us because we didn't want it to take up our entire evening. In summary, I wouldn't make a special trip to Hollywood just to go here but if you're already in the area and have some time to kill it's worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTGlos
40,Fun place to visit,"Whilst it was a bit overrated, it was still a cool place to visit. Had many fun facts and strange exhibits. I would recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarH9114OH
40,Fun and sometimes creepy!,"I've been to a Ripley's in Australia before, and this is pretty much the same - a whole lot of really weird and fun exhibits! Everything is interesting, and it ranges from the historical (a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe), to the wacky (celebrity portraits made of candy) to the creepy (a knife carved from a human bone). Our visit took about an hour and we really enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilySparrow
40,Corny and very fun!,"Finally took my kids to see this place. So glad we finally went! It doesn't take long to go through the museum, so only plan 1-2 hours max. I was surprised how affordable this place was.There are all sorts of curious facts and things to see. Then there was a room or two with optical illusions and interactive stuff. I brought my 4 kids ages 9-15 and everyone had a great time.There are some pay games, etc along the way (like the Zoltar and a shooting gallery) so be prepared to shell out some quarters for the games along the way.Most impressive to me was the art. They had a lot of really cool art, like a pictures of Marilyn Monroe made out of pasta, Mick Jagger made out of chicken wire and a portrait of Bob Marley made out of guitar picks.If you are in LA, add this to your ""to do"" list for some less expensive, but fun entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tasiadoo
30,do all three cheaper that way,we did this as the day was very wet so we went in to shelter from the rain we were in and out in less than 45 mins expensive some good facts in there old not up to date on stuff .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paula01
30,Some interesting stuff but expensive,"The stuff they have here is interesting, but not interesting enough for the admission price. They are trading off their name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmS3206GT
40,Good Fun for the Kids,Don't set your expectations too high!I took my eight year old son and it occupied him for around 45 minutes or so.Ripleys has some interesting and fun things to look at and kids will find some of pretty interesting.Definitely once is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kosta100
30,First time,"There're many kind of interesting stuffs to see. Its sure a good experience, one time visit is enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978ivyt
40,Much to see,Many exhibits from the book and TV show. From all over the world and from resent history. Also has a gift shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverNZ
30,Overpriced but some interesting exhibits,"The LA Ripley's believe it or not museum is priced at $20 / adult which I thought was a tad too much for what's in the museum. That said, there are some interesting artifacts - and not surprisingly, a lot are to do with Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pradyota
40,Weirdly entertaining,"Pro:- If you grew up watching the TV show or those little snippets in the newspaper, you will pretty enjoy this attraction- Lots of interesting displays that span the world- Some displays are interactive... beware the mirror though ;)Con:- Pretty small place, but enough probably to spend an hour or moreTip:- Get the VIP ticket for entries to 3 attractions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VTik
50,Ripley's Rocks,"We live in Los Angeles but had not been to Ripley's before. I took my two grandchildren, ages 8 and 7, and I was truly surprised at how much they enjoyed it. The exhibits were very entertaining and weird and there were lots of interactive activities. They especially enjoyed the shrunken heads, the tallest man, the shadow room, the dancing room and the giant video game floor. The staff were very welcoming, in particular one staff member named Thomas who very patiently, and even enthusiastically, answered all of their questions. It was a terrific time for all of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/67marcyt
10,Waste of money... much better places to see,"It was early in the trip, the start of a 7 week journey. We decided to head to hollywood however found it to be run down and very dirty.Hoping to see something exciting, we paid the expensive entry fee for this venue only to find it boring, small and quite run down.We took 4 children with us, however they didn't find this place very interesting at all. The staff were also quite rude and only interested it tking your money and pushing you through.My advice, don't bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruwys-wanderlust
40,Interesting place,There's lot to see and read but it's worth it.Buy a $30 ticket so you can also go to the Hollywood Wax Museum and Guinness World record museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sally155017
50,Museum,Took a really quick trip through. Paid the $30/person which gave entry to the wax museum Ripleys and the Guinness book of records. Better then $20/person at each place. Lots of reading but some cool stuff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vav22
40,Had fun,"My husband and I but really enjoyed ourselves in this museum. Some of the displays were not well labeled so I didn't give it a 5, but definitely good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahC2348JE
40,Interesting and fun!,"I knew Ripley's Odditorium's were unique, but wow! There is so much inside this museum and it has the most diverse range of exhibits I've seen in one building. From portraits of stars made from candy to a section of the Berlin Wall and almost everything in between! This place is sure to have something that appeals to all tastes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkusWilkinson
40,Good Fun!,"This was good fun. Lots of silliness and strange but true facts. The clue is in the title, some of its true and some of its not. There's some really good crazy modern art work. The kinds of things that won't make it into a gallery because they're too popular. Hendrix made out of plectrums - the sort of thing I'd love to have in my house!Lots of interactive stuff and things for the kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/changingworship
30,Not Bad,"We’ve bought the VIP Tour – 3 Museums (Wax, Rippley’s and Guiness). Nice places to visit with kids or when it rains. It took 3 hours to visit the 3 museums. They are pretty close to each other. Interesting but there is more stuff to do i Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryL549
50,Always a Favourite.,"These have always been a favourite of ours around the world when we see them. My kids like them and some of the displays are interactive. We came across this place as we were walking up and down Hollywood Blvd looking at the stars. We were there around 10.30am so it wasn't too busy and we could see the displays easily. All displays were informative with a little bit of info about them all. Lots of hands on ones where you pressed a button and something happens. We were here for nearly 2 hours, more if my children had been older and I could read more. There was a game at the end that was free and part of admission that my kids loved. We have always like this attraction, It was good to get out of the heat for a while. Wasn't too expensive for 1 adult and 2 kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fee70
20,Not worth the money,"I was expecting a bit better quality as I have been to the Ripley's Museum on the Gold Coast of Australia and really enjoyed it, I thought if any Ripley's would be the standout it would be the Hollywood one but alas no. It felt small and in need of an upgrade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centean
40,Nice staff,"Been living in Los Angeles like in forever finally one night we got up and go! Nice exhibits, used groupon when purchasing tickets 😄👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxt44
40,Fun break,I've been here a few times and noticed the exhibits change from time to time. This is a fun place for kids and adults with lots of hands-on exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinehresman
40,Really Interesting!,"This little museum was a fun activity we were able to enjoy for a few hours. There's so much to see and read about. All of it is fun, interesting, and occasionally down right disgusting! It's fun for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshAndy2
50,Great fun!,"We spent a good few hours here as it is very interactive, the kids loved it as much as we did. Excellent staff. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasjv
50,"Very interesting exhibits, nice staff.","There's only so many sidewalk stars you can look at and pictures you can take of the theater. Ripley's museum is incredibly interesting, and its worth getting the 3 passes for Guinness and the Wax Museum. Hopefully you get Taylor at the front entrance, she is really nice and helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5529TUandrewg
40,Fun activity for a few hours,Loved the interactive opportunities and interesting facts. My friend wanted to go and we got a ticket bundle which included this one. I was pleasantly surprised by the museum!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuyazh
40,INTERESTING,If you have some extra time on your hands you should take some time and check this place out. You will walk away with some very interesting facts and some new knowledge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
30,Not Worth a Special Trip,I had some extra time and have always been curious about the Ripley Museums so decided to visit. I'm glad I did't go out of my way to visit as I was disappointed. It's probably something children would enjoy but could be an expensive trip if there are a few of you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NevinA843
30,Filling in time,Bit of seen one you have seen them all.. Actually think the one on the Gold Coast Queensland is better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieFyfe
30,Kids might like it,"We took our grandkids aged 9 to the three linked attractions of which this was one. Typical Ripley's Believe It or Not fare. Too many of the i teractive buttons, etc were broken. I am sure there are better things to do in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellynvb
50,A different Ripley's !,"I love these Ripley's Believe of not museums, I have visited a few of them and each time they are different. This one is another great one. Friendly staff. Clean museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigcop73
30,"Seen one, seen them all","My niece and I stepped in here to kill a little time, and it was interesting but not really any different than any other Ripley museum. My teenage niece did enjoy it, but neither of us really thought it was worth the price of admission. The employees, however, were very friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrigan716
50,So much fun!,I was a little bit adamant to visit Ripleys but I was with people that wanted to go in so I did also.What a treat of a place and so glad I checked it out! I can definitely recommend it the exhibits are fantastic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aymeh
30,Nothing much,Went to Ripley's on Hollywood boulevard . We were very excited to see what to find in there . We were not very impressed . It's also very small .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1STEP4WARD
40,"Interesting thing to see, fun place","Fascinating stuff, lots of interesting displays and information as usual with Ripley Museums. Opens late, too. Kept our teenage children interested. A bit busy in places but hard to criticise that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer64Uk
40,"Interesting, informative place for all ages","Very interesting place and exhibits. Ripley sure did have an interesting life collecting oddities from around the world and this attraction exhibits some of them. A lot of the exhibits require some reading, but there are also some interactive ones. Enjoyed the last special effects room where you danced and it was projected on to a screen- very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8866VKjuliem
40,Fun for the family,Our family had a great time here. We've got two little ones and everyone had fun. They've got online coupon codes which really helps bring down the price and kids 0-4 are free. You don't even need to print your tickets out since you can scan the barcode when entering the musuem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emrlddrgn7
50,Awesome for the price,"Mt son absolutely loved this place and if you get a map anywhere, there are discounts to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heathernelson445
40,Preteen and teen boys loved it,"I was pleasantly surprised with this Ripleys. I have a childhood memory of visiting a Ripleys in the 80s that was not good. Even with that in my head, I agreed with my children to go. We purchased the VIP package (gets you into Ripleys, Wax Museum and World Record museum) and I thought Ripleys was the best one. If I ever return to LA, I would consider returning to Ripleys, but not the other two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyM291
30,A decent 30 minutes,"My wife and I had just finished a tour of LA and were on Hollywood Blvd. and she wanted to see Ripley’s Believe It or Not. I didn’t particularly want to but she wanted to. We inquired about the ticket prices and found out you can enter and get 2 other very nearby attractions for 30 dollars each. I figured that wasn’t too bad of a deal. It wasn’t. If it was 30 dollars each just for Ripley’s, I would’ve said no for sure.We went in and took some pics and even though it wasn’t the best thing to do in LA, it was interesting and we found ourselves enjoying the oddities. It was a rather interesting 30 minutes and I’m glad we went. If we had kids though, I don’t think they would’ve liked it at all because there is a lot of reading. If I had a ten year old, I would have made him read all the signs, lol. (I am a teacher)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
40,Very Interesting But Small,"We took our 10 1/2 and 7 1/2 year old grandsons and had a great time. The guy working in the front was very, very nice and friendly. He encouraged people to come in and take photos and look around. The kids found the museum fascinating. We spent about an hour or so in there and could have spent more if we looked at everything and read the descriptions closely. A favorite part was an area with music where you could see a delay of your shadow. The museum is fairly small but there are many odd and interesting items to see. The only negative we have is that the area of Hollywood seemed seedy. Go during daylight hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AreWeHavingFunYet
50,Loved it!,"I went there and even before we walked in the manager was out talking to us, and being friendly. They were so nice and welcoming and really made it a great experience. After going inside, we saw so many neat things. It was definitely worth going because it puts some of these people, creations, artifacts, etc. into perspective and it can be very humbling. We continued to walk through when we saw another crew member who stopped when they saw us and started telling us some extra tid bits of information about the paintings and such that we wouldn't have known otherwise. My favorite part was a room where music was playing and you could see the color changing around you on a screen, me and my friend danced in there for a good solid 30 minutes alone, and a crew member even came in and danced with us. They were so welcoming and upbeat and just made it such an enjoyable experience I would not give a second thought to going again. A definite A+ in my book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twilco
40,Take the 15 minute tour,"It was nice to get out of the heat and walk around this fun ""museum"". It is quirky and my daughter loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluegrassmom3
40,Interesting for 5yo,"We learned some things and that made it fun. There is something interesting for everyone. On the bottom floor as you walk into the exhibit, by the one-eyed lamb is a place for children to crawl in and stand up to be an exhibit, too. I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would. It was great to go in the middle of the heat of the day. We spent an hour, but it could be done more quickly like in a half hour. There is enough to spend 2 hours but only if you are the type to read every sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaMichaelTaylor
40,8 out of 10,"I visited Ripley's a while back, forgot to review. I don't think that it was really amazing, but definitely interesting. Kind of like and 8 out of 10. Basically, it's enjoyable, just don't expect to come out of there saying ""WOW"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMaik
40,Oddly surprised,I really wasn't too keen on going in as this was not on my top things to do list however once inside I was surprised at how interesting weird things could be. Hopefully one day when we come back with the grandchildren we can take them here as I am sure they will enjoy it as much as we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921LauraK
50,SICK! (Awesome!),"Had an awesome time. FINALLY a creepy odd unique interesting bizarre fun way to entertain the kids. I'm in my late 30's - I took my hard to impress teenage son (14), and my little girl (7). it's nearly impossible to entertain/please the both of them at the same time (they don't get along - as most of you can relate) - but on this day it was totally chill- no fighting. Finding something this original and unique that would impress the both of them was a miracle. For 27.99 we got the combo tickets for Ripley's, Hollywood Wax, and Guinness book museums (child's ticket cheaper- but I can't remember how much). This was a great deal and well worth it. I thought maybe we would spend about 20 minutes in Ripley's - but we ended up spending about 2 hours- so much to see, read about, and lots of hands on activities. They really did an awesome job with displaying everything that would capture/draw In a very young child to an adult. I can't count how many times we were creeped out by all the bizzare displays. How many games we played. The numerous amount of interactive displays kept my daughter so crazy busy (finally, a museum -of the sort - she can actually touch stuff in and not get yelled at every second). Some stuff she didn't want anything to do with (because she was really grossed out- but that never stopped her from peeking) , but the whole time she was so excited ""mommy look!!!"" Or "" IS THAT REAL!?!?!""My son thought the place was amazing and really interesting - that's a lot coming from a 14 year old who normally says ""it's ok"". We had a great experience At Ripley's. I'll never forget!!' The Guinness book place was ok but mainly it was like walking through the book in a fun house wAy- you have to read tons and tons of wall displays and you just lose interest. There are not many displays or interactive examples to get you or the youngsters intrigued. Not nearly close as exciting as Ripley's. The wax museum is cool if you like taking fun pics and selfies - you can blend in with the wax modeled movie stars, pose with them, and just have fun taking photos and sending them to people who might really think your hanging out with Justin Bieber or Tyler swift. It's just fun and my kids got a big kick out of it as they LOVE taking pics. Especially my daughter who suddenly becomes a supermodel, when you take her pic. But really the main attraction was Ripley's - DONT MISS IT-it's really a wonderful and memorable time!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileenontony
50,Amazing!,"The place is so interesting! Many unique photos, models and attractions. Lots of fun for all ages.And it's open late!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelove365
40,Fun stop,"While walking around the Hollywood area, this is a fun place to stop. We have 2 boys, ages 11 and 16, and they also enjoyed it. There is a lot of interactive displays which we all enjoyed. It only takes about an hour to go through, but it was raining out, so this was a nice break and we actually had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amym904
40,Cool Fun on a hot day!,"Great museum of oddities and facts that the children, and adults enjoyed. Great photo ops and great bonus packages for savings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreathingAloha
30,"Good, worth the money","Very interesting info found here. The interactive features were great. If you're into weird facts and also reading this would be a good move. I got a package deal, $30 for Ripley's, Wax museum & Guinness World Record.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayeshaalexis
20,Tourist Trap,Title says it all. Has a few interesting exhibits but basically a tourist trap. Needs a good dusting from top to bottom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmdmuskegon
50,So many things inside !,"Put aside at least an hour for this, maybe 2...there are so many neat, cool, and historic things in this place that it is hard to breeze right through. Pictures are allowed, in fact there is very little supervision, giving one the feeling of complete freedom to move about at will. The is a perfect place for some of those ""frame-worthy"" photos. Take the plunge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355JohnL355
40,Remembering the TV show bought me here!,"Watched the show 1982-1986 & found the stories presented by Jack Palance very interesting. Great to see so many interesting artefacts, displays & such informative information. A place to get away for a few hours & spend some quiet time remembering past stories, gaining knowledge & seeing the weird & wonderful. You can purchase attractions tickets that cover two or three places for a cheaper price if you have the time to spend in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leannamarie63
40,Really interesting,Spent over an hour at Ripleys. It was so interesting looking at all the things they had there. This is a good place if your wandering around and had enough of shoppingKids really enjoyed all the interesting facts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gooskie
40,A lot of information but a little dated,"This is a great place to obtain knowledge, but it is beginning to look a little worn down. It needs an uplift of new stuff and redo some of the dioramas. It is a great place for kids to learn of amazing people and the things they have accomplished.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doc10261881
30,Good for one time visit !!!,"It is a small museum but got some interesting artifacts , but the two things my kids enjoyed the most are the shadow wall where we can create shadows for our poses and the other one kind of projected our shadow on a screen and made some fun things on the display ... Am not sure what it is called exactly .except for these we didn't spend much time anywhere else .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sruj
20,Not worth the time if your on holiday,"Real waste of half an hour if I'm honest. Old and very tired with nothing really of much interest. It was on a $30 deal including the waxworks opposite and the Guinness book of records attraction.......also rubbish. Keep your money , we all thought it hey were rubbish!Sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hubz72
50,Fun,"We bought a ticket from the wax museum which provided entry to this venue and I'm glad we did this. It was really interesting, a lot to look at and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tallulahfallulah
40,I couldn't believe it!,Was impressed with the amount of facts and artefacts contained in a small place! We bought a three in one boucher..Guinness book of records and wax museum for $30 which was good value!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769lesleyw
10,complete waste of money,"he ripley's is a complete waste of money and time, full of ""oddities"" from the 1930s collected by Ripley, that don't even look odd anymore. a ripoff, don't go near it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60ofirz
40,Enjoyed Our Visit,We visit mainly because our daughters were curious about Ripley's.Although to be fair most of the items are the same in all of their locations. But worth checking out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
50,Fun and exciting,My daughter wanted to go here so we did I'm not gonna lie i really enjoyed it to lots of interesting and informative stuff to learn in there i had a great time lots of stuff to do in there too worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
30,Average museum but time well spent,"It was our first time at the RIpley's museum and we didn't really know what to expect. Lots of photo opps and read on history of items they have the museum. They also have mini activities to do around the museum which is great fun, especially for kids. Note there is an activity on folding your tongue, which is filmed. You can watch yourself later in the museum. Tonnes of laugh.Purchased the ticket as part of a VIP package for 3 museums. If you can grab hold of a LA brochure, it is likely there is also a discount code when you purchase the VIP package.Overall, an average museum but we recokn it was time well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikeSweet
20,"Tired, but maybe 2.5 stars","Part of VIP pack with Guinness World Record Museum and Hollywood Wax Museum. It was okay but there really wasn't very many actual oddities, mostly it was pictures or models and descriptions. More than half could easily be just as effectively presented on a web site. There were some non-functioning exhibits. We felt it was better than Guinness' but worse than Hollywood Wax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
50,Family fun,We really enjoyed the displays at Ripley's. We always see and discover something new. The kids learn and see something new each time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261LBTW
50,"Quirky, Weird But Interesting & Fun!","My kids and I found the museum interesting and fun. It's weird enough to keep kids' attention. Easy to navigate and very visual vs. boring museum. Combination of facts about Ripley's fascinating life and pop culture items. The artwork made out of weird things was the best (stamps, candy, duct tape, for example)! Fun and affordable day outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happymallqueen
40,Fun!,There was so many fun and interesting things to see. We really enjoyed it. Around every corner is something new. Recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693katiew
30,For the price I found it disappointing..,"There were some interesting displays, but our group found that for the price $17/person, it was over priced. We all walked out and looked at each other wondering ""is that it?"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheScriber
40,Always something different!,"My daughter finds this fascinating, so in we go! Always a bit different in each place, interesting in a creepy way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAdelaide
40,Freaky but interesting,A little weird but that's what you expect when you go there. Scared me from the jump but it wS fun to see a lot of the stuff inside. Definitely didn't disappoint. The stuff at the front were hilarious...made it a great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sando93
50,We loved Ripleys,"Ripley's was a museum with a bit of a difference... so many ""odd"" items... and interactive screens.. extremely wheelchair friendly.. we loved the psychadelic screen at the end of the visit.. recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181AndrewH
30,Same same Ripleys,It's alway great to go to one Ripleys but they are a lot the same. If your interested in this stuff then it's great to go. Or if you are traveling with kids. We enjoyed it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323
40,Great way to spend a few hours,We got tickets for $1 in the black friday sales - so I wasn't really thinking about value for money when we visited.I personally loved the museum. I thought there was lots of interesting things to read and look at. My partner is a bit of a big kid and likes hands on things to keep him entertained. He really enjoyed the museum.Heads up if you want to have a Marilyn Monroe skirt photo - wear a skirt you will have an opportunity :). Also even if you don't need to use the toilet - still go in its lots of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug2692
40,Good for kids,If you have kids I think this is better than Guiness book of world records. Has more activities and hands on things to do. Kids loved it. For sure thing to go into of the things we visited In hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffsY122LR
20,Not so much fun,"Super tacky and if your kids are over 10 years old, it's a waste. Weird stuff. We should have realized when the staff didn't seem to care if we purchased tickets or not. It seemed to be a brick and mortor freak show. Really not worth the time or money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29charliee
40,If looking to spend sometime entertained...,This is a good place to visit if you looking to spend some time entertain while in California. Here you will see hilarious things. You can expend good 4 hours of your trip. Kids will enjoy the visit. Is not to different to others this kind musseums. I recomend the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelerPRUSA
30,Good,Loved it whenever it was interactive but you had read a lot. It has lots of interesting stuff.If it's someting fun to do while hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferf860
40,Fun!!,"We visited RBION during our 24 hour stop over in LA. It was a fun way to kill some time and as we were first through the door around 10:30am (opening times aren't as punctual as the website suggests) we had the place to ourselves.The rest rooms were clean and pleasant - which is always a relief!The exhibits were cool and entertaining, i particularly enjoyed the Marilyn Monroe room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIANOTKYA
30,"Not a must do, but it's something different.",I was expecting more out of this museum. It has some interesting things to see but not worth going out of your way to see. There is a lot of marylin monroe stuff there which is really cool for any marlyin fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmalee92
40,Wasn't expecting much but quite interesting.,"Definitely worth a look if you are interested in odd things. Has some very cool things to look at, and the kids will love some of the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525shanec
50,"Best Weird & Strange Collection in LA, and That Says a Lot!","While not as large as many of the other Ripley's, this location, right on Hollywood Blvd., offers just as good of an experience as any of the other, larger attractions. They have a shrunken head, torture and humiliation devices, creatures with too many legs and heads, and other weirdness that one comes to expect in such a place. PLUS, being in Hollywood, they have added many West Coast and Hollywood Believe it or Nots that you won't find anywhere else. Great place to visit, and it's just down the street from the best Guinness World Records attraction in the country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casaflamingo
30,Too short,"It was cool, but the Ripley's in NYC is much longer and bigger, but it as a small price. You get what you pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yahtsy
40,very interesting,me and my partner love this place visited the last twice we have been to L.A and found the second time a lot had changed well worth a second visit if its been a while or for a first time lost of interesting weird ad wonderful things to see or do x,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamahoglet
50,Incredibly Interesting and Fun!,"Most interactive museum I've ever experienced, and most fun. Full of fascinating displays complete with explanations (like a short video on how shrunken heads were made). Lots of amazing things you'll never see anywhere else, with several jokes along the way ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traventurz
40,Fun Intriguiing Museum,"It is always fun to go to Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. The one in Hollywood is close to the Hollywood and Highland area, which is also a good place to park, as the underground garage is huge.The different exhibits are interesting to read about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Amazing with a few surprises!,"It is always interesting to find out new facts about people and things, however it is also interactive. There were a few fun surprises that you didn't know about until later. Very good for kids and adults alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awesomeast
10,Total Disappointment,"Took the wife there on our vacation; she'd been really wanting to go. Big mistake. Parking was easy to find, that's about the only good part. When we went to get our tickets the guy at the front desk was hassling us about buying a package deal (which included Ripley's, Hollywood Wax Museum, and some other place I can't remember). After telling him we weren't interested he kept pushing it on us; we almost left because of that. Inside the museum was a sore letdown, nothing fascinating like they promised. The Ripley's museum in Newport, Or was better than this location. Gift shop? Forget it, just a little corner with average tourist junk; almost nothing Ripley's related. We left feeling cheated having to fight traffic to deal with the lunacy that is Hollywood Blvd. Guaranteed never to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snowcats95
30,surprise and some fun!,"Included in an Holllywood Bvd Museum package, the Ripley is some fun about famous people, but the space is not very big and the discovery few... If you have 3 hours to spend make all the visit of Wax,Ripleys and Guinness in an afternoon, at a reduce price!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanPierreB722
30,Cheesy and Schmaltzy-Just What You'd Expect,"As a kid, I loved Ripley's. They ran a single-frame in the weekly comics, and for some reason, my parents had some of the Ripley books. The museum was just as cheesy and schmaltzy as I remember the books and articles. Met my expectations--but expensive ($17 admission).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jblewis
10,Really disappointed. Did not live up to the museum quality of Los Angeles,Save your money. It mostly has pictures and posters on the walls with information on it. A couple of statues and small displays. I went through the whole thing in 15 minutes. I should have just stuck to reading the believe it or not books.Los Angeles is such a great place for museums and galleries this is not one of them. I would pass on this and visit the other attractions on Hollywood blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
50,needed more time!,I could have spent an entire day here. I got discounted entry because i ate a bug for a special show they had there that day. Best thing in hollywood! Convenient location and near many attractions in the area. Lots to see and picture taking opportunities. Don't rush through it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildwestbunch
30,Good family time,My wife and son had a blast here. It was ok for me but glad they had a good time. Here is a tip buy the three attraction package,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodgerfan721
50,Great Stop,Our children are not thrilled with museums. They were very excited and engaged going through this. Great way to spend a couple of hours. One can't really read everything...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elladah
20,SUCH a disappointment!,"I love funky and weird things, I was so excited to visit Ripley's.. boy, was I disappointed! I won't waste your time here, there is just soooo many other things to do in the LA area! Everything here was worn down and outdated. I left like I was in a thrift store!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaAnn1091
40,Very Cool,"This is the first Ripley's we went to. We didn't plan to go, just stopped in while walking the ""Walk of Fame."" It was a quick, interesting museum with every inch covered in something new and cool. My son loved the shadow wall and dancing wall. I loved the Marilyn Monroe section. Not too much in the gift shop, but we were able to pick up some souvenirs. I am giving it 4 stars because it got very crowded very quickly. The staff, however, were very nice and great people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636allisonk
40,Enjoyed,"I have done the museum in Myrtle Beach, SC, so this one was not new and different and had many of the same exhibits. However, my daughters, who had never been to one thoroughly enjoyed it. Fun exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amymc001
50,Interesting,"Really fun interactive and interesting museum for all ages.Loved the Marilyn Monroe section it was probably my favourite.The music section was great so much interesting and different bits and pieces.It was a good way to spend an hour or so off the streets away from the hustle bustle and heat of the Hollywood streets.There are some fun surprises and interactive sections, amusing for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayBan__x
50,Fun Museum for Hollywood Visitors,"Museum its self was wonderful fun, we had a blast walking around and seeing everything. Parking was scary and expensive. People are approaching you on the street left and right it was very uncomfortable. Homeless people everywhere asking for money right outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cindylou84118
30,Only average.,"We found a groupon for four at $32 total (vs. $68 regular), and really that was about what it was forth. It was fine, but not enthralling. It'll kill an hour or so, but in my opinion it's not a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearing_boxer
30,Not a bad way to kill time,"I was with my boys on vacation and they wanted to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the sites in the area. As it's REALLY crowded, they welcomed the idea of sneaking into some of the ""museums"" to kill time (we were headed to a baseball game later that day).I read some posts about Ripley's and the 3 pack (Ripley's, Guinness Book of World Records, and the Hollywood Wax Museum) and they are pretty much right on. It's cheap enough that it's worth doing the three. However, Ripley's is by far the most enjoyable and where we spent the most time. The other two weren't bad, but the kids weren't as excited (nor was I). I wouldn't go out of my way to hit these, but if you just want to get off the street and do something to spend some time, it's a good deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottg958
50,Best of the bunch,"While we were incredibly disappointed by the Wax Museum and Guinness book of records, our VIP ticket was redeemed upon setting foot here. There were lots of interactive displays that kept us amused and laughing throughout. There is even a twist at the end that had us laughing for ages, and I'm sure everyone will love amusing themselves with the dance machine. Great for all ages and a great indoor activity :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshH1611
40,Good way to pass an hour or two,We stopped at the Ripleys museum as we had a couple of hours to pass before another engagement. As we were in other Ripley's museums in London and Las Vegas we still enjoyed our trip around this wacky museum and it had some unique items that weren't in the other ones. Reasonably priced and it was very quiet so we practically had the museum to ourselves. Would recommend stopping by if on Hollywood Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darren1702
50,A Great Way to Spend a Few Hours!,"We got the VIP pass that gave us access to the Guinness Museum, the Wax Museum and Ripley's, and Ripley's was definitely the highlight for us! Immediately when we walked in we were treated to a handful of interactive displays. This museum was a nice surprise for us, it is much bigger than it looks on the outside and you can easily spend a few hours here if you take them time to look at all of the displays. Some of the displays have a few surprises in store for you, so make sure you try out all of the interactive ones!Ripley's is what made the VIP pass worth it for us! Definitely recommend to a family visiting Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96
50,"Very enjoyable,weird and fun","While on the famous Hollywood walk of fame, you meet with the museum (its on the main avenue so its easy to find), we decided to enter and its a very cool and freaky experience, you will have fun even if you are an adult or a small kid, it has very cool exhibitions and also you can interact in some places. Worth the price and its not very much time consuming. The gift shop is very cheap so you can have a lot of souvenirs of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrPaulagrace
50,Very interactive museum,We had an hour to burn in Hollywood and decided to check this museum out. We did not regret it. It offers a lot of interactive exhibits which is fun for all ages. The museum is a lot bigger than it looks like from the outside. If you are in Hollywood I would suggest putting this on your agenda.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370ryano
40,Enjoyable,"A good way to spend an hour when visiting Hollywood. We have visited others and thought maybe this the least spectacular, as this didn't have a lot of ""believe it or not"" but just things that had happened, for example a wall of newspaper articles of stars who had died and another exhibit of Marilyn Monroe's last clothes worn. Buy on line before to get a discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gksd
50,something for everyone,"We enjoyed this museum. It is not just about Hollywood although there is a fair amount that relates to the rich and famous. There are so many odd and peculiar things to look at. Makes a nice change when you are feeling all ""Hollywooded"" out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pennypickle
50,One of the best Ripleys,"A great collection of unusual artifacts from around the world, and loved that it included many from the Hollywood scene, such as memorabilia from movie stars, etc - made it a lot more relevant and unique compared to the other Ripleys around the world. All the interactive exhibits were working and there was a lot of content, easily filling an hour or 2. Highly recommended, even moreso considering some of the other similar venues in the immediate vicinity were rather lacklustre. Definitely check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wattostudios
40,Fun for tweens too!,"Spent a weekend in L.A. While there with my son and is tween friend, we decided to head into the Ripley's Believe It or Not. Originally, I thought, ""oh this will be just like the one in S.F., it was not. We all enjoyed reading all the information and watching the videos. The pictures were great too. We spent about an hour and a half inside. O.K., a couple of things where ""cheesy"", but when picky tweens tell you they enjoyed something that says a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwm50
30,"OK, but could use a lot more","I remember growing up on the East Coast over the summers and spending plenty of time at the shore. We'd beg to go to Ripley's, and we would end up ducking in during a rain storm or something of that nature. Fast forward 30 years, and we took my daughter and her best friend. Nice place, but pricey for stuff that can be found on the Internet these days. Best parts were the photo-sensitive room where a flash lets kids pose their shadows, and at the very end, a musical room with a slow motion/rainbow effect as guests pass by. There's plenty in Hollywood that is free or low cost, and if you need to extend the trip, 45 minutes here will be more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
30,"Expected more ""odd""","My daughter loves the odd stuff and really wanted to stop here, so we did. We spent about an hour touring the exhibits. Lots of interactive and interesting exhibits, but we wanted more of the weird and wild, so it was a bit disappointing. Clean and well maintained, the place is bright and sucks you in from the street. Pricey for what you see and how long you spend there, wouldn't do it again, we can just check out the book!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dme3
40,A laugh...why not?,"The funniest thing about this museum is look at the surprised faces of the other visitors. Overall the museum, although a bit expensive, it is really cute.There are many illusions you can interact with, torture device exhibitions, a small room playing video's of odd event's, a robotic replica of the tallest man in the world, actual shrunken heads, and replicas of the ugliest, fattest, skinniest, people in the world.There also is a section of animals: two-headed Cows, Two-trunked Elephant, etc, like Evolution fails. There are many artistic masterpieces: Jimi Hendrix made of guitar picks, Marilyn Monroe made of candy, etc, and an impressive city featured in the Lord of the Rings made of matchsticks. There is a very artistic interactive gallery, in which you have to move yourself and...see. Even the toilets are strange!You will exit with a big big big laugh",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GdN80100
30,Expensive for what it is,Popped in whilst my girlfriend and I were walking down Hollywood and we both left a little disappointed.The museum is a fun 45 minutes or so but very expensive for what it is. Unless you are desperate to see it I would suggest only going if you can find a deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglishDragon
40,It was good.. but you expect better,"I have never been on a Ripley's Museum, but I LOVE watching the show, to I actually was expecting a lot more. It is ok to pass on the day.. your little ones will get a little bored though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592melissar
20,Not Much really,after seeing Madame Tussaud on the Hollywood boulevard we got into Ripley s believe it or not museum as we had bought a combo ticket including both the attractions. in my opinion you are better off buying just the attraction ticket you want to visit as I did not find anything else worth seeing here except the Tallest Man in the World. had fun pics with the figure of Mr. Wadlow standing at 8ft 11 inch. for the price it is an expensive attraction and could be skipped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharnjit_Sondh
30,"It was Ok, I expected more","For the price we paid, 2 adults and 2 teens we expected some really cool things here. But it was mostly facts and reading. There were some interesting things like the tallest man and weird creatures but nothing extraordinary that we haven't seen. We paid 52 bucks and I think it was a waste of money. Probably the Hollywood tour would have been better. It is good to see once but not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolitap2013
40,See as part of three pack,"The museum was available to see in a package with two other museums, for the price it made more sense to get this, although this is the best one the wax museum and guiness book of records museums are worth a short look at and the staff did not bother us to buy anything. I have also visited the Queensland one last year and had mostly the same base items but catered for the specific area so it is still worth a look if you have been to one elsewhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenE171
40,fun,It was fun took lots great pics. The parking was a nightmare and there was a mixup with tickets but we enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graycelouise123
50,"Exceeded expectations, best museum on Hollywood Blvd","Went in here not expecting much but found a bunch of really entertaining stuff inside. My whole family (3 kids middle and elementary school aged+ wife) enjoyed the interactive exhibits both strange and funny. Son enjoyed time lapse movie of things blowing up, while girls danced creating a light show. Several brain teasers and some really strange things made out of fingernails. Much better than wax museum or Guiness world record museum (which frankly was dated and terrible) in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryinH-town
50,Great,"It doesn't take very long to get through, but it's worth going in. If you can, take advantage of the ""Hollywood Icons"" package, where you get into Ripley's, Guinness World Records & Madame Tussaud's for the price of only two of them, works out way more affordable that way & fills your day up a little more. However, I do believe for the most part it's a ""once you've seen it, you don't need to again"" type of thing. They encourage photos, which is something most museums don't these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bek91
40,This museum was ok,"We went to this museum and of course there were lots of exhibits. At the time we were there, the elevator wasn't working, so my family member had a hard time getting to the different levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
30,Interesting!,"It doesn't take long to get through this Ripley's Museum, probably an hour at most. It is full of weird and interesting things. I think kids would love it, but make sure you scope out some coupons as the entry fee undiscounted is a little bit pricey for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok
40,Believe it or not,"This museum was well set out with a lot of interesting displays. If you have time, it is good to see and it it close to Madame Toussards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelleyD588
40,It was a cool place to visit,"I'm a bit of a sucker for anything that yells ""Tourist Trap"", so walking in LA this caught my attention. Prices are about average for such a walk through setting Overall, it was very clean, kept up & great lighting. I enjoyed seeing past clippings from comic sections which I used to jump to first as a kid. I doubt I would come a second time, however if you have never been to Ripley's I would check it out, great as a family spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunerW
50,Surprisingly Entertaining!,"My children (11 yo girl / 9 yo boy) and I stopped by Hollywood Blvd on a drive out of LA this past weekend. We spotted Ripleys and decided to check it out. I am an LA native so paying tourist prices isnt an option for me! At under 40 bucks for admission for myself and my 2 kids along with a souvenir book, i thought it was pretty reasonable.The kids and I had a blast. There was something new and interesting around every corner and in every room. There were lots of interactive exhibits that the kids could actually touch and play with. Plenty of Picture opportunities!! We spent 2 hours there and probably could have spent another 2 there!I would definately recommend Ripleys to my friends and family. Totally worth the $$$. Awesome time!!!At the exit theres a little souvenir shop with things for sale, also with reasonable prices.*** PS im not sure if she was the Manager but there was a young lady there with glasses that helped us going in and coming out and she was real nice, pleasant, and great with answering kids questions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayE669
40,Typical museum,"If you've seen one, you've seen ths one, but it's reasonably priced and fun for kids. Brought back memories of the Sunday Comics when Ripleys always had a section. Many of those were here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dvyoral
40,alot to entertain and view!,"There was a lot to enjoy in the museum from record breakers and strange things to really neat artistic creations such as an entire village of lord of the rings made from matchsticks! They also had mosaics made out of stamps that were pictures of Liz Taylor, another picture made from pins that was Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt! There was a lovely picture of Tom Seleck from crayons that looked amazing and the tallest man known to have existed! Quite a lot to view they even had some of Marilyn Monroe' s items that were on display from a collection. The price was reasonable and we got into another museum as a two for one choice of tickets. Ask for they're variety packages with other venues and you might enjoy even more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyasm
40,Fun and Quirky,"I really enjoyed the Odditorium when I visited it with my boyfriend last August. We spent about an hour poking around and taking pictures. They really do have some strange things, including a section of animals, like a two headed calf. They have the real deal animals that have been preserved through taxidermy after their deaths from natural causes.The museum also houses artifacts from many cultures with videos and info plaques explaining the cultural practices. I actually felt like this museum had a bit of educational opportunities, along with the gawking and shock value.I wouldn't say that this is a must do on a family vacation to Southern California, but if you're a local or have time to kill in the area, it's worth checking out.Please check out my blog for loads of pictures from all three hollywood museums, including that two-headed calf and other animal abnormalities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
40,"Best of the 3 - Wax, Guinness, Ripley's","We had a good time here with a 50% off google offer. Not worth the full price but there are always discounts available. Some very fun interactive exhibits with your shadow and a psychedelic dancing room. We were surprised by the amount of art work out of interesting things like rubix cubes, candy, bbs, etc. Star Wars room was cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrkingcool
30,Some parts more interesting than others,"Parts of this eclectic exhibition are quite interesting, such as the Star Wars figures made out of scrap metal, a matchstick scene from the Lord of the Rings, the part on the world's tallest (and the shortest) man, and the vampire kit. I found some of the other parts not as interesting, however, but the presentations were all right most of the time and I felt I learnt a bit. I left Ripley's feeling that I wasn't disappointed, but I. wasn't overly excited, either. Ripley's is all right for the money they charge but far from being the best attraction in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496timd
40,I love Ripley's! Really cool museum..,"Ripley's is a cool museum. we bought a VIP combo pass to Ripleys's, the hollywood wax museum. and to the Guinness Records museum which were all right next to each other!! we were able to do three things all in one general locations and see some stars from the walk of fame!! interestin stuff to see at all three!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvsteph09
40,Very eclectic fun!,"What a crazy little place! From the dinosaur coming out of the roof, you know what to expect.All kinds of weird and whacky bits and bobs to see here, with many interactive parts to enjoy. Having visited other Ripleys Museums, they are quite similar, but with enough differences to make me want to visit each one.Look out for the discounted tickets which get you access to this and several other places on Hollywood Blvd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
50,"""Better believe it!""",This museum was amazing with a lot of history and facts from around the world. I deeply recommend this place we got a good deal for coming here that on our next visit we want to come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iglesias12
40,Fun!,My kids loved it. We all had a good time. And completely on a different topic-- probably the cleanest bathroom in LA! LOL! I'd say it's a great place to take inquisitive children in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaH909
30,Just Ok,i went there becaue i like the tv episode...however some pieces are just shown without much information(no year or location).....expected to have some real photos but just fake models ....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennyViperW
50,Definitely worth a visit,"Having never been to a Ripley's museum, I was absolutely fascinated. I could have spent more time there but as I was with others I didn't get to really check things out properly. Lots and lots of interesting stuff. I will go again when I can spend more time oohhing and aaahhhhing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivnoname
20,Boring,I hate when I have to stand and read crap. And thats all this place is. Very disappointing and down right boring. Just not my thing I guess.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/03nismochick
30,"Not bad, not good!","I've been to other Ripley's, and this one was just mediocre. There were lots of oddities like pictures made of airsoft bullets and candy, but not a lot of other ""gross"" stuff (which my 13 year old was looking for)! It is entertaining, but I wouldn't say it is a ""must-see"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithA910
50,Cool place for the kids,This is the one place my 12 y/o wanted to go. Kids loved it! A bit crowded but for the kids it was worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texashoneypie
30,Boring,"I found Ripleys to be rather boring. It did not take long to see everything and leave. I was a little dissapointed, but it was not expensive so was probably reflective of the price. Staff are rude, but so is everyone in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbuddy_1987
40,Family fun,"Interesting place! I watched this show religiously as a kid and have been to a few of these museums but not the LA one til yesterday. Some of the reviews had me worried it wasn't going to be worth the time but I decided to try anyway. I bought a 3 museum combo pass (Ripley's, Guinness World Record and Wax Museum) and was happy I did. My son (he's 11) liked Ripley's the best, as did I. A lot of neat oddities, and much bigger than I anticipated. It doesn't take a whole lot of time to go thru but if you invest in the 3 museum package you can spend a good couple hours doing fun, tacky touristy stuff at a reasonable price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueDahl
50,had u been watched ripleys?,"if you like ripleys, here the place you can see their documentation of that show.. you will like it... so dont missed it..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazinggirls
20,do not waste your money,"all of the ""oddities"" had to do with Hollywood, so most of the stuff was not ""odd"" at all. Pictures made from Skittles is not weird. Saw one in San Fran that was much better. Also very hot inside, Couldn't wait to get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mesagirl30
20,Touristy,"My daughter loves these kinds of places and talked me into spending the $17.00 a piece to go in. The museum is located in the center of Hollywood and is a tourist trap.I had to laugh that when I walked up to pay the young lady at the counter was chatting with a friends and would not look at me or help me until she was done with her conversation. There was not any ""thank-you"" or smile. She seemed bored and more interested in her friend.The museum is small. There are a handful of things that are interesting. It is hardly worth the $17.00 to see a stuffed two headed calf or a picture of Michael Jackson made out of candy.Some of the things were broken. They had an area that would take your image and put your silhouette on the wall. It was not working. The museum was almost empty except for two groups of foreign tourists.The museum was okay for a quick visit if the price was more fair. $17.00 per person is just a rip off and is set up to part tourists in Hollywood with their moeny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sfphotocraft
20,quite expensive and boring,"if you buy single adult ticket is quite expensive but if you buy combo with other museum maybe good deal even you really don't like others. Most of the things inside is just puzzle pictures of an actor or actress. some you can interact with, overall the museum is not really big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RnWSydney
30,Better Than I Expected,"Lots of weird things to see, some interactive themes were fun even for my teenagers, much cleaner and organized than I expected. Not sure of I would go again but glad I did this trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/325robink
20,Maybe for families...,Decided on a whim to get the two-for one pass into Ripley's and Guiness on Hollywood Blvd one night. It was okay... just didn't really grab us. Venue was in a lot better condition than Guinesss. It would be a really good venue for families to go to from an educational point of view. It just wasn't for a 20-something couple. sorry!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmania
40,Weird and wonderful,"I thought my husband would like this, but to my surprise so did I. We spent a couple of hours looking at strange exhibits from all over the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueV869
40,You won't believe some of it!,"If you enjoy the quirky things in life, you'll love this. Plenty to see for all tastes, great family tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Bren_248
50,"Fun, fun, fun",Come and support this old time entertainment.You can see fascinating things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrunsM
20,Can't belive what i saw,All display were totally under my expectation. Poor in quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimBudi
30,Just ok..,The kids (9 and 12) wanted to go.. it was approx $60 for the 4 of us.. It was ok.. some interesting exhibits and activities.. . spent about an hour there.The kids liked it..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyTash
40,Kinda Fun,They just opened the day before we went and it was pretty cool. The kids really liked it. There is plenty to see and a few things they let you touch. For the cost I would say go for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollytravels1
30,Meh - not really worth it,The same exhibits you see at any other Ripley's. Nothing too exciting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AG162
40,The Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum Is awesome:).,"Definately an awesome attraction for the entire family:). Well everything is interesting and staff is super friendly. However, some exhibits may not be appropriate for younger viewers. The lobby can offer museum combination ticketsso you can see this museum and another at a way cheaper rate. Thanks:).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrisHAnNDecE
