40,A quiet and serene getaway,"A quiet and serene getaway in the middle of a busy urban area. L.A. is full of surprises, but this quiet park is truly one of the hidden gems. Only reachable by car and you have to pay for parking, but the entry is free. The center is beautiful with abundant wildlife (birds, turtles, etc.), 2 lakes and an abundance of trees and hiking paths. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours.If you are in the area and miss nature, this is a must do.",Sam S
50,A real feeling of nature right in town,"We had been in the huge El Dorado Park and thought we'd check out the nature center for a walk. It's great! The trails are easy and scenic going around two small lakes and through a small forest. Though there were plenty of people there, it certainly didn't seem crowded. We even saw a coyote! We will definitely go back.",Barry
50,relaxing trail right near your home,"This is a somewhat unknown treasure in Long Beach. It's kid of tucked away and you could drive right by it and not even know it was there. It's a very relaxing nature trail with various tress, plants, ponds and all kinds of birds. Around 2 miles in lenght, so you can easily walk it,but take your time and enjoy the surroundings!!",Don B
40,When you are looking for that place to escape away to.,The Nature Center is a great spot to visit when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Located in Long Beach you will think that you have left the city but you are actually only 10 mins away from Downtown Long Beach. There is some wildlife like wetland birds which if you pay attention when driving near the center you may notice them flying over the freeways.,gaconner
50,Nature so close to home,"Unless you've been here, who knew this amazing piece of nature is located in Long Beach. The nature center has two miles of paths and a 1/4 path for the handicapped. This is a great time of year to see white heron's, geese, ducks and an occasional cottontail rabbit. The foliage is also changing this time of year, the weather is cooler and you feel transported to another place. As John Muir says, ""Come to the woods, for here is rest."" A great way to start your day, letting nature surround you.",Donna H
50,pleasant walk about in nature,"Nice trails around ponds and through nature. If you enjoy turtles sunning in the pond or seeing an Osprey in the trees, you will enjoy this nature center. There are 1 or 2 mile trail options, or do as much as you like, very versatile.",Mark W

40,Nature Park,"As far as regional parks go, this is a good one. It's definitely a park, in the sense that it's manicured and manufactured, it seems well planned, but it also seems planned. If you're looking for some nature in the city, this might be a good place to go.",Julee H

50,Quiet natural treasure right off the freeway with small natural history museum for kids.,"For a break take the 3 mile walk in the nature center over bridges and near a lake with great bird viewing and the omnipresent turtles sunning themselves. The small visitor center is a delightful place to purchase small nature oriented gifts or view their exhibits, including different kinds of fur displayed in the drawer, icky insects, snakes and other critters in this tiny satellite of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. The displays are just the right size for children, as is the small walk on the concrete pathways or the shorter pathway on the regular trail. Read the naturalist's report on bird sightings and talk to the great volunteers that staff the front desk and trails. During the summer the nature center hosts excellent concerts from country to Calypso.",Kathy Z
40,Suburban wilderness,"El Dorado is an oasis of nature located between the 405 and 605 freeways. A pleasant setting with trails through dense vegetation and away from the maddening crown, except on the weekends. Trails range from 1 to 3 miles, not paved so expect to get a bit dusty. Lakes are filled with turtles and fish; however, if you want to fish you'll have to go to the lakes in the other sections of the park. Lots of native flora and fauna if you keep your eyes open, even an occasional bald eagle. The Nature Center itself is not extensive and provides a low key overview of local habitats. Parking can be a challenge on the weekend. No running or dogs permitted on the trails.",Wandering traveler
50,Can't wait to go back,"I really enjoyed walking here. It's free, just pay for parking. There were lots of turtles on logs, which were fun to look at. On the trail lizards scurried by and there were squirrels too. I liked that there was actual wildlife. It's hard to believe this is in the middle of the city! It's a great escape. I did one of the shorter walks and am hoping to go back sometime soon!",Rosita
40,Couldn’t get a booking on the Catalina Express so: found this alternative,"This is part of a large city park in Long Beach and is unexpected in the city. The Nature Center has a visitor’s center which seems to be (appropriately) geared to children. There are three walking paths, one that is a mile long, one that is two miles long and a quarter mile path that is completely accessible. The first two paths wander around two lakes and a creek as well as woods and grasslands. The third is the same without the lakes. At times I could hear cars, but also there was solitude as well as bird song and small animal chatter. Lots of people were out walking on this fine Saturday afternoon. You’ll especially enjoy the turtles that come out to bask in the sun in the ponds!",Jean U
50,We walk in this park whenever we can.,"This is a little bit of heaven in a busy city, it is a peaceful experience which makesyou feel like you are in the woods in a very secluded area. You can spend hourswatching the turtles or just sitting on a bench and drinking in the peaceful atmosphere.Sometimes there are a lot of people walking so I suggest early evening or earlymorning walks.",deznr4u2
40,Surprising retreat from urban bustle.,"Nestled within El Dorado Park, the Nature Center is a little world unto itself. Surprisingly spacious, with a nice variety of hiking trails (1/4 mile, 1 mile, and 2 miles), a couple of hours spent here is a rejuvenating experience. You will forget that you are in the middle of Southern California's urban sprawl, butted up against one of the region's busiest freeways. The elevation is variable as the trails wind through meadows, shady oak groves, along little brooks and around a couple of lakes, populated by turtles, egrets, herons, and geese. I was there on a work day and the crowds were low, consisting mostly of moms and kids, but the place can get crowded on holidays and weekends. Plan accordingly. This place is a treasure, and a must-visit for any local seeking a respite from the daily grind.",venckman2017
30,Beautiful,"This nature center is very serene and beautiful. It is a very beautiful walk if you're looking for some nice scenery. The biggest downfall is you can't take pictures there, and the staff is pretty strict about it! That s why i do not give it 5 stars.",Megpasos23

NO, only if they had lots of extra time and had seen all the great sights LB has to offer.But for locals it really is a must see!It’s huge, very serene, lots of area for kids and teens to explore.Sometimes you pay for parking, sometimes you don’t. That area has no street parking so you have to park onsite. I’ve taken small children and have gone there with our Boy Scout Troop.They do have different activities and events so plan your visit by researching their calendar online.Across the street you must pay again but there is a big park to walk around in and the dog park.This can be a great relaxing Saturday or Sunday family event. I highly recommend it!",Tatabooboobax
50,Quiet oasis,"Great little nature preserve in the middle of a busy city. Lots of trails to walk and explore. Dirt and paved roads make for easy access. I was there on a Tuesday morning and the parking lot was already full. There is plenty to see, as the water makes it a haven for turtles and birds. Very quiet and serene.

40,El Dorado,"The El Dorado Nature Center offers short non-challenging walks through a wonderful park-like setting. the variety of plants and trees made for an interesting walk. The 1/4 mile route is completely paved, level, and appears wheelchair friendly. The 1 and 2 mile routes have a single set of up-down short switchbacks. This is a busy place as we encountered many walkers on a brisk afternoon walk. A nice reprieve from downtown. Saw turtles and waterfowl in the ponds. Looked forward to seeing squirrels and a little more wildlife but it didn’t happen today.2 knocks ... First, (not the fault of the Nature Center) the Uber ride from the Queen Mary side of Long Beach is expensive for the 7 mile reckoning I made. Second, freeway noise pollution encroaches on the experience. One of the signs asks you to stop and listen to the sounds of nature. Made me sad that I couldn’t hear much besides the drone of background traffic.",Hank H
40,Quiet time,"Great place to bike ride. Have ridden my bike on the river trail and gone to the nature center many times. Sometimes a relative will go with me. When I get tired I sit down near the water and watch the ducks and few fishermen. It is peaceful. Something we need nowadays. Also will bring a little lunch, there are picnic tables to sit at. It is also near the Policemen's fire range.",honesty62

There are different trails, as short as a single mile, to explore and relax in nature. Parking was $7 (Saturday ) and that allows you to park in other areas of El Dorado Park for biking,archery, bbqs and radio controlled airplane flying just to name a few. I’m looking forward to the next opportunity to head to El Dorado park to explore",brawny2016

50,Nature park within the city of Long Beach,We have enjoyed the nature park much more as seniors. We use it for our walking for the day. The trail offers you a mile or two mile loop. The two mile loop takes you around the lake. Birds and squirrels are found. The last year we had Canadian geese staying in the park. They also offer a quarter mile paved loop. We took my mother in law on that loop. They have benches on all trails. The mile and two mile loop have water available. The two mile loop has restrooms. The gift shop has toys and nature items available. Admission is $6 Monday through Friday with weekends $8. We brought an annual pass $29. I paid the daily rate before writing a check for the annual pass after they deducted $6 from the $35 rate. The trail is has uphill and downhill points along with shaded and sunny sections. The trail is well marked at the two mile junction for the longer walk. A hidden gem in the city of Long Beach.,Wes W

Ride your bike over or drive but know if you drive, parking is $6-$8..

50,Relaxing Nature Walk,"This is a special place! We spent a memorable foggy December morning exploring the trails. We arrived when the park opened (8:00-5:00) on a Sunday morning and it was very quiet. The fog put a hush on everything and it seemed like we were in a remote forest even though the park is right next to the San Gabriel Freeway (605).The nature center is part of the larger El Dorado Park, and access to both is off East Spring Street. We parked at the nature center on the south side of Spring and walked at both parks. Parking at the nature center is $5-8 depending on the day of the week and whether it's a holiday.The visitor center is small (8:30-4:00). It offers exhibits about the ecosystem and activities to engage children. A gift shop has t-shirts and souvenirs and restrooms are available. Staff are friendly and can provide a map and answer questions. A covered patio overlooks North Lake.A network of trails winds around the two lakes on the forested 105-acre property, with options for 1/4 mile, one mile or two mile routes. The 1/4 mile trail is paved and suitable for wheelchairs and strollers. It has educational signs about the local environment. The longer trails have a hard-packed dirt surface. They are not considered wheelchair accessible, but we were able to take one on most of the trails with effort and a determined assistant (there are some hills). There are benches for resting, water fountains, and another restroom at the furthest point from the visitor center. We saw squirrels, rabbits, turtles and many birds, including two great egrets. Note that pets and bicycles are not allowed on the nature trails.After we explored the nature center trails, we walked north across Spring Street into El Dorado Park where there are a couple more miles of paved trails and walkways around a series of lakes (plus connection to the San Gabriel River Trail on the west side of the park). This section of the property is more open and developed, with areas of grass and facilities for recreational activities like picnic tables, playgrounds, fitness course, fishing (license required), paddle boats (fee), an archery range and a miniature train ride (fee). Bike rentals are available. This northern portion of the park also charges the $5-8 parking fee and I don't know if one fee covers both area. You may want to inquire at the entrance or consider walking between them like we did. There's no charge for pedestrians and bicyclists. Long Beach Transit route 104 passes the parks on Spring Street.",CrankingChick

In the Spring you can see large white poppies that look like Matilija poppies (maybe they really are Matilija poppies).

There are two distance of the loops you can take, and it was my first time, so of course we tried the 2 miles loop and it was such a relaxing and easy walking while talking with friends, but if you want to make it a workout routine, you can walk fast and do the loop of 3 or miles. We had picnic on the benches by the parking lot after the hiking. There are shades at most of the paths, but it is better to wear a hat and put on sunblock lotion.If you live close by, buy the annual parking pass which is $35 because it costs $7 each time which is a little bit high but worth it for me who lives around 60 miles away.

The new entry really improves the special feature of this regional park area. . Two staff greeted guest at the new entry to the Nature Center when we walked in. I made purchases of books for Easter in the office, and was greeted and helped by a friendly and helpful staff member. We'd rather financially support local efforts to contribute to the wildlife near where we live.",Denise M
50,Bring your Sturdy Walking Shoes and Enjoy!!!,"I always feel wistful when I go to the El Dorado Nature Center because I grew up in nearby El Dorado Park Estates. This has been a favorite ""haunt"" of mine for years, and many times when I brought my own children to visit their grandparents, we would go over and walk and learn and romp and laugh and explore!The nature center is over 100 acres, which is a nice surprise tucked away in a very urban environment! The sounds of birds chirping and watching squirrels and other small wildlife scampering about is great for children and adults alike. Even today, my 87 year old mom is able to take a sedate walk on the paved trail that goes past two lakes without difficulty. It is easy walking, and visually attractive. There are also a couple of miles of unpaved trails, and I particularly enjoy speed-walking through those - it's nice to get in 6 or so miles by doing 3 ""laps.""There are great kids' programs, and I love the tiny-tot preschool classes! What a great way to introduce younger children to the wonders of nature!!!",Alisa G
50,Nature that is easy to get to!,"Great safe hiking! Good for families with small children. You are not out in the wilderness, but it feels like it. Can be crowded, go early. There are turtles, lizards, birds that are easy to spot. Foxes are suppose to live here, but they don't want to see you, so good luck. Great classes thru Long Beach city here too.",candace182015

40,Kids loved it,"We want educational aspects to each trip so we took the kids here for about two hours during our stay in SoCal. It cost $7 per car to enter. Parking is plentiful. We saw birds, turtles, rabbits, geese, blue heron, and other creatures. The gift shop/exhibit had some hands on exhibits that the kids could touch....antlers from deer, elk, and buffalo horn. The exhibit with the birds and their sounds was nice.The walks and the creatures we encountered excited the kids (7 and 4). Its a great family time to teach.",Calbuccaneer

50,Lovely for a walk!,"I love walking through the Nature Center! It is fun to watch the turtles come out from the depths and sun bathe on the floating ramps. You feel as though you are walking in the mountains even though the 605 freeway is very close! There are squirrels, Canadian geese and ducks. I love taking the 2 mile walk, it is so peaceful and relaxing. If you have little ones, probably best to take them to the other side of the park where the boats and train are. Note that it is closed on Mondays, but not the main park across the street. There are three trails, 1/4 mile paved walk, good for wheel chairs and strollers, and a one mile and two miles walk.",Speedcatbeth
50,A Great Escape,"This nature park is a neighborhood gem. It is bordered by a busy freeway and 2 major throughways, but you feel like you are out in the middle of the country when you are on the trails. Currently, the parking situation is in need of improvement as they are rebuilding the entrance to the park, but I walk there from my house, and you could also bike in for free to avoid the parking issue. Take your binoculars for bird watching- lots to see!",MySoCalTeardrop
40,Nice Park (and you can't beat free)!,"I was visiting family and we went to the park to take some pictures.There are tons of ducks, geese and other birds as well as squirrels all over the lake and park.

50,A Nice Surprise,We wanted to expand our knowledge of local activities and made a visit to El Dorado. We did not know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful nature preserve in the middle of long beach. The maturity of the trees and the shade they provided were a welcomed feature as we walked the 2 mile trail. You have the option of a paved 1/4 mile path or a dirt 1 or 2 mile trail. You get to walk along a stream that connects two small lakes. Even more fascinating was the large park to the north of the nature center with additional lakes. Now you cannot eat your picnic lunch in the nature preserve but can eat your lunch in the nearby park. Well worth a visit.,BoboTravlr
50,Did not expect this!,I had lived in Long Beach for more than a decade and it is still quite a treat to come here.

The minutes you park and step onto the path, you feel like the city life is in another world. It is serene, filled with water turtles and other creatures, huge trees and clearings, and well-marked paths. You have the option of a short 2-mile or a longer hike. There is some uphill involved for those with weak knees.",Evelina62
50,GREAT PLACE TO ENJOY NATURE AND TO LEARN,"We love coming here with our granddaughters and walking the short or the long trails. It is very fun and also educational. They have a wonderful hands on museum that is also very well done with displays, living insects and snakes, and other fun things for all who come.

40,Nice afternoon walk,We enjoyed the Nature Center especially since we are not from this area. It was a good example of plant life we have not seen before. Is it always this dry? It appears to be very popular with locals. I guess it is nice to get away for the hectic urban areas.,kagatlin
50,You'll Forget You Are In A City,84 Acre oasis in the middle of suburbia. There 3 trails. One is for those with a handicap or prefer a paved surface. Then there is a one mile trail that branches off about 3/4 of the way into a two mile trail.There are two lakes connected by a meandering stream. (The second lake is only accessible on the two mile hike.) There are several areas with different indigenous plants types so always something different.Great for birdwatching and great exercise.,meinkeb

50,I wish we had a place like this closer to my house,"On our way back to Las Vegas my son asked to stop here. The family grabbed our cameras and decided to take a stroll.As we entered the park we saw a plethora of hummingbirds circling the feeders out in front of the museum/giftshop. I would have been happy just sitting here.Instead we walked inside and the staff was very helpful explaining the lay of the land. The mile area circles a lake with plenty of trees yet the two mile path gets some plains and flower areas along with another pond. If we wanted nature and wildlife do the 2 mile they said.We were not disappointed as we saw several types of squirrels, rabbits and countless types of birds. Even saw two juvenile night herons (or so the staff and a nearby birder pointed out)The trails are well made and do have some points where they rise in elevation in an s like pattern. There were many people on the path that were there exercising and most people were polite when walking by.Humans obviously didn't read the signs about feeding the animals because squirrels would run right up to you expecting hand outs. Great for photographers.We went at opening around 8:30am and I would recommend bringing a bottle of water with you. There are bathrooms at the start of the trail as well as about 1.5 miles into the 2 mile.The place is clean with many scenic views. Sadly some trees have been vandalized as people carved their names into them. But all and all an excellent place to nature watch and get some exercise.",LVgabeg
50,Lovely walk,"I have been here a couple of times both with my husband and with my mom. Both times we all enjoyed the walk. The nice thing is that most of the paths are shaded and it doesn't get too hot at all. You can see turtles, squirrels, and ducks around you which I think is also nice for children. I had no idea such a beautiful walk could exist in the middle of a city. I definitely recommend it.",simho

40,Wonderful Mini-train Ride at the Caboose Corners in El Dorado Park,"Our two-year old grandson, a big fan of Thomas Trains, is visiting from out-of-town. I remembered seeing a little train ride from the Southbound 605 freeway past the Long Beach Town Center exit so I searched Google and found the Caboose Corners listed as part of the Long Beach El Dorado Park attractions; and it's open on weekends. Entry fee to the park was $7 at the gate. The ride itself was a reasonable $3 per passenger (kid or adult). The track was pretty long and the place was clean, open and fun. Because it had rained earlier so the park was not crowded which made it even more enjoyable. My grandson had a great time, We then walked to the lake to feed the ducks. There was also a playground with slides close by (a short car ride within a big park), making it a good, complete outing for an energetic kid. Next time we will pack a lunch and maybe plan a picnic. For us, this Caboose Corners is so much more convenient than having to drive all the way from North OC to Griffith Park to ride the little trains.",LnS2004

We walked around the paved areas for a bit and then entered the nature center as soon as the gates were opened. It was a restful and lovely place with open views of the lake, wooded trails and many twists along the path that make you feel you are discovering something new with each turn. After the two mile trail we drove through the other parts of the park. It was amazing how much area there was. While there we saw a cycling club, R/C airplane club, a few families, people on runs, walks and strolls. It is a place that I will be sure to bring my family to next time we all visit. I thoroughly enjoyed the sights and smells (eucalyptus, pine, etc.) and all the wildlife.",Amy P

The trees arch over the paths creating shade and an atmosphere of being away from the city. It's beautiful and very relaxing. The nature center is fun for kids. I've even done programs there with Scouts and found all then naturalists to be very knowledgeable.",Vala R
50,"great for family, or just to hike one of the trails","been there many times, and the parks dept. do a great job keeping it clean, quiet, and like you're out of the city.you can also ride your bike along the riverbed next to the center....around sunset, your kids will see all kinds of critters making their way down to the water",Booba B
50,Beautiful Oasis,"This beautiful oasis in Long Beach is a great place to go for a walk, to sit and meditate or to bring the kids. It's a calm and peaceful area, far from the noise of the city. Your blood pressure will drop shortly after you enter, just from the beautiful greenery, watching the birds and the turtles, relaxing in nature.",CAKatie
50,"If you want feel like you're away from the busy life you lead, then you need to visit the El Dorado Nature Center!!!","You can't hear the traffic or see the traffic. You can view some wildlife such and many species of birds, turtles, butterflies, etc. This is a great way to ""get away"" from it all. They have three different trails. Two dirt trails and one concrete trail that is perfect for strollers and wheelchairs. They also have a store where you can purchase wildlife items along with a hands on section where the kids can feel different fur and skeletons.",danielallen1969
50,Is this what California Used to look like??,"I loved this and walked around for a couple hours. It was cools seeing all the animals and the lush green of the park. I actually really enjoyed this place. I was a little surprised at how big it seemed and how many great trails they had to walk around. I did the 2 mile loop and the 1 mile loop since I had a bunch of time. I loved seeing all the turtles. Seemed like a place a lot of moms like to take their kids during the day, but very peaceful unless you encounter the few moms in their ""my kid is better than your kid conversations.""",Pixtonian
50,Serenity and Nature in the middle of Busy.,"I love to come to El Dorado Nature Center and go on the 1 & 2 mile walk. Its like walking out of the busy city into your own tropical forest with a hidden lake surrounded by beautiful foliage and stream. There are animals running though out like: bunnies, lizards, snakes(sometimes), squirrels, bass fish, great blue heron and a rare white heron. There are also two types of water turtles that wade on the logs in the lake and you can often see them swimming in the stream. I've also seen the turtle come on land to find a place to lay their eggs.(do not touch this is a mission for this turtle) There are ducks and other animals meandering about the trails. No bikes or Jogging allowed. I usually turn Pandora on to some relaxing music or modern day classical music and enjoy the serene experience. I really do enjoy coming every week to see the same animals and checking in to see they are still there and doing great. Life really is to short not to come by and take a walk through this little bit of paradise if only once. Maybe I Will See You There! :-}",Hawks3
50,Great Place for Kids,"i can't rave enough about this place, it's such a great place to walk, either by yourself, with your sig other, or as a family. Kids (and adults!) will love the turtles resting under the bridge. The parking fee also gets you into the main El Dorado park across the street, which provides another stop for a great walk is the duck pond. A definite gem of Long Beach!",marciaink
50,Love the nature center,"It is a great place to either take the kids for an education outing, or get excerise. You may choose between a 1 mile or 2 mile walk though meandering trails. You can see animals like water turtles,rabbits, squirrels and birds. Only down side is you have to pay to park. . I believe weekends is $5.00.",Jill M
40,Nice peaceful place,"Good information and worth the time to see this place, easy in/out. Not huge but enough things to keep ones interest....",res0wutv
50,Beautiful!,"Very beautiful and peaceful. I love the outdoors and live in the mountains, so when I got into L.A. it was a bit much until I visited here. I was able to relax and felt centered.",Alisa G
50,My Favorite Workout in Long Beach,"I've been hiking in the Nature Center for six years, ever since my best friend took me there for her birthday. I have spent numerous hours strolling the two mile trail and love the sense of serenity I feel when visiting. The foliage is made up of local California trees and plants, with a pleasant fragrance of eucalyptus floating in the air. The ominous herons are a pleasant addition to an early morning stroll and delight me each time. Turtles, rabbits, and squirrels are regularly spotted. Weekends can get very crowded; I find mornings the most pleasant.",laurastegeman
30,Great place to relax the mind,"Great place to relax the mind. I have visited the nature center approx 10-times. It's kinda boring, but a great place to walk the trails and get some relaxation of the mind. You can see the cool turtles maybe getting some sun on a wood platform. I enjoy this place with a friend and talk while we walk. It's about $5.00 to park and it closes around 5 or 6pm so look up the hours of operation.",Rita I
50,Wheelchair accessible,"Nice dirt path for wheelchairs. Saw many turtles, ducks and hummingbirds. It's like a little forrest in the middle middle of the city.",Linda D
50,Nice nature trails!,This nature center and trail is well kept. I love to walk the trails looking for birds and sit at the many benches along the way. The trails are easy for anyone to walk and there is a nice bridge over a pond with turtles floating around. The pond connects to a small lake that gets it's share of ducks and other wildlife visiting. There is also a small creek where you can find snowy egrets looking for dinner or mallard duck couples cruising slowly by. It's worth the time to visit for sure!Here's a tip though....make sure to visit the rest room before hitting the trail! :-),BJLee399
50,Great getaway from city hubbub,I was born in L.B. Sad to say I waited too long to visit this wonderful place. My wife and I played hooky from our responsibilities to come here. Great trees...water...walkways..and birds and animals. peaceful place right in the middle of sprawl. Good place to get easy exercise and enjoy the walk and nature. Sorry we missed this before...take time from your busy life and take a relaxing walk thru here...no need to travel to the ends of the earth for a little peace.,tripbhb
50,Love this place!,"Excellent scenery full of ducks and birds, turtles and rabbits. Lots of shady trees--and not so many shady people.",Norbert C
40,Oasis in Long Beach,"This is a huge park in the heart of an urban area. It costs $5/car Mon-Thurs, $6 on Fri, $7 on Sat-Sun, and $8 on holidays. The fee is per car, so bring your friends and family. If you head for the Nature Center itself, you'll also be next to the Animal Shelter. It's a clean, modern, humane facility. We enjoyed visiting the animals and struggled to remain firm in our resolve not to take one home. Across the parking lot there is a paved, 1/4 mile handicapped accessible path, and a 1 and 2 mile path that's dirt, but fairly easy to walk. (I was in a cast and mostly managed it fine.) There's not a lot of wildlife, mostly ducks, but we did see a cormorant. It's a great place for kids to race around, and there are quite a few benches along the path. We visited in December, but the path is heavily shaded, so it should be comfortable in the summer, too.",Marlys S
50,"You have to pay, but it's worth it.","Along with the Japanese Garden at Cal State Long Beach (free) this is another secret nature hideaway. But it costs $5 or so, which sucks, but it's based on the car, so pack a bunch in one and check it out. There is a 1-mile and 2 mile trail, and a 1/4 mile or so handicapped trail, concrete, for people in wheelchairs.",Ronrecycle
50,Urban get-away.,"It's a sweet place to spend time in nature away from the cars and the hustle of crowds. Walk among the turtles, ducks, squirrels and birds and stop off to sit and enjoy the beautiful trees and plant life.",nanaonabike

40,Nature in the city,"Very nice walking trails. An escape from the city. Children love to explore this environment. They will be delighted to see turtles and squirrels and insects.

50,Oasis in the suburbs...,"Quiet nature paths wind amongst tall trees and gurgling streams as dragonflies flit about and birds pass amongst the trees. A relaxing, educational great time.

50,Take a Hike!,"The El Dorado Nature Center is a great respite from urban life. Located in El Dorado Park, you'd think you'd driven miles to get to a remote place for a hike.There is a 1 mile and a 2 mile hike/walk that takes you through several different plant and animal communities. You'll see turtles, birds, maybe a rabbit, snake, fox or squirrel. Most of all, you will experience a relaxing walk in the woods.",RansomNote

50,You have not seen the beauty of Long Beach until you go here,"People often thing of Los Angeles as a concrete jungle, a system of freeways, an urban mess and greenery desert. The opposite is true. There are parks and mountains, trees and ponds/lakes. There are dozens of types of birds, hundreds of types of plants, plenty of space, classes, a lake, and lots of natural beauty.Go, see, explore, and go again, and again, and again.",Alexander_Designs
