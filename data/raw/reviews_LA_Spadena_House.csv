50,Witches house!,Years ago I was able to go through this unusual home when it was for sale...truthfully outside is much more fun to look at...,Trudi G
40,Witches House,"I have to say the detail on this home was amazing, I cannot believe that someone really lives here. It is enchanting and there are many details to see.Great picture opportunity.",Nav C
40,Adorable!,"Definitely worth checking out! It’s such a cute piece of architecture, stands out in the heart of Beverly Hills. I’m glad it’s around to awe and admire.",thepolishfoodie
40,Famous witches house !,"Designed and built by a Hollywood Art Director in 1921, the famous witches house was originally an office and dressing room at one of the studios before being moved to it's current location in the thirties. The house was a private residence right up until the nineties, but has now been renovated and maintained as a tourist sight (much to the annoyance of local residents) and a set location for movies such as Hocus Pocus. Not one of the better know sights in Hollywood, but well worth checking out the exterior (you cannot go inside).",Ste M
50,Need to stop by and take a look!,"Very cute house worth driving by when you are near Rodeo Drive. We were told by a neighbor that it had previously been on a movie set and moved to this location and that, as would be expected, on Halloween, all roads in the area are blocked off from traffic because there are soo many visitors. Be sure to check out all the details outside the house, such as the fake alligator in the lily pond moat and the fake ravens on the rickety bridge and in the bushes along with the ‘scary’ No Trespassing signs and such. As this is a private residence, you can only stop by and take a look from the outside. Therefore, it only takes a few minutes to take a look.",tinaNtravel
50,This House Makes Me Happy,"It's the embodiment of whimsy, and dedication, and imagination.Every time I'm in LA, I make it a point to stop by this picturesque residence. Privately owned, I'm sure the upkeep on this property is considerable & a big thank you to the owners for taking such good care of this iconic piece of architecture.Sure to delight adults as well as children.",pookala
40,Fairytale house,This is a different kind of house and looks more like a wich house from any fairytale. You can take photographs from outside.,Ravindra V
50,Well worth the visit,Girlfriend and I were in LA a few years back when we heard about this magical place. We loved the place. Tons of character and attention to details. Sort of like the place where a Tim Burton character would live.,Dougenstein
50,Definitely a must see while in Rodeo Drive,"The location of the house cannot be missed.Very impressive desiqn, so realistic including the landscape from the inside to the street side. Its only about 4 min drive from Rodeo drive, so check it out.",mari_reys
50,Kids would love seeing the Witch’s House,"My son & I loved seeing the Witch’s House! I know there’s more Storybook houses in California and I wish I could have seen them all. So beautful, whimsical, unique. I would love living in a house like this. We parked outside and admired it for a good 10 minutes at least. The house (and city) is lucky to have found an owner who appreciates it and restored it. Seeing it Halloween night must be amazing.Keep in mind this is a residential house and lived in. Be respectful. The house is not difficult to locate and was one of the highlights of our visit to L.A. Visited Tuesday, January 31.",Dani B
50,Great house!,As we were staying at the Beverly Hills Plaza we walked past this house on the way to the Beverly Gardens Park. It is wonderfully quirky and well worth checking out if in the neighbourhood. There are some really clever little details in the garden as well as on the house itself. Very photogenic and I would love to meet the people who own it!,Gadabouts95
50,Neat place to walk by,"Very neat home located in Beverly Hills. Not its original location but neat history behind it and fun to look. Wish they'd offer ""inside"" tours. It's like a little Hansel and Gretel house in the middle of Beverly Hills. Very storybook and unique!",suzy l
50,THE WITCHES HOUSE IS JUST THE BEST,"I grew up going there on Halloween and driving friends and relatives from out of town to see it. It is not to be missed. You cannot go inside because people live there, but the outside is just the perfect witches house with a broomstick on the roof, a moat, tiny windows. You think it is the witches house from Hansel and Gretel. Built by a set designer from Wizard of Oz movie I think.Do not miss this fun five minute stop!!",Jean H
50,Witch House in Beverly Hills,Located just off of Wilshire Blvd on Walden Drive. Easy to find! The house was used in a movie and then moved to Beverly Hills.,Annika0412
50,Unique gem in Beverly Hills,"A very unique and whimsical house in Beverly Hills. If you're out driving around, then you should check this place out.",jeep_girl_00
50,"Fascinating, Enchanting Witchy House","Reminds me of a little storybook Hansel and Gretel House. Captivating, you just stop on the street (one block off Santa Monica Blvd.) and take a quick photo or two! You don't have to get out of your vehicle. Quirky Spadena House covers all the details with the tilted, pointed, rooftops, odd, old-looking, curled shingles, bridge over the little front yard stream, story book gates, complete with dead tree (and stuffed stationery, black bird). My husband couldn’t believe I didn’t like my photos or that we had to go back and I had to shoot the photos again from different angles. He obliged (partly because this only takes a couple of minutes) as I again tromped through the deliberately overgrown high grass to shoot additional photos. (I could have walked from our hotel in Beverly Hills, but I think he wanted to see this house again, too!) This is splendid, so fun and perfectly delightful in Beverly Hills. I felt a bit goofy, but this witchy house is magical and brings out so many to do the same. During my second, almost discreet visit with much better evening sunlight, other visitors stopped me and remarked how Spadena House is so much fun. Just take 2 minutes, be very quiet (don't awaken the witches) and see Spadena House and you (and hopefully your driver) will leave smiling!!!",RikiUSA
40,the Witches of BH,"You can only walk or drive by as the house is privately owned , we diid it on the trolley tour and enjoyed the view",Margaret B
40,Pretty cool to see,"I love the Witch's House, This whimsical, haunted cottage is the perfect drive by jump out and take a snap kind of point that you would not expect to be in the middle of Beverly Hills. It was a nice surprise that our guide Claudia from ""We Love LA Tours"" showed us on our journey and we were excited to jump out and take a photo in front of it before the Witch caught us.Recommended to take kids there to get some halloween excitement happening",Nik B
50,"Knock, knock!","Very eccentric, imaginary and grotesque architecture and garden. I was just wondering if anybody lives there, if not it may be evaluated as a small museum house with matching interior decoration to its outer look.",travelguru-su
50,The Witch's House,"The Spadena House is also known as the Witch's House and it is a major tourist attraction.Built in 1921 in nearby Culver City, the house was moved to Beverly Hills in 1934.It is a real house that looks like a witch lives there with its storybook look and pointy roofs that look like they are falling apart.The house was built that way and is completely safe.In fact, it is a private residence.On Halloween, the house is the most popular in Beverly Hills with spooky decorations and people giving out candy at the front gate.However, the Witch's House is popular all year with people.Come take a few photos, but please respect the privacy of the owner.Lastly, be aware of witches.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
30,Cute and different,"It is a nice to see. You can only observe it from outside, not allowed to go in.Reminded me of the houses tou see in the movies (fairytale houses).",younis
30,Cute but I'd skip it,"We can't believe we wasted time trying to find this ""Witch's House"".What you see from the road is what you get-----it is fenced and not family-friendly. I would imagine children would revolt, seeing such an inviting house with no way inside.",Nancy M
50,Sightseeing,"What a fun place, don't miss this one. The house is right in the middle of a neighborhood in Beverly Hills. Very quirky! Check out the pics in the Internet, it's also called The Witchs House.",Terrre B
40,Amazing and must see,"This house is a must see. It was amazing. it is hard to believe that this house is in the middle of Beverly Hills, The house had a moat in front and very pretty flowers. It is definitely ""different"".",Venkata KR O
50,Very Amazing,It is hard to imagine that this house is in the middle of Beverly Hills. it is absolutely cute and right out of a children's book setting. They call it the Witch's House. This house was originally built years ago and was in Culver City but then they moved the house to Beverly Hills. It remodeled several years ago. Just love it.,Flhappy
50,Unique house must see,"**Must see **Just minutes from Rodeo Dr. in Beverly Hills is Spadena House aka Witch house. The house is very unique unlike the rest of the houses which are mansions in that area. Parking is along side the road as it is a residential area. The side has a plaque. Do not pick the berries The Witch..Cool, unique and an unrealistic home in the midst of Hollywood. The walls look old and dilapidated but that is what gives it its appeal and looks straight out of a Disney story. \ Hansel and Gretel.We didnt venture inside since it is private property. However this is a must see. Would have loved to see the place decorated for Halloween.If your going the intersection is Walden and Carmelita Dr. The entrance is on Walden Dr.",M V
50,Must See,"This house is a must see. It was amazing. The house had a moat in front and very pretty flowers. It is definitely ""different"".",CathyA29
40,Interesting!,"Very peculiar place to take photographs. I wish we could see it inside as well. If you have time, somewhere to go, if you don't you are not missing so much.....................................",Imgelem
50,"The premiere example of early 20th century ""Storybook"" Architecture","If you are visiting Los Angeles you should visit the Spadena House, or The Witches House as it is known as well. It is a landmark and a treasure and was recently saved from the wrecking ball by the very real estate agent who was trying to sell it. The gentleman has painstakingly restored the exterior and it is worth a stop on your photo ops of LA. Take it from one who lives here!",AveburyL
