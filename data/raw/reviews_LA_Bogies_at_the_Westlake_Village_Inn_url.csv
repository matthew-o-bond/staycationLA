10,Awful! Poor Management by Carlos the GM,"I’ve never been treated so poorly in my life!! We booked a company party online a couple months ago on bogies website, after doing so we also received a phone call and email verifying our reservation for the Capri room Saturday December 14th. One week before prior to our planned party they contacted me and said sorry we double booked the Capri room space you wanted. I decided to go into Bogies and speak with the General Manager of Bogies, Carlos. He said: “I’m so sorry I’ve only been here 3 weeks and I’m cleaning up someone else’s mess”. I said ok, I get it. he gave me a different space outside in the cold with fireplaces and said he will comp us 2 bottles of vodka as long as I purchase 2, I said ok no problem. We show up to our party Saturday the 14th and Carlos says: I’ve “upgraded you to this cabana outside, but I’m not going to comp you anything anymore”. As if he was doing me a favor?? When Bogies are the ones that messed up our reservation from the beginning. So we ended up buying 4 bottles and food at full price. And to top it allll off turns out not only did Bogies mess up my reservation and left us in the cold and retracted there offer of comping me a thing, Carlos also lies to my face! Turns out he’s worked there for months! Wow just wow.I’ve spent so much money at this property, I had my wedding at the property and every year we have our Christmas party here. So pretty much have spent over 100k in total here. We will not be coming back, ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherk554
50,Very Comfortable,I was on business in California. Stayed at Westlake Village Inn. Bogies bar is on the property. It is a very upscale bar. Ultra comfortable. Nice beer selection. Give it a try,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cserafino23
50,GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE CLASS ALL THE WAY INDOOR OUTDOOR SEATING,Bogies is a great venue to see and hear good music in a very classy and comfortable atmosphere . The food is fantastic and service is done well and friendly . The music on band nights is top notch and the sound is also superb . The owner Ken is really nice and personable always with a smile and a warm hello . Easy parking and the outdoor seating is really nice and comfortable on a warm summer night .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnC5636
20,"Nice location, tacky crowds","The good: Go in the daytime for a nice walk around the grounds. Salsa nights (if they still do them) are ok if you want to learn something fun with your partner.The bad: Drinks are overpriced, service is bad and the food is not great. Late night weekends it’s transformed into an overcrowded mess of older people dancing & grinding like teenagers. Really hilarious. Almost funny enough to recommend if ylu can visit when there’s no line, valet or cover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amarquette
30,"If you're into clubbin', Saturdays at Bogies","The after party for my friends’ wedding was at Bogies, which is why I booked my hotel room at the Westlake Village Inn. I figured that if I was going to be drinking, I might as well be able to walk back to my room instead of trying to find a ride back. What we didn’t know was that on Saturdays, they have club night. There was a line out the door for GA. There was a separate line for VIP if you were to pay for bottle service and a reserved table. Fortunately, the groom didn’t want to wait so he paid for a table. They are also strict about dress code. No athletic attire. Clubbing clothes only.We were escorted to a booth on the club side which admittedly was loud and bumpin’. The booth had decent seating and our server gave us the menu for the different types of liquor we could buy. We opted for a bottle of Jameson because one of my friends could not do vodka. They had different mixers like cranberry, Sprite, ginger ale, club soda, and orange juice. The bottles come out with a fun sparklers display and seductive dance from the servers. Of course, this was lost on us because we were just interested in drinking, not dancing. Anyway, we old. I admit it. I’m not going to lie, this place made me feel my age, not in a good way. The music was so-so. We drank, took photos, and chatted. It was all right but honestly, they were trying way too hard. Afterwards, the groom asked us why we sat on the club side, to which we said, we followed the server. He would have asked for a table on the restaurant side because it would have been easier to relax and talk. Well, now I know. If you’re looking for a club-like atmosphere on a Saturday night, in the Thousand Oaks area, Bogies is your place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaDeGirL01
40,Good Time Bogies,"I was here for work and staying at the resort. A bunch of us cam for after dinner drinks and apps. Beautiful ambiance and location looking over the golf course and lake. Very friendly, happy staff eager to make the visit enjoyable. Food was great and the drinks were as expected. Depending on the day of the week, this place becomes one of the hottest places in town to be with red velvet ropes at the entrance with bouncers, etc. Great live music here today on certain days. Worth it to stop by with a group or to watch the games at the bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennF508
50,Fusion Jazz group CAB Excellent at Bogie's,"Great up close experience listening to CAB, amazing Fusion Jazz group led by Bassist Bunny Brunel. Great food and service at Bogie's. A little live music venue treasure in Westlake California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9579LXgaryr
40,Work,Been there many times and never been disappointed in quality of food. Service is usually great however this last time was not up to par.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/584betsys

40,Great happy hour,I like to go when they have jazz events scheduled. Happy hour pizza and glass of wine for $10 can't be beat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bern423
30,I am sure this place could be better.,"My daughter and I arrived a bit late on a Wednesday night. No one was to be found, we seated ourselves. My daughter went to the bar to order but a waitress found her and said we could sit and order. Menus were on the table. We ordered a Basil Smash $14.00 and my daughter ordered a glass of red wine $12.00. We ordered a margarita pizza $13.00 to share. Food and drinks were okay but the service lacked. The servers were nice enough, I just don't think they had enough people working for the amount of people in the restaurant/bar. Don't think I would go back.

50,"This is the place to go for "" good times""","Went with some friends and had a fabulous time... Without a doubt you will not only have a great time, but there is tons of eye candy both men and women... ☺️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadenginger
40,Great location and great food,Great location and great food. We had steaks and deserts (I had a beautiful Apple Tart). The service was great and they had a really good wine selection - we chose local red.Steaks were done to perfection and the sides (I loved the spinach) were perfectly cooked and presented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiamMonte
40,Fun in Westlake,"I love the Westlake Village Inn. The grounds are beautiful and you can bounce between many of the restaurants or things to do on the property. Bogies is the bar and it is very pretty. I like the atmosphere. It can be a little ""meat markety"" for old men but it is a great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
50,Great food,"Excellent food, drinks and service. Very nice music and ambiance. They have live music and different seat settings to make you feel so comfortable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4717CFpaulac
50,Of All the Gin Joints in All the World,"A fun, good and great place to eat and hang out at! Lot's of locals like it and many visitors enjoy it too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreatMobi
50,"Fun Time, Good Food","On a Thursday evening there was two bands, from 7:30-9:30. Early enough to have a few glasses of wine and a gourmet pizza.Beware-it gets very crowded on the weekends, with an upscale crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amsvue
50,Unique Party Bar in the Valley,"Liked the outdoor concept where you're able to enjoy a cigar and drink with friends. Definitely recommend booking a cabana area if going with a group of friends. It got crowded and we were able to reserve a covered, private area. Many in the group like cigars and we were able to light up in our private table area. Price was much more reasonable than I had expected, based on rates paid in Hollywood or Las Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chipboy07
40,Pre-wedding cocktail party,"Bogies seems like a hopping night spot on the premises of Westlake Village Inn. We attended a cocktail party here the night before a family wedding. We were in a separate party room, but there was a live band in a separate room area with a lively bar area. The food served at the cocktail party seemed typical bar/casual restaurant fare, sliders, satay, pizza and the like. The restaurant seemed to attract locals in addition to guests staying at the properly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201MarkL
40,Good food and good location,I have eaten here many times.....sometimes with friends and other times with business colleagues or even by myself!! The food is always good and the staff is great. Good Food and Good Service!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983ronm
40,Danced The Night Away,"Loved that it's an indoor/outdoor spot, but during the colder months you definitely want to stay indoors. Bottle service is reasonable, but then again it was a company party!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ivygirl16
20,Strange bar and club...sort of creepy,"We dropped in after dinner at Mediterraneo. It was early, about 10:00 p.m., however, there were NO seats to be had anywhere. It wasn't that they were all taken up, a few were, but the rest were reserved for bottle service clients at $200/table! Not what we wanted as a couple in for one drink, a little conversation and maybe some dancing. So, we walked around and noticed a lot of ""older"" people acting like teenagers - one couple was totally making out....gross! (Get a room!). We're not young ourselves, but we felt really embarrassed for them and us.We moved away from these groups and into the dance area. Again, some very strange looking people - about 5 of them were dancing. One couple looked like they were having an intimate moment - again really embarrassing - another couple looked straight out of a late night movie and there was one guy getting down by himself. We really felt like we were in the Twilight Zone here so we left. I hope this club gets better later at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thymetotravel999
30,Always Packed on the Weekends,This place is always packed and noisy. There is no chance to have a good conversation due to congestion of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jce2000
40,Good Club Scene in a Rural Location,"I would definitely recommend Bogie's if you are in Westlake looking for a club scene. We ended up going to Bogie's twice during our stay in Westlake Village. Friday night was quite fun. Warning: dress code is STRICTLY enforced. Guys-no shorts, hats, jerseys, plain t-shirts. Girls-no ripped jeans or flip flops. Saturday night was very packed and not quite as enjoyable, but great people watching and outside bar/patio to get away from the dance crowd for a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
