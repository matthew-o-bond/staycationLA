40,Try to visit if you can,"It‚Äôs only a small attraction and you will only spend 25 - 30 mins in it. It only costs 7us and is run by local volunteers, they are really enthusiastic and have a lot to tell. It isn‚Äôt going to take your day up and would be really good for children.",CWD360
50,Cute little aquarium,"Not very large, but interesting displays , staff was very helpful and informative. More geared towards children.",mgtt51
30,Small aquarium under the pier,This is a small aquarium located under the pier at the front end of the beach area. There are a lot of star fish and small aquariums for children to learn all about the star fish. We were there during the exhibit on how starfish eat. The price to get in is $7 and they have a number of activities for children.,Charmain D
30,Cute and small but needs some help,"This is a cute and small aquarium near the Santa Monica Pier. It cannot be compared to other big ones and the small entrance fee reflects so too, but it needs some help and some cleaning too.",F-F
30,Cutie but needs more attention ...,"Cute little addiction on the pier for a non stop walk through to kill some time ... good variety for a small place but the fish and the tanks and all around need immediate attention / cleaning ... the small fee USD 5 , very good but not enough for the maintenance of the place apparently ... Enjoy !",Joa P

50,Little gem,Tucked away under the pier and tiny compared to most aquariums. However packed with local sea life and plenty of staff on hand to talk you through whatever you see. Touch tanks for starfish and other shellfish. Small but perfectly formed,Sarah V
30,üêôüêôüêô,Cute little aquarium. Cheap entry ticket price. The water tanks need a bit of cleaning but nevertheless this is a nice quick place to kill an hour.,Emirati Vacationer
40,Worth a quick stop,If you are at the Santa Monica pier the aquarium is worth a quick visit. Admission is a modest fee that goes to support the educational mission. There is one room with several displays. The touch tank had a variety of different animals. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic. I think it would be really fun for small children too.,LSQRD1
50,Very small but good value for the price,"For only $5 it was actually a very informative aquarium and the animals seemed well-cared for. Most, if not all of the fish were local to the SoCal area and they had workers to answer questions. For a small, one-room aquarium they have a lot of species of fish.",Corbin B.
40,A cute little aquarium,"This is a very small aquarium under the pier at Santa Monica. It cost $5 to get in. I loved the shark pups and the area where you can see the shark egg cases in tanks. There is also a little touch tank as well. The staff were very friendly, and it is super easy to navigate. Worth a stop if you love the ocean!",hmill42894
50,Excellent Little Aquarium!,"Although it is very small, the aquarium has a wide and beautiful array of different species and the staff is incredibly informed and friendly. The touch pools had cool animals that we had never seen at other aquariums, like sea slugs and crabs. The overall theme of cleaning and preserving aquatic territories is a good message that they did very will conveying. Overall, a fun experience!",Sydney W.
50,Adorable Aquarium for kids,"A tucked away surprise for the ocean lovers both young and old. Aquarium is quite small in comparison to most but has a wide range of exotic ocean life to be viewed. If you are interested in seeing what lies below the ocean waters that your walking next to along Santa Monica Pier, this is a great place to visit.",MLuiso
50,Excellent staff,"This is a very small aquarium, but for a minimal entry fee, it is well worth it. We got to see the staff feed sea horses and they let us feed sea stars. My kids loved it. The staff was so fantastic, especially a man named jack. He was so knowledgeable and really seemed to love teaching my kids about the various marine life. He really made our trip to the aquarium extra special.",Brooke014
30,"Very, very small","We considered the cost of admission to be a donation because there just wasn‚Äôt much to this museum if you didn‚Äôt have small children. However, I‚Äôm sure this would be a great place, close to the beach, if your little ones needed some time out of the sun but weren‚Äôt ready to go back to the room yet.",D R

30,Small,I was expecting to see a bigger place but I guess if you are going with small children then it‚Äôs ok. They have touching pools and if you stay long enough you can feed the sharks (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs everyday or just selected dates). You can see everything in an hour or so.,Cin
50,Big things come in small places!,"This is one great aquarium for such a low price. I came with my daughter and her friend and only paid $5!!! For such a tiny place, it packed a lot of fun things to do for both kids and grown ups. We showed up on time to feed the starfish which was super cool! Also the staff here was super friendly, open to questions, and very encouraging to participate in the activities. You're in and out in one hour tops! For $5, I feel like I got more bang for my buck than spending $30 at the aquarium of the pacific in Long Beach. Don't forget to say hi to those beautiful eels in the entrance!",The.BrokeTraveler
40,Fun Place,"Enjoyed a fun filled afternoon with our 3 year old toddler. Did some rides, did some walking around and enjoyed some the the street performers. Good fun.",MarcelU1968
30,Nice touch pools!,"A great place to quickly bring the kids if you want to have a bit of fun for 30 minutes or so! The aqarium itself is quite small and doesn't have a lot of space.If you're looking for something with sharks or dolphins then you'll be best going to another aquarium, however, it's a great little attraction next to the pier and the staff are very knowledgable and very very nice! They do also have touch pools which is really fun for kids and a great learning environment!Would recommend checking this out if you're spending a day at the pier but I wouldn't travel distance to visit! :)",AngelXena
40,Parking at Santa Monica Pier,"It cost us $14.00 per day at their public parking, if we had done our home work on the pier itself is $3.00 per hour. We only stayed for about an hour. I thought the pier would be more besides the rides. I liked Venice Beach a whole lot more",Frank R
50,Great Fun,"Yes, its a great please to take the kids to. I recommend it. Easy access and just the right size for young kids attention spans.",bill1241
20,"More of ""Info on the Bay"" than Aquarium...","If you have young kids - this may be a fun, $5 and 30min diversion. But for adults...we spent almost 30 mins walking up and down the pier trying to find this place, finally were given correct directions by a local, and found this tiny, one room building literally tucked under the Santa Monica Pier. This was included on our travel pass, so we thought, why not? I understand this is a volunteer run operation to try & educate people about the ecosystem in the Bay and how to protect it. In that respect, I applaud it. We had some nice conversations with the volunteers there. But this should NOT be advertised as an ""Aquarium"", it's a one room affair with a few tanks & that's it. The entry fee of $5 goes towards conservation efforts, so they're not trying to rip you off. I think this is more a case of advertising not matching expectations.",Amber S
40,It's one big room,"It's cheap, and it's fun for young kids. It's only one big room and dwell time is about 30 minutes but with the touching pools it's great for kids. Worth the admission price.",WorldTraveler1976
20,Best for families with small children,"My husband and I went to the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium while we were at the pier. It was a $5 per adult admission and kids under a certain age were free. It was a very small display inside and geared toward small children, although it was interesting to see some of the facts about the water pollution and saving the oceans in California. You could touch a number of sea creatures including starfish, crabs, and sea cucumbers. If you have young children, I might recommend this place. There is a colouring station and interactive videos for older children. We took about 35 minutes, but with kids you could take a bit longer inside. Good to know - there are 2 restrooms inside as well with change tables for babies.",TheAverageTourist
30,JUST OKAY,"Didn't actually go in. It looked like the type of place that if you had small children it would be worth the entrance fee, otherwise I wouldn't and didn't bother.",Bossy075
10,Disappointing,"We'd heard about Santa Monica in songs, advertisements, and travel guides, so we put it on our list of things to do whilst in the area.One of the ""attractions"" at Santa Monica Pier was the aquarium, so we gave it a whirl.I don't know what we should have been expecting, but wow, we were disappointed.Firstly, it's not that easy to find. Secondly, and most importantly, there just wasn't much to it. not much more than 10-20 minutes worth of interest.We probably weren't in the best moods, as our trip to Santa Monica thus far was pretty underwhelming; the rides were closed (it was an Autumn weekday during school), and we'd just had the most ordinary meal we'd had on our trip at one of the pier eateries.So, this was the crowning disappointment on a somewhat average day.We had a much more pleasant time at Santa Monica Pier on another day (and I'll write a more favourable review about that), but we weren't going to do the aquarium again.Skip this one folks, you're not missing a thing.",AmigoMarlz
20,WRITE THIS OFF AS A CONTRIBUTIOIN!,"We were really looking forward to going to the aquarium as we have seen some great ones across the world. The entry fee is cheap, as it should be, as it will take you about 10 minutes to read everything and be done. Not what we were expecting at all.",angelcindy
10,Think its Closed Down,I'm not positive but this place appeared to be shuttered and closed down. In leaving the Pier we walked down some concrete steps and past signs saying aquarium. The place appeared shuttered and closed. Could be wrong.,MIke23693
40,Pleasant day at the aquarium.,Pleasant and well organized venue. Some interesting species so a visit is a must especially with small kids.,Stavreez
40,Labor of Love Run by Volunteers,"In terms of Aquariums, this is not the Baltimore Aquarium or the Monterey Aquarium.It is open daily from 2 - 6 pm. It is staffed by volunteers who want to share their love of the sea life in the Santa Monica area. If you are visiting the pier, make a stop. Well worth it. We saw sea life that we do not see on the East Coast.It is small, but again, a labor or love from the volunteers who run it.",Connie F
40,cheap but fun,"Kids 12 and under are free, and adults are inexpensive. My kids loved the touch tanks, and we finally had to make them leave. They spent a long time talking to all of the touch tank workers and learning about every single animal in the 3 tanks. They had snails, sea cucumbers, and all kinds of starfish. The location is at the very beginning of the pier and on the bottom. We got a groupon for 2 adults for like $7. I think it is usually $5 for each adult.",amyw2012
40,Small Sea animals but a good place for Kids.,"It is a small aquarium which has species which are found around the pier. Some of the them, you can touch and feel. Some of them very unique sea species. They have a sit down are for the kids as well to color etc. our Kids loved the place. spent about 2 hours.",Gagan

10,Not good at all,"We visited using our LA go card, so we didn't actually pay out right for this visit, which I am very pleased about as I would have been very disappointed. The aquarium firstly was very difficult to find, and once we found it we were shocked - it was very small, unclean and there were hardly any animals - those that were there were not in what looked to be clean tanks. I would not recommend visiting.",Lo B
40,Small but great for small kids,"Great little aquarium under SM pier. Key word; little. Displays with touch tanks raises money and awareness for Heal the Bay. If you want to spend a day at an aquarium, go to Long Beach. If you want to give your children a couple of hours of education and information they are likely to retain, come here. My favorite was floor to ceiling jellyfish tank. Kids loved the touch tanks with star fish.",rod1701
40,Nice little aquarium,"This little aquarium under the Santa Monica Pier is quite nice--just don't expect it to compare with the one down in Long Beach. There are several ceiling-high tanks with local critters including various rockfish, small sharks, morays and wolf eels. Several open, hands-on pools with knowledgeable helpers will keep the kids (and the inquisitive) busy. Sometimes smaller is better...",brothermoses
50,perfect for 4th or 5th bday party,we had our kids birthday party at this pear aquarium and it was excellent. All the kids get to pet the sharks and feed the fish. And it is very educational.,Edward V
30,A small taste of an Aquarium........,"It is much smaller than alot of aquariums but does provide a ""taste"" of what they are all about, perfect for school groups or a smaller setting for kid-related activities.....did like the touch pools, always neat! Sharks were neat, too! Would have liked to have seen a ""ray"" touch pool, as well and any other interactive activities they could do, but overall, for the price, not too bad....would have more hours open, pretty limited in attraction hours.....",HGF001
50,Bite sized perfect little aquarium...supports a great charity,This is a sweet aquarium with hands on stuff for the kids. Supports the awesome Heal the Bay charity that focuses on what they call 'the locals' i.e. the creatures that inhabit the bay. There are fun things for the kids to do and lots of great staff to answer any questions you might have. We love it. We live here and visit often. Oh and they have different things going on different days...check out the website. Starfish feeding anyone?,AFoolForTravel
30,Get Your Finger Hugged By a Sea Urchin!,That was the main attraction for us - saw the sign for it whilst walking along the pier. It was only a very small place but there were an area where you can touch the star fish and sea urchins. The volunteers that were there were very nice and knowledgable. You probably wouldn't spend more that an hour there as it was quite small. Entrance fee was $5.,CTR15
40,Nice little attraction.,"Well priced, the small attraction off the Santa Monica pier gave the kids a little lesson in the ocean. A chance to feed some starfish and check out the sharks.",Gavin S
30,Very small aquarium,"We decided to visit this aquarium - we thought the entrance fee of $5 per person was sufficiently cheap that it didn't matter if there wasn't a lot to see. It is very small and there aren't many things to see. However, we enjoyed our short visit there. Children will enjoy the touching pools (which are closely supervised).",GerMar60
40,Great for kids,Lots of things to see and learn and it's small so not overwhelming. Kids can touch the animals and see that they are pretty cool.,Terri D
30,Small and not a lot to see,Conveniently located but small - not a lot to see but probably more appealing to young kids than adults.,RonWamberal
10,Don't Waste Your Money,I should have come here first to read the reviews. I walked in took one spin around the place and was finished in 5 minutes. I found the place to be very run down and dirty. Would not recommend this and definitely not worth the money.,Melissa W
20,Very small!,"If you walk in the door to the register, that's pretty much it!Good way to kill 15mins but didn't find it that interesting. the people are lovely and can spin a good yarn if your looking to kill some more time.",Y4896BWmattp

50,amazing,so much too see also its very exciting for kids my kids had a great time and not expensive at all i loved it,Patricia M
40,Crowded,"Drove over 5hrs only to find that every shop on the pier is closed until 10-10:30am. We did get to park on the pier was great till it was time to leave. We arrived about 7am couldn't find a single place open for coffee or breakfast then eventually found a typical McDonald's (which we didn't want). We enjoyed the peacefulness of the waves off the pier and people watched while all the fitness groups of people passed us. Eventually we went on to the bike rental and began our ride from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. We shopped along the way but unable to shop together because we had the bikes rentals. We jade lunch at a Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier( Not Recommended). We eventually made our way to the sand and water where we got to rest and the Mr went into the pacific for a quick swim. There was an abundance of people on the beach but the pier was unbelievably crowded, I was shocked at the amount of people and traffic along with the weight of the attractions that the pier didn't collapse. Do expect to pay high prices, it's good to show up before 10 for parking but any later might as well expect to walk a long distance and regardless of the wallet damage you will have a good time.P.S if you rent bicycles it's cheaper to rent the green bikes verses renting from the bike rentals locations, unless you're seeking to rent a tandem bike or something other than a regular bicycle.",Martha B

40,Cheap and cheerful,"This is a very small aquarium and seems to be run mostly by volunteers. They're all very friendly, passionate and knowledgeable and I learnt quite a bite while I was there. There is a touch tank where children can touch some varied creatures all of which can be found in the bay. The aim of this place seems to be about creating awareness about the preservation of the bay. I wouldn't say it's worth travelling half way around the world from but if you're looking for something simple to do one morning or afternoon it might be a nice little outing if you're in the area.",Marcimo_NZ
50,Cute Aquarium with hands on learning,"It's not what one would normally expect from an aquarium, especially if you've been to the one in Long Beach, CA or near Carmel. But, it is wonderful for small children and provides enough information to peek an interest in marine life, our eco system, and the importance of not littering. When we were there they had a wonderful hands on exhibit and the small children there loved it and were very engaged in the learning activities. So, it's a yes for families with small children. It's a good diversion! And, there is ice cream across the way and upstairs (in the carousel place) and a lemonade / hot dog stand a little further away.",L B
40,Small but extremely educational and enjoyable. Lots of 'hands on',"This little aquarium is well worth a visit If you are on the pier or the beach.

I'm sure we will return many times.",sqw
40,Not bad for a quick visit,¬£5 entrance for adults.Very small as only one room but the couple of tanks that you can gently touch the sealife in it is very interesting. Nice to hear info from the volunteers.Good little visit to get out the sun for 20mins.,EssexAngelDelight
30,Good for kids,This is not exactly an aquarium. It's more of a one room marine center. It would be well worth it for families with kids as there are several touch tanks and a kid-friendly learning area. Kids under 13 are free and adults are $5. It provides interesting history of the pier and surrounding area.,Kelley Y

There is always something unusual and fascinating in this tiny gem of an aquarium.There are fish and rays and a touch tank for the little ones to enjoy. But there are always a few animals not often seen in much larger aquariums, such as nudibranchs (beautifully colored sea snails in pop art colors) or a sea hare (which are massive, slow-moving sea slugs the size of a very large rabbit).If you've never seen a sea hare, you should check this one out.

I browsed through and was asking myself if I was missing something, or if there was another room that I didn't see?

Great food and service, and we sored a booth by a window facing the beach. Great people watching.",CleveandKat
50,Neat tucked-away jewel on Santa Monica Pier,"Lovely little jewel tucked away below the Santa Monica Pier. We've visited the pier twice before and never knew this aquarium was there! Only $5 for adults and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Our group's age range was 32 - 65 and we spent over an hour there! Small, but compact, and large aquariums for the space. Amazing fish indigenous to the area. Starfish, crabs, and Sea creatures we had never seen, they were in troughs accessible for children and adults to gently touch them. Creatures of awesome colors and shapes - almost prehistoric in appearance! All the marine scientists there were available for questions and were so enthusiastic in their responses. They were patient and genuinely seemed to relish our interest. We're from NC but plan to visit again if we get back to the area! Thank you Santa Monica for this lovely little facet in your jewel of a city!",Linda W

They have a touch tank (to touch sea stars), some small sharks, a tank with a large eel, a seahorse tank, and some tanks with various other fish. Kids are free, adults are $5 per person. Total time we spent there was less than an hour. It was fine for our time in Santa Monica, as it was a short diversion from the beach and pier.

50,Really enjoyed!,"This was a lovely place to visit with my little girl. It wasn't massive and only $5 in. She thoroughly enjoyed looking at all the different fish and sea life, touching a starfish and watching the sting ray and sharks being fed! Staff were friendly and informative.",Kerry O
50,Please don't pass this gem by!,"My daughter saw the sign for the Aquarium and we decided on a whim to go - initially because if it was a bust it wouldn't cost much. We spent maybe upto an hour here and got to learn a lot about sea life! We saw sharks growing in their egg sacks, baby sharks, small adult sharks and got to touch starfish and sea cucumbers and the like. You also get to view microscopic life through a microscope. It seems to be run entirely by very knowledgable volunteers. Just lovely!",Madmumatuk
40,Small but interesting site,Nicely uncommercial site with just a few tanks all of indigenous species. Younger kids seemed to be enjoying themselves touching animals and learning a lot. The antithesis of the larger well known aquariums and no bad thing for that. Seems to be volunteer run with an emphasis on research and education. If you are near the pier it's definitely worth a look.,reviewer64Uk
50,"Only $5, free for kids and you get a lot more than you pay for!!","We visited (2 adults, 12yr old & 8yr old) one afternoon after spending the day on the beach and pier. It is only $5 an adult and children 12 and under are free.This aquarium is run by volunteers and the plan is not to be the finest aquarium in the world, don't expect massive tanks with sharks and turtles or dancing dolphins. Do expect some totally committed volunteers who love what they do and really convey that to the visitors. This is all about getting to know the sea life around Santa Monica and the surrounding area. It is about touching and feeling the sea life rather than watching from behind 6"" glass. The whole experience takes about 30-45 minutes depending on how carried away you get with the touch tanks.I really wish more aquariums/zoos/farms were this simple, this cheap and this enjoyable. Please give them your time and money!!",Christhewino
30,Southern California,"We spent an interesting 30 minutes in here. Not shark reef in las vegas., but the teens and the little kiddos thought it was cool. They touched all kinds of sea creatures and learned a little something while on vacation. It was definitely worth the $5 for the adults and teens, the little kiddos were free. Free is always good.",Ronda M
30,Not at all as expected,"Visited the aquarium today and not quite as expected. It was $5 to get in and it's run by volunteers. At first I almost turned and walked out but after looking closer it was actually quite interesting. The kids touched star fish, crabs etc and chatted to a very knowledgeable volunteer. We only spent 20-30 mins in there but they learnt a few things they didn't know before.Worth a visit but don't expect it to be the same as the more traditional aquariums.",hazelkennedy
30,It's just ok,First it's not really an aquarium. It's one room with a couple fish tanks. The ones where they let you touch the creatures are cool. My kids liked that. But it is not really a big thing to do as it takes under 30 minutes. It's ok if you are there anyway.,LostALot22
50,This place is so cool!,"This is run by volunteers that are trying to bring awareness of our marine life to all visitors. We came some years back when it was new and they have done such a great job with their donations. Only $5 for each person, and a lot for the little ones to do. So much to look at and enjoy!",kimt333
40,Fun for kids,Touch tank was a cool experience for my 5 yo. $5 entrance fee for adults. Nice bathroom and way to stay out of the sun for a half hour.,GeorgiaMichaelTaylor
40,Like in the movies,"The thing I like the most about being here, is to feel straight up in Hollywood. Like you just walked into a movie set, get yourself an ice cream and ticket for a ride. Fun afternoon to chill by the ocean, hollywood style.",Sabrina G
40,Quaint Aquarium,We were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff. There is a reasonable entrance fee for operating expenses. The aquarium illustrates the local marine life and provides entertainment in the form of touching some of the marine life. We did feel some sorrow for the sharks being captive in small tanks as opposed to roaming the ocean. But overall the aquarium seems reliably supported and an interesting place to visit while at the Pier.,DDM137
30,"Small, but free","Educational, 'touch area' where you can touch starfish and other sea things, couple tanks with fish in it - seems more geared towards families with small kids.",uki_guy
40,Charmingly amateurish,"The place it tiny with a tanks with sea urchins, sea slugs, hermit crabs and star fishes for you to touch. It's run by young volunteers hence has a certain kind of charm.",AAGill
30,Small museum intended for children,"A very small museum, where children can actually touch some of the sea creatures. Some nice workshops are taking place at the museum.",Tirza_ha
40,A little gem under the pier,"This is a great place for a short aquarium visit with kids, a class trip, or a birthday party. We've been there many times with the kids especially when they were little. They have a lot for a very small space.",ChloeBird
30,Stay for an hour,"Stay for an hour just so your kids can say they've seen the place. It's really better for smaller kids and has limited games/rides. Everything is CRAZY overpriced (I paid $4 for a bottle of water) and food is mediocre. There are some cool looking restaurants on the pier and the views are amazing. But if you don't like crowds, I would avoid it. Also, consider taking an uber or riding a bike there. Parking is insane.",Neghar
50,Well worth a visit!,What a lovely place! Run mostly by volunteers this is a cute but small aquarium. Great fun for kids and a bargain entry price of $5 (free for kids) you can afford to go more than once. Volunteers very friendly and helpful. Free creative stuff for kids also. Anyone giving this place a poor review is just mean. Keep up the good work!,bettyblue79
40,Fun for the kids.,The pier is a must visit at least once. It is always busy and lots of fun for the kids including the rides.Good for a couple of hours but then walk over to 3rd Street Promenade to have lunch or dinner.,Vanessa M
40,Small but interesting,"We went as a couple & would say we were only in there for 20 mins but if you had kids you could spend a lot longer.They have volunteers who are very knowledgable on the species in the tanks, a small play area and a touch tank, there's also sharks & eels. $5 per person (over 12 years) worth a visit.",Samantha L
30,small but interesting,"a very small but interesting aquarium, a cool jellyfish exhibit, and doesn't take too long to check everything out.",ferdferd
50,Hours of fun...,My kids couldn't get enough of the pier and arcade. Rides and games that can entertain for hours. Good fun for everyone!,jhbreland
50,Great little aquarium,"Small and easy to visit. Surprisingly wonderful variety of fish and shellfish, including sea horses. Very friendly and helpful staff, great for school groups. Nice touch tank where children can hold sea stars, urchins, sea cucumbers. Kids love it.",Valerie W
50,One of the kids favorites,We were lucky to go when they were feeding the sharks and the girls were able to feed them a fish! This was a trip highlight!!! They feed the sharks once a week so call ahead to find out when. The biologist there was so nice. When she saw how interested the girls were she even took out some stuff that wasn't on display and let them touch it. She explained so many things to them in simple language.This place is small and run by volunteers but my 7 and 12 year old girls thought it was great!,Stacey H
50,Sharks!! :),"This aquarium is pretty good for being a small aquarium, they have baby sharks, starfish, moray eels, fish, jelly fish, and other cool sea creatures. They also have a little kids area.",Palomared
50,Small But Great Staff,This was included in our Go Pass but we likely would have paid the $5 to go in. The place is tiny but the staff is great. They took the time to talk about many of the local species and we spent a lot of time in the touch tank. Tiny rays and sharks were fun to see up close and they were sharks about to hatch.,Tiffany H
40,Good Fish,Always fun to see these colorful fish up close and personal. Clean and birght setting. Easy access and fun for all ages.,CindyLeighCohn
40,"Small, convenient and friendly","Yes it is nowhere the size and scope of the Long Beach aquarium. However, if you are at the pier and you have kids, it is a good place to come to see local sea life. If you join Heal the Bay, then you get in free, so we visit quite a bit. They have small sharks you can see up close. In fact, you can see some in their birth egg sacs. There are also some touch tanks and other tanks of sea jellies, eels and other life. Does not take long to see but kids seem to like it.",hikingdude
30,Conservation Aquarium,"This aquarium is very small and not really what you would think of when you normally go to an aquarium. There are some touching tanks that allow you to check out some of the ocean life that you would find around the area. Most of the aquarium is filled with conservation information and teaches you on how to do your part to keep the ocean great. The hours are Friday: 2-5pm, and Weekends: 12:30-5pm. The cost is $5 for adults, kids 12 and under are free. If you have kids you might be there for awhile looking through all of the displays and playing with the different ""hands on"" items. If you don't have any kids you could see everything in about 30 minutes.",TheTravelingKitchen
10,Creepy Looking,Really needs work. Creepy looking and dirty.Day I was there a line of 50 kids were waiting. Hope they had fun but I thought it looked dirty.,Flhappy
50,Great local attraction that has a great cause,"This is a small aquarium under the Santa Monica Pier. It's run by Heal the Bay, a non-profit and it has a large volunteer base. If you're expecting marine mammal shows with over-the-top trainers then this isn't your place.Come here to learn what is in the water just off our coast and take the time to soak in all of the exhibits.Highly recommend. Children will love it and learn from it. Adults will learn quite a bit also.",AprylBoyle
40,Local and small,"Good little aquarium made excellent by staff that supervise it.We learned about the areas biology. My daughters could touch star fish, crabs, sponge,and many other little sea creatures.You can observe the fauna that lives under the pier, a sea horse and a jelly fish. Kids can play and read and color.A nice break from the heat and from walking while learning about the sea.I would recommend for families with very small children and to get coupons before you go for the adults. You can find the aquarium at the entrance of pier, below it.",Isa b
40,Nice for young children,"A great intro into Marine Biology for young children. Its small, but interesting. Lots of touch tanks and the staff are friendly, informative, and helpful. I think they are volunteers. Most of the exhibits are local specimens, not a lot of exotic species. Small but again, great for a young persons attention span. Adults who have had limited exposure to marine life will find it interesting and worth the $5 fee.A must for kids when visiting the pier.",dinerdon
40,Santa Monica,"I took my grand-daughter to the Santa Monica Pier for 1 on 1 time for her 3rd birthday. I've been there several times before and it's always beautiful. We went to the aquarium (tiny, so not overwhelming) We then rode the carousel and finally the Pacific Ferris Wheel. All in all, it was a perfect way to spend time with my little one on her special day. The weather as always, was gorgeous!",Dahlia Ruiz G
30,Good for a nostalgic walk and exercise,"Our second visit to the pier saw it with different eyes, a trip back in time. The walk ways have been replaced which was a step towards a facelift. School holidays, very busy, however was good to see the kids enjoying themselves. Love that wheel and its illuminations.",christine c
50,Handy little aquarium,"It has a lot of variety, but it is not overwhelming for young children. You can visit in less than an hour. The volunteers and staff are knowledgeable and friendly.",janejets0n
50,Cute,Super small but still cute. 12 and under area free and I think it was a couple of bucks for the rest of our family. I wouldn't race down there to do that for the day because the whole place will take 30 min. But we still enjoyed ourselves.,CAChristy
40,like it a lot,very well maintained and clean. i love aquariums but this one is one of the best i've ever been to. dont miss it,Ernani94
40,Great affordable family attraction,"We recently visited the aquarium while we were at the Pier. It was an all adult group which was still fun and interesting but if you have children you should put this on your itinerary. It is a very small aquarium but it is very ""hands-on"" and informative in a fun way. There are volunteers throughout that are very helpful and know their stuff. There are several open aquariums that allow you to touch so many interesting things. They had children's table and chairs to sit and color sea life coloring sheets. Definitely worth a visit.",Shelly M
40,Great quick stop for small kids,My husband and I stopped by this aquarium with our toddler when we decided the pier itself was not appealing. It is a little non-profit-feeling place with volunteer-types manning a tiny 3-room operation. Our son really enjoyed some unrestrained exploring time and there is plenty of hands-on stuff to do. It would be a nice activity for early walkers to ~7-8 year olds. Budget 20-60 minutes max for a visit depending on how into coloring (there are some tables for this) or talking to the volunteers your kids are.,beaglebay
40,Nice little aquarium,"I paid $5. My son 12 was free. For sure worth it. Nice little small aquarium. Nice tanks filled with interesting fish like eel, jelly fish sharks etc. Nice petting tank for smaller children. Not to be confused with Monterrey Bay or full size aquarium but for sure glad we went. Nice clean restrooms.",USAtraveler01
40,Cute little place,Went here about....two years ago(may 2013 is as far back as I could go but it was in like 2012) with my mother and my youngest siblings. It was 5 dollars donation and the kids enjoyed themselves. Not a huge aquarium but just right for little ones and if you have limited funds. Someone commented that they were hoping to see dolphins and killer whales...this is an aquarium...not seaworld. Thats in Sandiego.,ParizzA
40,Fun for Kids,The aquarium was small but quite interesting. There were areas where you could pick up things and a great display of sea horses. I think it is great for small children as well as adults.,SBuffalano
30,Extremely small,"Although it's small, there is a good selection of things to look at and touch for kids. However if they've been to larger aquariums, this will disappoint.",AZgyrl
40,Perfect for little kids,We went to this little aquarium by curiosity and it was nice but it is made for small children. Lots of hands on activities and very kid friendly staff. Children were having a great time in there.,sookeod
50,Beautiful view,Relaxing view by the Santa Monica Pier. We had a picnic and listen to people playing music. The aquarium is not what we wanted to see.,Cathy G
40,"Bargain, touch pools",The aquarium was small but very interesting. You just pay a small donation to enter. There is a touch pool and also baby sharks in sacks. The volunteers are very informative.,Coconut_dog
30,It's not the Aquarium,The Aquarium is not what your here for. Your here for the oceanfront scenery and the Santa Monica Pier.,paul_nancy1
30,Was expecting something else...,"But good all the same, we were drawn in by the shark feeding signs. Smaller than expected but I can see if you had children (we didn't) then it would have made the experience a lot better as its quite hands on and there is a couple of kids areas with crafty things for them to do. Still the Jellyfish were awesome and its good to know that the donation is helping the marine life.",Kim C

20,Very tiny....,"It was ok, but I was expecting a large aquarium. Admission for adults was $5 and kids were free so, I guess it was worth the price. Took approximately 20 minutes to view the exhibits.",we_out
50,Love the little aquarium that could!,"I live near the Pier and was so excited when I found the Aquarium. I loved it so much that I started volunteering there! Its small, but so chock full of sea animals to see and touch! The staff and volunteers are helpful and you can get one on one attention that you don't get at the big aquariums. Tuesdays and Fridays are feeding days and you can help feed the sea stars and see the sharks eat! Its well worth it!",nevinbleau
40,Kids loved it!,Great experience for my kiddos and the works where so friendly and engaged with my children at every tank. They enjoying touching and learning about the sea life on display. Small but quaint and a nice way to spend an hour of our day on the pier.,SoniaNManuel
40,Fun,"I love seaside promenades on piers. They are exactly the same no matter where you are in the world. Love in all weather. A fairground, hawkers flogging souvenirs, pencil portrait artists and fast food outlets. Forward view of the sea and sideways the beach in both directions. This one has very cool view's. I never get on a ride, nor buy from the stalls. Generally I don't eat on them but we did have a very good burger here. Aquarium was closed so can't comment. Parkings a breeze.",clarebelleuk
50,Lots of interesting sea creatures!,"I loved this place! I touched sea urchins, star fish, sea anenome, and much more! It's a small place but they have alot to look at. There were sharks and moray eels. I could spend hours here! I thought it was an amazing value as well, since they don't charge entry fees but only ask for you to give a donation. Awesome!!",SouthTexanGirl
40,Nice little trip for those with kids,"It won't knock your socks off, but this is a very nice little attraction that smaller kids will enjoy. The people that work there clearly enjoy what they do, and it's fun to hear them talk about the various little sea critters. This is also a very inexpensive way to kill 45 minutes or so. It's worth checking out.",carter2004
40,Small but quaint Aquarium for kids and family.,"Santa Monica Pier Aquarium (Heal the Bay) is one of the rare jewels you may miss if you have children to have a hands on experience with local sea life. It is located under the Pier when you first hit the beach. It is open after 2pm during the Weekdays and at 12:30 on Weekends and closes at 5. Mondays it is closed. The Aquarium is small but has many stations for children to touch star fish, sea cucumbers, and other sea life. It is a great learning experience for children and adults. I found myself wondering exactly how does a sea cucumber feels like...and found out. ;-) The Aquarium is an addition to other experiences to have on Santa Monica Pier so not a full large scale place. Heal the Bay has a lot of eco-learning programs so children learn about the ocean, the animals living in the ocean and our relationship with it's ecosystem. The staff is friendly and informative...and if you have kids...this is perfect place to have a moment of calm after a long day of activities...only a couple blocks for Third Street Promenade, and Santa Monica Place...plenty of hotels.",Akiko A
40,"Here, Fishy","Santa Monica Pier Aquarium is downstairs at bottom level under the pier and is open Tuesday-Friday 2-5 and Sunday 12:30 to 5:00 but NOT on Mondays. There are a number of hands-on stations for kids which is great because then you don‚Äôt have to keep telling then not to touch stuff and they get more involved. Nice feature to the pier because it is affordable and because of its medium size does not take up the whole day to walk through. Star fish (now called Sea Stars), sea anemones, and some floaties with a lot of good information presented so it is educational, too.",Flynn123
50,Working acquarium,This is a delightful acquarium with much to see and hands on experiences for children. All acquariums are not large....sometimes less is more...we spent over an hour here on our recent visit with our 7 gradnchildren. They squealed with delight at the exhibits and sealife living here. It is a great expression of caring about the sea and its inhabistants!!!,Gran7

40,Good Value,"This is not a big or fancy aquarium, don't have high expectations. But I really enjoyed that it was all local specimens, many were able to be touched, there was friendly, informative staff and I loved looking at the shark eggs! They were very cool. For the price of admission ($3 required, $5 suggested) this place was a bargain.",ColoradoDitto
40,VERY SMALL BUT A NICE BREAK FROM THE BEACH SCENE,"The Santa Monica Pier Aquarium may be small but it is packed with delightful examples of local marine life. It's small but informative and a nice break from the crowded Santa Monica Pier above. It's too small to warrant a special visit on its own but if you are at the Santa Monica Pier, it is well worth the visit. The exhibits are basically in one large room. The highlights are the small sharks, the two huge eels and my favorite, the live seahorse display. I could spend an hour just watching the small seahorses moving about. There is also an exhibit of starfish where you are able to gently touch them and feel their texture.There is an area for kids to draw and learn so it is perfect for families or just for adults who appreciate the beauty of nature.The adult admission is only $3 but they ask for a $5 donation. It's operated by Santa Monica's HEAL THE BAY organization so I felt I was helping a great organization with my donation while also getting to spend a few minutes looking at the great displays.Again, this is a very small but delightful aquarium. If you are in a hurry, you can see everything in 15 minutes or so do as I did. Take a look after all the displays and then return to the ones that really catch your attention and stand back and enjoy. I visited on a busy Sunday at the Pier and the aquarium was not crowded so I enjoyed a peaceful visit. It is worth a visit if you are at the Santa Monica Pier.",Jackbear
40,Nice location,"Inexpensive aquarium with some great displays. Smelled though (like fish, haha) Great location for something different on the pier!",JannieBoo
30,Santa Monica Pier Aquarium,"It's cute .. it's small. It's educational. Ok ... if your kids like to touch things (not pick them up at this aquarium) ... just touch sea cucumbers, crabs, etc ... then go. It's cheap .. it's for a donation. It's a 20 min. aquarium. My kids liked it (10 & 12) and there were some smaller kids who seemed like they were loving it.",mersee
30,Really small but informative and great for kids,"On the last day of our trip, my friends and I visited the aquarium as we were excited to see what it had to offer. Admission fee is just $3 (although the recommended price/donation they state that they prefer is $5) and the moment you get in, what you see is pretty much the whole of the aquarium!All the fish and underwater species they house are from the local area, with helpful volunteers and information articles on hand to explain what they all are. The room is relatively large, housing all the tanks, and there is a separate room screening videos on wildlife such as dolphins and seals etc.The main plus points for this aquarium is the small room with fish samples in jars (as you would find in a science lab) that kids can look at in closer detail, as well as the 'view and feel' tanks, which are open tanks that you can touch and feel species such as starfish and crabs.A great educational venue in a good location and with cheap admission price.",Trailbee
50,Got kids? Then its a must!,Cute little hands on aquarium for the kids. Learn about all the sea creatures in the local waters.The staff is so friendly and helpful.

Even my 11 year old had fun.,KristinaL3

40,Excellent aquarium in a tiny space,"This is a tiny little aquarium, but what it lacks in space it more than make up in quality and interest.
