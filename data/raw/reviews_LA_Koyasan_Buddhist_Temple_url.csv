30,Tranquil spot in busy Little Tokyo,"When visitors visiting Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, a lot of time many visitors focus on food, gifts, and excitement of being in an ethnic community. In fact, Little Tokyo is more complete as an ""ethnic"" community. Other than the nicely designed plaza filled with with restaurants and stores,Little Tokyo also include indoor parking, community center, and community theater. The Koyasan Buddhist Temple is part of the community. Visitors can see that people come to the place to worship, not just to visit. The temple adds another dimension to the community. It is located on 1st street and is tugged in behind the historic buildings on 1st Street, Just walk in to visit while taking a break from visiting the plaza or eating at a restaurant in the area. It is a nice place to give visitors a calm and relax atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
