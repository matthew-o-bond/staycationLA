40,GREAT SMALL LOCAL MUSEUM,"The museum is located in the libruary complex and the parking is very reasonable, it cost us $2.00 to park for over one hour visit to the museum. The museum entrance fee is also reasonable, the staff very friendly and helpful.The rotating exibit now is about Route 66 and is really well done on local history and the road history as well. I have been to a lot of Route 66 museums along the road and this one has some of the best history of the route of any and has exibits of stuff I have not seen anywhere else. Well done!!The other halls of the museum cover different piriods of Santa Monica history from before the Spanash to present, with nice exibits, good signage and presentation.We visited on a Friday morning and were the only visitors in the museum the hour we visited.If you are in the area and want to learn about the local history this is a must visit museum.",707clayg
50,Was there for a Route 66 exhibit.,I was visiting this museum as I had lent the museum some Route 66 collectibles for an exhibition. The museum is not large but they do make the best with the space available. The museum staff is friendly and accommodating.,flyboy1946
50,What a gem!!!!,The Santa Monica History Museum is such a gem! It is located in the heart of Santa Monica and wonderfully displays the rich history of Santa Monica. I learned so much from my visit there along with the information on the website. There are also seasonal exhibits which are fun to check out a few times a year. I recently went to their exhibit on aviation. It was a full room and there was a panel. There is so much to learn about this city and this museum does a great job of helping us all remember.,Zachary B
50,Well above expectation,My friend and I visited the museum and were shocked as to how interesting we found it! John who is the museum manager was enthusiastic and gave us many interesting facts about Santa Monica. Would seriously recommend and thank you again to John!,Ben R
40,Contains exhibits covering several different aspects of local history,"We were keen to understand the history of the Santa Monica area and this small museum attached to the library provided some interesting insights into how the city developed. It comprises several disparate elements, each covering an entirely different aspect of local history. While it did not provide a single cohesive narrative as we walked through, we were happy to spend a couple of hours there.Good points:+ A quiet, tranquil space away from the bustle of central Santa Monica+ Friendly and helpful staff+ Interesting exhibits+ Two accessible toilets close to the exhibition spaceNot so good points:- Rather disjointed with multiple themed areas rather than a single historical narrative or timeline (I thought that the KCRW radio exhibits were overly dominant and out of place, this element would have worked better as a separate side room rather than occupying so much of the main space)- In contrast to the dominance of the KCRW exhibits, the Native American / 'pre history' section was confined to a fairly small side room and could usefully include far more on local flora, fauna, geography and geology as context for the subsequent development of the City- I would have liked to have seen more exhibits covering the City's airport and aircraft industry- Little of interest for children",Corb2000
50,New discovery of Santa Monica,"We can learn the history and other faces of Santa Monica in this museum. I hadn't known about Santa Monica's history at all before visiting here, but now I have a clear image about how this city has developed and attracted a lot of people from all over the world until today. When you come to Santa Monica, I recommend you to visit here first. It is worth of viewing and then you could enjoy Santa Monica much more!",fujikuman0827
40,"Worth a visit, helpful docents, good displays and labels.",This is a visit where you'll learn a lot about Santa Monica. It's connected to the public library which is also an incredible place to park yourself with a newspaper or magazine and people watch or just relax.,Cynthia C
50,A pleasant stop for some local history,"We stopped into the Santa Monica History Museum soon after opening for the day last week. Frankly, I hadn't really noticed it when looking for ways to spend a morning - my daughter's boyfriend suggested stopping by because it sounded interesting. Not being from the area, I had no preconceptions about what it might hold.The museum is a relatively small place next to the library. Street parking was easy to find if you want to go but it's cheaper to park in the adjacent parking facility.The staff is really friendly - although on the day we went the person who greeted us seemed sort of surprised to see us come in. It wasn't very busy but I think that is to be expected for most small historical museums and societies. The space is small but set up nicely. There is plenty of room to move about from gallery to gallery. The permanent exhibits do a very nice job of showcasing early Santa Monica and were interesting to spend some time over. Something that was surprising was a mention of the early segregated beach facilities that existed. Many local museums tend to overlook such things - it was nice to see that this period of time wasn't neglected.This month they had an informative exhibit on the history of the Soldier's Home (now the VA facility). There were a lot of old photographs and displays that were really interesting to look at.I have to admit that one of our favorite exhibits was the one of the Douglas manufacturing plant - specifically a letter written by a young woman working there during the WWII years. For those who don't take the time to read such things you are missing out. It was a pretty funny, open and honest letter that made us laugh at her descriptions of some people she was working with.For those doing research, there looks to be a pretty decent library of local history works as well and a bright and open work space.This is a small museum, yes, and doesn't take up a lot of your time, but it's a nice way to spend an hour.",Dale C
50,What a find,Small tucked behind the Santa Monica Library. It's entrance on the opposite entrance to the library. Fun displays about Santa Monica history. From Shirley Temple to Pacific Ocean Park. Reminders of my days of growing up and visiting Santa Monica.,sunstonetours
40,Interesting and informative,Learning about the city of Santa Monica and seeing all the famous people who lived or worked in the city was particularly interesting. This beach side city has a very interesting past.,sixxmom
50,Shirley Temple on display,On my vacation I visited the Santa Monica museum & although it's a small museum it's a wonderful place to visit & you'll learn alot about the town through the many stories & pictures available at the museum!I was lucky because I went during 'Shirley Temple' month & they offered a wonderful tribute to her!,Lori F
50,Santa Monica History Comes Alive!,"Walk into this museum and 100 years of local history comes alive! Come explore the history of Douglas Aircraft, Muscle Beach, Santa Monica Pier, offshore casinos and famous local athletes and celebrities, chosen from millions of impressive pictures and artifacts owned by the museum! There is currently an extensive collection of perfectly preserved Shirley Temple dresses and precious artifacts, as Santa Monica proudly claims her as one of its native daughters! The museum workers and volunteers seem to be experts in the historical detail and were eager to make my trip enjoyable!",MoatMonster
50,Gem of a museum,"Learn about the history of seaside community of Santa Monica by visiting the Santa Monica History Museum.Upcoming exhibit will focus on former resident Shirley Temple and her accomplishments in the world as a movie star, diplomat.Easy parking at SM Library.",FranChasen
50,Local gem & Unique exhibits,Enjoyed some exhibits. Didn't even know this place was here.Went to see an exhibit and that's how I learned about it.,SMOgal
50,Fantastic local museum,"Celebrating 40 years, the Santa Monica History Museum has thousands of artifacts and pictures, along with special exhibits. See The history of Muscle Beach, Douglass Aircraft, the Evening Outlook newspaper, Art Linkletter, Shirley Temple (born in Santa Monica), P.O.P and much, much more",Terri D
50,The biggest surprise of all is how wonderful this museum is! Please go!,"As a former resident of Santa Monica and someone who is writing a book with many Santa Monica historical elements in it, I could not have been happier to be in this space. The displays were well defined and so pleasing that I did not want to leave. It is not a big museum but it is ""packed"" with simple displays, from the history of the land area, the building of the Aero Theater, and importance of Route 66--all encompassing. Attached, but not connected to Santa Monica Library, this museum is worth the $10. There is a small gift shop area, complete with postcards, books, and other items. It didn't take more than an hour or so to go through everything but I would have spent more time had I known before discovering it late in the day. If I had known this stuff before I moved away from Santa Monica, I might not have ever left. I will definitely return in the future.",Sabrina N
50,Search Out This Gem,"TripAdvisor reviews took us to this gem within the Santa Monica Library complex. It may not be one of the biggest Museum's, but it is precisely because of this smaller size, that we spent time reading in detail, facts and the fascinating background relating to the history and growth of Santa Monica. Apart from the permanent exhibition, there are also temporary displays, including in February, the history of the Valentine card. A visit of an hour or more is highly recommended.",bsandrs
50,A great little municipal museum,"When I stay in a new area, I always make for the local museum. I tend to learn more about an area than I do from guidebooks and they can be very entertaining. This history museum ticked all boxes and gave us the opportunity to visit the adjacent museum.",Anthony D
50,"Way cool for locals or tourists.,..","A tiny place bursting with our Santa Monica history. A great find.Thank you to the Gabriels and the other museum founders/supporters.Filled with old photos & interactive displaysI have to smile. People came to Santa Monica 100 years ago for the same reasons we do today: beach, weather and to relax.Doesn't take long--less than an hour but worth it.Only cost $10 Yes yes yesAs long as you’re here, stop next door at the main library. While I think main library is a disappointment, it’s always good to visit a library!",Summerasalifestyle
50,Spanish connection,Entry is $5 and it is behind the Library and closed on Monday and Sunday. It is not large but worth an hour with the staff who are delighted to take visitors around and explain the history of Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Am amusing souvenir is a copy of the last edition cover of the Evening Outlook newspaper with your photo copied onto front piece receiving an Academy Award. It is worth a visit if you happen to be nearby.,stella w
