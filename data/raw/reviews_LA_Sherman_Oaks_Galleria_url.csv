30,"Not really a mall, rather a tall strip centrer","There is the Arclight Theatres (seats have no padding and are not recliners or reclining) but do have reserved seating. Seats need to be redone - old and flat.Cheesecake Factory, indoor and outdoor seating with heaters (always great), Friedas which took over the El Torito Grill but not half as good, PF Changs and some smaller chain restaurants like FatBurger and Ben & Jerrys. There is a DSW and Paul Mitchell plus Burke Williams Spa and a gym. Validated parking for 4 hours which covers a movie and a meal. Don't ever walk down the area with smaller stores (not many) and mainly go for the movies and Cheesecake Factory. When cold and windy, hard to walk around.There are malls to the east and to the west and north in the San Fernando Valley so this isn't what I consider a ""mall""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
30,Movies and Restaurants only,"We go to the Arclight Sherman Oaks to see most movies due to reserved seating. Parking cost us $5.00 due to Valet Handicap parking. You need a validation up to 4 hrs. to cover the cost. If you park in the north end and walk to the parking structure outside, it is a wind tunnel blowing through the walkway. There is a Frieda's Mexican Restaurant, Cheesecake Factory and PF Chang plus a couple of smaller places for ice cream and burgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
40,Quick trip,OK...there is parking! There are places to eat! There are shops of all kinds! There are places to grab a coffee (Starbucks). Full selection of options! Walking distance to Hotel and other shops. A pretty good drop off point. The place never seemed to busy! Traffic around the Galleria is nuts...ok... this is LA. Perspective.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneT60
40,Good assortment of restaurants,"Lots of eating opportunites here, but not much else. Cheesecake factory, PF Changs, Starbucks, Ben and Jerrys, and a really great little Japanese restarunat with fantastic sushi. Aside from the movie theaters, not much else here. Anchor store (I believe it's called Urban Living), appears to be going out of business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjake2004
30,An Odd Assortment of Stores,"Well, the two best things for me at the Sherman Oaks Galleria are the Arclight Cinemas - and - the 24-hour fitness center. The Galleria has a long isle-way that is like a wind tunnel. It is architecturally designed so that all the wind just goes down that tunnel and it is freezing in the winter and kinda refreshing in the summer. It has an indoor/outdoor thing going on.I have eaten at the Hana Grill and they have excellent food there. It's casual asian cuisine, but it rocks. I also frequent the Robek's and I just love the Fall Pumpkin Spice drinks they have. They have some great smoothies. Of course, Starbuck's is there too.I went in August 2018 and there were some newer stores there that I haven't even seen before. It has been a few months. I saw one store that kinda reminded me of a store that you would see at the airport for various odds and ends. I saw a furniture store but they were already going out of business and was having a sale.I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang’s China Bistro and had my deserts at the Ben & Jerry's even. It is really all about the restaurants there it seems. There was also a Mexican restaurant but I have never tried that.There were only a couple clothing stores on the mall level and they seemed like upper retail dresses and such. Also, I noticed the DSW shoe store is still on the 2nd level.I also saw a day spa and a waxing center which seemed new to me. And the Paul Mitchell School is there too, but it looked closed.They have a pretty big parking garage that also expands into a valet area as well. However, the parking spots are pretty tight. You can validate your parking in several of the stores.Typically, I only go there to work out or to go to the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857dylanv
10,Awful,AWFUL from the minute you walk in until you leave. The music is so loud (mariachis ). Husband said it was the worst $77.00 he’s spent I his life and we go to some 5 Star great places. This is just plain awful. $32. For a buffet of lousy food. Uneatable. Tough and dry chili replenish. The cheese was like a dry rock and the chili you needed a sharp knife to cut! All the rest of the typical Mexican food was equally bad. We asked to sit outside because the mariachi playing in that small room with a low ceiling was deafening. The Champaign would be $15 or $5 for each margarita. The desserts were lousy and ice cream melted. The service was only a matter of walking us to our table and giving us water. Plates weren’t even removed. The fruit was the only thing worth eating. Don’t waste your time or money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
30,Simply Not The Same As In The Days of Moon Unit,"I finally made it to the Galleria and much to my chagrin, it is now mostly occupied by DeVry University and a smattering of stores. The restaurants are okay, but one stands out, Frida Mexican Cuisine. I cannot find this anywhere on Trip Advisor to rate, but it is well worth it. Sadly, the Galleria has lived past its youth and tries to hang on to its adolescence from days gone by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999jimw
30,Good shopping,While in the San Fernando valley check out the Sherman Oaks Galleria which is just off of the 405N. freeway and the 101 highway. It offers a nice selection of shops and food spots and plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Sherman Oaks Galleria,We spent a little over an hour walking around Sherman Oaks Galleria. I hadn't been there in several years and it was quite a surprise with all the new stores. We had lunch and enjoyed our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSO70
40,"Not too big, just big enough","It's a good environment to be in, especially during lunch hour. Great people watching place for me and my 9 year old sonHad lots of good restaurants, like Buffalo Wild Wings where we ate. Restaurants offer parking validation and everything is spaced out and not crowded Open air outdoor mall with a few stores, but not too many. Will definitely come back when I visit the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parksrblessed
20,sherman oaks galleria,was quite different now than when I lived there 26 years ago...mall had wonderful clothing at reasonable prices. now just basically a shell of what it used to be,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gvineyard12016
30,Not the valley mall of yore,Its mostly chain restaurants and a movie theater. Don't expect any shopping to speak of. The parking is super easy and plentiful. If you're looking for a Cher Horowitz experience keep looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelAMullins
40,Good food before movie,Good place for food before movie! Good friendly service at the Mexican restaurant and in the movie too. We went to eat in the Mexican first really good tacos and happy service. Lovely seating outside. Saw the film stone gloves about the boxers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/943lynsieh
30,Small Galleria With A Couple Good Places,"This isn't your standard/traditional shopping center. We go sometimes to the movies here - Arclight - but I hate the seats - far too firm and uncomfortable.I think the only real redeeming factor is that the Cheesecake Factory is here. There is parking, but you will often end up being way far away from where you go up to the shops because the cinema is quite popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaHollywoodMuse
40,"Good location, plenty to do","It's not the Galleria from the 80s, but there is plenty to do.The location is great to meet friends from all over the Valley. Parking is easy if you remember where you park and could you the pay system easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/subrogoddess
50,Great place in the best area of LA,"Sherman Oaks is surely the best place to live or stay in LA: nowhere else you can reach almost anything you need without a car in LA, but here. And Sherman Oaks Galleria is surely a great place to go to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shyanp2015
40,"Stadium Style Arc-light Cinemas, Food and Drinks","Great place to catch movies and lunch or dinner in Sherman Oaks. The theaters are remarkable and there are at least 5 restaurants to choose from for snacks, drinks, lunch or dinner,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeTheHighRoad
30,Home of the Valley Girls ...,"Yes, this is the mall location that's reputed to be the site of reference for the famous / infamous ""Valley Girls"" referring to San Fernando Valley. It's just so small and cramped that you feel boxed in. Some good eateries, but I'd shop elsewhere for convenience and selection. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,perfect place to go for movies,There are a lot of movie theaters so they are never crowded. Went to mocking jay opening night. They had three theaters playing at the same time so my theater was not even half full. That was really enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3066NMsamanthar
40,Not like it used to be... and that's a good thing!,"As other reviewers have said, the ""Valley Girl"" days are long gone. The Galleria is now a very small space with a few stores, a few restaurants and a cinema. But that's not such a bad thing. If you want to take your date someplace that's not quite as hectic or crowded as the larger malls, then the Galleria is perfect. There's a Cheesecake Factory and a P.F. Changs for dinner, then the cinema for a movie, and even a bargain shoe store to browse through and not break your budget if your date finds that ""perfect pair"". Believe me, you take a girl shoe shopping, she will always love you for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egtact
20,Very small,Shouldn't even be called a galleria. Very small number of stores (useless stores) and some restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/younis79
50,Small but Mighty,This mall is small but has quality restaurants and stores. (as well as theater and fitness center) Really enjoyed a dining experience during brunch time at this Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon recently. Loved the food and the prices weren't bad. Service was very good. We sat out on the patio on a beautiful day. Thoroughly enjoyed it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevntrish_10
40,Perfect for a meal & a movie,"This is NOT a place to shop. It is not a mall. Think of it more like a glorified office building that has some cool places to eat, a few shops to browse around, and a fantastic movie theatre. (And a few other things like a 24 hour fitness and a spa.) In other words, you come to do a specific thing, not to just walk around to spend time.If you want to get a lunch or dinner & a movie, it's a great place. Most shops (can't confirm; I know The Cheesecake Factory does, if you eat there) give you a few hours of validation, and the movie theatre gives you 4 hours.The Arclight is a fantastic movie theatre. The sound & picture quality are always fantastic. They also have reserved seating.This is definitely a great place to go if you want a nice (but casual!) date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loudhannah
40,Fun and convenient..,"A little bit of everything for everyone. We usually go for dinner, but they have nice stores, a movie theater and a great atmosphere overall. Don't forget to validate parking ticket which can be a bit pricy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosVent
50,Lots to do,"Parking spots always available. Wish they were a little bigger because it is a hassle to get out of your car and I'm small.Great place to stop if you want a good dinner and a movie, or drinks out.It offers many restaurants such as El Torito Grill, Cheesecake Factory, and P.F. Changs.If you're looking to have a beer with friends and watch a game, it offers a new restaurant...Buffalo Wild Wings, which has plenty of seating of enough TV's to meet any ADHD needs.Oh, and don't let me forget. Burke Williams Spa and 24 hour fitness.Need anything else?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magiw2013
10,Sherman Oaks Galleria - Waste of time!,"I was soooo disappointed in the Sherman Oak Galleria. There were only a couple of stores and the rest food places and a gigantic 24 Hour Fitness. If you are expecting a big shopping place like, South Coast Plaza or The Grove, this is not it. The only redeeming thing was the Cheesecake Factory. Also, parking is $9.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyCO64
