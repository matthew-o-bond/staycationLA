50,Worth a quick visit,"On the way to visit my wife's alma mater, Pepperdine, we saw the sign for KGR. We decided to check it out. It was pretty darn hot that day, so we only toured the Visitors' Center, but it was just great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesj835
50,"Multipurposed, Always Beautiful","The ranch has hosted a famous television weight-loss program and also features a beautiful clubhouse with snacks/drinks and a gift shop for visitors. Take your choice of wandering the spacious, well-shaded lawns or take to the trail, a moderately steep climb up into the surrounding canyons, with great views and photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglasg224
50,Great for seniors in walkers,"We took my 90-year old mom here for an easy outdoors experience and it was perfect. We did not do any of the trails because she uses a walker and is recovering from hip surgery, but she enjoyed the visitor’s center very much (nice short films plus awesome large-scale map of the Santa Monica Mountains). Then we walked around to the mansion and other buildings and wound up in the picnic area by the mansion, lunching under beautiful mature trees. The trees on this property, mostly live oaks and sycamores, are outstanding. Those plus mountain scenery, super-easy walker-friendly roads, impressively clean restrooms, and hardly any people there even on a fine Saturday in late April, made King Gilette an excellent outing for Mom. Perfect for a family outing too: younger folk can do trails while the elders enjoy the gentler pleasures of the trees and visitors’ center. Small kids would be fine too: acres of beautiful grass to play in, under the trees. Mom & Pop could watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicegrrl
40,Serene & Beautiful,Good destination for kids who like the outdoors. Welcome center features information about local animals and the Rangers are very friendly. There is flat walking area. Inspiration point trail is a steeper climb. There are quite a few picnic tables throughout the park and we made a note to come back in summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevonS432
50,Beautiful Scenery,"There was a very helpful ranger at the ranch willing to answer questions. The scenery was beautiful and peaceful unlike the hustle and bustle of the city. It was relaxing. We turned off the PCH to get to the ranch and the ride was hilly, my husband was holding on to the car handle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STCHeather
40,Nice Visitor's Center,"As the father of a toddler, we're always looking for small, interesting excursions to get out of the house for a few hours each day. I discovered the King Gillette Ranch Visitor's Center after seeing a friend's instagram pictures of the old west town at the nearby Paramount Ranch. Look up my review of Paramount Ranch to check that out too. You can do both together on the same day. While at Paramount Ranch, I spoke to someone who worked there that recommended we go to the visitor's center at King Gillette Ranch, and we did.This isn't a huge visitor's center but I thought it was very cool. There are a bunch of displays with buttons that light up, which my son loved. They have a bunch of animal statues, and other neat displays. They also have a movie playing about the Santa Monica mountains, and while it makes me feel like a weirdo that I enjoyed it... I really did! There is also a little shop that sells different items. They actually sell ""local honey"" that comes from Bennett Honey Farm in Fillmore, which led us to visit that place (where you can get the honey WAY cheaper). They have a little outdoor area too where my son likes to walk around and sit on benches. His favorite thing is probably the nice water fountain out front!This review is just for the visitor's center. I've never actually done any of the hikes, but there is that too! I love finding little random or hidden places to see with my son, and this is a nice one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Nice hike,"We took a walk up to Inspiration Point and around a one mile circuit. Good views and easy walk. First part was a bit steep, so it got our hearts pumping, but after that it was either flat or downhill. Lots of shade and beautiful flora. There was a longer circuit which we did not take. The museum was interesting, too. They had picnic tables, bathrooms and rangers to answer questions. Very nice facility. The ranch house is not open for visiting but our walk led us around the grounds and the house. This ranch is located in the Santa Monica Hills where there are many other open space areas with lots of hiking. Trail heads are numerous and maps are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedlite
10,AWFUL EVENT EXPERIENCE!!!,"DO NOT plan an event here!!! Horrible experience with the LA Mountains/NPS staff!I recently had an event at King Gillette and the event coordinator for LA Mountains/NPS, Joan Pankratz, is a nightmare to work with. Not only did she over charge us for the space but she also kept the security deposit because we didn't clean up EXACTLY on the 4 hour mark. Even though we left the location spotless and better looking than we found it. Even the stone kitchen area was swept clean. She stays and watches every thing you do for the whole event time.Months prior to the event, we tried to get in touch with her during the planning process and she was always on ""vacation"" and took forever to send over paperwork or even a simple email to answer questions we had. When I saw her in person, she even told me it was her first event at King Gillette and she hadn't been there in a long time... meaning, she made up an absurd price to charge and had no idea what the venue looked like at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lenny4992
50,Specials!,They have groups scheduled such as Navajo rugs with a person demonstrating how they are made.There are paths for walking/hiking. The hawks are seen hunting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schreiber11

50,LOVE this hike and area!,Part of the Santa Monica Mountains - great ridge line views - FANTASTIC Visitor's Center - clean restrooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvidTraveler507
50,Visitor Center is sma,"Visitor Center is small but is packed with things to do and learn. Check their schedule first as they often have programs that you may be able to listen to while on your visit. If you like to hike, you are close to the old Ronald Reagan ranch as well as Malibu Creek State Park (that still has remnants of some of the movie/tv sets). There's a shady spot by the center with picnic tables and great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilief2014
50,Great Place To Spend Time,This is one of those places that have so much history and you can only imagine the grander of days gone by. An abundance of trails to walk and the beauty make it a must stop to spend a few quiet hours and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nevada_Travelers_R-B

This is a great place to being a picnic with lots of room to wander.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632

40,King of the Mountains ...,"We always enjoy visiting the King Gillette Ranch this time of year before it gets too hot, and before the summer crowds show up. It's a pastoral setting on Mulholland between Malibu and Calabassas sited on gently rolling country. Has a great visitor's center which outlines the history, has exhibits & dioramas, and has a quaint little gift shop. There's a stream, ponds and lots of trails to hike. The original mansion and other structures are across the stream. Nice! Enjoy...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Pristine environment which shares original California natural ambiance.,"Easily bypassed by ripe for exploration the ranch has a welcome center and docents to bring you up to speed on events, native animals and flora with pictures; picnic areas and structures to investigate. They invite weddings, parties and picnics as well.One of the most stunning locales in the Santa Monica Mountains, 588-acre King Gillette Ranch is situated in the heart of the Malibu Creek Watershed, by the confluence of five major tributaries, and adjacent to Malibu Creek State Park. This scenic parkland at the lower end of the Las Virgenes Valley is a haven for larger mammals of the Santa Monica Mountains. At the same time, it offers a rare unspoiled view of California’s rich archeological, cultural, and historic resources, including a Chumash settlement, and nationally significant structures designed for razor magnate King C. Gillette in the 1920’s by Wallace Neff, architect of California’s Golden Age. (from overview)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjblock
50,Great museum on the Santa Monica Mountains,Great museum on the Santa Monica Mountains. It offers an overview on wildlife and plants that are commonly found in the mountains. The main house is worth a look. Unfortunately it is not open to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Beautiful King Gillette Ranch with A Scenic Visitor Center and Helpful Ranger,"We went to King Gillette Ranch which is in the Santa Monica Mountains. There are hikig opportunities in this scenic park. While we were at the park, we also visited the visitor center there. The full name of that center is Santa Monica Mountains Anthony C. Beilenson Interagency Visitor Center. The visitor center is manned by a park ranger, who was very helpful in answering the questions we had.There is also a movie to see on the area. There is also many exhibits in this beautiful visitor center.I liked the map of the Santa Monica Mountain area. There is animal, water, Hollywood, landscape, and other exhibits.It was free of charge with free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Brief Visit but well worth it,We visited to find out information for the park area and were very grateful for the friendly and information welcome we received. The film was a great introduction to the area and the things to be sold were interesting and different. We were grateful for the information about the Paramount Western Ranch set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djne11026
40,Quiet park,"King Gillette Ranch is a quiet park to take a stroll amongst nature. It is also free. There is also a pond with some ducks. The visitor's center needs some maintenance on the outside, but the inside of the visitor's center is nice inside with some educational exhibits. The parking is free for the first 2 hours when you park at the visitor's center. This is also the location where ""The Biggest Loser"" is filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveler78

40,Good hike,Stopped by on a Monday. First at the Visitor Center where I grabbed a map. There's free 2 hour parking there. To park for longer it's $7 in a lot just around the corner. I did the hike up to Inspiration Lookout and made it there and back in less than 2 hours. The hike isn't too strenuous but it is on an incline. The view is amazing. The mountains surround you on all sides. Awesome even on an overcast day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Beautiful vistitors center in Santa Monica Mountains,"We went here for first time last weekend to the Bird Fest show and were very impressed with the visitors center.At the visitors center they have a small museum of flora and fauna of the area and rooms for presentations and small group meetings. There are also several trails and walks around the facility for bird watching, walking and jogging. There is plenty of parking available and very nice restroom facilities.While at Bird Fest we attended several presentations and also went on a ranger led bird walk.We didn't know this visitor center existed. Can't wait to go back and utilize this fine facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig-World-Travelle

50,Good place to start your Santa Monica Mountains visit,"This is the headquarters for the Santa Monica mountains staffed by Federal rangers, state rangers and county rangers as all 3 groups control areas in the Santa Monica mountains.

Keep walking and you will never have to walk into this gym.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
50,Santa Monica National Park VIsitor Center,The Santa Monica Mountains Visitor Center is located on the same site. It is a valuable resource for information on the wide variety of things to do in the area. The exhibits are informative and it's a great place to go with kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22scadoo
50,A Fabulous Place!,"My wife found a write-up on the King Gillette Ranch in Sunset Magazine, so we decided to try it. It is still being developed, but is a great place for a picnic, a short hike to inspiration point, or a longer hike up the ridge trail.I remember this ranch from my childhood - we'd drive by on our way to the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h2odel
40,"Razors, the Biggest Loser and Visitor Center","King Gillette Ranch was originally built in the late 1920’s for King Camp Gillette who is widely credited with the invention of the safety razor but in reality only improved upon earlier versions and developed a low cost, disposable version. We initially came here to visit the Santa Monica Mountains NRA Interagency Visitor Center which offers an introductory movie, a number of good exhibits and a staff to assist in planning your visit to this large Recreational Area. This is where we learned of the Ranger guided tour of the nearby Paramount Ranch, an old Western movie set, which turned out to be the highlight of our visit to the Santa Monica Mountains. However, there is much more here than the Visitor Center, there is a picnic area, garden with local flora and interpretive signs, the beautiful “ranch” and a few shorter hiking trails through the hills behind the mansion which serves as the set for The Biggest Loser reality show. During our visit they were setting up to film the next season so we could only view the mansion from the edges of the grounds. We also hiked the 1 mile loop trail in hills behind the mansion which was a pleasant walk through the Mediterranean environment of the Santa Monica Mountains and provided overlooks of the ranch grounds, The Biggest Loser set and the nearby Malibu Creek State Park and one can almost see the choppers at the beginning MASH, which was filmed here, coming over the hills. There is free two hour parking available near the Visitor Center and for longer parking, there is paid parking close to the mansion but the cost seemed rather steep; fortunately, two hours was just about right for a visit to the Visitor Center, a walk through the garden, the grounds and the loop trail. The ranch facilities are definitely worth a visit, especially if new to the Santa Monica Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve5863
50,Great place to check out!,We decided to check out King Gillette Ranch because the Biggest Loser is filmed there. Since it was a weekend they were not filming and we were able to walk the grounds and take plenty of pictures. The welcome center is beat to check out as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoliSciGuy24
50,Well Done,"We visited the park last month when they were having a Mexican art show. We had never been there before and really enjoyed it. The visitor's center is quite nice, there is ample parking, and the gardens are beautiful. I highly recommend it for a relaxing afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roa5980
