50,"The museum is such a hidden gem, wonderful experience!","There is not much thing to do in Covina. So if you stop by this city, you must visit this art museum. The museum is a hidden gem, and it contains more than 200-piece artwork.The sculptures are breathtaking. I went there on a Saturday morning, so the Peerless treasure room is open for public. I heard usually the room only open for a group visitors more than 10. I am so lucky to see this room. The Chinese painting are vivid. Highly recommend for family visit, the kids gonna love it. Plus, the museum is free admission.",Lisa K
