50,History in my own back yard,If ever visiting this area. Remember this hidden treasure is here. Beautifully displayed. Excellent Docents who explain everything from the way adobe brick was made to the feeding of the two hundred ranch hands and service workers. The maze bowl in which the tortillas were made was huge. I loved this place. To know that the air field on the Dominguezâ€™ land ( modern day Carson) houses the Goodyear blimp. The Porche race track also sits on this original land. So much history. These were wealthy Spanish people who married into the Delamo family. Carson family. Sepulveda was a squatter on their land. There are streets in this community named after these people. Excellent piece of history.,Sherelle D
40,Very interesting and well explained by the Tour Guide,We visited the Adobe Museum when attending a re-enactment in the same grounds.(The quaintly named Battle of the Old Woman's Gun).Tranquil setting. You get a conducted tour of the D R Adobe Museum and from this we gained an excellent insight into the historical struggle for California.Beautiful grounds and we especially liked the cactus garden.,BobandJosie
40,Beautiful well maintained adobe,"Show up on the hour for the tour, there are no self-guided tours. The docent was very well informed and interesting, and was kind enough to let us into a tour 12 minutes late, then show us what we missed. The adobe has an interesting history including early aviation shows.",barbgal
50,Quiet jewel in our back yard,"Looking for something to do on a laid back week end, I found myself touring the Domingquez Rancho Adobe House. After living in the South Bay area for many years, I just became aware of the historical sites in our area. The Domingquez site is situated just off Alameda Street surrounded by a lovely green property. You cannot see it from the street and it is easy to miss but also easy to get back to. The house is very well maintained and nicely appointed. Our tour guides were two lovely interns who were well-informed and patient enough to answer all of our questions. There was no rushing through the museum. It's the perfect thing to do on a quiet day because it is right nearby, interesting, and peaceful.",kelly o
