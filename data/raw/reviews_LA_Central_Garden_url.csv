40,One of our favorite places at the Getty Center,My wife fell in love with this meandering but well designed garden that for some people is the higdden in plain sign gem of the fabulous Getty Center museum. Hint: There are five small bridges over the stream that crosses the garden and on each bridge the sound of the water is different. Lots of other surprises.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
20,Less Than the Sum of Its Parts,"This is a grand example of what a garden in Los Angeles should not look like. Planted with all imported species, many of which do poorly in our climate unless supplied with copious extra water and care, this garden is as inappropriate to our climate as woolen underwear. Great place to eat and watch the sun set on Los Angeles. Highly recommended for romance, but it's not a ""garden"" experience.",
