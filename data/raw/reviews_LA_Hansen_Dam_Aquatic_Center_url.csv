40,Great pool for kids!,"I went with my 2 and 4 year old children. The pool is big and shallow. They also have an area with a slide (I did't explore it) There are plenty of life guards on site. You can take your food, beverages and beach accessories. They rent cabanas ($30 -cash only) for the whole day. There is also a food truck inside the park. They have plenty of restrooms. I didnt give it a 5 star because the restrooms are really far away from the cabanas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lola_Fox_2018
40,Hidden Gem is a MUST for hot days with children!!!,"This is for sure a hidden gem in the valley that is a MUST for all parents with children who need a break from the hot summer days! This is a GIANT pool complete with two large water slides!!! I have a 3 year old, so he couldn't do the slides, but the best thing about this pool is that it's almost like a beach where all around you walk in. It's really wonderful.And get this... it's only $1 for kids and seniors and $3.50 for adults!!! I mean, come one!!! That's great! You can pay extra for cabanas and what not, but we got there early and just go a nice shaded area.Okay... they are strict for rules here, so check their website. It's easy to get frustrated by that, but really it's all for safety and their safety record is off the charts! You have to have a 1-to-1 parent/child ratio until the child is 6. So if you have 2 kids under six, you have to go with a second adult. They're also strict about about can go on the water slide. My wife couldn't where her sun protector and I had to rip out those little metal circles they put in swim trunks.But all that aside... bring a picnic! Towels! Chairs! Maybe even a table and grill!!! This is a super fun place to go to save you from the hot summer!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
