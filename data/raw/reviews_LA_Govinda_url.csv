50,Wonderful and meditative,"Go there frequently to recharge psychic energies in times of strife. It is far from where we live but worth the time going there to repeat the long ago learned mabreak:I can fast, I can think, I can wait.Well, exclude the fasting for the food is delicious. I think the services are beautiful and the Beatles were there once back in the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamg36

50,Terrific Vegetarian Food,"We had a tour of the Krishna temple and a great meal at the Govinda restaurant. The halvah, very different than halvalh sold in Jewish delis, it was more of a sweet couscous. The salads were aslo tasty. My favorite was the curry saue and rice and the steamed vegetables.The ginger beer is a good way to top off the meal.Some people gripe about the setting. The restaurant is in a residential neighborhood and is part of the Krishna Center. eating here is part of the experience of visiting the Krishna community. If you are expecting McDonalds or Chilis go elsewhere.The restaurant is popular with people working in the movie studios nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
