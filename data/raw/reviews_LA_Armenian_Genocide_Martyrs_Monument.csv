50,Historic place,"This monument has been there around 50 years. It is a reminder of the first genocide of the century, which happened in 1915. Armenians gather there and say prayers every year on April 24. It is on a beautiful location.",hadikranian
40,Impressive Monument,"A beautiful, large monument. We made viewing this a part of a day trip from Los Angeles. We started at the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum. Followed by a visit to the Puente Hills Mall, which is the ""Twin Pines Mall"" from Back To The Future"". Then had a lovely visit to the His Lai Temple... and rounded it out with a visit to view the Armenian Genocide Martyrs Memorial Monument. We never would have know about it if it weren't for the sign on the side of the highway. There isn't much to ""do"" here... but for a monument, it's pretty epic. I wish there was a hint more information about the place... It may have been under where everyone put the flowers... but it seemed sacrilege to move them to read the info. There is a plaque, but I feel like there could be more info there.",Michael T
