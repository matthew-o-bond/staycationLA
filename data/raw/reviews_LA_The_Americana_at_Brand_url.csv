50,This outdoor mall is more family destination than shopping experience — and that's perfectly fine,"There are some malls where you go to shop. That mall is conveniently located across the street. The Americana at Brand is an experience, and one worth repeating even when you have nothing to purchase. A trolley, elegantly choreographed water fountains, and curated green spaces invite you to enjoy the central square (much like a piazza) with your family. This is the perfect place to hang out while ""the shopper"" among you hits the stores.Not to be missed: the outdoor patio inside Barnes & Noble, and the rooftop bars and restaurants that give you the bird's-eye view of it all. And when hungry stomachs prevail, there are literally dozens of restaurants within a short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christopher_E_Haigh
40,Pleasant place to spend a few hours,"This is one of those manufactured experiences, like Disney. You've got Bellagio type fountains dancing to music, a wide green space for picnics, and a trolley that moves painfully slow through out the area. But it's all very pleasant and family friendly. As shopping goes, it's mostly very high end, like Tiffany and Nordstrom's, with a couple of specialty shops and an Amazon brick and mortar store, plus a movie theatre. It's also got a Cheesecake Factory and a number of small cafes and restaurants. It's one of those places where you feel safe with the family and to grab a bite or a movie or just watch the fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewM27

Those even in and out burger around the corner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515
40,Great for strolling and people watching,"Though I'm not much of a 'high end shopper'-this place was fun to stroll through and do some people watching. Window shopping, taking in the beautiful water foundation and grassy park in the center of this outdoor mall, was a pleasant way to recover from jet lag before encountering DTLA and NoHo. There is another huge shopping mall across the street with a variety of shopping options and parking garage. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MG02116

There aren't much stores in this mall compared to the one right across it, most stores are high end specialty shops, but this is the best place to dine in. The best is still Cheesecake Factory (even though the line can get long). This mall also has a movie house. Parking is a bit expensive, so whenever I visit, I park at the one located at Artsakh street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bianxdr
50,Stylish stroll through Glendale,The Americana at Brand is one of the very few places I have been to that give you that European piazza style feel. It is not too big and not too small. The lovely boutique stores and stalls has a bit of everything for all members of the family. The main water fountain is absolutely thrilling for young and old and is a definite eye catcher. We found ourselves staring at the water jets on a few occasions. The overlooking condos are quite impressive and the gorgeous surroundings allows one to enjoy the beautiful SOCAL weather. This is a must see if you happen to be in Glendale. It is a touch touristy but with a Drybar hair salon a Barnes and Noble bookstore and restaurants like Katsuya and cheesecake factory and Nordstrom the entire family will be satisfied. Definitely will go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarMan6

50,Everything you need1,"The AMERICANA is a delightful place to people watch, shop, go to the movies, have fine dining and sit and watch the fountains.

50,SO CLEAN and enjoyable!,"Outdoor shopping, and even several areas to stop and just ppl watch. This was not far from our hotel and we enjoyed it very much! Save money on parking and go behind the Glendale Galleria and park for free, and just walk out the mall entrance vs paying $10-20.00 for parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145missyr
50,Amazing Place!,"We bump to this place unexpectedly because we intended to visit Sugarfina for candies!This is a very very very beautiful place I can said which the concept of the buildings integrated with residential, nice restaurants, shopping houses, library, coffee houses and the fountain view!We came back 2nd time for the lunch and hang around and we back to the same Japanese restaurant for dinner. I can't imagine I can hang such place for lunch till late night. There have a famous Cheesecake Factory which the cakes taste very nice! There have a performance fountain with musical which was so mesmerising and the ambience was so relax and peaceful. We did spend time at Noble and Barnes which there have a balcony can view the overall fountain view. Such a relax place to hang and definitely will come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleyymk87
20,Not my favorite,"I guess if you're a big shopping fan, this might be a nice place to go. But I hate the parking (big, generic parking garage--hard to navigate), and the fake, Disneyland-ish attempt to make it seem, I don't know, natural, but not? If you want the park, go to a park, not a fake park in the shopping mall. Usual shops, hard to access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaM974
50,What an amazing mall,I have to say this is one if the most attractive mall I have ever been to. The whole thing is a relaxing experience from parking to wondering in the air conditioned shops. Great design and blown away just enjoying the water jets and swing music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nenners56
10,Gift Card Beware,They should tell you when you get a Caruso gift card for their stores at The Grove or Americana it deducts from your balance if you don’t use it for 12 months up front. I would have used it right away had I known and just lost $$$ because of it.Very silly policy. Real bummer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTE323
50,I enjoy going to Americana at Brand,"This is a beautiful shopping environment where you can shop, dine and meet friends. In this season I go there every night. I enjoy waking at nights. I find this place very safe and entertaining. Lots of restaurants and shops. I usually eat at Cheesecake Factory. I love there herb rubbed salmon and the bread is delicious. I spend lots of time in Nordstrom. I love everyone that works in Chanel boutique. To name a few of the girls that usually help me is Natalie, Monique, Talar and everyone else. I can’t remember everyone’s names, but everyone is nice at Nordstrom. I love that store and always shop there. I also stop at Sees candies 🍭. I love, love, love.......their chocolates. I get my coffee at Barns and Noble. They have Coffee Bean at the second floor. They have a balcony overlooking the fountains. It has a beautiful view. If you are visiting LA, Americana at Brand is a must see place. You will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlalik
50,Great place to walk,"I love americana, we go every weekend, we get ice cream, we eat ,we go to the movies, we walk and we watch the water fountains",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penaclementina
40,Beautiful but crowded on the weekends,"The American is a beautiful outdoor mall with green lawns , a trolley ride and a spectacular water fountain. The shops are mostly high end, Tiffany’s, JnCrew, Anthropology, Calvin Klein ect. There is a great selection of teas truants with lovely outdoor seating. The movie theater has 18 screens and almost always availability. It’s a nice place for dinner and a movie. Also the parking is fairly convenient. That said it can be very crowded on the weekends. If you like the energy of people coming and going and enjoying the park like atmosphere it’s the place for you. If you want peace and quiet go during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daraadf
50,Perfect Weekend spot,If you’re looking for a place to dine and shop the Americana is the spot for you. Several great retail shops and great places to dine. Not to mention they have an 18 stadium theater. If your looking for more shops the Glendale Galleria is right across the street. Why not indulge in a weekend filled with food drinks and shopping!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javi83er
40,Great Place to Enjoy the Day,"Recently I was having my car serviced in Glendale and while waiting I decided to walk over to The Americana at Brand. Previously, I had only visited the Americana during the nighttime hours but, this is a great place to visit during the daytime hours as well. I wandered around and enjoyed the pleasant music, the beautiful foliage, and the friendly people.Before I knew it the time had come to pickup my car and I found myself sad that I had to leave The Americana so soon. I will definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summervacationeer

30,Disneyland fir Shoppers,"Mixture of high end (Tiffany) and work-a-day (Barnes & Noble) shops, including a multiplex cinema. Very pleasant grounds with a cute trolley that makes a trip around the facility at times. I couldn't find a trolley schedule - maybe evenings and weekends? Not a must-see, but pleasant place with lots of outdoor dining, a fountain pool that sometimes does tricks, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationer612564
50,A great shopping experience,"This is very similar to the famous Grove without the farmers market attached. A nice selection of shops and it's unique in the fact that above all the stores are residential condos.

50,Lovely place to stroll,We took an afternoon stroll at The Americana to unwind after a day of crazy LA traffic. The ground is very well kept and dotted with variety of stores for those who want to browse or shop. Thoughtfully placed little kiosks offering tempting treats with inviting seatings make it lovelier to brake for an ice cream. Eateries are all around so we ended up having our dinner there as well.Might be easier to park across the street at the old Glendale Galleria where there are ample parking spaces and just walk across street. I don't think there is any time limit on the parking which makes it easier to linger.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suwannac2016
40,An LA-Style Outdoor Mall,"I am at this mall often, although rarely for shopping. Most of the stores are higher end than I usually shop at, so I tend to hit Sephora or Apple only. There are a lot of good dining options which is why I am usually here. The display at Christmas is outstanding. You can get parking validated with a purchase but only for a couple hours. I tend to park across the street for free at the Galleria and walk over if I need to go to both malls or will be longer than the validation offers. This mall is very busy on the weekend and during the holiday season. It's great for people watching, all kinds of folks are strolling around here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/world_in_my_eyes
50,Magical ✨,"This is like the Disneyland of malls—completed with fountains, music, picturesque streets, and even security guards wearing retro outfits.

Even if you’re not interested in shopping, it’s still a great way to walk around and chat with your friends while enjoying the beautiful area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0DY6
40,Even validated parking will cost you,My sister and I spent the afternoon here. We decided to see a movie after lunch. The theatre offers 4 hour validation with proof of purchase. We were there maybe 5 hours total and had to pay $11 to exit. Parking is such a joke in Glendale. No such thing as free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compcrzy
50,Plenty To See and Do,"Whether it’s the dancing fountains, beautiful nighttime scenery, upscale shops, the 18-screen cinema or inviting restaurants, there are hours of fun and enjoyment st the Americana. We enjoy just walking around the place, eating in one of the many restaurants or just having a cup of joe at one of the cafes around. The indoor Galleria mall is just steps away. Free garage parking is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
30,Great upscale outdoor mall,"Nice place to visit walking around in a circle checking out the very expensive shops. Has great eating places also at a high price tag. The free part is watching the water fountain with its dancing water show. Went this weekend at night very bad idea Crowded Stroller kids selfies, no one watching where their weee going and not caring. Nice mall for dinner, strolling, watching the fountains. Stay away on holiday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912vickik
50,"Love, love, love this mall","Not your typical mall in any country, but you would never imagine you're in LA when visiting this mall.We stumbled across this mall several years ago and made a special trip here this time and we weren't disappointed.It is Christmas and the entertainment is fabulous.

Santa was set up for photos, the area was decorated with lights and music playing in the outdoor area gets shoppers in the Christmas spirit, whether you celebrate Christmas or not, it is a lovely experience to warm the heart.Oh! and we did a spot of shopping too, although I couldn't tell you how many stores are here as we really enjoyed the entertainment more than the shopping.We parked in the Galleria, shopped there and then wandered over to Americana.

50,"Clean, Safe, and Fun","My wife and I recently stayed at a nearby hotel and stumbled upon The Americana at Brand. First and foremost, yes, it's a shopping center with restaurants. That being said, unlike many things in the L.A. area, it felt clean and safe. It's a great stop for you shopaholics with a tempting credit card (or not so great if you're in recovery). I enjoyed that there were a ton of places to shop both indoors and out and maintained decent standards. The restaurant selection nearby was great and offered everything from quaint local dives to the familiar chains and fancy tastes. If you are looking for a great way to kill some time or enjoy shopping and cuisine, this is a worthwhile stop. My wife and I were there near the holidays and the outdoor shopping area was lit up with a beautiful display of lights and had a fun water feature as well.

It seems there was something going on at every turn - fabulous shops, a wonderful array of restaurants and bars, a dancing fountain, a bandstand complete with live jazz band and people kicking back in the lawns availing themselves of the blankets available to enjoy the music and ambience.

It is full of cute shops, restaurants, theater, fountains and a nice grassy area near the fountains to just bring a picnic blanket and people watch with an ice cream cone. It is closed off to traffic so it is very pedestrian friendly. So much to see and do in one spot. Don't miss it. It's worth stopping to check it out. This shopping area is very well planned and thoughtful in the way they designed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaf761

50,An entertaining date night,"We were staying in Sherman Oaks and looking for a reasonably close date night. We ended up here and had a lovely time walking around until we found a restaurant we wanted (tried to stay away from chains we have in our area). The fountain resembles the Bellagio one, in sync with Sinatra music. There is a nice faux lawn where children and families played. We appreciated the free parking (after being validated at the restaurant we selected, Amici Italian). We wanted to go to the Las Vegas seafood buffet, but the line was out the door! If we had come a bit earlier, we could have enjoyed the happy hour specials at many of the restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitney629
40,A Brief Escape,"This is a great outdoor mall; probably one of the best I've seen. I knocked off one star for two reasons: I don't need to hear Frank Sinatra all the time, in fact, ever, and the statue is well, horrible. I call it the Great Retail God. Say a prayer at it's anatomically too-large feet, 'cause the prices here are way up there and you're gonna need sales - but for window shopping, it's great. Nice place to hang. If you want to re-live your amusing adolescent memories of hanging out at the mall, it's quite the hang-out for Glendale teenagers on a weekend night. Also a hangout for young moms with babies on the weekdays. It opened during the nadir of the Great Recession, and when I would go there, my concerns for people losing their homes and jobs just melted away. It's always happy here no matter who's in office; some would call that artificial, but in a tense city like L.A., it's kind of refreshing, at least for a couple of hours. Then it's back to reality.

The central area gives a town square vibe to the area. During the Holidays it can be quitefestive and jolly. You can eat or shop outside which is a plus.

It is well lit so there isn't much to worry about in terms of safety. There are movie theaters to catch the latest film and the restaurant quality is pretty good.If you are coming here specifically to complete all your Christmas shopping, a mall may provide more options in terms of stores. If you're just looking to do some window shopping or check out a few popular stores while eating some ice cream then Americana will be more than enough.Overall: I would recommend this place to a friend.

50,If you must shop with teenagers...here ya go!,"We took an Uber over this location because my daughter wanted a cupcake out of a ATM machine ...that would be Sprinkles . What the heck , why not . They actually are pretty darn good . Once she was good and sugared up she wandered over to the open park area ...which is great for people watching , fountain watching and for my teenage dancer? A open spot to do aerials .There are a few good tourist friendly restaurants like Katsuya and Cheesecake Factory. Stores that you see in most malls like Apple , Forever 21 and H&M .If they say malls are dying then this place might be the new concept to keep retail stores alive . It has retail on the main floors and gorgeous residential apartments above . There is a trolley that runs through the shopping center.

SHE always greets with a smile ..i always make a point THAT I leave her a "" tip"" . She always makes the women's restroom look clean and smells clean. She deserves an appreciation.

40,"Wonderful Mall even after all these years, except for parking fees",Still a good mall with upscale stores and good restaurants. It was under renovation when we visited. But it is almost against the law for a mall to charge mall patrons to park. Really? Don't the stores want people to shop and linger and spend money? Versus thinking about the cost of parking while they strolled around?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacklD5839DS

50,Lovely outdoor makl,I'm a fashion buyer for a living so there is no doubting I shop at a lot of malls around the world.What I like about this mall is that it is outdoors and has a great ambience. You can dine in the outdoor restaurants and you feel more like you are in Europe than in an American shopping mall.The mall is immaculate and has a small selection of great stores anchored with a Nordstrom. It has more upmarket high street stores but not high end stores.There is a gorgeous fountain in the middle and a strange tram like cart you can hop on and off of if you can't be bothered to walk the 1000m this mall is!!! I guess it's sweet for novelty factor.Across the road is Glendale and this is a bigger indoor mall but much more american and has more down market stores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calamitycastle
40,Romantic and charming,"The best free thing to do in Los Angeles, other than visiting the beach, is going to Americana, pulling up a chair, and watching the water spectacle synchronized to music at the beautiful outdoor fountain. I'm usually rushing around trying to experience the most out of life, and this is one of the few truly relaxing, peaceful things I do all year. It's an oasis of pleasant experiences, picturesque surroundings, and pure happiness in the midst of a crazy and exciting city!A trolley slowly makes its way through the shopping area, a waterfall soothes your soul, the chatter of people at the outdoor patios sets the soundtrack for a delightful stroll. There are many stores to visit and validation for parking at all restaurants.At Christmas, the massive tree replete with decorations and lights strung up everywhere are absolutely charming, capturing the feel of small-town America even though, geographically, you're far from it. If you want a romantic date, this is the place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamWillieWilson
40,Shopping!,"The Americana is a good place to shop, eat and hangout with friends. I like it here since it is also just across from the Glendale Galleria Mall so you have extra more place to shop if you do. It find anything you like at the Americana. This place also has ample of parking or you can always park at the Glendale Galleria Mall which is always free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaindl
40,Beautiful mall,"Go there even if you do not need to shop. It's neat just to walk around and enjoy the scenery, beautifulStore fronts, dancing fountains, upscale eateries. We went twice today. This morning to shop and this evening for a movie. Use their parking garage. First hour is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heb2013
40,Romantic and fun,If you go at night the fountain looks great when it is lit up. There is always old music playing and it's hustling and bustling all the time. There are lots of fun restaurants and shops to check out as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethW1548

40,Touristy but nice,"A fun place to hang out... The shopping at Glendale galleria is good and the restaurants and atmosphere just round the corner at Americana makes it a good place to visit, we ate at the Cheesecake Factory which was very good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sufiahw
50,$$$,If you love hoards of people and expensive stores and a trolley that literally goes in a small circle this is a perfect place for you. I am still trying to figure out the hanging chandelier in the open air that looks to me like a second thought . I also am not to keen on the statues in the water. The best thing if any is the fake snow they blow out during the holidays. My advice if you don't have money stay away! It is really overpriced and has turned our quaint Glendale into a nite-mare at the holidays. Not my favorite thanks to Mr. Caruso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevenss
50,A beautiful place,"While staying at the Glendale Hilton, we were able to take their free shuttle to this mall. We had a really nice visit that included going to a movie and dinner.

Books and small one of a kind gifts.you have to pay for parking in the parking structure. some people park in the Galleria and walk over.the Americana does validate for a period of time. i believe the theater validates for 4 hrs. but watch your time as if you are 15 minutes over you get charged the full hr.but great place for families and out of town visitors. you can just sit outdoors and not spend alot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the-duos
40,Very nice atmosphere,"I go to the Americana to have a change of scene. I don't buy much there, though I like certain shops. There is a really nice atmosphere and it's fun to just walk around.

50,Quality time in Americana,Nothing Compares or comes close to the Americana. The atmosphere and the vibe made me feel like I was thinking and Europe. The restaurants for little upscale but the quality and the service is well worth the price. There's also local vendors for those on a budget. Between the Grove and Victoria Gardens I prefer the Americana. They're just so much to do NC you're really have a good time. And plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920johnnyv
40,"Lovely ""European"" urban area in L.A.","No offense meant - but this area that looks like a sophisticated European district is one of the finest areas in L.A. and uplifts that - otherwise mostly dull - town.

The large central pools and water displays provide a cool, pleasant back-drop to this open-air mall, and there's plenty of parking.The shopping is even more convenient, with the Galleria (with dozens more shops) just over the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikebarie
40,Colorful Decoration,"We met our friends here for lunch and saw the Xmas decoration. It was very pretty, even during the day. After having lunch and a long coffee with our friends somewhere else, outside the mall b/c we could not go up to the Griffith Observatory due to heavy traffic, we went back to this place around sunset since heavy traffic around LA. It turned out it was also a good idea b/c it was so beautiful when the lights came on... It's good for shopping (of course) with many places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tn258

50,Shopping the Americana Way,"The Americana & The Grove have brought back the allure of mall shopping experience to Los Angeles in an open space.Parking: You can self-park or valet. You get 1-hr free self-park, which you can validate for up to 2 to 3 hours, at Nordstrom, the theater or at the concierge desk, with receipt. Spend over or close to $249 and you get free valet for a day, but if you self-park you might get free parking and a valet voucher for another day. After you accumulate 14k Caruso points, you get free self-park for 1 year. I normally come via Central Ave and look for 4th floor - I think 3rd floor is mainly spaces for disabled. Alternatively, if you go to Glendale Galleria, enter Grand or Central Ave, and walk to Americana - without worry to validate parking (Glendale Galleria is a different property & no Caruso rewards there). If you lose your ticket, little to no help at concierge: Maximum $18 -- I said I was VIP and have free parking for a year (which I do technically) and they opened the gate for me at no charge.Caruso Rewards: Sign up and get loyalty points for purchases at the Grove and the Americana. Sometimes they double the points per $1 spent.All things being equal, the Caruso rewards program does become a tie breaker.Concierge: They validate your parking, upload your sales receipt to Caruso via app, provide bottled water, can charge your phone or lend you a charger or lend you an umbrella when it rains (which is rare).Lounge: Free wi-fi but you have to provide email to Citi, sponsor (which is a hassle). Sofas available. Expect to see parents with toddlers at the lounge.Stores: I frequent Nordstrom (men's - Zegna Quindici ties $285 to $385 & Bosca wallets $80 to $115); Barneys New York: tiny selection) but convenient for returns; Tumi (good selection - compared to Outlet at Citadel); MAC cosmetics (You can also purchase within Nordstrom), Tiffany & Co (they ate owned by Avon, hehe; so, don't take the bait about being ignored to get you to purchase to show you can afford this hardware - just have a goal in mind of what you want to see: Me, pens, card holder $145 & $135 bracelets) & Apple Store. Many other stores ~Food: I've visited Nordstrom eCafe, Bar Verde & lil Italian deli next to Tumi (soup & sandwich combo ~ $10). Jersey Mike's sub (try the #99 in the secret menu) - Also, I usually go to Foxy's coffee shop across the street or In & out next door - or, King Taco nearby. Watch a game: Buffalo Wings nearby - or Bar Verde at Nordstrom (Hendricks Martini ~ $10). Happy hour at corner Japanese restaurant near the fountain.Amenities: Water fountain, central music, kids playing area(s), trolley.Dome: Find the words ""Seek and You Shall Find"" - in Latin, of course.Kodak Moments: Good themed photo locations near concierge desk and throughout public access areas around fountain - be aware of surroundings & safe of trolley and people walking by ~ATM: BofA atm nearby.Scams: Be aware of people befriending you and playing a trick where they ask you questions - write in a piece of paper (then hand you a piece of paper - using some kind of trickery you find your answers on the paper) ; fortune tell you and then ask you for a big donation - I've seen more than a handful of willing participants walk to the atm and give them loads of cash. I reported it to Security.Be Safe & Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lu5i44rim5

50,Outside mall,"I like the Americana. It has a wide selection of shops and restaurants that you can walk outside. The layout is attractive. The fountains and grass in the middle are very pleasing. Some of the better stores here (in my opinion) are nordstroms, anthropologie, Calvin Klein, Sephora. Some good restaurants, I like the Italian one and I'm blanking on the name (sorry). There's also a Cheesecake Factory if you like that and if you have kids... cause what kid doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? There's also a movie theater here which is great to be able to do dinner and a movie esp with kids. One of their favorite things to do is to get a cupcake from Sprinkles. It's right next to the Glendale Galleria you can literally just walk across the road to get to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/racgeo

The place looks a bit like a small disneyland in the middle of the city with a train that also carries people around. Love the fountain with the Frank Sinatra music. The restaurant selection is huge and i haven't found any bad place so far. Great for weekend shopping trips!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackaither
50,A marvelous creation with multi places to visit and shop,"from the APPLE store to the movies, you cannot go wrong atthe americana at Brand.

30,Outdoor shopping mall,"I spent about an hour visiting this outdoor shopping mall, which is enough time to visit many of the stores. There is a large fountain in the middle of the mall, but little else of general interest to the public other than shopping. The stores are of the mid- to upscale variety, but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere. If you're in Glendale and looking for things to do, this isn't necessarily the best place to go. Nearby attractions are far more interesting and will hold your attention for a longer time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brianjazar
40,Beautiful shopping center,"This place takes after The Grove (and is owned/operated by the same company): a shopping center with beautiful architecture, nice landscaping, and a variety of shops. The parking garage is a little tight, but valet is an option if you prefer that. This is a great place to walk around and even just window shop on a nice day. There are also many restaurants in the center and many more within walking distance of the shopping center. Overall, a great shopping experience with tons to eat within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zinear
40,Actually very pleasant,"A few interesting stores including a Disney baby store, mostly upscale shopping and lots of eateries.

I loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriM935
30,A few hours max..,"Think the Grove in Bev Hills on a much smaller scale.... And not in the best location either..The Americana is ok ,nothing great ..it's the same concept , outdoors , has a grass patch , a cute train ,however there is no Farmers Market attached , fewer shops and only a handful of restaurants to choose from. We spent about one hour here because it just didn't have that fantastic atmosphere and vibe like the Grove did. I wouldn't recommend it if you have already been to the Grove unless you have nothing else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madamb2013
50,Great place to walk around,It's always busy and always pleasant to take stroll around Americana. Good selection of stores and restaurants as well and you can also find more at the Galleria next door,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikehocalate
40,Plenty to do,"We visited on a Saturday afternoon. The parking structure tells you how many spaces on each level, so it's easy to find parking. They have elevators that face the center of the mall, which provides a nice view.Besides eating lunch at Cheesecake Factory, we climbed aboard the trolley. The timing was such that the conductor slowed trolley so we could watch the water fountain show as it had just started on the hour. The trolley used to make a complete circle around the shopping center, but today it just went about half way, then reversed direction. So we got off and walked over to Barnes & Noble. My 5 year old son enjoys the kids section. Then we took a trip over to the Apple store to check out their latest devices. In the concierge area, there's an automatic playing piano that my son liked to watch.We got validated parking from the restaurant. So, overall we had a good visit, and didn't have to spend a lot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles

They had a great up-stairs sale going on, wish we had more time. My only complaint is that parking is only validated after the first hour by restaurants not stores (at least that was what I was told). I don't live in LA but in my opinion, you should never have to pay for parking when shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPC123

It's outdoors and you can spend the whole day wondering around, eating, having a coffee or just people watching!

It's very pleasant to walk around listening to the music, watching the fountain show or taking a ride around the mall in the trolley.Besides the many restaurants there's also a movie theater with a beautiful lobby.Our favourite place though is the Barnes and Noble balcony on the 3rd floor where you can sit and watch it all from up above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geniemtl

50,Stereotypical L.A. but in all the best ways.,"Husbands, bring your wives. Moms, bring your kids. Kids, don't fall in the huge fountain when you are lost i wonder while staring at the water show.The Americana is an open-air mall that feels more like Downtown Disney only with a more even mix of kids and grownups. There's even a trolley that serves little purpose other than incentive for kids to be good ""if you want to ride the trolley later"". There are a lot of stores especially when you can walk across the street to the Glendale Galleria when the weather gets too hot. The huge water fountain with music-synchronized water spouts that are nice looking at any time but perform a ""show"" every hour adds to the theme park feel without the down side of long lines.The movie theater is top notch with I-Max 3D. As clean and upscaled as you could want it to be while spilling popcorn.There's a number of restaurants but I go with either The Cheese Cake Factory or Katsuya Sushi depending on what my family is in the mood for. The prices aren't too bad considering the location and Katsuya is excellent sushi. There are of course the ice cream and pretzel vendors as well.Shopping is diverse. You can take your wife to Barneys and browse until you finally get the nerve to look at the price and then run out or spend your time in The Apple Store or Sony Store or any of the other shops which range in price from reasonable to indecent and from electronics to toys to purses. As I said, there is also the Glendale Galleria across the street which has everything any mall has. It ends up feeling like the Galleria is the indoor section of the Americana and they are one big shopping experience. It barely feels like crossing the street and more like getting to the other area.All in all, take it from someone who hates shopping - this is the least painful way to allow your wife to satisfy her ""needs"" while being able to supervise the rate at which your bank account shrinks....and kids love it too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanmG4029WX
50,What else could you want?,"The Americana has everything you could want. Cheesecake Factory, sprinkles cupcakes, lemonade, bookstores, clothing, movies. Great place to hang around and just kill some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringWonderland
40,Super Busy!,"If you are coming to the Americana, have a destination in mind as there are so many people here that at times parking is tricky and trying to get through the visitors is like an obstacle course. Highlights of the Americana include the movie theater, Barnes and Noble, and The Cheesecake Factory. This is a great place to go, but it can get stressful trying to avoid being run down by women on phones pushing baby strollers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
50,Upscale attraction,"If you really want to have a unique experience and fancy upscale stores (affordable though) great food and a magnificent water spectacle Bellagio style, but most of all feel safe and being surround by decent people this is the place, great job Mr. Carusso (owner)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriquel93

50,"Summer, Spring and Winter and nice place to go","Is a place where you can see the fountains have magical shows filled with music (similar to the fountain in Las Vegas Nevada). There is a FREE RIDE in a trolleys all over the Americana for ALL ages, you just sit and enjoy the ride all around the Americana.So many SHOPPING options,(Glendale galleria is steps away). Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants at the AMERICANA if you sit outside you can see from your table the fountain show while you have a dinner with your family or friends. They have the famous Sprinkles cupcakes here. During the month of December go with friends or family, enjoy a coffee or crepe or just enjoy the tree, santas village and lights and fake snow show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514paquitam
50,Good for Leisure,"The shops, the restaurants, the fountains, the park - good ambiance and vibes - especially for a leisurely evening!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desi2007

40,Great outdoor shopping space,"What I love about the Americana at Brand is the atmosphere. It's got a really cool vibe to it.It's really an outside mall but it's more than that. You can go and not even shop. I like to people watch. Grab a coffee or some tasty desserts from the vendors around the fountain and just sit back and relax as you look at the beautiful fountain, listen to the music and watch kids play on the green.If you do want to shop you'll find a variety of stores. Most are a little bit on the pricier side but you will find H&M, XXI Forever, Urban Outfitters, American Eagle Outfitters and J. Crew that are more reasonable in price.The store selection is always changing, probably because of the high rents. So a store you like today may not be here next month. But by the same token, a new favorite store of yours might move in next month too.This shopping center has a great selection of restaurants from Italian to Japanese to Mexican. My favorite ones are Frida for Mexican and Cheesecake Factory.I also like that there's a multi-story Barnes and Noble book store and a movie theater.There's plenty of parking and they valet as well. If you can't find what you're looking for here just cross the street and you'll be at the Glendale Galleria mall.There are always cool events happening here throughout the year including the lighting of a huge Christmas tree during the holidays.Bring the kids and get on the trolley. It's free and it takes you around the whole shopping center.My only complaint is that sometimes it does get too busy and there are way too many people, especially around the elevators and escalators to the parking structure, making it hard to walk.This is one of the nicest shopping centers in all of Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripAddict5

50,Beautiful place,"If you've been to the Grove in LA then you'll notice that Americana is very much like it. It’s so beautiful with the lighting, fountain, statue and the shops and restaurants around. It looks very luxurious but you can eat quite cheap food too and the shops are not all expensive.

40,Charming!,"I love coming to the Americana and often bring out of town guests as I live 15 minutes from here. There are nice restaurants and the fountain show every hour is nice. The theater is great here and the theater and most restaurants will give some validation for parking. (For a really cheap time, park next door at the Galleria for free and walk over). Enter parking near the InNOut burger and as you walk to the Americana, you will pass a small restaurant I really like called Granvilles. Try the pomegranate cosmo! Love the trolly (free), the music and overall atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylLuvNLife
50,Outdoor Dinner Seating,Fantastic outdoor mall set in the middle of Glendale. The mall had majority of the typical stores located at most malls.

50,Much more then a mall,"The Americana at Brand is a spectacular creation. Calling it a mall would be a crime. This totally enclosed space is a visual wonderland. A gorgeous retail village. A beautiful main avenue with 2 story retail spaces on either side. Lots of miandering trees and grassy areas. While exploring this little gem, you have no idea you are right in the middle of Glendale. Shopping at all price points, excellent aray of food choices, as well as a beautiful movie theater complex. I was very impressed with this fantastic location. What a splended place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunfobs

40,Disney Reinvents the Shopping Mall,"Although not related to Disney, the Caruso firm has adopted many of its utopian small town ideals when building shopping centers. This is by far the best iteration of those ideals after previous centers including Calabasas Commons and The Grove. Here the atmosphere is less mall and more small town village green as the mall also has condos and apartments. During the day there is a street car that runs a circuit around the entire complex. There are plenty of restaurants, stores, a cineplex and a new Nordstrom. Throughout the year there are many events to draw you into the mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
10,Very strange,"We stayed at hotel across the street and after walking through an alley way we stumbled into what the best way to describe is a cross between Vegas and Disneyland. There is music blaring from the tops of the buildings which are apartments above and very high end chain stores below in the round. The huge water pool and fountain in the center constantly burps and splashes, nothing relaxing about it. Not to mention the trolley that makes the loop while the conductor annoucing the great shopping deals to be had. I guess you could think of it as a mini tourist attraction, somewhere to forget the real world outside its walls and happy to help you spend your money. Just didn't feel right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mockee54

30,Dinner & Movies,"Very pretty location. It's usually crowded. It's got several restaurants and one movie theater. I like how you can reserve your seats ahead of time. I don't like that you have to pay to park, but the stores and restaurants usually validate your ticket. The Apple Store located in here is usually very crowded, so make sure you make an appointment .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/472marinav
30,Overpriced parking and upscale shops.,Lots of upscale shops and eateries. Overpriced and a hassle to park. Nice holiday decorations but park a ways away and walk or you will pay parking and it is set up to make parking not a pleasant experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
40,Pleasant environment with high end stores,"This is an extremely pleasant shopping area...there is a large open grassy space in the center with a beautiful fountain that water displays every hour on the hour. They play music in the background...great standards (Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.)...no rock and roll or rap. The only drawback is that many of the stores are a little on the hign end side (translation...expensive). Some of the restaurants are a little too high end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,A shopping and dining experience like no other,"If you visit L.A,. you should check out this wonderful place called the Americana at nearby Glendale. It is so beautiful and relaxing that many people come to just sit on the lawn and look at the fountain and people. It has shops and restaurants and a movie theatre and also a train that goes around the huge pool. I found everyone in a good mood not like an indoor shopping mall at all. There is music playing and even free lawn games for everybody. You can even borrow a blanket to lay on the grass. L.A. can be hectic at times, go, there is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ponsie2015
50,"Wonderful mix of shops and restaurants, with class and some special touches","This is almost a tourist attraction, or rather it's a great place to just hang out and enjoy the atmosphere. This is like being at a piazza in Rome where you can just sit and watch the world go by and enjoy it. The central fountain is not the Trevi Fountain, but more Bellagio type, and is a pleasure to watch. It has a fine assortment of nice shops and excellent range of restaurants with great cuisine. The trolley around The Americana is a bit corny, but everyone loves it. Great place to be and be seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

40,"Crowds, upscale shopping, and watch out for parking rules!","You will always find a crowd here and the shops are not your cheap fair. The highlight is the very large Apple Store and Sprinkles cupcake place. It has a cupcake ATM, which is novel for a visit.Beware of the parking nazis! If you lose your ticket, you will pay a full-day of parking which is $18. I recommend parking across the street in the Galleria if you are not buying anything, as you will not get validation besides the movies and large purchases. With a movie theatre, bookstore, eateries and such you and the family or friends will have plenty to do. But, do you like crowds?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkweblog

40,Nice place in the evening,This is a very good shopping destination when you combine it with the galleria. Much better setting and all round atmosphere than at the south coast plaza with most of the same brands. Good restaurants as well so this makes a good evening destination. The area around the fountains was very lively in the evening with lots of street activities.Parking was expensive so park in the galleria or target for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735
50,Plenty to see & do,"Such an amazing place - plenty to see & do .Open area shopping, with great brands such as apple & Barnes & Noble & Nordstrom.

We even crossed the street and visited the galleria! A nice family outing for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Csbaby26
50,Better Than The Grove!,"So glad they built the Americana on Brand and its next to the Glendale Galleria. Free parking for the first 90mins with validation and convenient walking distance. Many restaurants from Asian, Italian, Mexican, coffee, bakery, California Infuse,,,,,,and of course all the shopping. The Americana just like the Grove has a center court grass area for the kids with the water fountain display that synchronizes with music. Ay night its all lid with lights everywhere. This venue is not for everybody. It can get very crowded on certain times and the holidays. Plus theres a flow of people coming from the Glendale Galleria.The grove in Fairfax takes forever from the 10 freeway to get there and its exhausting.We live near by and we go there primarily for the movies and dine when possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKom

50,"Make a night of it! (Girls night, Date night or Family night!)","The Americana is a great place to spend a day! besides shopping there are several places to dine at but the best part is all the events they have throughout the year like yoga, movies, and concerts on the lawn and events on special occasions like chinese new year and during the holidays they have a tree lighting ceremony and they even make it snow.

40,Nice - Pretty Place w/ Good Restaurants and Shops,"I have mixed feelings about these Disneyesque developments, but have to admit that this is very nice. The fountains, music and green lawn are lovely and relaxing. There are some nice restaurants (Chi Dynasty is great for Chinese) and a variety of shops from high end (Tiffany's) to more moderate (H & M), and there is a nice Barnes & Noble. I checked out the newer Nordstrom on a recent visit because I love the store - but was disappointed. The old store in the Glendale Galleria was much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koda

50,Disneyland in Glendale!,"Entering into the Americana is like entering a different world. With trolleys circling the park every few minuets, the visual experience is worth the trip. With its park like atmosphere and the dancing waters, it is a fun place to take the family. AND THEN there are all the shops surrounding the park. Almost everything you want can be found there from a movie theater to wonderful restaurants and kiosks that sell fun things for the whole family. While I was there a balloon vendor plied his trade making the children laugh with glee. Parking is wonderful.

Christmas lights were beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyH447
40,Quite Pretentious,"A combination of stores (said to be ""upscale"") and restaurants in a park-like setting which includes a fountain with music. Rather phony. However, the large Barnes and Noble is sadly one of only a few remaining bookstores in Glendale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZuzkaE
50,Must go,Was my first outing in Glendale and kept going every weekend .. This place is gorgeous .. Don't miss the train :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gonom
50,A neighborhood find,"On a regular day the Americana is a great shopping area. Filled with great stores, unique food venues, a movie theatre and more. At Christmas the decorations are something to behold. A great place to just people watch and enjoy the decor. Lots of activities ongoing at The Americana. A must see if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538pamelas
50,The Americana at Brand,"Golden shining waterfalls, a green grass park, a red trolley car, these are just a few of the colors and excitement of the shopping destination known as The Americana at Brand.I am NOT an enthusiastic shopper and do not like to go to the local malls but the Americana is not just a mall. It is a destination. Men, women, children, and pets can wander on the streets of this shopping center, stop at a restaurant, go to the movies, or just sit at the edge of the fountain and people watch. Of course, shopping is what Americana offers best in Glendale. Urban Outfitters, Barnes and Noble, Kate Spade, Tiffany and Co, Anthropologie, Forever 21, Lululemon,Sur la Table,Sephora are but a few of the resident stores--oops, almost forgot the sleek new Nordstroms.Believe me, the Americana is a wonderful experience and being a Glendale resident, I wish to thank the Carusos for their foresight in revitalizing what was once a very sad corner of Glendale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckydawgs
50,Great date evening/night place!,"Went there on a date. Perfect evening weather, stroll around shops, several restaurants to chose from for eats, then after watch lighted music dance from the water fountain! Awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolanda1953
50,Atmosphere,"Such a nice place to just stroll or sit and listen to the music and watch the fountain. Plenty of places to eat. A nice variety to choose from. It is alway clean and well maintained. A movie theater and lots of places to shop but you don't need to shop you can just come and relax.My grandsons love to ride the trolley, eat pizza and go to Barnes & Noble to buys books.It's wonderful in the afternoon and beautiful with the lights in the evening. Something for everyone. Well done Mr. Caruso.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mojolynn
50,Wow,The entire atmosphere is such an experience. The singing and light up fountain is beyond gorgeous. They also have a trolley you can ride that takes you around the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninxox
50,"Shop, Eat and Play!!!!","Stumbled on this our last night as we were looking for a place to eat at the Glendale Galleria. We asked for suggestions from someone at the mall and they told us to go outside the mall and walk down this street and there would be a Cheesecake Factory. As we were walking to the restaurant I noticed a bunch of lights and turned to look and and to my amazement saw this AMAZING area and started to walk towards it. OMG, what a beautiful area!! It is called the Americana at Brand. Literally a short walk from the Galleria mall, but it was like a park with a waterfall and restaurants and shops surrounding the park area. At night it was breath taking! There are lights across the street in front of the shops, (not for cars, for pedestrians only), even a huge chandelier. I have to say, it was one of the most beautiful shopping areas I have ever seen. You have the comfort of sitting and relaxing in a grassy area and the benefits of shopping and eating. You have to look at the images online as my description cannot do justice to what my eyes actually saw. Plain and simple, DON'T MISS THIS IF YOU ARE IN THAT AREA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraR152
50,Nice family place,This is a nice area to stroll around with your family. There's plently of shopping but you don't feel compelled to shop. The grassy areas and the fountains are a nice place to gather and enjoy the outdoors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rvgirrrl
50,Glendale has a town square!,It is a great place to walk around and see all ages having a good time. It gives Glendale a center and has brought life back to downtown.Some stores are out of my price range but I still find goods that have a fair price and are up to the minute in style. It is a great place to take guests as it is open and relaxed. The fountains are fun and the movie theater is large enough to find a movie you like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarkus2u
50,Like a Day at the Park,Beautiful fountain common lawn with free blankets to borrow to enjoy the day. Piped in music compliments the ambiance. Upscale shopping abounds nearby by as well as moderately priced dining options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lih
40,A Shopping Must in Glendale,"I remember when the Americana at Brand first opens several years ago with my husband. We were fortunately to check out the soft opening of Cheesecake Factory (for their staff training) and were seated by the window. I remember watching the water fountain show that reminded me of the more massive water fountain show at the famous Bellagio Hotel in Vega$. The manager at Cheesecake Factory told me that the people that designed the Americana actually had the same people who made the famous water fountain in the desert (America's playground) create and design the water fountain that we saw there out the window. That is pretty fancy and cool if you ask me.But anyways, aside from Cheesecake Factory and the awesome water fountain, there are other eateries and stores to shop here. This place is like an outdoor mall with a ton of fancy shops. There are also events that occur from time to time at the Americana, like the Bingo at the Brand this summer. fashion shows and so forth to give the community a little bit more at this shopping facility.Parking is not free here unfortunately. Well the 1st hour is free, but you need to get validation for the rest of the hours (2 hours with restaurant validation, 4 hours with theater validation). You can also just park at the Glendale Gallery parking lot and just walk over (no need for validation) if you rather not deal with the parking though.Overall, a great outdoor mall to come to that is worth shopping, strolling and browsing. And maybe even grabbing a little something (either as a meal or as a dessert).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meowmix318
50,"Everything you need for a relaxing, luxurious afternoon","The Americana at Brand is a new mall in the style of a European square crossed with the lavishness of the Bellagio in Las Vegas. I'm talking about their fountain that dances to the piped outdoor music. Their grass and gardens are impeccably maintained despite the crowds that walk and sit on it every weekend. The shops are high end-- Apple Store, Tiffany's, Nordstrom, Barnes and Nobles, Anthropology, Urban Outfitters. (The Kitson moved into the Glendale Galleria.) The restaurants are trendy with good service, and great food-- Frida's (Mexican), Katsuya (Japanese, Cheesecake Factory (American/Southern California), Dean Deluca's Deli, and many more. A Sprinkles cupcake shop just opened-- craveworthy ice-cream and cupcakes. They removed the children's park, but I did see kids kicking a ball around on the grass. The movie theatre is still outstanding (Pacific 18). Its a great place for a dinner and a movie, and even a better place to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeenieBeans
50,The most charming mall in L.A.,"Visiting the Americana is a must if you are in the L.A. area. It is basically a smaller version of The Grove. There is a nice mix of upscale and affordable stores (from Guess Marciano to Forever 21), attractions like the trolley ride, the fountain show and the movie theater and there are plenty of places to eat. I would recommend visiting here during the holidays especially. It is always very festive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817marissar
50,Americana is the star of Glendale,"This is the best Shopping environment for families within LA. It worth a visit and spend good time around the area. It is linked to Galleria Shopping Mall with all famous Department stores. It is more fun rather than shops with the theater for movies, coffee shops, restaurants and other activities. It's the Glendale landmark nowadays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALBADEEN
50,What a fabulous mall,"this was absolutely lovely. parking was not problem. it was all outdoors, with a lovely lake and fountains. there was piped music as you walked around.

40,a neat place to walk around in the evening.,Here you will find some up scale shops along with good dining ($$_$$$). There is a movie theater if you are so inclined and a water show in the center which is fun to watch. A large barns and noble book store (with free wi fi) and it's right across the street from the local shopping mall. A nice place to window shop / walk around after a full day of being a tourist.

40,A great place to spend some time,"I walked down to the Americana from my hotel, The Hilton, up the road. It was a lovely sunny winter day and I spent some time browsing the shops before settling in at one of the outdoor cafes next to the fountain. I had bought a great new book from the huge Barnes and Noble store in the mall, so spent a good couple of hours reading, drinking coffee and people watching. Well worth a trip to browse, eat some good food and soak up the pleasant surroundings",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nic1954
50,Great family place,"A wonderful place to visit. The fountains are amazing and strolling around is refreshing. At Christmas time, they had man-made snow falling - a nice surprise.

The parking is easy in easy out. This is the only Mall I go to now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoHoMike
50,Great day at a beautiful Mall,"We took the family to this great Mall. It is elegant, charming and clean. It has nice choices for restaurants and we decided to go Mexican so we went to Frida's and it was delicious. We had a patio table and we loved it. After that we took the family for a stroll in the park, a little window shopping and to the movies. Everybody enjoyed it. Great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ppepe99
50,Savvy!,"Talk about fancy Malls with all the trimmings, that's exactly what Americana is! Higher End Stores, Higher End Restaurants, Coffee Shops. Even the little stores/stalls are interestingly one of a kind food or little stuff. To top it all, they put a dancing fountain in the middle of it all that has ala Las Vegas Signature on it! The stores closes at 9:00pm or 9:30pm except for the Theaters, the Restaurants, the Fountain show. Barnes and Noble is open till 11:00pm. It's very entertaining to just sit down on a chair under one of those umbrella tables and watch the fountain show right after all the stores has closed. Less crowd, very relaxing. You should try it sometime. Bring a drink or a coffee with you and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTCGreen

50,Most Fun in Glendale!,"This is the best place to spend an afternoon in Glendale - the dancing fountain, the piped-in cool jazzy music you hear everywhere you go, the twinkling lights in the trees after dark. The movie theaters are excellent. There are many places to snack or dine. And sometimes there are special performances on the lawn area, by artists on the verge of fame (Il Volo, for example was here just before they became a US sensation). Visit the lobby of the live-in condo area too, and watch the piano play on its own. And get your car washed while you shop - it's worth it - not much more than your local car wash!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCMSS

The whole shopping block was decorated for Christmas, including the trolley which circled the block, transporting shoppers. After eating at Chi Dynasty, I walked down to the center of this outdoor shopping area to find a green space all decorated with lights and a giant Christmas tree.

50,Lovely layout and landscaping - Great selection of shops & restaurants,"On a beautiful day, going to the American at Brand is a wonderful way to enjoy it. There is a great selection of shops, restaurants and a movie theater. In addition, just sitting in the sun listening to and watching the fountains and the children being walked in their carriages is so relaxing. There is music piped in everywhere, which helps to set the tone.

The best mall I've ever seen if you are looking for brand names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommymiad
40,An interesting shopping center,"To be fair, Glendale does not have much to interest tourists. But if you find yourself in Glendale, the Americana is probably one place to be sure to check out. Envisioned as a ""town center,"" it does sort of serve that purpose. On the green which is in the center of the complex you will find an interesting fountain, with water sprays synched to music, and some Glendale families enjoying one of the few green playgrounds in that part of town. But let's be clear: the Americana is first and foremost a shopping center. The stores tend to be upscale chains, the restaurant somewhat on the expensive side, but most of them serve pretty good food. Other reviews have listed the brand names available so I won't repeat them. The movie theaters are by far the best within 10 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joerussin

I found it by accident while seeking an In N Out Burger which is not accessible from inside the Galleria.This ""Americana Way"" is not really real but you can indulge yourself in the harmless illusion of Utopian shopping based on a past that never was.The streets are impeccably turned out and replete with working streetcar ride and happy, smiley uniformed staff. The shops are magnificent and there are plenty of places to sit and relax, with or without a drink/food.Not really real, but really worth a visit nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silkroadworker

50,Not an ordinary mall.,"This outdoor shopping center is in the style of a small town main square. The square is a grassy quad with a water feature in the style of the Bellagio dancing fountains (Las Vegas). The stores are typically high-end-- Tiffany's, Apple Store. Its a great place to go for a dinner (Cheesecake Factory, Frida's) and a movie, and add a quick visit to Barnes and Noble to peruse the books. I like to take the kids there for a matinee, and have quick crepe while the kids romp in the adjacent jungle gym set in sand. This mall is far from ordinary.

Most people window-shop as there are several high-end retailers here but my favorites H&M, Barnes and Noble, Crumbs Bake Shop, and Pinkberry are within everyone's budget! There is never a dull moment and if you have nothing to do, this is the perfect place to people-watch and you may be lucky and see someone famous. Saturdays are great as they have a farmer's market and farm animals for the kids and adults to interact with. I would highly recommend this attraction to tourists or anyone within the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777JenM

Park your car at Valet, walk the designer shops, take pictures at the glorious fountain, stop int Apple store, eat at any of the many fantastic food establishments (either formal dining or casual cafe dining), then take in a movie. When you are done take a ride on the trolley, people watch, and shop a little more. Ambiance, music, and cleanliness is amazing.There is only one thing that could be better than a night out at this haven in Glendale, and that would be to live there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWalding
50,Window shopping in a cool setting!,"Less than ten miles from downtown LA, three miles from zoo, and steps away from spacious Glendale Galleria (currently under remodel), you'll find a different kind of shopping experience. Park car in adjacent parking garage, use elevator or escalator and take a look around. In a park-like setting with a beautiful fountain you'll find high-end and popular stores and a number of fine and casual dining establishments. On a budget? Jewel City Diner is a great place to people watch, B&N is huge w/3levels, and free trolley saves a few steps. Enjoy samples and purchase assorted olive oils and balsamic vinegars at 41 Olive and relax in comfy chairs on the porch of Gilly Hicks while listening to music. Perks and tips: parking validation at most businesses, immaculately maintained restrooms in parking garage and use parking kiosks to pre-pay ticket.

50,A Little Bit Of Everything For The Whole Family,"First off, this is one of my most favorite places to go to hang out, shop and have a fun day. My husband and I found The Americana accidentally while looking for the Apple store. We live in Orange County but my husband works in the valley. I agreed to meet him at the Glendale Galleria but found The Americana right across the way. What a find! There are luxury apartment/town homes that surround this place. Right in the center are beautiful fountains that dance to the tunes of whatever music might be playing at the moment. Kind of like a mini version of the fountains in Vegas. There's great stores to shop at as well (H&M, Fprever 21, Calvin Klien, Apple Store, Barnes & Nobel, J. Crew, BCBG, Anthropology) the list goes on. They are not short on restaurants either ( Trattoria Amici -Delicious, The Cheesecake Factory, Chi Dynasty, Starbucks, Frida Mexican Cuisine, etc).The Americana is for all ages. There is a small play area for smaller children to play till their hearts content. There is a diverse group of people young and old alike that visit this place. Great for people watching. in some ways The Americana reminds me a little of TheGrove in LA. It's pretty easy to spend the entire day here. My husband and I usually get here in the morning and spend the entire day into the evening hours here. As I mentioned earlier, this is my new favorite hangout. As a matter of fact, I'm headed there tomorrow. The Americana had their 4th annual Christmas Tree lighting ceremony last night (11/17) and we missed it. So, I'm looking forward to seeing their 100ft tree and all the beautiful Christmas decorations. Bring the kids, I hear they have snow twice a day until December sometime. The Americana is definitely worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1hapicamper

50,"Relaxing day riding the free trolley, shopping and sitting in the park.","What a wonderful place to visit and have a fun relaxing day to shop, ride the free trolley or just sit in the park and have something to eat. You forget that your in a city when you visit the Americana at Brand in Glendale, CA. There's a fountain of water where the water dances when the music plays. You can take your children to the small park and let them play while you sit and relax or chat with a friend. There are very comfortable chairs and couches to sit on in the park. What a wonderful place to spend a few hours or the whole day. Catch a movie in the beautiful movie theater. Shop, go to the huge bookstore or do nothing but enjoy your day.I've been there at Christmas time and they have a Santa Clause, beautifully dressed, where your children can have their picture taken. It also snows (not real snow) on the streets at different times of the evening during the Christmas holidays.What a wonderful way to spend your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueBear77
40,"Very fun place to hangout with friends, and shop and and dine.","I love Americana, I always go with my friends. It is a cool and exciting place. I personally love the movie thearter and always see a movie there. My favorite shopping stores at Americana are H&M, Forever 21, Gilly Hicks, Barnes & Nobles, and apple store!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beacholic
50,LOVE the Americana!,"I don't get that excited about shopping, period. But when I went to the Americana, that was a whole different experience! Maybe it's because it's in Glendale, and I didn't expect to find something like that there, but the place is pretty neat! It's like a cross between a Las Vegas resort and Main Street at Disneyland. Actually, it's like a Disneyland for consumers. The short trolley ride was fun, and our conductor made clever remarks here and there that kept things amusing. I also loved LA Creamery. You can't find that in swanky Westwood or hip LA just yet! I ended up going to the Americana a couple times while I was in Glendale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tessiedriver
40,SHOPPING SPREE!!!!,"The place was awesome...outdoor shopping area by high rise luxury residential tower...totally lavish lifestyle...and it has it's own trolley to take you from one end to the other so you don't blister your feet! Shops are cool and eating place just as good! ( cheesecake factory and a shake kiosk..beard papa's, creperie..yyummmm!) gotta wear comfy stylish clothing and shoes to fit in the crowd.I enjoyed the 2 hours I had there. Will definitely go back and check it out at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daytripper107
50,Great place to watch the water dance and people watch.,"This is a great place to sit outside and enjoy the evening. I loved it for a date night and would recommend it to people of all ages. You might need to pay for parking if you stay over your validation time but it is a great place to stroll. The view of the fountain is best at Katsuya, and their happy hour is great. I personally like Katsuya and Granville for dinner, I do not recommend Cheesecake Factory unless you want to wait for a table. The Americana has movies, a weekly farmer's market, seasonal decorations and a huge Barnes and Noble. The kids liked the play area along with the cupcake and new ice cream shop. The stores are very high end, but I was not going to shop as much as spend time with my honey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apamperedtraveler
50,Loved it.,"This was an amazing find, lovely coffee bars and restaurants, and the best part, the musical fountain displays, I could have watched them all day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viavirgin1
40,"Nice Atmosphere, But Some Lacking Parts","The Americana at Brand is just a few years old, and therefore still has that ""new car smell."" It's located in Downtown Glendale, close to many other LA cities (like Los Feliz, the city of LA, Burbank, Pasadena, etc.). It's very hard to miss at there are literally signs pointing to it, and the complex itself is huge, with tons of stores and lots of apartments/condos above. The parking complex is huge and parking is plentiful. What's nice is that you don't have to make a very long trek to the elevator, usually, as the parking has many levels and isn't particularly large width wise.. more-so height wise. You also have a choice of using the escalators, which is nice. Parking is not too highly priced, and you get free parking if you're there for an hour, I believe, or 4 with a theater validation. The stores themselves at the Americana are.. well, overpriced. There's Armani and Tiffany's, Juicy Couture and other higher priced designers. The cheapest stores are the Forever 21 and H&M, both humongous and impossible to miss. The restaurants are also not cheap in general.. Fridas, the sushi place, etc. Cheesecake Factory is the most reasonably priced as far as I could tell, but there is almost always a wait. There's also a small diner, which I've never been to. I usually go to the nice little stands that are a little overpriced as well, but a better atmosphere. Crepe Maker, the pizza stand where pizza is 3-4 dollars a slice and soda is 2. Well.. the atmosphere makes up for the prices, I suppose. The hourly fountain shows are spectacular, in my opinion. I go just for that usually. The atmosphere is always nice, with lots of people walking around and riding the little train. It's a nice place to take the family, see a movie with your date, watch the fountains with your spouse, etc. A nice feel overall, and worth a trip to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hreshtagner
50,Absolutely LOVED the American at Brand,"I have 3 teen boys, we all absolutely LOVED the Americana at Brand.It is new, elegant, with a very relaxing atmosphere.We first ate at Jewel City, the inside is like a small 50s style diner. We chose to eat outside and enjoy the sun, great food. We had hamburgers, chicken strips, fries.Nice jazz music playing outside, I loved this.Lots of different shops that will appeal to everyone. I loved the Kate Spade store. We also took the free train ride that gives you a short tour of where all the stores are.We liked the area so much, we ended up returning for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.Small play area if you have little ones too.This is definitely something you want to check out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mylee2018
50,Wonderful new outdoor mall.,"A nice place to spend the day or night. All upscale shopping. Beautiful fountain in the middle with sycronized music. There is a free trolley car ride around the mall, movie theatre, Cheesecake Factory, Japanese Restaurant, Mexican restaurant, and food vendors in the center lawn area. Many places to sit and enjoy the venue. Grab a cup of coffee and a crepe and watch the fountain or just the people walking by. The parking garage is like none other. Painted a crisp white, complete with grand piano and formal seating. Attendants are dressed as though there are at an upscale hotel. If you eat at a restaurant you can get your parking ticket validated for 2hr free parking. Be sure to grab a meal at Granville Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBKathy
