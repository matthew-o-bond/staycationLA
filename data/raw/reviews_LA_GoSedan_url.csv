10,Buyer Beware,"1 reviewShare reviewEmbed reviewWrite an updateEdit review1/4/2020I had been a GoSedan customer off and on for ten years. Last month I booked an executive car CURBSIDE pick up at LAX and received a confirmation for 7:35 PM. This car service was a disaster!I received a trip reminder for the executive car and pick up time during the day on the trip. However, when the flight landed there was no call from the company, no car at the CURBSIDE location, and no answer when the company was called. After 55 minutes and several calls, all of which ended in a long wait and a hangup, an online chat agent said the company needed to arrange a RESCUE driver, whatever that means. Still no driver. Instead, I got a new update for a CURBSIDE pickup for 8:40 PM. Still no driver. Another chat with an agent who says take a shuttle the the car. Remember, I paid for CURBSIDE. A shuttle arrived and we traveled twenty another minutes to an off site satellite, what looked like a converted parking lot.After waiting still another twenty minutes at the outpost, GoSedan sent out a shared ride vehicle for the pickup. Remember, I paid for direct executive service. Over two hours after the confirmed time, not at CURBSIDE, and not executive car, the driver immediately complained about having make the trip.Email and calls to customer service have gone unanswered.Stay away from this company!",John M
10,Horrible - Please Avoid,"I was left at the airport with no ride on August 26, 2019. I've been calling since then to get a refund. I was told 6 different times that the refund was mailed. None of this was true. The refund check finally came 11/20/19 and it's 38% short of the original amount..... now I am back at square one trying to figure out where's my correct refund.... horrible company, bad communication, horrible customer service. Go with a taxi, ride share or personal car service.I wish I could rate them a zero....",Tiffinee
10,WARNING DO NOT USE THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY - USE UBER OR LIFT OR ANYTHING ELSE!,"GoSedan are criminals! Do yourself a favour and don't get robbed like I did, just use Uber or Lift and stay away from this unprofessional incompetent business! If you care to read about my my detailed and honest review, please read on.It has been almost 2 months since GoSedan cancelled the service (9 seater private passenger van) from our hotel in Mission Bay San Diego to LA Airport, that I prepaid for and they still have NOT REFUNDED my money! They could not provide my family with the van and insisted that a large SUV would fit all our luggage and passengers, but then changed their minds and cancelled the booking altogether when the driver wanted to pick us up 2-3 hours after our scheduled booking time (at his convenience). They tried to convince me that I had plenty of time before my international flight, like they were in charge of my personal itinerary! Like I said VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! I had to make a dispute claim with my insurance company to get the money back from them and they are still dragging it out leaving a week between email responses to me, claiming that it has both been processed and that it's still being 'processed by their accounts department' never providing evidence of a credit note invoice.I prepaid 4 separate bookings totalling over $600USD with this company before our trip to California as I'm from Australia and didn't realise it would be easier and safer to use Uber once in USA.The first trip from LAX to Anaheim was just okay and the reason for this is because we had a horrible flight and anything would be better in comparison. The driver Tony guilted us for our international flight being delayed even though we contacted him before our scheduled booking time. He provided our family of five with ONE bottle of car temperature water to share. I'm not completely ungrateful about this, it was from his own personal supply of beverages, but I had been under the impression from reading heaps of positive online reviews that this company was a Private Limo service and they provided cold drinks for all passengers. He then drove extremely fast, erratically and at times using his phone to check maps and messages veering close to the highway barrier in the carpool lane. In the end he did manage to deliver us alive and in one piece.The second trip was actually good service (I forget the gentleman's name who drove) as they provided the Van that I prepaid for and my family and our luggage was delivered safely and comfortably to our destination on time.The third trip was disastrous! The driver started heading towards our hotel (we could see on the app) then decided he'd prefer to take a different job started heading away from our hotel and then ended up sending another car in his place. The SUV that showed up was tiny! Certainly not a 9 seater passenger van, it was a 5 seater and it only just fit our luggage with 1 passenger in front. We then had to pay for an additional Uber XL to fit the rest of my family. This is the reason I phoned GoSedan to make a complaint and also to get them to guarantee the 9 seater for our final journey to the airport, they apologised offered a partial refund (which has never and will probably never be processed or paid) and said that there would definitely be a 9 Seater Passenger Van there to pick us up on 17th September 2019. I phoned on the day to re-confirm this promise at which time they tried to convince me that a large SUV will fit the same amount of passengers and luggage as a 9 seater, then decided the time of the booking wasn't quite right for them and was too much of an inconvenience, so they cancelled the booking but KEPT MY MONEY! Thanks for reading and I hope I've saved you money by my honest review.",Alison M
10,Horrendous customer service & policies!,"This is the 2nd time I've used Go Sedan for airport pickup ground transportation for family. I didn't write a review on the first trip although it was terrible as well. I believe in giving 2nd chances.That said, the 1st time Go Sedan was reserved, the driver arrived one hour early than the company's designated pick up time. When the driver was told he'll have to wait an hour, the owner of Go Sedan called to say that they'll be charging us for the hour the driver has to wait. What?!?! They show up early of their own accord and charge the customer for their error!?!? Absurd!!!The 2nd time we used Go Sedan, the driver, Steve Imo, berated and derided an elderly family member that was being picked up from an airport and brought to my home. The driver was rude and contentious with my 77-year-old family member.I booked a 3rd reservation with Go Sedan (at the same time I booked this most recent airport pick up) that I have now hastily canceled and paid a ridiculous $5 cancellation fee even though this 3rd resv. wasn't until next month. Another absurd policy of Go Sedan - they charge customers cancellation fees not just within 24 hrs, which is reasonable, but at any time of the cancellation. Thievery!In closing, I HIGHLY encourage any readers to avoid Go Sedan at all costs! Even bicycling is better than this ground transportation firm that's full of aggressive, irritable, irrational, thieves!!! Boycott Go Sedan entirely!",Tiffani
10,Horrid ride home from LAX!,"Horrid ride home from LAX! Driver derided us for waiting near the wrong column in the American Airlines terminal, that was our welcome home!Then he turned on the Trump rally on Fox News. He grunted when I objected and continued driving. Nearly 2 hours of the Trump rally and political commentary.His driving was okay and he did arrive on time. I just object to having to endure his choice in radio stations.Just bad customer service.",Cavydad
50,Great service.,"Prompt service, clean comfortable car, friendly and courteous driver. We couldn’t fault the service and will definitely use again. Many thanks to Jude.",globejetsetter
10,Left stranded at LAX... Horrible company... Do Not Use this company...,"Worst company ever... Had every excuse under the sun as to why their driver never showed, all of which were lies... Told me they would cover my additional expenses and have never paid as agreed... They are Liars, Cheats and Thieves... I have filed a complaint with the state of California and hopefully they will pull their license to operate...",Allan M
10,Stranded at Burbank Airport,"One of the absolute necessities for a ride service is reliability. Since this company requires advance booking and payment to use, the expectation of this contract is that they will show up and transport you from your previously agreed upon location to your destination. On 8/13/19 GoSedan under trip 270663 arranged on 7/12/19 failed to show up at the Burbank Airport to pick us up at 10:55PM and transport us home as previous arranged. There was no telephone call or text message from driver or anyone at GoSedan. We called the assigned driver x3 times (each time the phone rang continually until it got to an answering machine). We called the Customer Service number for GoSedan who placed us on hold twice for 15 minutes while she tried to contact the driver. Finally she returned to the phone to advise us that the driver has a ""flat tire he is trying to repair"" and will be 1 hour late (a doubtful excuse, considering no one was answering his cell phone). When advise this wasn't acceptable she stated that ""their are no rescue drivers available now"" so she will just cancel the pickup and we need to find another way to get home. At this point we were the only passengers waiting at the Burbank Airport and staff was leaving from the airport. I advised her that this was not the way to run a ride service and I wanted to speak with a supervisor/manager. I was advised she was the only staff on but that she would leave a message for someone to contact me on 8/14/19, but there was nothing else that could be done. I told her I expected GoSedan to refund my $36.00 and pay for the Uber ride that we would have to take ($25.91, cheaper than GoSedan). She stated their policy is only to refund and would not pay for the Uber but would communicate my desire to the manager/supervisor who would call be on 8/14/19.On 8/14/19 Go Sedan failed to contact me by 12PM, so I called them. Again I waited on the phone for about 15-20 minutes and when I got to a customer service representative told them I needed to talk to a manager/supervisor about be stranded at an airport. I was told they were all ""in a meeting"", but would call me back after the meeting. Never received a call back and to date of this review have not been refunded any money.I researched GoSedan (aka Opoli, PrimeTime) complaints on the internet and found out a few additional things of significance:1. Many recent complaints about customers being stranded at airports/not picked up at airports.2. Slow or no refunding of money from GoSedan's failure to meet contractual obligations3. Evidence of not enough drivers and no ""rescue efforts""4. On Yelp, multiple complaints answered with a preprinted apology with identical information (sorry, mechanical driver problem, please let them know what they can do)5. At BBB identical situations to our experience in failure to pick up customers.6. Multiple filings with California Public Utilities Commission under Passenger Transportation - Passenger Stage Corporations against GoSedan (I am filing another one)",GoSedan Customer
50,Excellent service,"I rarely write reviews but given some of the very negative reviews here I thought it only fair to state that I have had two excellent experiences with GoSedan. The drivers were on time (early, even), courteous, professional, excellent drivers, and got me where I needed to go. My most recent trip involved a 2:15am pickup, so I was a little nervous, but the driver was waiting for me when my plane arrived and I was picked up and delivered to my destination without a hitch. Clean, well appointed vehicles, excellent service, and it sure beats the inconsistent quality of Lyft/Uber. It was also quite reasonably priced (for my LAX to home trip, it was comparable to a cab). Well worth it. The app is nice, too.",BillLongBeach_CA
10,"STAY AWAY, THIS COMPANY IS AWFUL","I ordered this company for a client yesterday. They picked my client up fine from the airport to her appointment. However the return was a complete nightmare. They left my client sitting outside an office building in the dark for over 2 hours. She was supposed to be picked up at 4:45 and it was almost 7 by the time they got her and then decided to pick up several other people along the way. My client did not get to her hotel until after 11. This was not a shared ride I paid for. I am just disgusted with this type of customer service. I will absolutely never use them and would never recommend them to anyone. The 800 number I called barely speaks English. They were not at all helpful. If there was a zero that’s how many stars they would get. Horrible, Horrible service",mrsrushing1
10,Don’t use,Left me waiting for an hour. Promised a 30% discount to make it right but they never came though. When I asked they said “call and we’ll give you $10 off”. That’s not 30%. I should have cancelled and demanded a refund. Save your money and save time. Don’t use them.,JSwithteens
10,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,Driver was 45 minutes late picking us up at airport ( LAX ) on our arrival date.Driver NEVER SHOWED UP picking us up at cruise terminal the following Saturday to take us back to the airport- This was paid in advance - and I have been calling and e-mailing the company for my refund for days. They are unresponsive and lack any type of customer service.Stay FAR FAR away from this company - they are thieves!,adamskim45
50,Perfect!!,I am so happy with your services! If I can only put 10 stars for this! I was on an emergency when I booked with you guys. I couldn't thank you more. GoSedan did not let me down. Thank you so much!,iyahrigodon1026
50,Luxurios!,I went to a sophisticated party and booking GoSedan did not let me down. They provided me with their luxury car and everything went well! Really recommending this to everyone!,Jan Lord L
50,Professional Driver,I have alot of bad experience in the past when it comes to cabs or private service but GoSedan has changed everything. It's not just because of their good vehicles but as well as their drivers. I was actually going to the airport and I had alot of baggages and I was already almost late for my flight. He helped me with my baggages and really made a way to take the best route that he can get so that I can be on time for my flight. Thank you so much! I would definitely ride again!,mikeeC5343EF
