40,One of the better park designs in the community.,"I grew up in this neighborhood, so I know what this area was like before the park. At first I was skeptical during construction, since a couple of the main streets that connected to Harry Bridges (including the one to my dad's house) were permanently blocked off, requiring me to take a roundabout detour. When the park finally opened in 2011 I was pleasantly surprised. The walk itself is a great experience, especially on the elevated berms that cross the bridge. You get a great view of the port operations from that vantage point. It seems more secure there than the nearby Wilmington Recreational Center due to a visible police presence. On weekends families and soccer teams converge to use the facilities. During the holidays and indeed throughout the year there are many family oriented events, such as concerts, movie nights and snow days.The only two issues are an under abundance of trees (but you can go to Wilhall for that) and the use of fake grass in a couple of areas. But all in all, it's way beyond ""better than nothing."" as another review put it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victorsB8915TF
30,Better than nothing for the local people,"Wilmington Waterfront Park with its grass covered sloping berm is a perfect sound barrier for the people of Wilmington against the constant truck noise from the Port of Los Angeles. This green oasis of fun is very environmentally friendly being stocked with drought tolerant plants and irrigated with recycled water. The large expanses of flat grass are perfect for playing soccer on, and for those non team players there are separate exercise point around the park with equipment. There is a small picnic area perfect for birthday parts or other kinds of social gatherings. On hot days the children can run through the moving water feature.TIP; Take a towel if you intend to do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanger24
