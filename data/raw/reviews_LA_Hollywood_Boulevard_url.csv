The nightlife only exists from Thursday to Sunday and the crowds aren't that great. Despite the strip being very hood, everything is obscenely high priced.

20,"Dirt, poverty, souvenirs","Holy, how I have looked forward to see the famed Hollywood Boulevard, it's Walk of Fame and iconic buildings and how I was disappointed. I would not reccomend walking it at night, even on a normal day it's unsavory, dirty, full of seedy characters ... not glamorous at all. In such a rich city as L.A. there shouldn't be so many homeless and destitute crammed into every doorway, even at the fanciest of buildings. (And I'm not blaming the people of lesser luck.)The glory and glamour of the golden age of Hollywood is definitely gone, wherever you look there is a SB, MCD, BK, 711 or any other old chain store. Not impressive at all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556etienneh
10,It is not like in the movie,"I personally didn't like the boulevard, it has a really pitiable look from the outside, it was even evening, I walked through the stars etc but honestly it is not nice at all. It looks poor and dirty and when the stars on the streets end that's nothing else.If in LA of course it is something to see but if you don't have time I don't think will really matter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauravX2333GF
40,Catch the Sights,Walking along the Boulevard you can see Iconic locations and visit many interesting shops restaurants. It is worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mark2016-57
40,Ideal spot to see LA's attractions!,"Well Hollywood Blvd, is the street we see in movies or TV that are set in Los Angeles. Hollywood Blvd has the walk of fame, and as you make your way down you will also see attractions like the Dolby Theater, TCL Chinese Theater, El capitan theater, the studio where Jimmy Kimmy is filmed, museums, souvenir shops and lots of restaurants. You can also take a tour of celebrity homes - there are many tour operators that try to get customers on the Boulevard. The Holywood Blvd is also in close proximity to the Capitol records HQ tower, and sunset boulevard (parallel street). The only drawback is that the place is packed. Evenings can get frustrating - lot of people - tourists, tour operators, pedestrians, photographers, evangelists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go64922729842
30,Experience,Pros:There’s a few cool things to see. Some tours be better than you wondering around since you will be guided and you won’t feel lost. I highly advise researching the area so you know what to do and where to go in order.Virtual room is awesome experience! Probably the best part of Hollywood for us.Cons: too many people asking for tours and giving away CDs trying to become famous it gets freaking annoying. You have to be so careful because it’s a bit crowded and someone might take something without you knowing it.Overall very good experience! Just be aware of were you are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adriel727
30,Walk of Fame,The walk of fame was wonderful to see but very dirty and smelly. Shame they dont take better care of it. Lots of homeless people and also people hassling you to take free stuff. Just ignore them though and dont let that deter you. Such a busy place as all the tours leave from there. It is still an amazing place to see so much history. It is very long so dont expect to do in one day unless you are super fit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91debdeb
30,Two different worlds!,"Parked a few streets over for free. Sadly, the walk to Hollywood Blvd. smelled of urine. We saw raging loons arguing with others, loud obnoxious guys trying to sell CD’s & too many homeless laying in the sidewalks.Arrived to find blockades at The Chinese & Dolby Theatres. It was the premiere of “The Irishman”movie. Very cool that legends of the movie industry were attending a red carpet event the night we were there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SesameOntario
30,Meh!,"Okay, so it's your first time in LA. It has to be done... but only the once!Hollywood Boulevard is an array of tacky souvenir shops, people dressed up in costume for a fee and vendors selling (and shouting over a loud speaker on repeat) Gatorade! Stayed nearby in Loews Hollywood and this place seemed busy from first thing on a morning until late a night. It could be fun to spot the famous named stars on the sidewalk but having your wits about you took most of the fun out of the experience. I can't say we felt fearful at all but you are on alert due to the surroundings.Not much in the way of great eateries (if you go off Tripadvisor reviews) although we did enjoy quite a nice meal at California Pizza Kitchen) at Hollywood and Highland shopping complex. Madame Tussauds is also near the Chinese (TCL) Theatre which was a good evening's entertainment. Also, there's a outdoor walkway on the second floor of the Hollywood and Highland which allows you to view the Hollywood Sign in the distance (although you will require a good zoom lens).Go see the stars, take your photos then go back to your comfortable hotel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grays_on_Holiday
50,Has to be done,One of those things that has to be done. Doesn’t take long at all and easy parking in the Bollywood and highland shopping centre. We were done in under an hour as we didn’t eat there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PreeG
30,Mecca of Hollywood fans,"Definitely a place for fans of Hollywood but for the rest its just another street with cinemas & lots of eating places & gigantic souvenir shops, perhaps the biggest in the world! Go there if you are into movies or just to tick mark it on your list. Half a day can be easily spent walking around, visiting the theatres & the eating places that abound. For those with more time there are theatre tours & studio tours. But definitely do have an ice cream at the famous Ghirardelli confectionery to complete the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjulaH5
30,It’s ok,"Just walking around the area like Chinese Theatre and Walk of Fame. It’s over rated in my opinion. Be careful don’t go there too late at night as got lots of drunk and homeless people. Just hang around the main area and don’t walk too far out! You will find lots of people dress up as different characters eg. Jack Sparrow, Spider Man, Michael Meyers ect, you can take photos with them and pay small tips. It’s still worth the visit but don’t need to spend too much time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/no1_rabbit

30,Yikes!,"This is probably one of those things everyone needs to see once. It’s fun looking at the stars on the walk and seeing the Chinese theater and Dolby theater and the souvenir shops are pretty over the top. Other than that, it’s very crowded and has some very seedy shops and people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trmashaney
30,Disappointed with the Hollywood walk of fame,"The Hollywood walk of fame is disappointing as I didn't think their would be so many homeless people and though it would be cleaner but did see lots of interesting characters.Their are miles for stars on the footpath it was interesting to see them and take photos but very crowded.You also need to be carefull of poeple trying to rip you off with scams.Their are lots of souvenir shops with great thing, lots of food option.I wouldn't say I felt unsafe but wary of people, i'm glad i experirnced it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123kym
50,Take the walk get the camera ready for stars... On the ground with names... Selfie hot spot.,"Met a cool dude from germany and we walked the whole thing and talked took pics of the stars.. It was fun lots to eat, had some huge slice pizza almost like NYC but they could have lost the thick crust. China theater was great, original tommy burger... 21+ dispen. It was a fun, I didn't get to see it at night but I had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Where1go7
10,Not the Hollywood you'd expect,"To echo a review from 25th Aug by Jo, Hollywood Blvd is a complete mess. The stars themselves are difficult to pick out, mostly because you are trying to keep safe, but they are not maintained either.It's a dreadful street, littered with beggars, undesirables, street vendors and people trying to lure you in to their tacky shops or venues. Our 11 year old daughter found it quite distressing, especially when a man in a harrowing costume jumped out at her with a bloodied knife from an escape room venue - what a vile thing to do!The only bonus was, ironically, a restaurant we had booked down a back street away from the Boulevard called Madera Kitchen, which was wonderful. Out walk back to out car was fine as we walked down back streets which were much safer!Otherwise I would advise to avoid at all costs, not a fond holiday memory whatsoever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamsind2014
10,Didn't feel safe,"The stretch of stars is very crowded and we expected this. Did not expect the strew of beggars and street vendors being borderline aggressive towards you if you refuse to buy their produce or pay to take pictures with the costumed characters, half the stars are covered by vendors. Only gets worse after dark. Its interesting to see the stars themselves but it needs improving as currently is a chaotic mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocU6727HF
40,A Must Do whilst in LA,When to Hoolywood Boulevard as part of an orgainised tour & it was Amazing to see all the sights that I'd only ever seen on TV! I havr to say its a Must See whilst in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd231
50,Loved it!,Visited Hollywood Boulevard on a sat. late afternoon. It was packed! We enjoyed walking and going to the various stores and shops.We enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpshad
10,Not even worth the time,"I am currently in LA visiting for Scotland and went to Hollywood Boulevard for the first time today.It’s good to go and see the stars you want to see and get a picture.Be prepared for forceful rappers and hip hop artists trying to force you copies of their mixtapes and trying to “sign” th for you as if there going to be some kind of big shot.The same guys and other random guys hang about to sit and cat call on woman, if there with a man or not.Within about 5 minutes of me and my partner being in the street I had a guy following my partner and trying to talk to her and get close to her, after me telling him to leave him alone. He gave a whole big I’m from LA speech. Didn’t realise it was a Scotsman he was shouting at, scared the poor boy a wee bit!Just really not worth your time as a Young couple or female as the hassle from all of these guys is terribly every 5 steps or so there’s another one.These characters Really have gave a very bad Impression of Hollywood.Need to learn some respect, should come to Glasgow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calvinkox
30,A magnet drawing sightseers,"It has changed over time, and likely for the better. It still draws good crowds. It is likely slightly better than ""Average' as a sightseer's attraction, but less than ""Very Good."" I'll give the higher ratings to the attractions themselves and not the Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
20,What a disappointment!,"I have been to Hollywood Blvd 5 times now. When I first came in 1993 I was young and it was a complete dive. very sleezy, dirty and full of sex shops. I felt so vulnerable. 20 years later it had improved and modernised in one section with the DolbyTheatre and Hollywood and Highland complex put in. In 2019 it was disappointing to see a slow slideback into seedy. The footpath was soooo dirty and some stars cracked and broken. Homeless people, strange people dressed up as superheros that looked VERY unauthentic wanting photos and payment and very clogged footpaths. Shops have closed (eg American Eagle store has vacated a very large store that has been taken over by a cheap chinese clothing store) and old theatres left crumbling and empty. Hard to get the vision of the glamour years. With such a draw card for tourists you would think that something would be in place to keep this area a showcase of the movie world that people come to see. In my hotel room there is a magazine that has an article about an effort to revive the area with the movie industry investing in this idea and bringing their busineses back. Surely Hollywood earns some good tourist dollars to give back to the clean up of this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anitiaf
30,Walked the touristy portion,"We walked the touristy portion and drove on most of the remainder of Hollywood Blvd. On the former, the streets were very crowded. We stopped for ice cream and drinks and watched some of the entertainers. Some very underprivileged/poor street people were begging for money. And along the way, we saw where some homeless people live. Shameful that a few have so much, and many have close to nothing. or nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnaYYZ
10,Horrible experience,"Completely not worthy place to visit. Big mess, dirty, a lot of homeless people and drug addicted. Noone do anything to ""clean"" this ""main street"" - American dream",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319adama
20,Not what was expected,"I expected this strip to be glamorous and exciting... but reality was far from it. The walk of fame is dirty, smells and just an uncomfortable experience which is a shame. It is worth a shot because it is so famous, but it’s really disappointing that it is so badly kept, and the crowd that it attracts is interesting. Wouldn’t bring anything valuable on this trip, and keep family and friends close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt_92aus
10,"Crowded, dirty, and not what I expected","I thought the walk of fame was going to be a nice clean street and well presented. Not to be. This was dirty, crowded, and embarrassing part of the city. Sorry, it may sound harsh, but I was definitely expecting more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nwp72
30,A less glitzy Vegas Strip,"This is all about Holl-y-wood! It is crowded and hot and hard to linger or find your favorite stars on the walk of fame or in TLC theater courtyard...still it's a must stop if even just to see it. Lots of shopping here, souvenirs, tours and hollywood museums. One this Sunday there were lots of vendors set up on the walk of fame so it was extra crowded. It's fun in a very not serious way. Since this visit was with my two teenage boys who are not into the Hollywood thing (and neither am I ) or shopping so our visit was very short. There are some good places eat but weren't hungry so it was basically just to see it. I've been here on a previous visit with a girlfriend when it was not so busy and had a much better time wandering around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitaLyC
20,"Crowded, dirty and you have to want it",Ok you have the stars but every 5 feet you have to avoid someone who stops cold to take a photo posing by one. This usually pushes you into someone trying to sell you something. Loud and crowded you have to be pretty keen but you cxan see some cool stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heath2489
30,"Busy, should have got there earlier...","As big movie fans we were really looking forward to it... arrived around 1pm to a BIG crowd, our fault as I bet it was a lot quieter around 10/11am...Best place we visited was Highland & Hollywood Mall nice eateries, bars and shops you will also get the best view of the Hollywood sign from the 3rd floor of the Mall...Don’t get ripped off by high souvenir prices, there will be at least one store were you will find a bargain, we were lucky enough to find a $5 shop selling goods that we saw 3 times that in other shops.Biggest bit of advice, get there early and miss the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinUK15

20,The Boulevard is past its heydat..,The older happening places are closed up. The paint is all cracked and dry on them..the sidewalks are busted up with weeds growing up alongside the buildings. There's still a bunch of places that'll take your tourist dollars directly on the boulevard but just 1 block off its dead. The scientology building is still there. It seems so unlikely that the Hollywood Blvd of the 1980s even happened.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravilya2018
40,hollywood history,"Some of the other reviews were acurate, there are lots of ""weirdos"" so know that up-front, but the place is special!

10,A MESS,"When we have out of town guests one of the places they want to see is Hollywood Boulevard. Unfortunately, their vision of Hollywood Boulevard is non-existent. They will not casually stroll down the boulevard & bump into movie stars & celebrities. They will not be able to take pictures of their favorite actors' & actresses' stars on street at their leisure.What they will find is a mass of bodies crowding the street. A circus. A sh---t show. Some of what I've seen--a man with a massive python snake around his neck.There are so many people on the street you will see the snake until his head is up in your face---hot dog carts in the middle of the sidewalk with hot dogs wrapped in bacon in the heat of day just sitting there uncooked. ( Hot, unrefrigerated, shriveled bacon, anyone?)---people hawking wares--people screaming messages or songs into amplified equipment-- men with their pants being worn past their butts or holding a hand down the crotch of their pants (why? I have no clue)---many people dressed like characters competing for your money. Just who is the person in that costume hugging your child as you snap photo after photo for your memory book. You have no idea. Anyone can put on a costume and take pictures with you and/or your children. Scary thought!Forget looking down at the sidewalk to read the star's names. If you try you won't last long. You will bang into people. Just try to get a picture of your favorite star's star.The people we have taken never go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelPo11

30,This place is not safe,"Staying in LA for the weekend where else was we gonna visit, hollywood boulevard is word famous, but this is not a safe place to be and the later it gets the chances of something happening become more and more,Even in the day the whole area smells of piss and drugs, with locals harassing you with flyers, tickets, photos, cos, drugs n prostitution, never have I had to say NO so many times.Mainly the ethnic element of the area are the worse and the most threatening, mentioning your jewellery as they beg and follow around, and their is also a lot of crazy people walking the streets shouting and arguing at thin air,To be honest I was shocked that such a famous place could be such a sht hole,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoney1979m
20,Not the best time.,We drove to Hollywood from san Diego on a Saturday. First mistake. L.A. traffic is the worst. Hollywood Blvd is extremely crowded with people trying to take photos without getting run over by people. Lots of vendors and homeless on the sidewalks. We walked the blvd took a few photos and got back to drive in more traffic. Overall can now say I've seen it but that's about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123jcl11
10,Degenerate but not the worst I've seen,"Yes, as far as other reviews state, the street is overrun by street vendors, bad smells, hustling tour sellers, cheap merchandise etc. But unlike other such degenenerate places there was no abuse from the homeless, no junkie wars etc. As if they know that such bad behavior will have them evicted from their lucrative begging spots",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2763REpeterm
10,Crowded mess,"If you want to not be able to walk, to see homeless, beggars, scammers, dirty food vendors, etc., this is the place for you. Overly crowded tourist trap. Avoid it if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelO235
20,Dirty and run down,"With the exception of about two blocks, Hollywood Blvd is run down and people just begging for your money. Not much to see and not worth a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M-P-E-06
10,One of the grossest places on earth.,This street was so disappointing. I love film and old Hollywood but this place is just awful. Yes it’s cool seeing the walk of fame and the handprints but the street is very dirty. So many of the stars are in such bad shape. There was poop spread across the sidewalks. So many hounding venders every five feet trying to sell you something. The amount of homeless people on this street is unbearable. I get that it’s a tourist trap but there’s no reason to ever go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasblaze9

50,The Boulevard of dreams.,"My friend and I walked from the Hollywood bowl down Hollywood Boulevard past all the shops, man’s Chinese theater, and superheroes on the street. We felt totally safe and it was a beautiful evening for walking down the boulevard. Hollywood Boulevard is a must see to complete the trip of a lifetime to glamorous Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874elainem
40,Walking the famous boulevard,"Finally walked the Hollywood Boulevard. Scratch that one off my bucket list. Saw some really famous stars, from Charley Chaplin to Kaley Cuoco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coenvdbrink
40,Packed Street,"This area was very packed with people selling things, performing and dressed up wanting money for photos. Hard to see the stars with the amount of people present. Lots of fun and things to look at though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CEAJ8
30,busy and dirty,the food near the area was amazing. traffic was okay. the day was beautiful but the area was dirty and way to touristy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aries0467
20,Slightly worse than I expected,"I wasn't expecting it to be all glitz and glamour, I went with modest expectation, but it was worse than I thought. I stayed in a hostel on Hollywood and Highland, it was a great hostel, but the whole area of Hollywood Boulevard is really bad. So many scary homeless people about, the streets are dirty, the walk of fame is really nothing special (although I'm glad I've seen it). There's not really much to do here, just some shops and restuarants that you get anywhere else, but this is a pretty rough area. Tacky gift shops and street performers trying to part you with your money. I saw drugs and prostitution but it didn't cause me any trouble, just kept my head down. I stayed here because it was fairly central between the beach, Universal studios and downtown L.A all of which I wanted to visit, but there must be much nicer areas of L.A. to stay in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/821richardc
10,Not what you expected,"It was my first time coming to Hollywood, I was so annoyed. It was dirty and nasty. Hollywood boulevard was very bad, the only good pet was seeing the Hollywood sign to say you’ve seen it. The hotels are nasty and gross. Homeless and dirty people around every corner and literally on every street begging for money. People are high and prostitutes walk around and they started to hit on my husband while me and my children were with him. Do not come and stay in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956ziag
30,Not very interesting.,"It's a street, with stars on it.We took an Uber/Lyft, walked around for about 10 minutes... and left. I didn't see the value, but there were a lot of people walking around, so some people must like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarjana
10,Tacky. Avoid,"Wow... I heard it was a bit of a dive but man how awful this place is.I know celebrities go there for walk of fame, Oscars etc but I assure you it’s only when Obliged for publicity. No way they come anywhere near this disgusting place and without security around.❌Don’t bring your kids. It’s seedy.❌Stay away at night - every local warned us to avoid.❌ Drugs everywhere. People trying to scam and rip you off at every turn.❌ Tacky at every stop.I grew up thinking this is “Hollywood”. It’s not. It’s just a way to rip off unsuspecting tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3674BZchriscappola
40,Very quite place now comparing to 9 yrs. ago!,"I have been there once before with my brother, but this time I was with my husband. It is quite an interesting place! That said, I found the Hollywood Boulevard now very different comparing to my previous visit 9 yrs. ago, i.e. now it was very quite, with very less neon lights and live atmosphere. In fact, I was quite shocked to see how quite it was!!It is a must see place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayaseeli
10,A MUST SEE!,"Yes, you must see this to believe it. And also to give credit to the Hollywood illusion wizardry. Locate a grungy area in your hometown, cover the mess with a red carpet, surround a small area within it with a ribbon, release the good looking people in, ask the homeless to keep out of bounds and bang - you have yourself a Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jancze2018
50,amazing,"really wanted to go and have a look around here since we were in LA, interesting area, alot of old and new mixed together. worth the look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417michelleb
20,Overrated,"The first time we went, we were so excited to see Hollywood Boulevard but it turned out to be pretty overrated. There were way too many people on the streets so it was pretty annoying. The only cool thing was seeing the stars especially of someone you're a fan of, but that was about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amardirian
10,Disappointing - tacky tourist trap,"We drove here from Santa Barbara - such a disappointment and not what we expected at all, smelly, tacky and dirty. Full of tourist tat shops and generally a pretty depressing place to be. It was pretty ugly and unpleasant in the day, can’t imagine it’s better in the evening! They seriously need to invest some of the £25k each star plaque costs (there are over 2,000) into improving this place!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littledsheff
20,Dirty and Underwhelming,"We were pretty excited to check out Hollywood Blv, however, we found it to be very dirty, stinky and run down. Not at all what pictures make it look like. We found a few of the stars we were looking for but it took a while. Definitely recommending looking up where the stars are located before arriving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravelGuides
20,Not What I Expected,"Visited for the first (and probably last) time in November. It is cool to see the Chinese theater, and all of the stars, but it is such a let down. Dirty streets, cheap vendors and people dressed as characters that will walk right up to you and put their hands on your shoulders. Wouldn't wanna bring a kid here, not much for them to do, but get lost and maybe see something they shouldn't. Good luck finding a bathroom. Not my cup of tea, and that my friends, is the tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8833SJsamanthaj
40,A Must See,"Visited last year as part of a tour of the California West Coast. We had a guided walking tour which I would recommend. It was good to see the walk of fame, Chinese Theatre and of course a view of the Hollywood sign, however, now we have seen it, probably would not return as the whole area was surprisingly run down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthaw99
40,"Go for the experience, but guard your wallet","It's tacky, kitschy, and a must see. See the highlights like the TLC (Chinese Theater). Stop at the Dolby. Look for your favorite star on the otherwise unimpressive Walk of Fame. If you spend more than 2 hrs here, you have truly spent too much time. Much more impressive at night than daytime because of the lights, but watch your wallet. Lots of shady characters on Hollywood Boulevard knowing there are tourists with cash. And, because it is crowded, expect to wait a minute or two for that ""perfect"" photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfm02719
30,"Just OK, but worth seeing once.","I decided that Hollywood Boulevard is a lot like Bourbon Street in New Orleans. It's crowded, a little dirty, kind of seedy and cheesy, and people are constantly trying to hand you stuff you don't want - but you probably should walk down it once. Everything smells like weed, but I found that to be true of most of LA (recreational is legal in CA). It was fun for a while to see the stars on the Walk of Fame for celebrities we liked. We're from Chicago so we're pretty used to seeing a lot of homeless people everywhere, but for folks who are not accustomed to this, it could be a bit of a shock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastrada
10,Disappointed and Scary!,"So we are spending a week in LA which has been nothing short of amazing. I really wanted to visit the walk of fame so after a day at Santa Monica beach we headed to Hollywood to grab some dinner and experience what we thought would be an amazing evening. How wrong was I?! In between the homeless scavenging through bins, the people high on drugs, the threatening leaflet pushers who told my husband they would bite him if he didn’t take a leaflet, then there’s the smoking venue which fills the streets with the smell of weed - I could go on and on. Travelling with two 17 year olds, 11 year old and 9 year old who needless to say were terrified. We got out of there as quick as we could and returned to our hotel which feels safe. Such a disappointment and a sad reflection of what real Hollywood life is like. The sad thing is we drove through a few days prior and it looked so vibrant and fun we really wanted to experience it. No thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sazzer30
10,What a DUMP!!!!!,"What a gross, disgusting place!!!! So sad!! Took a family vacation and LA/Hollywood and pay tribute to some stars and their craft only to be in this filthy armpit?!?!?! Would have selected 0 star review but wasn't an option......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hammer7576
30,Fun Visit,We went as a family. There was a lot to see. We loved finding the stars of some of our favorite people. It got a little crowded around the Dolby Theater. There are a lot of people doing whatever it takes to make a dollar from costumed characters to people trying to sell stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberleeB926
20,Overrated sight !,"The Hollywood boulevard is a very busy street . The traffic is terrible , especially when they close the street for events. There is only shops that sell trinkets and junk. If your accommodation is there , you should prepare with earplugs . The noise is hard till the morning hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anne_wallin
10,So disappointing,My husband and I went to a program at Dolby Theater on a Saturday night. We walked by Chinese Theater and Hollywood/Highland stores. It is a crowded mess of people and curbs so full of street venders and tacky “super heros” that it was hard to walk. No one looked like they were having a good time. I can’t believe the city doesn’t have or enforce street vending laws here. An embarrassment to history of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmccabe813
10,Trashy tourist trap,"I want to warn other moms: please don't bring your children here. Police dragging people out of bathrooms, someone tried to buy my clean urine, aggressive tour bus promoters, prostitutes soliciting in broad daylight, it's disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erinboyle26

40,Home to some of LA's iconic sights.......,"If you are visiting LA, then Hollywood Boulevard is a must see location. The site is home to a number of famous sights including the Walk of Fame with gold stars set into the sidewalk, the TCL Chinese Theatre with the hand and footprint casts of stars outside, the historic El Capitan Theatre, and the home of the Oscars, the Dolby Theatre. The area is a little seedy with hustlers in costumes waiting to lure you into chargeable photo opportunities, but well worth a visit !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem

10,"Dirty, one visit a lifetime is more than enough","Not what we expected in any way.Homeless people everywhere, people shoving flyers at you and trying to hustle you every hundred yards. Filth everywhere, famous stars are in weird locations in the middle of nowhere.Not a place you feel safe at night, no restaurants that appear clean or friendly.Visit once, say you did it and move on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldtiredandretired

40,Busy,"I am glad that I finally saw the famous Hollywood Boulevard. It is very busy place, full of life, a bit of tourist trap but kind of enjoyable. I think I have visited much more interesting places in my life, but I would regret if I didn't come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvaF2Eva
50,A must see!,"Some call it Hollyweird others call it Hollywood, from viewing the stars on the pavement to the souvenir shops and street artits and lookalikes it's worth a visit,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmur101
20,Pretty horrible,"We arrived in LA at the start of January and we were only staying for a night.We decided we would spend part of the night at Hollywood Boulevard before it got too dark so that we could see the stars and the sights before it got too dark.I did not expect what we got.The whole street is really run down. There are homeless people every 100 yards. The place is filthy. I didn't see a single restaurant that made me think ""that looks nice, we'll eat there.""We didn't spend a huge amount of time in LA but it struck me as a city of 1000 slums sprinkled with areas of extreme wealth. Hollywood Boulevard supported that theory entirely. The HOLLYWOOD walk of fame was littered with homeless people and junkies - and believe me, that's a criticism of the city of LA - not the homeless people!!Honestly, I would plan to spend about 30 minutes here if you are visiting LA unless you like souvenirs, terrible street performers, drug addicts, run down restaurants and being generally disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Graham2412
10,"So disappointing and veryexpensive indeed,don't eatat the Travestre Resturaunt","We took,a Christmas break to LA,and stayed at the legendry Garland hotel,the first day,getting off at Hollywood and Highland metro stop,I was horrified,at old and out of date the buildings were,the walk of Fame was full of of homeless drug addicts on welfare,it stank,of burgers,and had all take out,and tuck shops,smelt of urine,sunset Blvd,was full of cheap,medical places,for Hollywood fallen with hiv itwas horrible and deeply depressing watching people carrying all their worldly goods in supermarket trollies,We had one meal at the Travestre resturaunte,(the only resturaunte the mall)the waiter was so rude and insisted on an 18xdollar tip,and we had no idea,about the tipping system he chased us out!shouting don't you come back!it was horrible.We did a trip to super stars homes,universal)and went to the Arkwrigh theatre to see Stan and Laurel,ok)it's a pity that they don't invest,in making it more chique,and less expensive,with better cleaner facilities,all the palm trees are dying,and it's a pity that the super stars don't build up he area,where they take in the money!very frightening for 2018!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyhichcox
50,"Grohmans, Giardelli, Stars Walk of Fame!","Everything we expected and more! Grohmans Theatre is huge. Great photo op! Giardelli Chocolate shop is sweet with tasty testers, ice cream bar, gift shop. Stars on the sidewalk are easily identified except for trump’s which was hacked to pieces and surrounded by rude graffiti...another great photo op!Go around Halloween and you’ll be surrounded by costumed superheroes and characters from your dreams!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyBain
10,Utterly disgusting,"I can't say enough about how filthy, crowded, and seedy Hollywood Boulevard is. It's really hard to see the stars because it's so crowded and when you do see one you're interested in you can't get a picture because there are tons of people walking over it. The best part were the foot and handprints and signatures in cement but, again, it was so crowded that it greatly detracted from the experience. Besides the ridiculous crowds, the whole area was dirty and smelled from the numerous people cooking meat on grills in the middle of the sidewalk and homeless people. The worst part was the obnoxious costumed characters who tried to get people to take pictures with them in their cheap, ill fitting, Party City costumes, many of whom were VERY OBVIOUSLY on serious drugs and behaving in ways that made our teens very uncomfortable. I would definitely suggest that anyone visiting LA skip Hollywood Boulevard and find literally anything else to do instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilyVonSchtupp
30,Holiday Crowds,"The Boulevard hasn’t been this crowded from a few years back. It was noticeably different this time around. It could be just because of the holidays. Places to see here include the Pantages (where Wicked is playing), Ripley’s, Hard Rock Cafe, Madame Tussaud, Museum of Illusions, Grauman’s Chinese Theater and many specialty shops, to name a few. There are also many suited characters that cheapen the place. Street performers galore. This is akin to the Times Square of LA. Free parking is available on the streets or at a paid garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
30,over blown and crowded,"Spent about 30 min traipsing down the street looking for names of ""stars"" (and others) on the sidewalk. Way too crowded, dirty and unappealing to stay any longer - saw a few names in the concrete outside the TCL Chinese Theatre then couldn't wait to get the next taxi out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miccla11
30,Crowded tourist area,We opted to drive down this famous area rather than get out & deal with the massive crowds and street vendors/costumed folks haggling. Truly not sure you would get much better pictures on the sidewalk as I got from car given the crowds. Only reason would be to hunt down a specific star. The teenagers got kick out of seeing everything & we were able to then fit in other activities in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681lizs
30,Dirty dump,"Hollywood blvd is just dirty and full of homeless, drug dealers, and husstlers everywhere, the place is not safe day or night the smell is unreal, apart from that it is good to see the stars names that line both sides of the streets but once you have seen them there isnt much else to do. The place is run down with bored up shops etc, plus it is very expensive there is nothing to do apart from trawl the trinket shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe15
20,Downhill,"First went to the TCM film festival in 2014, went again this April (2018) and wow, what a difference. In just 4 years, the sidewalks have been taken over by tent cities just a couple of blocks from the Chinese theater. Really a shame, hopefully LA hasn't lost all will to keep the city safe and clean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inalbertsm
50,Check it out,Definetly a good sight to see. The stars and the famous people's hands and feet. Walking around seeing them all is mesmerising.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiJoJo5
10,Very Busy and Dirty,"Before I came to the USA, I imagined Hollywood Boulevard as a very glamorous place. However, when we visited the place three days ago, we were so disappointed with what we saw. There were beggars everywhere. A lot of homeless people were sleeping along the streets with their pets. We couldn't even enjoy taking our own photos as people wearing costumes would approach you and say, ""Come on, let's take a photo together"", and once you took a picture with them, Voila! You have to pay them for including them in your photos like they were a celebrity. Other people will sell you with other stuff like CDs, cards, etc. and they would even persuade you to buy it. The place would have been beautiful if these things have been attended by the government.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358jaysong
30,Once in a lifetime,HB is one of those places you see once for the experience but probably would not revisit. The walk of fame stars are on both sides of the street in double columns. There are so many names that it seems if a name is not there the person must really be a nobody.There are some historical sites such as the Chinese Theatre and Roosevelt Hotel but they are surrounded by souvenir shops and the like as well as folk passing out advertising material or touts looking for business.You can tour the Dolby Theatre but this takes you off the Boulevard and needs its own review.Overall we found HB rather ho-hum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT652
30,"If you like ""stars"" on the boulevard...","The main attraction of Hollywood Boulevard are the stars in the sidewalk, NOT real stars walking on the sidewalk. Aside from the iconic Chinese Theater and the shopping at Hollywood & Highland, there isn't much else to do on Hollywood Boulevard other than buy cheap souvenirs. If you want to see stars in the flesh, most of them shop and eat in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and Malibu. Since most of them dress ""low key"" in public, they are not easy to spot when they're out and about. The further east you go down Hollywood Boulevard from Highland, the more ""ghetto"" or ""ratchet"" it gets. A lot of homeless people live in Hollywood frequent the boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
20,Dirty and neglected,"We’re staying in LA for 2 days and are staying at a lively hotel just off Hollywood Blvd. what a disappointment this place is! Like so many other reviewers before me, it’s just dirty, smelly and full of shady characters.The side walk isn’t maintained well, chips and holes everywhere, be careful not to trip!Get very unsafe, even during the day. Lots of homeless people and what appears to be junkies. You would think that the city would put more effort into keeping Hollywood and Sunset Blvds more presentable. I’ll be sure to avoid this area should I come back to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liane_os83

30,Way overrated,it's hot and sunny and its simply a sidewalk with names on it. It is really hot in the area and a lot of restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielF9392
20,Not What I Expected,When you see this on TV it looks all polished and clean. It was such a disappointment. It is dirty and run down. There are lots of shops that are closed down and barricaded up. Parking was difficult to find and expensive even for a short stay. The stars were interesting to see as they span across all walks of fame and date back some years. So if you are desperate to see the walk by all means go otherwise give it a miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264sallyh

I did not enter the mall, museum or restaurants, be mindful of ""hustlers"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nyron2015
30,"Too many people, too many hustlers",We got here on the hop-on-hop-off bus and needed to change to go on the route we'd chosen so we had time to kill. The boulevard is fascinating but hard work. You're surrounded by breathtaking movie historic things but distracted by people disturbing your visit. Don't answer the questions of those in costumes and never take their offered hand. Enjoy the names you read in the stars under your feet. Amazing number of homeless people too. I suppose it's good to be able to say 'I've been there'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reubenm97

30,"Get your map, look your stars and escape.","This place is awful, full of tourist in a rush with no a good hour to visit. But your love for your stars will make to visit them, to feel you are with Mrs Janis Joplin, Mr Jimmy Hendrix, Mr Leonard Nimoy, Mrs Julie Andrews, the keepers of every child fantasies, Hanna & Barbera etc. So I recommend to look for your stars previously (there are some pretty good apps for it), get to the boulevard, look your stars and get out as quick as possible. There are many Tours here, but I consider them totally unnecessary as any authentic fan will have the info about his/her beloved stars. Besides there are a lot of fake anything: fake Marilyns, fake Michael Jacksons, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400guillermop
10,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"Definitely would not recommend. It is dirty, strewn with litter and looks totally neglected. You are harrassed constantly by hawkers and people dressed up wanting payment for photos. Definitely feels unsafe at night.

Now I've come to LA again with my husband and daughter as it's their first time and knew we had to go so they could at least tick it off their 'done' list.It's a truly seedy place with not much to see, unless you want to see people taking drugs, peddling crap to you and making you wish you never came there. We saw a man on the street who was drugged out and sort of frothing at the mouth and walking unsteadily towards us, falling over and trying to hold onto people's legs. It actually made me feel sick.I'm not sure how this place ever got touted as a tourist destination, it's a hole.

10,Getting worse,"We’ve travelled to Hollywood multiple times. I’m sad to say that it is in the dirtiest state I’ve seen. The amount of homeless living on the street is heartbreaking, the amount of con-artists with their “free CDs” has increased - my question to them is who has a CD player nowadays anyhow? The street smells like urine. It went through a stage where it looked like some pride was taken. Not anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_me_happy99
20,It's not what it's all Hyped up to be!,"too,too busy. no big deal. and agreed with the rest of the reviews. very dirty area. streets need to be cleaned up. would not go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juicee000
10,Hollyweird its not!,"LOL Hollywood Boulevard is freaking Disneyland compared to what it used to be. Boarded up buildings,no street lights, the stench of urine everywhere,homeless people, middle aged transexual hookers roaming the streets trying to catch your eye and give you the sign. Thats when it was Hollyweird.Now it's kid friendly and everything. Shopping malls places to eat. Lights. Not that I would go there if I was a tourist. I don't see the point. But I'm just saying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kearyb2018
10,Awful.,Dirty. Over crowded. Not worth the visit. Also felt very u safe at night. Clearly lots of problems here. Tourist groups everywhere adding to the misery. Take a quick pic of the famous cinema and get the hell out of there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wassa_1976
20,"Disappointing, dirty,",We stayed in an apartment just off Hollywood Boulevard on or holiday and took a stroll down there a couple of times. This place was absolutely awful - I actually felt quite scared and very wary of my surroundings. There are so many homeless people lining the streets with their trolleys or just sat in doorways and under benches sleeping. I stopped a couple of times waiting outside shops and was asked numerous times for a cigarette or money - the people were very persistent. Really sad sight to see. The stars are good to see as is the Chinese Theatre and hand prints of the stars. See those and then leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithb62
40,A shopper's galore,Shops absolutely everywhere as well as all the sidewalks lined with stalls and people selling celebrity home tours. Good luck finding your favourite celebrities Hollywood Star among the hundreds covering the paths!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadartemis
50,LA at its best!☺️,Woah! This place is stunning👌🏼Honestly so many photo opportunities and is overall just blooming beautiful!❤️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ejboden27
20,Not sure what all the hype is about...,"We were very disappointed with the overall experience. It is definitely a giant tourist trap that locals use to their advantage. It's become less about the stars and more about characters. People dress up in various outfits and try to lure you into taking a picture with them. Beware, though, if you do take a picture with them they demand you to pay them. We also had multiple people approach us handing out CDs - which we suggested against taking because they too demand money as a result. We couldn't wait to get out of there so we could stop being pestered. Very upsetting how the overall experience has been altered over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Sharks88
20,Unattractive area,"The area is dirty, smells of urine and is very run-down. There are lots of touts trying to con you into purchases. Apart from places like the Chinese and Dolby Theatres and maybe the pavement stars the area totally lacks class. Why does the local authorities not capitalize on the potential here?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betula103
10,Dirty!!!,Give this place a miss! The streets are filthy with homeless drug addicts everywhere! The stars on the ground are pathetic even Donald Trumps had been destroyed by someone! The shops are not great either. We visited universal studios which was good but expensive and took a bus tour showing you Rodeo Drive and other areas but you need to be loaded as all shops designer Gucci etc...I would not go back or recommend this place Venice beach is also scruffy and full of homeless people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobb1971
40,Pretty Interesting,I toured Hollywood Blvd during my visit to LA and it was pretty interesting touring the boulevard and looking at the stars. We didn’t take the paid tours. There are websites that tell you where you’re favorite persons Star is so you can go there and take your pictures. I didn’t see the need for a guide. There are a lot of souvenirs stores as you’d expect. What I didn’t expect though is the amount of stores selling sex toys. They are a lot of smoke shops but it seems none of them sell recreational marijuana. You’ll have to get that elsewhere off the boulevard. We found a place about 9 miles away. That was interesting. As you walk along the boulevard you can see the Hollywood sign in the background. There was also someone putting your name on a blank star so you can take pictures. That’ll cost you $5 or $10. That stopped when the cops came around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean156
20,Not as good as it’s portrayed,"Disappointing place that we were looking forward to seeing. Lots of tourists around but the street was dirty, crowded with too many touts trying to sell tours etc. Some interesting bits like the Dolby Theatre and Mann’s Chinese Theatre but the rest was unimpressive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839iaina
30,Overated tourist place,Full of tourists. So many souvenir shops and street vendors. Nothing much to see except for several people in costumes that you need to pay to take a picture with. It was nice to see the stars in the sidewalk though but aside from that nothing much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANALIZA49
50,Another must do,Hollywood Boulevard is great heaps to see & do plenty of shops & places to eat & pretty easy to get a parking spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
30,"You've got to go, but its not as you would expect...","Hollywood was one of the obvious places for us to go whilst we were in LA. We are still glad we have been and ticked it off our list but in agreement with many of the other reviews on here, it just wasn't as we expected.It was uncomfortably HEAVING and a bit of a tourist trap-- full of the same kind of souvenir shops and street vendors (very commercialised).Still, it was good to see the stars and associated famous attractions.I would still recommend stopping by for a look but please be open minded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiam670
30,"Visit to say that you have, but don't expect too much","Hollywood Boulevard is a place you should visit to say that you have been there while visiting the Los Angeles area. Take in the stars and some of the landmarks. I would take the tour anytime from morning to evening. I wouldn't feel as comfortable during the night. It can be a bit of tourist trap, but it's great to walk the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bx2L
30,Legendary strip with mix of seedy to the sublime,"Walked the blvd of broken dreams on a steamy night. Reminded a bit of Times Square pre disneyfication, lots of homeless and transients. Lots of boarded up storefronts and junk smoke and souvenir shops. Graumans is a hokey highlight, but cool to see handprints ranging from stars of bygone days such as Shirley Temple. Cool new Dolby Theater and some modern installations. Could morph into a Vegas strip in coming years. Just not that much to do unless you're looking for weed or some cheap souvenirs. Lots of stars inlaid in street with some highlights being Bruce Lee and Michael Jackson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvc73
30,A bit underwhelming,"Hollywood Boulevard is one of those places that has to be seen. It has lots of shops and restaurant and things to do. Theres a non stop attack on your senses from what buildings there are, new boutique type shops and restaurants and yes the great Stars and Hollywood walk of fame on the footpath to admire. Just remember that there are a lot of people in close proximity to you and pick pockets are rife. Car parking is extortionate and the whole place has a bit of a run down feel and needs some serious rejuvination. If you walk about a mile or so down the length of the Boulevard the whole place takes a sinister turn and turns almost into a red light district. It is well worth seeing this place just for the entertainment value of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetsetter2771
20,Kinda cool but kinda rundown,Took my wife and 3 kids to look over the area. It was neat to see the stars on the sidewalk. The old buildings were cool. It had some inappropriate stores and was very dirty. Bathrooms were hard to find. We were concerned with the cleanliness of the restaurants there too. We did find some souvenirs that weren’t too expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9706JYchrisc
40,Hollywood Experience,While in LA we wanted to experience a bit of Hollywood and this is the place to do it. We parked at the Hollywood and Highland shopping complex which was very convenient and surprisingly affordable. The street was packed with people but we enjoyed taking it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoVols79
30,Prepare Your Senses,"Wow! I'm a native Angeleno, but taking a trip to Hollywood Boulevard can be a bit overwhelming for the senses. Granted, I was there on a particularly busy day with 3,000 attending an event at the Dolby Theatre and a Los Angeles Cultural Carnival parade in progress that closed quite a length of the boulevard. The crush of tourists, parade goers, and event attendees meant shoulder to shoulder slow walking along the sidewalk, which was also filled with street vendors for the parade. Anyone trying to take a personal souvenir photo at any of the iconic places lining the boulevard or of the Walk of Fame would have a hard time doing so. Reggae, Salsa, and Rap blaring from speakers competed in a weird cacophony. It was a lot for the senses to take in. A bit overwhelming if you aren't used to that many people, sights and sounds closing in on you all at once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CacheOn
20,Just Hollywood,Does not satisfy our expectation but can found great place to stay here depending on each ones appetite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yoshiok573
30,"Crowded, dirty and all-the-time-traffic","Iconic place, a must-visit place so please prepare yourself to be in a very crowded area. No matter where you go, stay on the street or move into a shop - its full.It is dirtier than I thought. It is still fun though!We tried to drive through it - impossible. We were stuck there in traffic for at least 20 minutes, and only did one block!For some reason when I see this Boulevard on TV it somehow looks more glamorous than what it is in real life - but I guess that is just one of those things in life :)We found some great shops, and some shops that tried to sell us bad quality souvenirs for ridiculous amount of money. So be careful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thingstodiscover
30,A must but quite underwhelming,"You think of Hollywood boulevard as the glitz and glamour of LA particularly when you think about the Oscar ceremony and the walk of fame... to be honest its a bit dirty, nothing flash but certainly a must if you are in LA just because of the nostalgia of this iconic street. The stars on the walkway are everywhere... it is amazing just how many there are and some of the more well known stars can be far from the main Hollywood drag..There are plenty of touts selling tickets for trips, souvenir shops and bars and eateries. Also some of the would be actors pretending to be everything from Darth Vader to Elvis trying to make a buck from having a photo with you...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
30,Underwhelming,"It is very surprising that local authorities have no plans how to reinvent Hollywood Boulevard. This place is so disappointing. Busy, touristy, cheap in every sense (except for prices). There are rows of low buildings extending along both sides of the street. Those buildings look very unattractive. Lots of banners and flickering lights make the whole area looking just lame and cheesy. No good restaurants, interesting shops or unique activities but boring gift shops are on every corner of the street. The place really deserves better treatment. Now it is stripped of history and its respect. Such a waste of potential. Must see in L.A. but keep your expectations at a minimum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acidov
50,A must place to see,"It was just great to walk up and down this street and look at all the famous names in the stars on the footpath. It is a must place to see and you only need to see it once. It is very crowded and don't forget to climb the stairs to get a view of the famous ""Hollywood sign (we unfortunately weren't directed to the place or we didn't understand the directions.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olie293
50,"To see once in your life, at least :)","Honestly, I heard a lot of bad reviews about Hollywood boulevard like “you’re gonna be disappointed”, “it is such a disappointing place”, “it’s not worth it” etc… we found it great! Our air bnb was 10mn walking from the far east end of Hollywood boulevard so we walked it all, found some great stars, cool people (like J.Lo, Shakira and Jennifer Anniston are quite far on the east of the boulevard). Lots of cheap souvenir shops, lots of shopping centres, coffees etc. Lots of tourists when we enter to the “centre” (aka TCL Chinese theatre area) but like everywhere you go to a touristy area let’s face it, it’s just like that! So, yes there are a lot of people asking you if you wanna go on a tour or a bus tour or whatever, but honestly it’s much worse in Cambridge (UK)! And yes there are some homeless people in the streets but A) they don’t ask for anything, they just literally don’t have a home, and B) if you’re shocked by that, man don’t ever go to San Francisco!!!!We liked it and had a good walk around. I still think it is somebody to see one in a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691aureliem
20,Disappointed - Not what we expected,"Hollywood Boulevard! From everything you hear and how it has been depicted in movies and the media, it sounds like such a glamorous location. We stayed in a hostel right in the heart of the strip of the walk of fame and we couldn't wait to leave. The whole area is very tacky and comes across very cheap and it honestly felt like we were living in the centre of a homeless community. Way over hyped and I honestly wouldn't recommend visiting unless you really wanted to get pictures of the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissR7662FR
20,Disappointing,"Being a first-timer, I was expecting to get a taste of Hollywood Glamour and was pretty disappointed. All I can say about it is that I feel like it's a completely missed opportunity for a special experience. It smells absolutely terrible, the streets are lined with shops that aren't family friendly in the least, it's probably the dirtiest place I've ever been, and it feels pretty unsafe. I would have loved to see more food trucks, street performers, or even maybe some information booths where they could help point out certain Stars you'd like to see on the Walk of Fame or something of the sort, to make it a special experience. It was cool to see the Chinese Theatre and some of the Stars lining the streets. We were expecting to stay longer and ended up leaving early because it just wasn't what we were expecting it to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriamjean
20,Over hyped attraction,"Dirty sidewalks, the alleys smell like pee and weed. The best time to visit is after dark when the lights turn on so that at least there's some kind of glamour linked to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awnr2017
10,Ignore the 5 Star Reviews,"Hollywood Boulevard is a complete dump, The harassment is sadly not limited to street vendors either (who's 'talents' appear to be limited to dressing up in cheap fancy dress). If you're after $10 mixtapes from your favourite unknown artists then make sure you take enough money as they forcefully shove these into your hand and try and charge you. If this was the only problem then fine, but it's not, the stars on the floor are in terrible condition and in some cases covered in urine, this was by far the most depressing place I've ever been, and that's even after getting the LA metro! I also saw a homeless man sat on the street scratching away at his sores... DISGUSTING place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmK695PP
10,Dirty and rundown,"Seemed to be more vagrants than tourist. The place is run down and shabby and the ambience is not helped by the piles of human waste and the drugged up or sleeping vagrants. Save yourselves time and give it a miss, the rest of LA is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56jg65
50,Great place for tourists,"Very central, can jump on tours here, Jimmy Kimmel, good restaurants everywhere (Hard Rock, Johnny Rockets). Safe for tourists to explore at night...at least near the Roosevelt Hotel area. Walk of Fame or even get lucky enough to catch a movie premiere & see a big star. Hollywood Blvd is an excellent starting point for any tourist travelling to Tinseltown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115nathanw
10,LA should be embarrassed,"Went with a high school band to LA and spent an afternoon on Hollywood Blvd. Thought the Tenderloin in San Francisco was bad until I saw this place. Drug addicts shooting up right in front of the public, CD scammers in your face demanding money and not a single LAPD officer to be seen. The LA city council should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngE9689KK
30,"Kind of Disappointing, Head downtown instead","This place is kind of gross, and felt unsafe. Walking down the walk of fame we were constantly accosted by people trying to separate you from your money. Not much left to the hey day of glamourous Hollywood. Musso and Franks and the Frolic Room was an oasis from the barrage of cheap shops and cheap people out on the blvd. A drive by is enough if you have to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cglopez911
10,Overpriced trash of California,"Disgusting, many of the stars are cracked and dirty. Too many aggressive and annoying character beggars and CD hawkers (CDs are outdated anyway). Homelessness is also an obvious problem. For us as Australians the accommodation to stay in the area was also way overpriced even during off peak times. If you do come here do not go on the bus tours instead get an Uber or Lift and check out the walking trails and lookouts. A place I wish we had avoided. Much better to look at on Google.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5264IOkimr
30,"Disappointing place, but as dry as it is, you can extract from it a little bit of juice.","I'm not going to repeat the stuff mentioned in other reviews. Junkies, beggars, cd-sellers and other creepy creatures of the night are real and wait for you in there. Definitely not the place I would visit with my girlfriend, if I had one.However, I was alone, so I made a run and interracted with all the local people I could find. Therefore I visited the temple of Scjentologists and watched their movie explaining their fundamental beliefs. After that I could ask them all the questions I wanted, including their opinion about South Park episode dedicated to them. After that they wanted to sell me their book, which I didn't take.Then I found a Jehovah witness and learned they are pretty similar to the ones we have in Poland. Hell, he was even giving to people the same flyers as they do in here - except in English.At the end I found a guy playing on a horn. Gave him a dollar in exchange for some story. What I got was a long explanation of his beliefs, that involved both Plato, Socrates and a couple of others and witnessing stuff yourself being placed at the top position, hearing stuff through direct communication being in the middle and writting being the worst thing in the world.Meanwhile scammers tried to rip me, but while I was always curious and polite during conversations with them, I kept being assertive and never actually bought anything from them. Didn't spent a penny on them, except for the guy with the horn, who I actually wanted to speak. Never got offended or threatened by any of them either and I roamed around from 13:00 - 2:00. Don't act like a wuss and don't be overly aggressive and you should be fine.My general advice is: take this place as it is and explore what it has to offer - not those silly stars and souvenir shops that sell the same stuff as the shop right next to it, but all those crazy people from all over America that live in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225_ukaszl
20,"Dirty, Skanky and Full of Con Artists","I had the unfortunate experience of staying in a Motel near Hollywood Boulevard for a couple of nights and I can honestly say I will never go back. The place wreaks of tourist trap, yet offers practically nothing in terms of things to do.After spending 30 minutes walking along the dirty street reading a bunch of names on stars, most of which I've never heard of, I had had enough. The closer you get to TCL Chinese Theatre, the more scammers and con artists there are trying to make a quick buck. Be careful of people pretending to be nice offering you ""free"" things like CD's or perhaps photos of their costume. They really expect a reward for these ""free"" offerings so the best you can do is ignore them or politely say no. Sadly, they're inescapable, so be prepared.Most of the more popular star names are at the busiest part of the boulevard (again, TCL Chinese Theatre area), so taking a photo can prove difficult as you will have to essentially stand still in a crowded area, blocking anybody wanting walk by, in order to take a photo. Forget about getting a photo of yourself without a hundred other people in the shot either.Overall, Hollywood Boulevard was plain nasty. If you've ever been to Times Square, it's honestly 100x worse. I didn't mind Times Square because it's actually unique and spacious to avoid the scammers. That's not possible on Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewK508
30,A place to check out,It's a place worth checking out quickly if you have the time but there really isn't a whole lot to see and it is not the best area. It is like a spread out low budget version of Times Square.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainCookieDaddy
20,"Dirty, daggy & it’s lots the Hollywood star",Second visit here since 2011 as I wanted my partner to see it buts its just gone down hill. Dirty very and daggy with terrible costume characters and lots of homeless around. Didn’t feel safe at night. There’s no tourist help just people trying to sell you rubbish cds and rip if merchandise that’s made in China.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRaeCRae
10,California's toilet.,"I don't understand ,nor ever will, the fuss about California's toilet, Hollywood. And in the epitome of it all, the smelly and unclean boulevard is simply reminiscent of all other nearby smelly and unclean streets of this massive waste disposal known as LA. Maybe it's the long-endured irresponsibility of the city's administration, or the great income disparity as one palm-lined street of pop-up boutiques can easily lead into a corner full of the homeless in tents, or the fabricated personalities hovering over empty promises of stardom and all that other bs over it's already ugly, threatening cityscape. But to many of the mindless masses, it still attracts them with promises of glam and glitz , or whatever. This wasteland is simply a result of our dumb innocence and compliance for the entertainment industry for all these years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariaeul_liab2016
10,Disappointment Boulevard,"I’ve never been so stressed at an INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED tourist location! Very disappointed to find that the place is nowhere near it’s reputation.What I expected: clean and vibrant. Being bit of a tourist trap is understandable given its popularity.What I experienced:1) Wannabe rappers trying to scam me by handing me their mixtapes on a CD (btw who really use CD players anymore?) so they can demand payment in the form of tips.2) Impersonators blocking my way to urge me to take photos with them so they can charge me for it afterwards.3) Tour buses trying to get you to ride their “Benz” (they ain’t wrong, the buses are manufactured by Benz, but the really crap model)4) All the stars are filthy and cracked, probably never cleaned since installation.5) Everywhere you look there are weird loiterers, drunks, homeless people that doesn’t make the place feel safe.6) The stink of urine emanating the entire area makes me feel like I’m walking through a very long bathroom.7) Towards the east end, there were lots of adult sex costume stores that made the place look cheap.8) For some reason there are recruiters pushing Scientology at you.My advice: get to the sidewalk directly across the TCL Chinese theatre *click click, click click*, walk a few steps east to the Dolby theatre *click click, click click*, take a few shots of the stars on the Boulevard *click click, click click*, and if you have any particular stars you’re looking for I suggest you find them first on Google.I spent less than an hour there and I felt I’ve stayed for too long.At least I can tell my friends I’ve been to Hollywood Boulevard, so I guess there’s that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafterc

Chintzy t-shirt shops, aggressive tour hawkers and costumed characters, just an assault on the senses, and barely a whiff of what one might expect with visions of Hollywood.

Don't lay on the stars, they aren't cleaned often, and someone puked on them last night stumbling out of a night club.2. The people with the purple shirts that say $5 Sale at the $10 store are there every single day. It's a scam. The prices have never once been $10, that is why they have shirts printed with sale on them, and why those shirts are faded from the sun.3. You don't have to tip the superheros. You should, it is how they make their living and LA is expensive, but they legally can't tell you what they charge or demand money from them. If you tell them that you know this they might back off. If they don't then threaten to report them. But only if they are being hostile... and honestly, you should tip them.4. Every bus tour is the same, but right near the end of the day you might catch a deal as they are trying to make a few bucks extra for the last tour of the day. In the morning though, forget about it.5. If you are looking for a specific star or celebrity, you can google it. Google will provide you with websites that tell you the exact address for Ringo Star, Betty White, and Brittany Spears.6. There are two people named Michael Jackson. One made music and then died. His star is near the Chinese Theater. The other Michael Jackson was a radio DJ in Ohio who got very old.. but last I checked is still alive. His star is on Vine and has a microphone on it. If you pose with this one grabbing your crotch, the locals will point and laugh at you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiasnerfherder
30,must see,"Its a must see, but its dirty, scary and busy. the hawkers try to give you CDs for free then once you take it ask you for money. the Chinese theater busy and so dirty. the stars unkept and uncared for. the shops are either junky or seedy.I am glad we went, but once is enough in this life, Scientology recruitment was very heavy handed and in your face. The stars go for so long you cant see them all.The impersonators pushy and overwhelming, i had a teen and she was very uncomfortable here. i think little kids would be scared. not my cup of tea but we can tick that off as been there done that.if you dont see it, dont worry",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesAsiaLots
40,Always a different experience! Many things to see! Many people trying to make a living!,"Okay when you think of Hollywood you think of all the good things you see on movies and television. What you don’t think of is all the people literally living on the stars. We always stay polite and respectful to everyone and anyone we meet. There are a lot of look alike Hollywood characters you can pay to get a picture with. Or pay to get your name put on a star. Plenty of stores for gifts and snacks. Of course plenty of places to eat. If you are lucky you can catch a red carpet event. It is a very big tourist destination for sure. Be aware of your surroundings and enjoy the atmosphere. There is no place like Hollywood in the world. It is truly a international vacation destination! After all if it wasn’t for all the visitors and people wanting to make it big there wouldn’t be anything to see. If you are driving, walking, or going to see a event Hollywood Boulevard is a place to see and be seen! It is a true awakening when you see so many people in one place at one time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
10,Filth and disappointment,Dirty place full of weird and homeless people. Do not even try to use public transport unless you want to see something you have not seen before. Competely different from what I expected it to be. Half a day to see the key attractions is the maximum time I recommend to spend there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam115Adam
20,Actually pretty disgusting,"So this is basically a sidewalk with these famous stars on the pavement which, when in hollywood, one should go see. But what Hollywood Boulevard really is: A street that smells of urine, has dubiouss shops on it, a lot of homless people. A litle further up, the smell is gone and replaced by people in spiderman costumes. All in all, it doesn't come near anything like Times Square, Nathan Road or any other famous avenues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling_Patrick
30,Stereotypical Tourist Street,"You will not doubt want to visit Hollywood Boulevard if you are in Los Angeles but there is nothing overly special about it. It's full of stereotypical tourist stuff and in some places isn't overly nice. Pop by for a few hours, but you don't need to spend a long time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
30,"Do it, so you can say you have","But in reality, its one of those things that isn't great, but you do feel obliged to go see when you're in LA.There is some fun in randomly finding stars of people you didn't expect, or that you are a fan of, but that's about it.And be prepared to be asked to go on tours.Lots and lots of times.And then even when you think you're done, you'll get asked again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b_long176

50,So glad we made time for this,"We were in CA on a pretty tight schedule and didn't have much extra time, but we took public transportation to Hollywood Blvd and I am so glad we did.

10,Hollywood I thought I walked into Detroit,"Very dirty to the point it smelled like urine everywhere. People sleeping all along the sidewalk, and if they are not sleeping they are begging for money. Harassed the entire time to buy cd's or bus trips. Parking was $30. All we saw was overpriced t-shirt shops. Not what we expected at all, DON'T WASTE A DAY going there are other things that are a lot more fun and cheaper!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlewis32
20,Hype - Not for me,Never enjoyed the hassle of an overcrowded sidewalk. All the fuss about celebrities is not my thing. A couple of decent restaurants in the mall help breakwaway from the chaos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianB6495
30,Know what you're getting into!,"First, for the uninitiated, Hollywood is NOT Beverly Hills. Don't expect glitz, glamour and ritzy stores and stars walking all over the place. Hollywood lost it's glam in the 40's and has not recovered since. Expect tourist traps and seedy stores. However, Hollywood DOES have the history. If you can accept the seedy side of it, it's a fun outing viewing the stars on the sidewalk and finding your favorites, averting your kids' eyes from some of Hollywood's more risque offerings. Also stop at the Chinese Theater to see the stars' foot and hand prints. Many famous movie and stage theaters are there, such as the Chinese, El Capitan, Dolby and the Pantages. Parking is easily found at the multiple parking lots on the side streets. Also a good jump off point for the multitudinous stars' homes tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814ianb
40,Welcome to Hollywood,"Busy street, lots os people looking at the floor, taking pictures. For sure the place that everyone wants to visit.

10,"Seedy, filthy and full of druggies.","I was totally disillusioned after my visit. We visited on a Sunday afternoon the boulevard had a certain aroma of weed and urine . Homeless people abounded. The streets were filthy, the inlaid stars on the pavement were cracked or dirty . The shops were tacky selling cheap tourist tat.There was an atmosphere of unease as beggars , CD merchants and people dressed in 3rd rate fancy dress with bad body odour tried to con you out of your dollars. A good survival tactic give no-one eye contact just walk purposely forward.A very intimidating atmosphere definately not glamorous . We saw druggies shooting up on the bvld . Why aren't the police out in force in this area?We walked to the Chinese Theatre and felt stoned with all the ""smoke"" around us. A seedy place even on a Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leedsFrancesca
10,Disgusting.,Definitely not what we expected. It was disgusting. I live near New Orleans and even Bourbon Street was more pleasant (and that doesn’t say much).So many people soliciting.

Not even worth going there just so you can say you did it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewM5533
30,Enjoyed The Walk of Stars,"Hollywood Boulevard is a bit grotty and tacky, truth be told, but we still really enjoyed the walk of stars, looking for some favourites and enjoying the razzmatazz of it all.It's kinda cool to be in Hollywood, the centre of the movie world, but a day or two is enough because it can all get a bit much.Still, you won't be bored on Hollywood Boulevard to be fair.

Plenty to see and do.The area is buzzing with many tourists visiting this popular tourist street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
30,Don't Expect Hollywood Glitz,"How could you come to LA and not visit Hollywood Boulevard? Though don't expect to come here and see all your favourite stars; except the one's on the boulevard itself.The area is generally made up of tourists, gift shops, tattooists, smoke shops, and porn theatres...the surrounding areas look a bit ghetto too. Though it is Hollywood and it's worth visiting the once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dude_76125
30,Still Active at 3AM,"We visited the iconic boulevard at 1AM and stayed for a couple hours on a Friday night watching local musicians and taking in the nightlife.

40,Crowded and Lots to see and do!,"This was my very first time to Hollywood Blvd and I had fun . It’s much easier to walk for a better view than to drive so that is what I did. I wanted to take pictures of the stars and find my favorite actors etc. I definitely didn’t come prepared with the water I needed In the hot LA sun and prices were not cheap. There were many different types of people everywhere, obviously tourist. Shops, restaurants , hotels , homeless people performing for money and so much to do. You can see the Hollywood sign from the strip near California Pizza kitchen.I recommend a walking or bus tour just to get familiar with the area and get some great views (pictures) Also there is a city pass you can purchase to get around the city. Overall I had a amazing time and would definitely come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciairas2016
40,The biggest street in Hollywood,"Hollywood Boulevard is the most famous street in LA and has many great tourist attractions, restaurants and shops. However, it is a bit dirty and there are lots of homeless people and scammers. People in costume are frequent and will charge you to take photos with them. Anybody handing you a free mixtape will then demand money and it will likely turn out to be a blank CD. I suggest you keep your head down/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6296NXryanm
40,WOW !!!! SOOOOooooo many people - Surrounded by an Aura of EXCITEMENT,"This attraction of Hollywood West is absolutely BUZZING. The amount of tourists, Buskers, Peddlers and so on is HUGE. We asked whether the pace ever died down - answer: around 3-4am you would be able to walk up and down quite freely without dodging hoards of people.Trying to read all the Hollywood Walk of Fame plaques proved to be difficult, but hey, first-time visitor to this city, just HAD to be able to say ""been there, done that"" - at least once, but would love to go back and allow for a LOT MORE time.Taking photos of the famous ""Hollywood Sign"" from this location proved to be quite challenging as well due to the massive crowds. Would suggest perhaps early morning might be a better option to stroll Hollywood Boulevard, before the tourist crowds descend.Nonetheless, still got some great pics of some of our favourite celebs hand / foot prints & personal messages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMCGM
30,Busy. Dirty. Diverse. Amusing,"Lots going on and much diverseness in a small area of the strip. Like most of LA, it smells and is dirty, but as long as you stay around people, felt rather safe. Had a lot of different food and beverage and lots of shopping options. Don't expect to be able to stop for a professional instagram shoot on the hollywood stars - way too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noes1987
20,Big disappointment,"We took a tour bus to California to visit several areas, including Hollywood Blvd.I was disappointed in how some of the street ""performers"" treated us. They were very pushy and demanding. Several of them pushed up against me trying to hand me CD's while others tried to pull me toward them for photos. When I declined, one of them called me welfare-trash coming to their state and not wanting to spend money. Indeed! I wasn't the one on the streets in a ratty Wookie costume begging for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamaralyn40
10,"2 hrs wait, front of gen/seating line, and they walked us past good seats to the very worst.","Don't count on getting best seat possible by where you are in line. We were the 3rd ones in the general ticket line. Didn't expect to get the front because of the people with priority tickets going in first, but we stood in line from 2:15 til 4 and when we got to the actual studio, they asked ""How Many?"" Then walked my daughter and I past seats that were open in the front row all the way to the side as well as others scattered about and we were put in the very very last possible worst 2 seats in the back next to the sound editor and 2 ushers who stood next to us or in front of us during the whole show. It would have been fine if those were the last available seats but they weren't. The people behind us were put in 2 seats four rows back from Jimmy. That was biggest complaint, the rest is basically because I have been to The Colbert show which set a standard Jimmy didn't even come close too. We stood in a long line there too, but we were walked in and ushered in, row by row. Where you were in line, determined how good of a seat you got, as it should in a general seating line. Also, Stephen Colbert came out before the show started and talked to the crowd for quite a while. He also explained things that were going to happen as the show went along. John and the band put on a great performance before Stephen came out and there was a warm up comedian before they played who was funny. Even after the show and Stephen runs out high five-ing people on his way out, he came back in and talked to us again and thanked us for coming. If you go to see Jimmy Kimmel expect to see what you see on TV and not much more. There is a warm up comic who was not funny, and he is just telling us to scream more than trying to say any sort of jokes, but who cares, you don't come to see him....Then all of a sudden they roll the credits on the tv monitors and Jimmy comes out. After a monologue, they went to commercial and Jimmy is talking to people on stage, similar to Colbert. They came back and he did another monologue and video clips/skit, then at the next commercial, he talked to the crowd for 3 to 5 minutes, well, just one couple in the front row really. After that, the guests would come out, they would have commercials the same way with celebrities and staff talking on stage, then each guest, when done, the comic would say, Say thanks to so and so! and we would clap and the would leave out the door. After the second guest left, we thought we would see the singer, but then they said, Say thanks to Jimmy! and off he ran out the doors just like the guests and that was that.No thanks for coming, or anything. Apparently, they had prerecorded the singer. The stage producer/director, I'm not sure who he was, had come out and talked to us in line before the show and said the guests that would be on the show. It included the singer who we never saw, and he even said Jimmy's cousin was going to be there to cause some mischief. He wasn't. If you can get free tickets and don't have to stand in line for hours, go for it, otherwise, don't wait in line. You see nothing that isn't on TV that night and it wasn't worth waiting that long for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurstravels

Alternative is to checks the sidewalk stars and walk diligently between Highland and Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad

All we seen were people off their heads on drugs shouting at us and following us a lot of drunk and drugged up people this was a major disappointment when you can see people clearly shooting up on the street slot of homeless also. I thought this would be one of the main attractions of the visit it was not all we could smell Was piss and weed come on Hollywood clean up this street do not go after dark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francist83
40,A place to go but not at night with kids,My drama geek son and I were giddy to see the theatres and walk of fame. So many sights and pictures taken! Once it got dark it was a bit skeevy for a woman and young teen. Glad we went and got to see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonj2015
50,Long walk,"This street goes for a while. Some attractions. The mall, jimmy kimmel studios, the hollywood stars names engraved on the streets. There's a lot of tourist attractions.

There is a lot of history here, we went to the Wax museum, the Chinese theatre, the Hollywood museum, and then we wanted to leave because it does not feel safe here, and make sure to hold your belonging tight to yourself because there are a lot of people trying to pick your pocket. This place was on my bucket list but was not my favorite part of the strip.

It stank! There were homeless people everywhere and rubbish. One of my friends accidentally bought a CD off a bloke from the street that she didn't want. The shops are all the same, aimed at tourists had a good selection of tacky holiday junk we all love. The McDonald's was disgusting and had a creepy man in the women's toilets - please avoid going there. The place needs an upgrade and a deep clean. Wish they would address the homelessness issue too - provide help for them. Car park was very handy right on the side of the Boulevard but wasn't cheap.

A bit of a dump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardN28
20,Tacky and unpleasant,"Really disappointed with Hollywood Boulevard. Parked at the Hollywood and Highland garage by the Dolby Theater which is a convenient spot. Hollywood Boulevard itself was really disappointing though.The sidewalk was full of people dressed up in awful costumes throwing themselves at you for pictures - and if it isn't them its people selling their tours, CDs or just straight up beggars not to mention its super crowded. Only real upside was the day I visited they had shut the road as they were doing a film shoot for the show Lethal Weapon so I got some good pictures without any cars in the road.Was cool to see some of the stars on the sidewalk, but that was about it. Too crowded and all there is on the street is huge tacky gift shops. Plenty of nicer places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olihenryy

Only the film industry and hollywood by itself makes this city interesting to explore -cinema studios, Beverlly hills and so on.

Take a walk along the stars and grab some photos and do not expect something else interesting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siomikas
20,Local Low Life Spoil this Attraction,"When visiting LA everyone heads to Hollywood Boulevard to see the stars in the sidewalk. Nobody tells you about the low life who are attracted to this area. Unfortunately it doesn't feel safe even in the middle of the day as police presence was minimal on my visit. It seems like it is the LA centre for tourist scams which is a pity. When you see a celebrity getting their star on TV you don't see the junkies, beggars and scammers. I wonder if they are paid off for the day?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaely416

The streets were covered in trash and people were literally following us asking for money. We were here mid-day-- I would never come in the evening. It seems very unsafe. I live in NYC-- and it is a million times cleaner. To be honest, the only thing I cared to see was MK and A Olsen's star and it was closed off for an awards show.

One of them said ‘you got to buy this , cuz you touched my cd’(they put there cds on people’s hand or cell phone, there s no way to not touching it). And another one goes ‘give me 20, give me 20 or i am gonna bit the xxxx out of you’ this cd seller group consisted of 4guys around 175cm tall.

10,The biggest disappointment of my travel history,"Went there at 8 PM. I was prepared maybe for a too touristy place, but I did not mind that, you know I am in LA, and I had to see this place, I was expecting glamour, you know the feeling you get when watching the Oscars...but man...this was not it. It was rough, no one in the street but homeless people, I looked at the stars on the pavement searching for a some actor name I like, but then I thought, what am I doing here. I took a taxi and left. Is 8 PM too late to visit that place? Or is always like that. Nothing to see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sami_m_1981
10,"Smells like urine, oh that is urine!!!!","Walking down the sidewalk with all the stars, whole place stinks of urine, homeless person just passed out in middle of sidewalk with a stream of fluid eminating from him, obviously peed himself. Place is filthy and loads of homeless/ drugged/ drunk people laid out often right in the middle of the pavement. I would say most of the stars would be turning in their graves to see the state these streets are in.Any new stars would probably resist have their star there to be peed on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emelian
30,Not the best experience,"Honestly wasn't impressed. Overcrowded, noisy and dirty. You could hardly get to the stars stars with the amount of people there. Some of the stars are cracked and as much as I dislike Donald Trump it was sad to see his star covered in rubbish. There is also lots of scammers trying to get money off you - literaslly got off the tour bus to have a man give me a ""free"" cd , wrote my name on it and then asked for a tip for it . I thought ok Ill give $5 to go away he looked in my wallet and said theres a $ 20 wrapped in a receipt ma'am...I kid you not! Also on the day of our visit weird Christian people screaming at everyone that we were all going to hell. Not the best and better things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996kirstief
50,A mecca for entertainment fans,"This famous boulevard is very historical. There are many old theaters on this street, as well as some good restaurants.

This was once the famous in the world for making of grand films, even now the US films are known as Hollywood films it is so important.

Price also reasonable.It is hot in the summer so be prepared for walk. Comfortable footwear and dress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aadhes
20,Disappointing,"As an introduction to Hollywood there must be better places to start. I get it celebrity stars laid in the pavement, important cinemas and theatres. However, this means crowded pavements as people stop and photograph stars, touts pushing tickets for tours, street acts and homeless people. The general impression is grubby. Endless souvenir shops (on the positive these shops have cracking air conditioning). However, if you've seen one you have seen them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotsWaaHay
20,Sad and disappointing.,"I have been to Hollywood once before, as a teen, and was excited to come again. My husband and I did one of those tour buses and hopped off early to walk back. We were absolutely horrified by the state of this famed place. Dirty and run down doesn't quite describe it. It feels like there is a solid coat of grime all over this place and could use a serious power washing. The most disheartening thing was the sheer number of homeless sleeping or wandering the streets, either heavily under the influence, severely and persistently mentally ill, or both. People without shoes, dirty and tattered. I am well aware you cannot help those who refuse the services, but it seems like in a land of such wealth and excess, more should be done to address the area's overwhelming vulnerable population. So many times my husband and I felt incredibly uneasy and really saddened at the state of the world there. My recommendation would be to stay near the Dolby Theater and Hollywood & Highland, where you can still see the walk of fame and some interesting street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherF712
10,Dump,"Disappointed it was so dirty not what I expected all horrible scruffy shops .. not impressed at all, will not be going again, considering so much wealth there, should be lovely needs cleaning up!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303angiej
40,Vibrant place,"It's a vibrant place buzzing with both tourist and locals. There are lots of bars offering seats overlooking streets for bird watching.There are many live performances on streets which are entertaining and so are characters. The place also has many famous Theatres.Spend few hours in the area, Must see attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anand1351
30,Not very clean.,"Very disappointing for a person from overseas with expectations. The stars in the footpath are cracked and dirty. Numerous shops shut and boarded up. Lots of fast food places and bars. Expect homeless to be sleeping on the footpath. While I acknowledge there is a lot of history to be seen, especially if you are a film buff, this is not a good advertisement for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyandBillG
50,Buzzing and Alive,"We took some of the other reviewer advice and visited at night. It was energy filled and quite the spectacle to take in. So do visit and do it at night.We parked in the mall right there. Inexpensive and well located. Spent a couple hours walking, watching and taking pics. Glad we did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhoom13
10,Really horrible,"I visited Hollywood expecting some tinsel town magic, all I got on Hollywood Hollywood Boulevard was a horrible smell of urine everywhere and lots of poor homeless and acutely mentally ill people everwhere.Shame on the city countcil for not wasking the streets here given the amount of tourists that visit to see the Stars names on the pavement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ncwguy
50,Just Fun for Crazy Photos,This is the second time we've Traveled here.Just fun to people watch and walk around. Many Photo opportunities. You can even see the Hollywood Sign from here.There are a few street performers. Few are good some are pesty. You will see people handing out CDs.. they want a small donation... trying to make a buck on their music. If you're not interested... keep walking.I like to see the sites... there are various places to purchase cheap souvenirs...Just Go and enjoy...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fizzyfil
30,Not a great use of limited time,"If you really feel you need to check this place off you list of places to see then do it at night, find a parking garage a block or two off the strip for about $8 and make a quick trip up and down a couple of blocks around the Chinese Theater. You can be in and out of there in an hour and on to much better things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyg521
30,underwhelmed!!,"Well, this place is a huge let down! The stars are set in the pavement in a very average part of town which was not what we expected. It's dirty and crowded and after about ten minutes you will want to leave! The street vendors are a bit overwhelming and one even stuck a live snake in my partners face which freaked her out! Hollywood is not a very nice place does not compare with Beverly Hills which was the exact opposite to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonH689
20,Girls go to Cali!,"This was my first trip ever to California. It was cool to see the hand prints and footprints of some very one and new actors and actresses. The walk of fame stars was fun to looks at. I caught myself just looking down and times. But as for Hollywood Blvd itself.....Dirty, nasty, RUDE people (the people trying to peddle there CD's) I was totally caught off guard by some of the comments when you did not BUY the CD. This is one of my Been There Done That. Probably would not go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cwillis01
50,"Short Stop in Hollywood, Not enough time!","Some love it, some hate it; We Love it! Based in LA this time, (discussed in another review) whilst on a coach tour so drove us around most of Hollywood on the coach and then dropped us off to do our own thing. We actually stayed here in Hollywood two years ago, and really got on with the place; Why?, because there’s lots to see and do. Sadly, we were only here for a couple of hours, but having been before we knew where we were going. The Chinese Theatre, the Stars Handprints in Cement, Lowes Hotel Shopping Complex and of course the lovely walk along Hollywood Boulevard looking at the Stars names on the pavement. (That’s ‘sidewalk’ to our American friends) Absolutely Great, we just love the place! All of the above is fully accessible to all, both disabled and able bodied, both old and young, as it is flat and spacious. All shops etc, within this area are also accessible for the same reasons. If you choose to drive here in a car, parking is available nearby, but have no idea of charges as we’ve never driven here. Two hours is not long enough to see everything on offer; in fact, if you had much longer, as we did two years ago, then you could take in the latest movie showing at the Chinese Theatre, which is quite voluptuous inside, with really nice seating and the Imax Screen is something to behold. Well, that’s it for this visit, have to catch the Bus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanJay
30,Crowded and very Touristy,"Walking down Hollywood Blvd reminded me of walking around Times Square. It's crowded and slow with lots of touristy things to do. There is a lot to do up and down the block, but I would probably recommend going earlier in the day before most of the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinedm23

40,Day in LA,"Hollywood Boulevard is over rated. The Chinese Theater is its BEST real attraction, which was our very first stop after arriving into Hollywood. The Stars on the street were smaller than I'd imagined and were EVERYWHERE. Lucked out and saw Mickey Mouse's and Michael Jackson's Star, which I thought to be kinda ironic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194jameso
10,Ruined by those rude beggars.,"This is the worst experience we had in USA. This is like a broken Hollywood dream. The ""up-coming"" rap star enforced me to take his CD. I ignored him and he just kept yelling at me: where u from? Bro, i'm asking you! Chill bro! Relax bro! I suggest all of you just skip this ""attraction"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bossplayaz
40,Very Busy Area,"We stayed just off Hollywood Boulevard for 4 nights. It is a very busy area day and night, but really comes alive in the evening. You name it, its there on the strip. I felt a little unsafe in the evenings, you just need to be aware. I found the strip to be a bit on the shabby side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ac992

30,Driving down Hollywood Boulevard,"It was fun to see but it is definitely overrated! The street is quite scruffy and certainly doesn't ooze star appeal however to drive down, stop for an hour and have a look is well worth it. A top tip from our motel, drive to the Highland and Hollywood shopping mall on the boulevard and park in their underground car park. Parking is $2 for 2 hours as long as you get your ticket validated at a shop, we bought a Coke and that was enough. Go into the mall and if you go to the second floor there is a viewing platform to see the Hollywood sign. A must!! It was fun, glad I did it.Don't expect to see real stars on the Boulevard, you get to see dodgy people dressed as Super Heroes selling CD's, I avoided them and have since learned they are after money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360AliT
20,"Tacky, tacky and more tacky","It's amazing to see the tawdry sidewalks of Hollywood so crowded with tourists when the ""attractions"" are so poor -- silly shops, uninteresting displays, desperately unemployed actors in costumes hoping to be photographed for bucks. The real magnet of Los Angeles isn't here! Go to the Griffith Observatory! Hike up to an overlook of the Hollywood sign! Visit the beach in Santa Monica. Skip the crowded streets of Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
40,Amazing but scary,"The walk of fame with all the stars runs 25 blocks (about 2,600 stars) so you have to be dedicated. Graumann's Chinese theatre, the Egyptian theatre, Capitol records etc etc afe along the Boulevard. It's absolutely fascinating and amazing. The scary part is the number of hawkers along the street, who try and blag you into getting a photo with them in their Spiderman/Wonder woman etc costume or dancing to their music/buying their CDs etc and just won't take no for an answer. They get nasty if you won't give them money for taking that picture. I ened up giving one very threatening man $10 for a CD I didn't want just to get rid of him and out of the place alive. Brrrrr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360emmas
50,A Stroll Down Hollywood Boulevard,"A Stroll Down Hollywood Boulevard always rekindles an appreciation for the hundreds of stars memorialized there who have used their unique talents to entertain us through various media.Memories came flooding back as I toured the Chinese Theater, Walk of Fame, Hollywood & Vine. Best to go early before the crowd swells.Don't forget Sunset Boulevard. Last trip I stayed @ the Andaz (loved everything about it!), which is surrounded by attractions within walking distance or a $5 Uber ride.Be sure to visit other attractions & areas in West Hollywood.••••••••••I took awesome photos of the *Stars* while walking on the sidewalk & of the buildings & signs while Ubering slowly ~ but a glitch in TA's App would not allow me to Choose them. Sorry.••••••••••",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanEvan
50,A must be,"It's just impossible not to pass here. Even if you don't like cinema (like me!) this boulevard is amazing!The walk of fame, but also the characters in the street (be careful, they ask for tips for photos), the theatres create here a specific atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davric73
40,Interesting,Its an interesting place to walk around. There are many places to walk into and buy souvenirs or book appointments for city tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahsD5005MH
50,Many things at stake,Hollywood Boulevard did a nice movie brainstorm in my mind; there are people with costumes on the streets and both sidewalks are filled with famous older and newer stars. I always wanted to go there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squirrel796
10,Horrible in every sense of the word,"Did this to 'tick it off the list' but it was an incredibly disappointing experience. Tacky, dirty and boring. I think 20 minutes is more than enough time to get a measure of the strip and then perhaps another 30 mins tops for browsing the shopping centre. There are plenty of places to get something to eat and drink in the mall.If you had to cull something from a busy itinerary, this would be a choice candidate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsHC7
10,"Hollywood boulevard: smell of piss, puke and canabis","This a place that comes close my nr 1 place of no go areas. Hollywood bld is dirty, overcrowded and filled with cheap souvenirshops and fast food outlets. This is the exact opposite of Beverly Hills, which is only 10 min from here. Plenty of homeless people, people trying to sell a star watching tour every 50 yrds, combined with the smell of piss, puke and canabis. I was close to vomiting myself because of this (not an exaggeration). If you want to spent your time and money on the good things in life, don't go here. This is probebly the closest thing to hell on earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RU135
20,Hated everything about it except...,....hard rock cafe. The strip is dirty and full of superheros trying to take your money for pictures. I hated it and would never return. The hard rock was a great escape from the disappointing strip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubsn
30,"Crowded, wild people watching, but you have to at least check it out.","We stayed right off Hollywood Blvd so we went out at all times of the day and night. It gets very crowded, but that's to be expected since it's such a concentrated area with many attractions. The walk of fame is definitely something you have to check out while you're there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1594VQcc
20,still a dump,"I was at this street 3 times. 2000, 2008, and a week ago (2017). Nothing changed, still a dump, crowded with tourists, beggars, impersonators want to take pictures with you for money. The city takes so much money from tourists and pockets them all. No idea how they cleanup on Oscar night. I guess they probably kick those people temporary off the street, put some red carpets on to cover all the filth, garbage, junks, etc. What a shame for such a famous street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayneNDH
30,Crowded and Dirty,"We couldn't understand how all of the stars come here during the award shows because how dirty the area was. The stores, restaruants, bars, theaters were great in a three or four block area, but we wish it was cleaner. Great place for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJWallyrock
30,Love & hate,"It's one of those ""attractions"" that you will love because you have to see it as it's famous, but you'll hate for the fact that it's too busy and too touristic. What does it mean? Go early and take no too much time to see it. After 11 am it just gets very busy in peak season and too many tourists and people trying to benefit from the tourists. Note: parking is very expensive, but you have not choice. Between US$ 15 and US$ 20 per time (usually for about 3 hours or so)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasEMM

20,Bring Sanitizer!,"I use to love coming down here as a teenager, but it has gotten so bad. The city makes plenty of money you think they would take better care of the stars. It's just sad to think this is what tourists think of Hollywood. The architecture is beautiful but yet deteriorating due to lack of care. Word to the wise walk it but don't let your kids be barefoot or if they fall wipe them with a wipe or better yet sanitizer. Do not let your teenagers walk alone, its pervert capital.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940cynthiaj
40,Walk. Don't Drive!!,"There's so much to see here, but you'll have to deal with massive crowds to do so. You can certainly drive down the Boulevard, but you'll be going just as fast--if not slightly slower--than the thousands of pedestrians on either side. You may as well walk for the full experience.There are plenty of souvenir shops and such along the way, but I enjoyed getting a glimpse of the Roosevelt, Chinese Theatre and, of course, those famed stars!In all, it's a must-do if only to say you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernMama2
30,Walk don't drive,Just like NYC this is definitely a walking adventure. I suggest driving through to check out and scope your adventure. Then find a place to park and back track until its time for lunch or dinner. Cross over and return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerhardlangguth23
40,Good day of shopping,My wife loves to swing by here whenever we are in the area. There are a lot of little shops that sell a variety of things from souvenirs to clothes. Of course the star walkway is fun to look at and find celebrities that I know and my kids know. There are plenty of places to eat and the few restaurants we tried were good and worth the price. My wife always finds unique shoes and jewelry here that we have trouble finding back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joserR4746XD
50,Jimmy Kimmel Live.,"My daughter and I attended a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live, at the El Capitan Theatre, On June 7th. We got in line around 2:20pm. I believe the line started heading in at 3pm. After getting inside, you watch some videos. Then you are let inside the theatre, where they guide you to your seats. There is plenty of instruction on what is going to happen before, during, and after the taping. The main celebrity for the show was Michael Keaton. Very cool! What a very nice guy. Jimmy Kimmel was great! What a funny guy. The entire process for watching the show was a lot of fun for us and very interesting. I would absolutely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia

30,Just OK,"We stopped because I had never seen the Hollywood stuff on my previous trips to LA. Because of a late flight we didn't have as much time here and short of being able to take a tour that was fine. It was interesting to see once, but there are a lot of people hawking stuff and many gift shops. Glad we saw it but not in any hurry to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportsinfoguy
40,"Skanky, but a must see","It would be a shame to visit LA and not go to the Hollywood Boulevard. Yes, it's crowded with other tourists and you get constantly bothered by touts, hustlers and other dodgy characters. But you see the Walk of Fame and the handprints in the Chinese Theatre. Park in Hollywood and Highland - only $2 for 2 hours with a validated ticket. Don't go at night though and keep a tight grip on any children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
40,"Crowded , tacky yes , but still worth a look !","We were staying within 10 minutes of HB (far enough away from it that there was no noise or riff-raff around) and ventured down that way twice. Walk of fame , street ""performers"", photo opportunities with movie characters , souvenir shopping. All good fun.It is true that at times the streets get packed with people and those soliciting $$$ for a photo can be annoying but as others have said , if you expect it , you will be oblivious to it and can just roll with it.We had 2 young kids in tow but only did the walk late afternoon and NOT in the evening. Kids loved it. But I couldn't comment on whether it is a suitable thing to do in the evening with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoosterJo

30,Always bustling,"Everyone comes here to see the Walk of Fame and it has become an incredibly busy tourist attraction. Walking down the block requires a lot of maneuvering around crowds. There are a lot of people dressed as famous characters who take photos for tips, but beware as some of them can get quite aggressive, especially when they pop into your photos uninvited. Parking around the area is also very costly (ridiculously so!). Not an attraction I would visit often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621fs
30,Hollywood Boulevard – See Your Favorite Star’s Star.,"Hollywood Boulevard is where you will find the Hollywood Walk of Fame which consists of more than 2,600 stars embedded in the sidewalk six feet apart. You can find the stars on both sides of street covering 15 blocks on Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks on Vine Street. The purpose of the stars is to commemorate achievement in the entertainment industry to include well known actors, producers, directors, musician, fictional characters such as Donald Duck and musical and theatrical groups. There are five different types of brass symbols that you will see to include: motion picture camera, television set, phonograph record, radio microphone and twine theatrical masks for comedy and live stage performers. Movie Stars such as Gene Autry have more than one star for the different types of genre that he performed in. Before you go you may want to search on the internet for the location of your favorite Star’s Star. You will also see a bunch of other characters out there who are trying to get you to spend your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swabado

I was pleased we got this attraction in before any tourists arrived for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mabelenep2017
50,Boulevard of Creativity and Loads of People,"Walking down the walk of fame is quite the experience, especially on the weekends.There are so many people performing near Hollywood/Highland, the businesses are really sightly, and the stars are home to individual statements.What I thought was really nice was that a tribute to Chris Cornel was left on his star by a fan just after his tragic passing. Things like this are what makes Hollywood Blvd a pleasant little walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazy_Belle
40,Take the Walk of Fame..,"Seriously, love it or loathe it, would anyone come to LA and not check out the iconic Hollywood Boulevard?I enjoyed it and the crowds, CD peddlars and superheroes offering photos along the main drag didn't bother me. It's all part of the experience and easy to ignore given you have so much else to stimulate you especially if you love the movies. So yes, there is an element of tackiness but just go with it.I caught the Metro Red line to Hollywood/Highland from Union Station ($only $25 for 7 day unlimited) but you could also get off one stop earlier at Hollywood/Vine which is also right in the middle of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. All within a few hundred metres of Highland Station is the Dolby Theatre (where the Oscars is held) the famous Chinese Theatre where celebrities from the Golden Age of Hollywood have left their hand prints and messages with us forever, Hollywood Museum, Madame Tussaud's, and of course, the iconic and ever growing Hollywood Walk of Fame. There are plenty of food options nearby as well.This is easily worth a half day of your time if not longer (why not walk down two blocks to Sunset Blvd to check that out as well?). I'd also recommend a trip to West Hollywood as it is very different to Hollywood Boulevard and will give you a better overall feel for the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7

We went with our family on a long road trip (ages 6 to 60-something) and all enjoyed ourselves.In just the short time we spent there, we were able to experience crazy people watching, tons of lights at dusk, amazing performers in costume, souvenir shopping, and lots more. We would recommend a stop here!!!!Parking sucks, so plan ahead.After that, enjoy your time here and be respectful of the people out working in costumes! A dollar or two gets you lot of great photos with these creative people. It's worth it! They really get into their roles!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawni_and_Buck

10,Come on Hollywood - clean up this dump!,"We were so looking forward to visiting this iconic location and had explained to our children all about the walk of fame. We were all excited.We stopped by Hollywood Boulevard after a day at Universal Studies so it was about 3.30pm when we arrived.We saw a sign for parking so drove into a rough surface car park where the guy asked us for $25. This was their only rate. So we paid.As soon as we got out of the car we felt uncomfortable. We walked the short distance to Hollywood Boulevard and stopped. There were people yelling at us to take a celebrity home tour, homeless people sitting on the pavements in groups openly smoking pot, transvestites strutting up and down, people shoving their goods at you - usually cd's - and if you took hold of them they demanded payment and finally the poorest excuse for batman etc characters you have ever seen aggressively requesting a picture with them and then charging you for it.Horrible vibe and to top it all the walk of fame was filthy dirty and many were cracked.We dived into the Madame Tussaud's museum which was great and a super reprieve from the dump outside.We spent no more than an hour there - I can't imagine anyone wanting to spend any longer!Total disappointment.So come on Hollywood Authorities- clean up this attraction or lose your tourist revenue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nosidawn

30,Not my thing,"We spent half a day here as we were traveling with a big group of dancers & this was one of our half-day excursions. It wasn't my cup of tea but it was still good to see such an iconic attraction. It's a fairly touristy area with lots of people trying to sell you tours, charge you for photos & tacky souvenir shops galore. The shopping was pretty good & we enjoyed seeing the stars on the walk of fame. Overall its ok for a few hours but I wouldn't bother going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
30,When has Spider-Man ever not laundered his outfit!!!,"When he is walking up Hollywood Boulevard is when! You have to go here when in LA but walking the short distance to cover the stars is not as awesome as it should be. The people dressing up as stars like spidey and cat woman are a joke. One guys costume was so faded it wasn't red and blue anymore, but more a grey colour. it is fun in that it has a lot of eccentric folk working the street but we couldn't help feel like we needed to be careful about being ripped off or puck pocketed so be warned",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint
20,Hollywood stopover,"I suppose you have to do Hollywood on an Los Angeles stopover but frankly I wouldn't bother. This was probably the most underwhelming part of our entire trip, a little shabby and quite frankly we could have been anywhere. Sorry, in our opinion spend your money somewhere like San Fran, LA not worth it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markbD2344OI
10,Filthy & Rundown,"The street is filthy, worn and tired.On top of this, you are bombarded every 5 yards (no exaggeration) by someone begging you for money, whether a tour operator, an ""up and coming rapper"", or a homeless guy.Get your photos and leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBeverleyBunch
30,Times Square West - Visit but don't plan on staying long,"Hollywood Boulevard is pretty much Times Square West. If you have been to Times Square, you will recall the many sketchy folks walking about in dingy character costumes enticing you to take photos with them in exchange for money. You will also recall the many people attempting to hawk some type of tour, DVD or CD. Well, all of that is found on Hollywood Boulevard as well. In addition, there are a fair number of street beggars hanging about.Is it worth a visit? Probably, if for nothing else than to see a few of the stars embedded in the side walk and to see the Chinese theatre. Should you plan on staying very long? No. Go for about an hour and you will see everything necessary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonBr2014
10,not worth it,"Disgusting to say the least.... The Hollywood past must be rolling in their graves, Except for the old cement memories outside Groman;s, nothing to see.

20,Road works everywhere and not much to look at,"Not what you expect at all. The top end of this road was crummy run down area, and near the bottom where I guess all the pictures are taken was blocked off by road works.

50,"Fun, Wild Sights and A Feel Of Old Hollywood","Start at Hollywood and Highland and walk a square mile. Along the way you will be on the Walk of Fame, its pure fun to walk on stars that have been in the ground for 60 years. Plenty of shopping and lots of food choices. Star look a-likes, its photograph and a selfie bonanza",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
20,Disappointed!,"I was so looking forward to travel to LA to explore this beautiful cities that you see in the movies (I thought). This avenue is one of the first things you think abou visiting when going to Los Angeles; you think about movie stars, fame, the oscars... is nothing like that. First, it's far from the centre and we had trouble finding it . (ahaha). it's also too crowded, which is to be expected I guess, and just much longer than I thought. which ends up being boring. I wast dissapointed in general with the whole city. :((check my instagram for my travel photos! :) IG anamafalda8 )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamafalda8
20,Disgusting,The smell of urine and marijuana fills the air and there are people living on the curbs. It's very sad actually. Very filthy everywhere. I left the trip feeling gross.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyC2104
30,funny enough,You get to see a lot of people dressed up as all kinds of characters. It's way too crowded and not the cleanest area but it has a certain character. Some street performers stage acts here and there. We didn't get a lot of CD offerings and nobody tried to take photos with us which was good.Quite honestly almost all the Supermans and Spiredmans we saw didn't look anything like the real thing. There's a Spiderman in Toronto that's way more interesting. We even witnessed a police chase which really made it feel like Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
10,Worst experience of our trip.,"In LA for spring break with teenagers- Hollywood blvd was, of course, a stop on our trip to California. The stars were fun to see, but the costumed vagrants were obnoxious and abusive. As my 15 year old son walked down the street wearing a lakers jersey, a costumed man (one of many) yelled at him to take a photo (which of course costs money). When my son smiled and continued walking, he was screamed at and accused of being a racist!LA- get control over this area. We refused to spend a dime there after that. What a waste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneBennet
40,Hollywood!,"On this street you can find everything, those who offer tours of the city, luxury cars, souvenir shops, restaurants, bars, the Chinese theater (with footprints in cement of celebrities), the Dolby theater, endless stars on sidewalks, countless homeless and costumed superheroes, and if you're lucky even a few Hollywood stars in the flesh. One thing is certain, you must visit Hollywood Boulevard when you are in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
20,See once and move on,"Every time I go near this area I can't get over how dirty and more unsafe it is. It's one of those most dos in LA, but it's not the real Hollywood. It's extremely crowned and there are a lot of homeless and people trying to rip you off around. Also every second person seems to be dressed in a costume and trying to get you to exchange your cash for a photo.Keep your handbag near you at All times. This is not a safe area and as the evening comes it becomes less safe.If your in a car it's probably only worth a drive by unless you are going to one of the Attractions nearby. If you do want to look at the walk of stars this is the best place and other parts of the blvd are even less safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
50,Larger-than-life Hollywood Blvd - must do,"Awesome Hollywood Blvd, as tourists to LA gravitate here. Celebrities of Hollywood's Walk of Fame where stars' hand & foot prints are done in the pavement; so many stars to chase up and reminisce. Dolby Theatre (used to be Kodak Theatre), TCL Graumans Chinese Theatre, El Capitan theatre. Hollywood & Highland Centre mall, fabulous plaza (view the Hollywood sign on a clear day, to the far distant hills), too many sights to mention; no time to do them all. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace.Not to mention lookalike-celebrity impersonators everywhere, lining the road hawking the photo opportunities for tourists. Despite the tourist traps, it is a fun place, upbeat and cool for a short period. And shopping opportunities like Zara, Sephora, bars, restaurants, photo opportunities everywhere.A must to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquitohc
40,Crowded,"Hollywood Blvd is a destination that you have to experience, (been there done that). Be careful, as you start walking along the Blvd to get to the chinese theatre. It's very crowded and you will be approached by many people. Firstly by the ""C.D givers"" who shove C.D's at you and then expecting you to give them cash donations, and Secondly by the ""Dressed up Characters"". They will approach you and ask to take a photo with you, others wil just grab you or jump into your photo shot and then expect you to pay them for the photo. Don't get me wrong, it's a place you must see, but be wary. Don't take the C.D's or be firm and politely say NO THANKS. Other than that, It is an O.M.G experience especially when you see the stars on the sidewalk and the foot prints at the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon

30,This is an L A scene;,"probably everything you have heard about it is true. the street is loaded with people; visitors, a few locals, and lots of people in costumes trying to get you to pay to have your picture taken with them. If you like looking at the stars to see your favorites, go. The Chinese theater is sool with all the hand and footprints. Lots of retail, tourist junk and good places too, especially at Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
30,Not Family Friendly,"I see that the city is trying to keep this famous tourist street going by putting in large malls, movie theaters, and parking (at the mall), but for the most part, both sides of the streets are dirty, crowded with local people trying to sell you tours, invite you to their adult bars, or get you to take a photo of them dressed in costumes. Think Vegas Strip without the Casinos and hotels. We've been here many times now and it does not seem to improve. Certain areas, they keep the solicitors out of the way so you can actually experience it like around the Chinese Theater. We've just run into too many solicitors that will hand out things (like little balloons to our kids) and then chase us to pay for them after. The only thing worth seeing is the handprints at the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnYourMarkTravel

30,Not how it looks on TV,"I wasn't disappointed with Hollywood Boulevard as it was how it was told it would be, but the hype with all the TV coverage and the Oscars makes it out to be something that its not.We went the day after the Oscars for 3 days of sight seeing, and god it was bad. Dirty, plagued with people hassling you to take there CD of the new big artist, the shocking costume characters who should be sued by each of the intellectual property companies they belong to.ButYou have to do it. You can't come all this way and not see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankersandrew

30,Meh,"It was ok. Nothing really stood out or was that special. The Walk of Fame is alright, as is seeing all the handprints at Mang's Chinese Theatre. However, be aware that people will give you a 'complimentary' copy of their CD, however, they would appreciate if you gave them a tip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/156maddied
30,Don't walk around at night,"This is ok. It is a bit run down. Some parts are really good eg. The star walk of fame, but some parts are dodgy and I wouldnt go out there at night. Good to see just to tick off your list, but I wouldnt stay too long",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
40,Gotta visit,"This is my second visit to this area. Although we did not do much, walking around just seem to be enough. There are lots of people around all the time which is interesting to observe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taarhaug
20,Homeless people & graffiti,"I was so looking forward to walking the area but I mostly kept my head down or focused on the distance. There are so many homeless people, graffiti, drugs, etc. that it was uncomfortable that I was just pushing through quickly so I could be done. I wasn't even enjoying the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redhead_roaming
20,From Glitz to Grim,"This area is known around the world as the epicenter of the entertainment industry. T.V, movies, music, award shows, talk shows. Hollywood has long been source of the pilgrimage to success in entertainment. The walk of fame, the historic theatres, the production companies, shops, and restaurants combine to make Hollywood a Hub for those hungry for a taste of the industry to this today.Unfortunately, the glamour of the mid 20th Century has seemingly become all but a shadow of its former glory. The streets of Hollywood Boulevard are now riddled with homeless, drug addicts, drug dealers, punk kids, and prostitutes. Peddlers abound trying to sell you their souvenir junk. People in costumes of notable Hollywood figures are glad to pose with you, but will be not-so-friendly when you don't tip them. Wannabe rappers hand out their mix tapes like candy for ""free"", yet snatch it back out of your hand when you don't ""donate"".The streets smell of urine, and litter obscures the start lined promenade. The area is noticeably dingy and grim. I would not recommended taking my family here at night, if at all. Of all the places to see in Los Angeles (and there are innumerable wonderful places to see), Hollywood is definitely one to pass on. Unless you like the smell of urine in your nostrils, the crunch of old newspaper, used napkins, and dirty foil wrappers under your feet, the pull of your loved one on your arm in fear of the local scene, definitely do not visit Hollywood.The boulevard might be acceptable for viewing the walk of fame, maybe the Chinese theatre, and a couple pictures. This can be accomplished in an hour. After that, move right along to greener, less urine-soaked areas of L.A., like Santa Monica, Malibu, Venice, and Redondo/Hermosa Beach. Or drive south to the sea side communities of Huntington and Newport Beach.Pass on Hollywood Boulevard and thank me later. You're not missing much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayzoobs
30,"Okay if you want to see buildings, lights and people","Around Hollywood & Highland intersection is the busiest with street performers, museums, souvenir shops, etc. Lots of displays and tourist traps. Watch out for scammers including costumed people squeezing into your photos or handlers dropping animals on you and then demanding money (you're not obligated to give them anything, feel free to walk away). If you just want to see Walk of Fame Stars without fighting crowds, head to Hollywood & Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geeeena

20,A very disapointing and somewhat dated street,"When in Hollywood, after taking a selfie with the Hollywood sign in the background what else should you do? Well take my advice and forget Hollywood Boulevard! Having carefully negotiated our way from Lake Hollywood Park down to street level and searched for a convenient place to park for a short while we were confronted by a very run down, dated and somewhat seedy looking Boulevard. So much so that we didn't even venture out of the car. It was not at all the glitzy and glam Hollywood that I had expected. As they say you win some and you lose some and this was most definitely a loser/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiskers51

30,A must do to tick of the LA list.,"Its the sort of thing you have to do at least once. Great to walk down the strip, stop at the chinese theatre. My faves are to stop at Hooters for some chicken wings, and a choc sunday at the Disney café. Take a token few pics of stars, and hands in stars handprints.... worth the cheesy walk down. Good view of the Hollywood sign... a trick is to take a photo through the binoculars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventuresofRach

50,Where Hollywood comes alive in absolute!,"Hollywood boulevard is a long stretch of entertainment filled mordern road. When you go there remember the boulevard is long walk of a couple of kilometres. So where your walking shoes. Carry enough cash with you as eateries deal in cash mostly. You will find global cuisine on this stretch. There are loads of dollar shops and souviegners shops around for you to shop from. Remember go there at lunch take a bus ride which you will easily get through tickets selling vendors roaming around. Take the bus ride to Beverley hills it's a 2 hours drive. Where they show you residents and sprawling dens of Hollywood's who's who. Carry water for the trip. After you return it would be much cooler than the afternoon heat. It will be an apt time to take the walk on the boulevard. Definitely stop by the Chinese theatre, Oscars hall, Hall of fame is on the street so you need go searching for it, chill at one of the famous clubs. Preferably take a prepaid cab. Or you will have to walk back to the parking after the grinding day. Carry your scarf, water, camera, map with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swethas206

40,"A journey through povery, pot, and glitz - following the ""stars"" in the sidewalk","Walked 10 blocks of the hollywood ""walk of fame"" (should be walk of shame) - which began at all the porno - drag stores and ended at the Chinese theater. You get the real California exposure here: From homeless beggars lying in the street urinating in public, potheads trying to sell you a few buds, black ""rap artists"" handing you their CDs for ""free"" then taking them back when you don't give them a donation, costumed characters happy to pose with you for a ""tip"". We were searching for a costume for a model that my daughter was outfitting for a show and we did find some cheap rhinestone shoes. If you are searching for Adult toys or risque women's wear - there are dozens of places to give you what you need. The highlight is at the end of the walk at the Chinese theater where you will see handprints from the greats including Shirley Temple, Bing Crosby, Marylyn Monroe, and even Harrison Ford. Its woth goin there to see that. We did not go in. There are tours you can pay for and tons of tour guides to give them to you. Jimmy Kimmel's show is also across the street. I would highly recommend daytime only for a family of small children as the area is not policed well - in fact I did not see even one cop in 10 blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jqgoode

30,Not that great.,"I have mixed feelings about this place. It was amazing because we were actually there to look at the Hollywood walk of fame. But apart from that. The area seemed dull. There was a lot of homeless people. The people who were dressed up as characters were great but they wanted a tip when you took a photo with them. This got very annoying because I have 2 kids and they kept trying to persuade the, over to them so they could get a photo! The shops inside here were expensive. But the building itself was detailed and sparked a lot of attraction with it's massive elephant statues and bright lights. We ended up staying here for a while but comparing it to the other attractions that we've been to. It isn't that brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf

30,Worth a visit but a little grim,"Walking along Hollywood Blvd is definitely a must do but it is not really very attractive, a little grotty and of course full of tourists.

Of course the stars on the floor are very well know but Hollywood Boulevard is more than that, this is also the home of the Dolby Theater, of the Chinese Theater or the Roosevelt Hotel.

I booked online and immediately I saw the debit on my credit card transactions. I never received a confirmation or eticket. I tried to call best tours.com but you will only listen to recorded information. They ask you to chat online but that is only available wed-sat. You can also email them in which you will immediately receive an automatic acknowledgement but never a response (I sent 6). Finally I was able to chat with a rep and get it resolved. Next week is the tour. A little worried because I see on Yelp that we will be lucky to have the tour guide show up. But, fair is fair.

30,In this boulevard of pretentious dreams...,"Hollywood. Home to the films, the glitz and glamor. Visiting this place once is a must for ardent movie-goers who are fascinated by the characters.

The place is filled with stores and shopping malls mostly selling souvenirs. Plenty of restaurants making the best use of the opportunity to get some customers. And other attractions & studios spread around.Suggestions - The boulevard does house some known attractions to see, like the Walk-of-fame, Madame Tussauds, Ripley's Museum, the wax museum, lot's of famous theaters. If you (may) cover all those, go for the drive to the Hollywood sign, or even trek to there on a good, sunny day.Careful - There are lots of characters dressed as your favorite stars looming around the area who hustle you for a pic in exchange for the green papers. There will also be agents who try to get you one a ride around the place to show movie star houses and other things nearby (that ain't gonna get me sold). This place gets super, super crowded. Both the roads with traffic and the sidewalk with people. Keep an eye on your belongings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scI-ROCKco

You wonder after how you came out alive! My friend had a photo shopped picture 'taken' with his look alike celebrity (Gene Hackman) and this was fun, and only $20. There is a nice restaurant and bar called Trastevere if you want to have a break from the hustle.

If you take one, they will harass you for a ""donation"" and even follow you down the street. There was a movie premier going on so you could barely see Grauman's Theater and the sidewalk was blocked off so you couldn't see the celebrity handprints. The stars on the sidewalk were neat but they were difficult to see as you had to constantly be aware of all of the people you were bumping into.

One can see the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood and Highland Mall.On this trip, we went and they were doing a movie premier so the road was blocked off from traffic and they were setting up for the event. Limos were circling in the area.Its a place to explore, spend time, and enjoy. For me, its fun.We also saw the signs for the upcoming Christmas Parade. We have gone several times and while the pacing of the parade is a bit slow, we have always enjoyed going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini

20,"Crowded, Dirty, Full of Homeless People","I won't be back. One visit to this overpriced place full of homeless people, overpriced restaurants, shops and hotels is enough for me. You can't even see most of the stars as there are so many people walking on them. Use caution when walking around here, especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
10,Disgusted,"When I went to LA this was one of the things I was looking forward to. Instead the area is dirty with trash, and is not well unkept. There are people asking for money left and right. And it's expensive to park.( yes I know this is a major city) overal, I don't recommend coming to this if you want to look at LA the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978joet
30,Not to bad,"I stayed on hollywood boulevard for 6 nights in a hostel. Its quite interesting, you have some hollywood stars, people dressed up as movie characters, a lot of souvenir shops, a few museums and things to do and some places to eat. There are a few shops to buy clothes too. If your looking at staying on hollywood boulevard its very noisy during the week until about 2am and friday and saturdays it doesnt start getting quite till about 4am",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keelia_1221
30,Tourist Drive,We drove along Hollywood Blvd for a stretch and got out for a few blocks to see the stars on the sidewalk. Interesting but very crowded and touristy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmacwi
30,Not a lot to do,"We went to waste time so it was fine. Saw the Chinese Theater but didn't go in. We walked up and down a few times and left. Lots of restaurants. Lots of souvenir shops. Definitely a place to people watch, if you're into that kind of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMARALAPIP
30,Had to show the teens all the hype!!,"Our family of 4 came in to town today and the first thing our teens wanted to do was see the Blvd and all the stars. We walked several blocks east from the Theatre and then looped back around and walked west. Besides the fun famous starts and a few pictures, after an hour all 4 of us were ready to be done. Our teens kept complaining about the amount of smokers, pot smokers, and worn out looking costumes along with snake handlers. Seriously, it's thick with people and smells.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledQ236SW
50,An interesting time spotting names on the Walk of Fame,"Although I stuck to the side of the Hollywood Wax Museum for several blocks, it was a interesting walk to be able to spot 'familiar famous' names. The vibe was nice for the most part as it is very easy to note that most activities are geared to the tourists so you can obviously ignore the bits and pieces that are not suited to your taste. Engage your full senses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qutedoc
20,A bit scary,"In my search for the Michael Jackson star, I had to fight my way through streets crowded with individuals shouting at imaginary people. Appears to be a popular area for homeless drug addicts. Dirty place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButtonsTheTraveler
10,This place is a dump,"Would never come back. Smells like urine, homeless people everywhere. People dressed up in knock-off disney costumes trying to get money for a picture with them. People trying to sell you homemade cd's. Take your kids if they want to see what happens when people do drugs. Gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar638027
40,Super touristy - massive regeneration since last visit,"Last visited 16 years ago - what a transformation - it's a fully geared tourist attraction now. It was worth a quick drive along for us, and a quick prance along the boulevard, but not much more than that, for us, anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
30,Are you a big celebrity fan,"It was interesting to see the sidewalk stars of well known people from all the different genre of the entertainment industry, as well as signed squares and hand/foot prints of select performers. You'll also get your dose of many hopefuls who came to Hollywood with big dreams only to find themselves dressed as Songebob Square Pants or some other character for a few dollars a day. And then there are the knock-off cd/DVD venders peddling the latest ripped off discs. Unless your interested in a tour of Grummens theatre, spending time trying to find a particular sidewalk star, or some other attraction, this won't take more than an hour to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikingfarmer
50,A must see,You can't take a trip to LA and not see the famous walk of fame. I spent an hour or so here so it doesn't take up much time and it's fun just picking out the people you recognise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiC1532
30,Great place if you love movies...,Visiting this site you will get closer to center of the scene of the movies and celebrities .

20,Let Down Boulevard,"really looking forward to this visit and what a let down. It is very dirty and tacky, lots of down and outs sleeping on the pavements and begging. No / very few public conveniences, we used the one in MacDonalds and it was pretty disgusting. Some event was being staged so all of the frontages were obscured by stages and camera crews. One great photo opportunity of the Hollywood sign is about the only positive. If there is something great about this location i really just did not get it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chubchubbanana
30,You Have To Be In Tourist Mode,"We were going on a tour that met up on Hollywood Blvd and decided to show up early so we could see the sites.The later it got, the crazier the street got. My son loved the street performers, my daughter enjoyed the international crowded feel if that makes since and I just enjoyed watching them. I just smelled urine the whole time/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylviaS4

40,Place to be in downtown,Walk on the hollywood boulevard and experience the heat of hollywood. Lots of stuff to do around from renting a Ferrari to visit fun place on the boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lion_chd
30,Different!!,"I had high expectation for this....and I was left feeling a bit confused.I thought it would be bright lights, clean streets, show time and fun all around.Instead it's full of tramps begging and hassling people. Very few police about to make you feel safe. About 25% of the stars on the walkway have been vandalised. It's all a bit odd.Having said that, you kinda have to go to say you've seen it and done it. Seeing some of the stars names was impressive and fun. But there is a lot of them and quite a bit of walking if you are to do them all.It's a must see when in Hollywood I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mightyhorns

10,Some of the worst street performers I've seen,"If in LA one thing people want to see is the Hollywood walk of fame , if so spend about 5 minutes ,which is all you'll need ,to see the famous Chinese theatre after that I'd get out , the street is filthy and full of homeless people , weirdos and tacky gift and tour shops but the worst thing is the street performers, guys with cheap fancy dress costumes like a Spider-Man with a backpack to the superman with white trainers ,2 guys breakdancing that my cat could do a better job of ,LA should put a bit of money into this place and brink back some of its lost glory .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparkyott1

30,Locals don't bother,"If you are a tourist, sure come take a look. It definitely smells like urine, is very dirty and there are a lot of homeless people here. It's been hyped over the years - by the media - to be more than it really is. Check it out but be prepared to be a bit disappointed. No longer is this the center of the world for entertainment, it's not terribly relevant in this day and age and it's kind of sad in a way. That said, a LOT of food and entertainment options, souvenirs, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
40,1st trip to California,I had a fine time. I actually thought there would be more to see & do but its the atmosphere. Just to hang out and check out the sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBLOVER2014
50,Nosy place,I think this is just only one street (exlude beach area) where there is a life ))) If you just look on a corner you will see very poor houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliya0610
10,Living in a bygone era,"We stayed two nights in this area specially to visit Hollywood. Hollywood Boulevard has the old theatres and stars on the pavement but nothing happens there anymore. One tv station has a chat show but you can't get in. There are so many rubbish tourist shops and people trying to sell tours. We walked both sides of the street for quite a long way and found nothing of interest. The area is quite run down, not terribly clean and homeless people begging. There are cheap fast food places and some undesirable looking bars. If you are planning a California itinerary like we were I would suggest you leave Hollywood and its tours out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Visi2rs
30,Highly overrated,"For me I found Hollywood boulevard to be Rather lackluster, just a bunch of stars in a pretty scungy area of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathanh723
40,Super fun with friends,Walking down Hollywood boulevard felt like a wonderful cliche! This is a great place to hang out with family or friends. Was cool to see the stars on the sidewalk. Loved the rush and touristy feel about the place. We enjoyed looking around but our favorite store was this amazing candy shop that had massive sized candy and cool displays!! So much fun to shop there regardless of age:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daswitty
30,Nice,It was great to see this legendary place. It was a bit overcrowded but all in all it is still worth to get a glimpse of this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piretjm
30,see the stars,"walking down Hollywood blvd is a neat experience. You can see the stars on the sidewalk, and walk to the Chinese Theater. It gets very crowded on weekends and afternoons. It is nice and quiet in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2He
20,Hollywood Boulevard,Yeah it's ok. A lot like Oxford street for those who know it. It's worth seeing if you want to tell your friends you've been there or you are in to Hollywood in a big way. Go to Venice beach and see some cool art. Give them a dollar. You won't have sleepless nights if you miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlopurves1
10,Dirty and uninventing,Honestly there is very little to justify visiting this place beyond seeing the Chinese Theatre and a few hand prints from showbiz stars. Everything else about Hollywood Boulevard is to be avoided from the human and dog waste on the streets to endless hassle of people selling their tours. This has to be one of the worst destinations on the planet. We were In the area for a concert so our trip was not entirely wasted but there is nothing that would motivate me to come here again or recommend it in any way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2can
30,"Crowded, loud and nothing special but a ""must see"" I guess","So what can I say about my visit to the Hollywood Boulevard? - It is a street, a crowded street, a crowded street with lot's of overpriced shops and scammers who want to sell you their ""free CDs"" (just walk by and don't answer them).It is nice to walk down there once I guess, just to have seen it but that's about it. Nothing really special there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannym547
50,A must when you visit L.A.!,"The walk of fame is among the most visited places on earth, but besides the stars on the sidewalk (which is fun seeing all those famous names) there's a whole hollywood ambiance around them, the diversity of people from allover the world and the local characters dressed as famous legends of cinema, places like the chinese theater and its concrete prints of the stars from yesterday glory and today's cinematic talents, madame Tussauds wax museum and Ripley's Believe it or not museum with forgetting the souvenir shops and plazas. It is truly an experience that can be enjoyed wtih the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962juancp
50,Great place to visit,"Great shopping and things to look at. Find you favourite stars, star in the walk of the stars, Visit the iconic Manns Theatre",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julesbayliss
30,Nothing to plan a whole day for,"Giving this three stars because its basically something you have to see at some point, but its a lot of tourist shops, people in costumes and people trying to sell you things. Once you've been once probably no real need to go back. I wouldn't plan to spend more than an hour here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJ273
30,Some sights but overall not as great as imagined,"Given its reputation, I must say the Boulevard was not a great experience. Too commercial and too many touts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twee_Seng_HO
40,Tourist Delight - Plan in Advance,This is EXTREMELY touristy but it's a must do if youve never been to LA. We planned ahead and it made it easier dealing with tourists. Having a map and knowing where you need to go helps because once you're ready to leave you want to get out ASAP.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColetteK683
30,Nothing to boast about.,"As a tourist, Hollywood boulevard is definitely a must see. You have the walk of fame, theaters, costume wearers, CD givers and everything else.You only need about an hour here, maybe 2. So i suggest parking in the lot for CVS, then go buy something, anything at CVS, to redeem your free hour parking.If you like museums there are some here and nearby like Ripley's and the Hollywood museum.Avoid the people giving CDs and wearing costumes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipinny
30,Not what you'd expect,After being lucky enough to go here twice it's disappointing that's not at all like you think it would be. You think from the tv/films it's going to be glitz and glamour when in fact it's a little bit seedy.Don't get me wrong walking around looking at the Stars on the floor creates some excitement as you've seen it so many times on screen as with the Chinese Theatre with the hand/foot prints but everything around it seems a little sketchy.There are pretty much people lined up dressed in different costumes waiting for you to have your pictures taken with them for money which I had no interest in but the block up the sidewalks making it hard to get along in some areas.One decent thing is the massive souvenir shop by the theatre which pretty much sells everything you could ever need to take home to friends and family.Was disappointed but I would still recommend it as it's definitely somewhere to say you have been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannahS78
50,The place where it all happens,"Hollywood Boulevard is the most famous boulevard in the entertainment world as it houses the Dolby Theatre - House of Oscar Awards, the El Capitan - Theatre for the world premiere of all Disney Movies and the Chinese Theatre - a theatre which hosts the world premieres of all Hollywood big movies. Apart from the above, you will also find the Museum of Scientology, Ripley's Believe it or Not Odditorium, Madame Tussauds and many more attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hiten1977
20,Not worth the trouble and the expense,Municipal parking in the area is the most expensive probably in all of the States. If you think it's worth it to see the stars in the sidewalk and the would be performers trying their abilities on the public then go ahead and fight the traffic to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaco86
20,Avoid this place. Don't get the free CD. Don't take photo with costume wearing people!,"Several guys giving out free CD's. I reluctantly got one since he was on my way. He said it was free. As soon as I touch it, he signed his name on the CD and asked me to buy it for $5. I refused him but he wouldn't go away. I didn't pay him since the street was crowded with people. This last for 2-3 minutes. Don't take pictures with the black spider man. I saw several tourists argue with him about the photo taking price after they took photos with him. These costume figures are very cunning. He told you $1 or $2 to take photos. That could mean for each person or for each photos. If whole group of people take pictures with these costume wearing people, you end up paying a lot. These figures looks cute but there are other helper around them. These cunning people aim at Asian people more. I would avoid going there at night. Not much to see except the stars on the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexemilycrystal
30,Should be on your ' must visit' list,"Daughter keen to see the stars names on the pavements so walked up and down both sides to pick out ones to photoBe warned , you are constantly bombarded with folk offering you trips , tours , sightseeing events etc . Hate being hassled on the streetsSaw the handprints of Marilyn Monroe which are in the pavementBottom line it's a tourist attraction in LAX which you should spend an hour or so visiting . Plenty of shops around and places to eat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spachick64
50,"If You Are A First Time Visitor To Los Angeles, It Is A Must","Under the heading of been there done that, if you are a first time visitor to Los Angeles, you must see Hollywood Blvd.It is best, I think, to see by car. There is nothing that special to get you out of your car. Yes, there are the hand-prints at the Mann's Theater (used to be The Chinese Theater) and the stars on the streets all along Hollywood Blvd. but it is not all it is cracked up to be. It is crowded always and unless you just must see concrete with a dead stars hand-prints in it, I don't see the point.But, it is still a must. You can park and walk around the Mann's Theater if you want. It is well patrolled and you will be fine. Your wallet will be in your front pocket, you will not be taking the flyers people want to hand you and you do not want to buy anything at all from a street vendor or worse yet, some guy that says he has a Rolex for you.I would not waste money on a tour bus. If you are in LA, I bet you rented a car. Go by car. Just pick up Hollywood Blvd. off La Brea and start driving east. Once you get to the Pantages Theater, you have done all you want to do. Past the Pantages there is nothing to see and it is not safe at night.The main stretch of Hollywood Blvd. is safe until about 10:30 pm and then you want to be in your car. No one is going to hurt you, it is just that a lot of the tourists are gone and a lot of homeless, some nice, some drug addicted will be out and about.If you have time, stop at Musso and Frank Grill on Hollywood Blvd (6667), They have great food and the place is famous and has been there forever. It is not cheap, so if you are on a budget you can grab a Pink's Hot Dog on your way home at Pink's on La Brea.Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Busy place,"Could not avoid this place every day as staying at the Loews hotel we passed through daily, you got the stars along the street for the customary photo and their's plenty of bars as restaurants to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/830roger
30,One of America's Famous Streets,"Unfortunately, this is no Times Square, nor Sunset Strip. Hollywood Blvd has deteriorated into a dirty street cluttered with panhandlers and con artists. The walk of fame is interesting, but watch your wallet and avoid any special deals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
20,Definitely not what it looks like on TV award shows,It is scary during the day. I would never attempt to go there at night. Panhandlers everywhere. Protesters. It is not a safe area. To see it once was okay but I couldn't wait to get back on the tour bus. I would have been happy just to drive by. I did walk the stairs the celebrities do on Oscar night into the Dolby theater and did get a chance to see the hand and footprints at Mann's. It is something to do once but I would never return to the area. It is,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieg1230
40,"Just ok, but a must to experience LA","Hollywood Boulevard as many may describe, seems to be much nicer on TV than it actually is. I would say it is due to the area surrounding it which is not the cleanest or ""prettiest"" area you may experience from LA. However, this shouldn't stop anyone from going. I think it's a must to experience LA. The main attraction there is the Chinese Theater which you see on TV and/or in movies all the time, but there is actually a nice shopping area along with some restaurants surrounding it. And of course, you have the celebrity STARS which although not the most glamorous, are also part of the experience. In addition, that would be the main location to hop on to one of the many different tour buses/vans which would take you through different areas near by or even further, especially up to the hills to see the celebrity mansions, get a better view of the Hollywood sign and a beautiful view of the city as well. If you're lucky enough, you may also very likely come across the filming of a TV show or movie and/or the premier of a movie. Overall, I think it's worth it and you wouldn't fully experience the city of Los Angeles without going through Hollywood Boulevard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valezka323
10,Bit of a disappointment,"On out recent trip to the west coast we began in San Francisco and ended in LA as we wanted to see what life would be like to live in an apartment near Hollywood Boulevard (we stayed 5 days).Sadly this end to the holiday was quite a disappointment. The Boulevard to me was ageing, lacking in investment, overcrowded and living off its history. Very much a low point, and rather dirty and seedy.Arguably worth a visit, but for no longer than a day (better 1/2 unless your doing a show etc.). There are a number of real gems still there, such as the El Capitan Theatre, but the boulevard itself was a real disappointment.LA itself is a nightmare for traffic at any part of the day, and your likely to waste a lot of time getting to the location (and then parking)? For what is not a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RWCG
10,Opposite of what you would expect,"The road is terribly dirty, it smells and feels completely unsafe to walk there! It is too commercial and after few steps you feel so disappointed and regret even being there. Definitively don t bother as it is not what it uses to be and definitively not what you would expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255Kathrin255
10,I LOATHE Hollywood Boulevard,"OK, go once - but that should sate you. Pushing, shoving crowds, dirty pavements, sleazy shops,tacky 'souvenirs', touts and hasslers await you.This is nothing to do with historical Hollywood of legend and history: you will find out more about that on Sunset Boulevard, especially if you do a tour with Felix In Hollywood Tours (see separate review).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
20,"""Disappointed"" ...","We had expected something more glamour or bling bling about that place but reality its too busy (another place too famous...) and dirty. The street is small. We came at night (not good time with kids), we feel unsafe. Dont waste your time and go somewhere else more nice !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMT-76
30,Much smaller in real life,Isn't this a common phase for anything linked to movies. Well the same is true for this road. A few nice shops back to back and 1 or 2 other attractions that are well known. But it finishes almost as quickly as it starts. outside of this stretch - its not the nicest part of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
20,Dirty and Busy,"Hollywood Blvd was pretty dumpy - it was dirty and smelled like pee and marijuana. If you want to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame and find some stars, sure... go once. It was very busy, packed with tourists and hard to walk around. That being said, there is a good shopping mall, lots of places to eat and grab coffee and I found a great yoga studio (Core Power Yoga if you like yoga). I likely won't be coming back to this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandyanthony
40,Great to finally go here!,"You see it so many times on Tv etc but being there is a bit different theres plenty of flash cars Bentleys , Porches , Ferraris even a Maclaren Dealership in the main Street.

20,Glitz and glamour have faded,"If you like tacky tourist traps then come here. The place is good to come during the day , although its dirty , smells and is full of vagrants and beggars . Nightime is worse. WE saw a guy get tasered here , because he was taping the police with his phone .Not sure of the full story , but gives you an idea of the place. Lots of shops to buy tacky souveneirs and heaps of places to eat. I would not go there with young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickX01
50,If you want to see how stars really feel? Maybe even bump into one...,"This is one of the greatest places to visit in Hollywood. There is definitely a lot going on at Hollywood Boulevard. Park your car, get out, walk around and let the scenery take you away. Visit the shops and see all there is. There are many times that you may catch a real star during your journey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWB2011
30,"Busy dirty and in need of some care,","When you think of Hollywood Boulevard it conjures images of a vibrant glitzy home of movies and entertainment, you can see in the architecture of the buildings that in its hey day it would have been a very well kept and special place to be.Sadly now its a cash cow location, bringing all people from all back grounds to come and spend money on junk and street entertainers, the whole strip is in need of maintenance and a good clean up, the actual street stinks, its dirty untidy and in need of repair, a large no of the stars in the pavement are damaged or in general bad repair as are the footpaths, the paths are very dirty and for the amount of revenue this area creates you would think it would be better.There were a lot of vagrants sleeping on the path and begging, and people begging in general.This area is a high volume area so gets super busy, loads of places to eat, Hard Rock Cafe , Hooters etc.Loads of shops to purchase the tacky Hollywood merchandise.Its a must see if your in town, but left us feeling slightly disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tony20002
30,Low expectations,"Went with low expectations and it actually wasn't that bad. I don't really care about celebrities and their stars, but it was the tourist thing to do so went with the family.Took a picture at Muhammad Ali's star at the Kodak theater. Ate some gelato at the shop right next to it.Lots of poorly dressed characters around that will take pictures with you for tips. Most of them looked terrible and shady. Lots of people selling tours.

40,A street you have to experience,"It's crowded and it's touristy. Still it is the street that defines Hollywood with it's stretch of theaters, retain shopping and hotels.

40,See The Stars,"A very interesting but fun place to visit, you can see the stars on the foot path and try to find your favourite, there is also Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, the Chinese Theatre and a variety of souvenir shops.There are a couple of things that you should be aware of when visiting you will be asked several times if you would like to go on a tour, there are people with CDs in their hand it is recommended that you don't take the CD it they offer it to you as you will end up having to paying for it, there are lots of people dressed up in costumes asking if you would like a photo with them, you can but be aware that you will have to pay them for the opportunity. But don't let these things spoil the fun of visiting Hollywood Boulevard, best time to visit is on a week days as it is more crowded on the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torz70
30,Hoped for much better,We were looking forward to our stroll on Hollywood Blvd but were disappointed. There are so many wonderful things to see like the stars on the sidewalk and the Chinese Theater.Hollywood Blvd is poorly maintained and much leeway given to businesses. The sidewalk where the stars are is very dirty and the smell of vomit or human excrement hits you every block or so. One business had music blasting loudly in attempt to attract people but it proved to be more of a repellent.The section where the original stars are located appeared to be the only area that gets attention from the city or the entity responsible for the blvd.I hope someone cares enough to clean this area up to make it more enjoyable for visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MommaGiiGii
50,"So you want to see Hollywood, eh?","As a new Angeleno, I was surprised that Hollywood Boulevard had so much to offer. The whole world comes here to see and experience the entertainment capital of the world and it's pretty dang cool. First, don't get suckered into taking pictures with the buskers on the street unless you want to pay for knock-off imitations of beloved Hollywood characters. Otherwise, enjoy walking along the Walk of Fame and look for your favorite celebrity's star. Take in a movie at either TCL Grauman's Chinese Theatre or Disney's El Capitan Theatre. Both theatres are beautiful and majestic and have modern screens and sound systems that provide a full motion picture experience. Walk up the stairs where movie stars ascend to the Dolby Theatre for Hollywood's biggest night at the Oscars. Plan on spending a few hours here to see all the sights. It can get pretty sketchy at night but it is perfect for a family and friends during the daytime. Welcome to Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
30,Overwhelming!,"This place is a real circus! Unless you can find out where the star of the person you admire is located, you just have to walk along to see all the stars in the footpath. That is, if you can get past all the people dressed up in costume, crap hawkers, ticket sellers, etc, etc. Some interesting buildings are worth a look, but maybe best if you go early in the day, when the crowds might be less-dense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972jennym
40,Cheesy Fun,"Is it a cheesy tourist trap? YESIs it fun? YESIt is fun to hunt down the stars of your favorite people and take photos.

If you go in knowing that, then it is a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515

10,Huge Disappointment,"Visited this for the first time early on a Sunday morning. We were excited to see all of the sights and found street parking, which turned out to be the best thing about this visit. We walked for blocks to see the stars on the sidewalks and other sights. Unfortunately, the area is filthy and smells horribly of urine; an unfortunate status of a place designed to honor entertainers. More empty storefronts than we expected, too.

30,"See it - but for your own sanity, make it fast!","Hollywood Boulevard is extremely tacky, very crowded, and rammed with street performers, people selling guided tours, and others using pushy sales tactics on everything from CDs to museum tickets. That said, if you tackle it like a military operation (get in, get some pictures, get out) it's still worth seeing, especially if you're a film buff, and you can't very well visit Tinseltown without at least giving it a quick look.

A great run to do, you can enjoy the view & have a good run at the same time, also you can watch Conan O'Brien or Jimmy Kimmel, its the place where their studio is located 😊😄👍🏻..drop by whenever you're in LA, ciao",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancarl0

There is just the fun of finding your various favorite performers on the Walk of Fame. And then all the people in costume to pose with for pics - or to take pics of from a distance so that you don't have to pay a tip. Then there are the street preachers. And the folks with pythons and boas that will let you wrap the snake around you for a picture - and a tip, of course.It's a unique experience that is just a fun time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougmendoza

LA in general is like any other city and in fact is a bit of a dive when driving in, especially when greeted with the morning smog (don't expect sunshine until early afternoon).

30,Hollywood's Iconic main drag,It's always fun to take a stroll down Hollywood Boulevard to people watch. You'll find an assortment of interesting characters dressed as beloved movie/cartoon characters who want to pose with you for cash. Don't miss Grauman's Chinese Theater with all of the hand/footprints of famous folks from days gone by. Stroll down the boulevard and remember those folks who've received a Walk of Fame star. Great people watching opportunities abound!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takrafty
20,Meh,"Dirty, unmaintained and lack lustre. That is how I would describe the Hollywood Boulevard.Many of the stars are dirty.It is as if they don't even clean them regularly.The shops on the street are ok.

HOWEVER....... You can avoid all of this by going extremely early in the morning. When there are not major crowds, it's not too hot, the Desperate Characters haven't arrived yet, because I went in the morning and I was pleasantly surprised after reading all these bad reviews. Just go in the morning. Don't hype it up too much either. It's not glitz and glamor like you make it up to be in your head. It's just like any other city, dirty with crime. I love this city, it was a very pleasurable experience, I was just going off of stereotypes of cities like Buffalo or Orlando, but I think its quite obvious that everywhere you go nowadays there will be crime. But you have to see this if you are in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonFruit85

10,A place the Hollywood stars have abandoned,Street vendors and people selling you something at every turn. Dirty sidewalks with the smell of urine in the air. Shady people as well.

Burbank would be a much better option to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romethisworld
20,Keep an eye on your belongings.,"Our tour guide dropped off us and told us we had one hour to look around and then she would come back to pick us up, as she wasn't able to park the van and trailer. We were a little put about that we only had such a short amount of time, but it transpired that we really didn't need any more than that.The first ten minutes or so were spent trying to find a restroom - we had spent about three hours driving from Santa Barbara and this was a priority. We found them in a sort of mini mall area, which was full of touristy shops and, for some reason, giant elephant statues. From here, you can also go up a couple of floors and snap a photo of the Hollywood sign on a distant hill.After we had exhausted that particular source of excitement, we went back out onto the boulevard itself. I always had the impression that this was some sort of wide, sweeping avenue, but it's actually just an average, narrow side street. You'll find the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which consists of stars fitted into the sidewalk, and a little further down is the Chinese Theater. There are plenty of street peddlers trying to hawk their wares and the entire place is packed shoulder to shoulder with people getting in each other's way.Hollywood Boulevard is the quintessential gimmick. You're going to want to visit so that you can say you've been, but there's nothing of any substance. It's just a magnet for chancers out to make a quick buck.

It is dirty, loud and sketchy. Be vigilant of the people around you. There is a reason why Hollywood High School has a six foot fence around it. Having said all that.....it is fun to visit Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Strip, you hear about these streets all the time. Grauman's Chinese Theater is now TCL Chinese Theater and has those famous hand and feet in cement of stars in front. They are fun to see. The Dolby Theater where the Academy Awards are held is nearby and pictures show that what you see on TV is vastly different than what really goes on. People watching, not an altogether enjoyable experience is an activity that makes the Venice Beach scene seem sedate. Here is the Best Tip Ever. There is parking a couple of blocks off the blvd at the Blessed Sacrament Church. Eight dollars for all day, the lot is fenced in and monitored. The best bargain in Hollywood!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdxtraveler52
20,Dodgy...,"I knew something was up when the only two people going to Hollywood on the bus tour was me and my husband! The rest of the bus were going to Universal Studios that day, so when the driver dropped us off at a not so nice looking side street, he told us to meet him back at this spot at 4pm and said, ""have fun in Holly-Weird"". It was about 11.30am then, so I was thinking, okay that's heaps of time to see everything. Every what was my question after that!? We did the Wax Museum as planned and the walk of fame, but the actual street itself? Not what I expected at all. Cheap souvenir shops, cool yeah? A little bit, cheap enough for a magnet or two. Next shop? Exactly the same, and again and again! The more you walk away from the middle of the street, the creepier I felt. People trying to sell you more bus trips up to so and so's house, where so and so shops... Not interested, but no, they kept coming. People selling their CDs? My husband got tricked into that one, I then saw him give the guy $3! Was not impressed with that! We stopped at a little bar place called Snow White something a rather. That was actually alright, just to sit down and take a break from all the people. We were looking at the clock, willing 4pm to come around so we could go back to where we felt safe! I honestly, would not be comfortable walking round on my own, even though it was pure sunshine! The street itself, not a nice experience. I would not recommend doing anything else except the wax museum and looking at the stars and hand prints, once you've done that, get out of there! Holly-Weird was definitely how to describe it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robyn_256
30,Nice to see once,We thought the hand prints the the theatre were interesting. The stars in the sidewalk are not in any order. If you're looking for someone in particular it may be a long day. It was really kind of dirty. Reminded me of Times Square before it was cleaned up. It's pretty crowded and full of people trying to sell you tours. They were not aggressive.

The attractions are not worth seeing unless you are turned on by a celebrity's name chiseled into the concrete sidewalk. Same thing for Sunset Blvd as there is nothing we found worth the drive. Rodeo Dr was nice but the stores are empty because the prices are beyond belief. A sterling silver belt buckle was $700.00 and the same buckle at a truck stop is $8.99. The only difference is somebody engraved their name on the $700.00 item. No place to park, lots of traffic, huge crowds of people milling about, lots of homeless people, and too many sidewalk hustlers. I have now seen it and will not be going back.

30,A Local POV,I live here in LA. This stretch of road can be a locals biggest headache. It's constantly closed for premiers. Now that is a very cool thing. They happen mostly on Thursdays so if you want to witness something TOTALLY Hollywood it's a great time to go. Just know traffic is going to be a complete pain in the keister. There's the typical affair of souvenir shops and nick nacks. The costumed characters can be aggressive if you want a photo with them. Most want a cash tip. It's where the OCSARS are held. Jimmy Kimmel shoots across the street and often does bits on the side walk. El Capitan is a great place to see a disney movie. They always have a little show before hand.If you come to Hollywood you HAVE to see it. Put your hands down at the Chinese. See the stars on the side walk. But don't expect to see celebrities. Unless it's a premier they avoid this area like it has The Zika Virus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKLIVIN77

20,"Crowded, touristy, but you need to go anyway","All the landmarks that come to mind when you think of visiting LA -- the Chinese theater, the Egyptian theater, the walk of fame, Stars' handprints, etc -- are in Hollywood. There are street performers and Scientologists vying for your attention, and it's not the classiest part of town, or the safest after dark, but how can you go all the way to LA and not see it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/writrsblck

30,All First Timers,"For some reason everyone's list includes Hollywood Boulevard. For the first time visitor or tourist, yes you must go. Even if it is to say I did it & saw it. Ive been to California many times for some reason people always take me back. It's ok, nothing new to see. It's a popular tourist stop so you can imagine how crowded it always is. So if it's your first time in Los Angeles, by all means go and sight see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifeWithSalsa
50,Take your time,"Get here early and do a walk around first so you know the places you want to visit. Its gets really busy towards the evening with tour groups.

There were all sorts of characters in dress to be photographed with plus lots of silly souvenirs.Overall a blast and occupied 2 hours easily. Not sure what it's like rest of year though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikesalter
50,Crowded...but great!,Great place to buy souvenirs...a bit crowded with people taking pictures of the stars ... but the environment is absolutely amazing with different people from different parts of the world. Really Cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasofiasaldanha
40,Loud and hectic,There's a lot going on. Lots to see and do and a real mix of people. Thoroughly enjoyed walking around and taking it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adammawright
30,not for me,great to see once but not for me. Too dirty and lots of people walking around. We ate in a nearby restaurant that was so dirty that rodents were coming out of the trash bins in the carpark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugos351
30,Fun but dirty,Spent a few hours on a two day trip wandering down Hollywood Blv it was messy and full of out of work actors pretending to be super heroes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millets80
40,Chaotic Fun along Hollywood Boulevard,"Brought my sweetheart to Hollywood to experience Hollywood Boulevard. It ain't pretty. It's messy, full of people of every size, shape and attire. It's loud and it's a lot of fun. Finding stars name in the sidewalk is a major attraction and experiencing the street buskers is invigorating. Get an App for this so you know where your favorite's are in advance. Restaurants are a hit and miss affair in this area. We use Yelp to help us pick out some great ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDRoberts
40,"Loud and dirty, but really cool","Hollywood Boulevard has all the bright lights and sights of LA in one spot. It is quite entertaining, and there are lots of cool shops and gift shops (my favourite is the Girardhelli chocolate store). It is pretty dirty, and there are a few scary people, but seeing all the famous names written on the stars on the walk of fame made up for it. It is a definite must see if you are in LA, but be sure to proceed with caution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5057LTnicolaf
40,Relax & Enjoy,"For us tourists it is fun to stroll and watch. Cheap tacky shops and impersonators are all part of the boulevard. Just relax and go with the flow, we are on holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runcation4fun
20,Not what I expected,"Went to Hollywood and Vine but was sadly disappointed. Very depressed, seedy area. I was approached to buy something, go on a tour, have my photo taken or check out the church of Scientology every 10 steps. Glad I saw it but wouldn't do it again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reeselmt
20,Tacky and run down,"This place is unloved, busy and a bit crazy in the fun sense of the word. Forget parking it's impossible and if your attempting to eat out in the cheap and cheerful places like McD's etc they are busy train station type joints, both overpriced and a shakedown.It's fun for kids but this is a place of two halves. The extremely wealthy and the extremely NOT wealthy. As a holiday destination the freeways are rough as hell in that they are crumbling due to lack of investment. The Getty museum is the highlight as is the Planetarium after that it's the Boulevard with it's cheap amusement arcade style shops all tacky and in need of some upgrading. Don't get me wrong it's worth a day or two but with the way the streets are the place looks great on TV but in real life it needs greater investment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djdrummeralan
40,Amazing But Be Careful,Our last stop trip in California. This boulevard is so amazing that it will bring you to the bright lights of LA. Shop for hollywood souvenirs. You can see the names of the past and present celebrities on the sidewalks while roaming around the place. You can also do shopping into well known clothing brands near the area. PLEASE do be careful with the impersonators in the area bacause once they will beg you to take a picture with them they will ask for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jemirt
30,Overrrated,"I have mixed feelings about Hollywood boulevard. The part I am talking about is about 2km long.The first part goes from ""The Four ladies of Hollywood"" (Check that, btw) until Metrostation Hollywood/Highland. This part is the most important and most touristic part of Hollywood. You find the theaters, museum, shops, ... that are known and have name and fame. It can be busy at some moments and places. Nothing wrong with this part, everything is just concentrated on this little part.The second part goes from Metro Hollywood/Highland to Metrostation Hollywood/Vine. This is also Hollywood Boulevard, but does not have the glamour of the other part. You find bars, restaurants, 18+ shops, strange guys (During the day too, but at night it's very clear they are not standing there for fun, which gave me an unexpected feeling of light unsafety), but no glamour or rich and famous feeling.Combination of both gives me the feeling that Hollywood Boulevard is overrated...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyBul
50,Entertainment capital of the world,"During August this part is busy with many visitors from all around the world - mainly Asia. Try to visit during the less crowded season. Los Angeles has a great climate all year round. March and April is very good and certainly less crowded. However, the top season to visit this part of the city is during the Oscars. My next favourite season is during Haloween",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek

10,"Creapy, dirty, run down hangout for homeless people",We were very excited about our trip to LA and especially Hollywood Boulevard. What a disappointment! the whole street was dirty and disgusting. There were a tone of homeless people and beggars followed by other people trying to sell you stuff. The neighborhood is run down and many buildings are empty.We excepted much more and only stayed about an hour before we made our way out of that hole!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USTravelgirl271839
10,What a hole! Bum Town Boulevard more like.,"We were genuinely shocked when we looked down and saw all the stars on the ground. This place is full of homeless people and is really run down. We didn't stay long as we didn't feel safe and felt it was just pretty crappy. Thought one homeless dude was dead, laying facedown in what I presume was his urine. Slowly made our way towards him to check he was okay, and thankfully he started coughing and throwing up his morning alcoholic beverage. We were satisfied he was fine so made our way quickly back to our car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateP968
50,Well worth a visit.,Loved Hollywood Boulevard - just to go and stroll round and see all the stars names on the ground and the people. Such an atmosphere - everyone seemed to enjoy it. Lovely for young and old alike. We loved it. Been there a few times already and go back every time we go to LA. Lots to see and places to visit as well as sightseeing and places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yvonne68
50,fun place to walk around and see all the shops and people everywhere,"Great place to people watch, shops were incredible to see, and walk around watching people , what a great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magicchef
40,Good place to visit,"It's great to see all the stuff that's makes Hollywood, there is only one concern I have is the amount of homeless people hanging about, other than that worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/King-of-the-slots
30,Okay/Over-rated,"Maybe if I saw a celebrity I would have enjoyed it more. I thought since it was an upscale neighborhood that it would be clean. I was wrong. There was trash on the ground. Crackheads and people trying to sell you a tour, CD, or club event. The stars go on forever. We took a tour and stopped to eat at a restaurant. I asked one bar if I could use the bathroom and he said its only for patrons. So I bought a $5 water. And he really stalked me to make sure I bought something. The tour was okay, but now I can say I've been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kemoyd
20,Disappointing,"As a few reviewers here have said - nothing like you see in the movies. This place has no soul. It's dirty, dated, not well looked after. There are people begging for money along the street. Really sad. So many tourists everywhere. If it used to be glamorous it unfortunately has lost all of its charm. Don't expect much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeee85
30,Check it off your list,"Take a long walk up the street, see the stars, see the footprints and handprints, visit a theatre or two (chinese theatre a favourite) and then probably go.I found half a day here to be more than enough. It was good to see but I soon got irritated. There are the ""tour guides"" trying to sell u a pricey package, the artists trying to give you ""free"" music, tourists everywhere and be prepared to pay for any photo taken with someone dressed in costume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicao140
20,Not worth parking and walking the streets,"This place is not worth parking and walking the streets to see the stars on the floor and the shops. Too many people on the sidewalks and there is not much to see other than ppl imitating actors or characters from movies and a lot of shops trying to sell you the same thing. most shops are souvenir shops. the streets are dirty. i would not recommend this place at all. however, if you do want to go, pass by while driving. it will save you time and still get to take tons of pictures. this place overall is...""meh...next please"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTrias
30,Tacky,A very tacky street with lots of shops selling junk. It's definitely not what you expect from the movies. Go by all means but don't expect a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrylgreen
50,Great place for Tourists!,Walking up and down Hollywood blvd was the highlight of our Trips. Lots too do and a lot of people watching. We shopped while checking out the Walk of Fame. One morning we even manage to see a premier. Great experience!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianabS3774RI
30,THE TOURIST TRAP!!!,"Hollywood Blvd is revamped with tourists at the top of this city's mind. It is lined with old fashioned double streetlights, palm trees, and new stoplights. The entire boulevard is over inundated with excited global tourists, agressive advertisers and sellers, the animated Disney characters and 'don't care less' shutterbugs. We strolled on the 'walk of fame', noting 'whose who' movie stars, climbed the 3rd level of the 'Broadway Hollywood Bldg' where we spotted the Hollywood'sign in the far distance, the condoned off TCL Chinese Theatre, then we continued up to Hollywood and La Brea Gateway where the 4 ladies holding up the gazebo. A TOURIST TRAP OF ALL TRAPS!!! WHERE ARE THE STARS?????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniel800

10,"Run down, charmless, tacky bucket list box ticking exercise.","Over rated street filled with opportunistic beggers, gangsters and homeless crack junkies. The shopping is well below international standards, the sites ordinary, run down and grossly over glorified. There is no reason to go other than ticking off a bucket list. Quickly go then leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2946TZbenjamins
30,Boulevard of broken dreams,"It's touristy no doubt about it. We walked up and back, lots of shops, lots of people..no stars except the ones on the pavement. Hooky bars everywhere and my fave place Dunkin' Donuts try the cronut with choc filling awesome..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineM852
50,Fantastic vibe,It's got a mix of old and new Hollywood. Great restaurants Lounges and bars.Great place for celebrity sightings. I had many during my trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250elisat
40,Worth a visit if you've never been here.,"They've really cleaned up Hollywood in the last 30 years! Hollywood & Highland is a nice mall. It's a great walk if it's not too hot. A bunch of tourist stuff, but it's cool. I would recommend spending a few hours here. See Madame Tussaud's, Guinness Book of World Records, Hollywood Wax Museum, El Capitan (for a Disney movie; must buy tickets in advance for most events). Park at Hollywood & Highland so you don't have to stress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
30,Iconic,"Just like on the movies - an interesting and historic place. However, the impersonators and street sellers are annoying and intrusive. Loved the Chinese Theatre, Doby Theater and Roosevelt Hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seren899

30,Disappointed,"I always wanted to visit this as I am an avid movie buff.However I found this dirty, run down and a bit sleazy.There are hawkers everywhere pushing tours of Hollywood, souvenir overload and hustlers in dirty bad homemade costumes trying to stiff tourists.I've ticked it off the list but wouldn't bother going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonw982
30,Not at all Glamorous....,Its not at all glamorous as I thought the Hollywood Blvd will be.Too crowded.Too much tourists.Hardly you get any place to get your photo properly done.CD and goods sellars are really bothering you and costume wearing guys are trying to get money forcibly from you.Tip.Avoid this place if you have Agoraphobia and you dont like crowded places.Take care of your wallets and purses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaureenY
40,I love it,I'll never get tired of Hollywood Blvd. Always lots of people walking the sidewalks and plenty of places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidson168
50,Movie memories & Shopping,"Our visit began in Hollywood at the end of November to the first week of December, just in time for the annual the Hollywood Christsmas Parade. The Hollywood Boulevard strip was all decked out with Christmas decorations, trees , lights lots of entertainment by bands singing all your favourite Christmas carols etc . Everyone was ready for the parade that started at 6pm on the 29/11/15. We noticed that all the crowds started to gather around from midday to get the best spot on the street. Lots of police to make sure everything went smoothly . I must say the crowds were very well behaved and everyone was enjoying the traditional Christmas Parade. It felt like you were waiting for the famous movies stars to arrive for the oscars. Mind you there were movies stars in the parade from their soap operas shows etc & of course for the kiddies and the young at heart all the Disney characters plus many more. If you are ever thinking of visiting LA try to be there around the end of November for the Christmas parade it is simply a magical place to be. The next morning all the streets were all clean and business as usual. The strip has the big famous stores like Saphora, Forever 21, GAP, American Eagle to mention a few & in the highland centre (Dolby center ) they have Skechers, Guess, Victoria Secret, Pink, Mac and many more speciality shops. There are endless souvenir shops everywhere in the street & not to forget the Dolby theatre, TCL Chinese Theater, Hollywood Walk of Fame ,Madam Trusseu & Ripley's Believe it or not etc ect . Don't be worried about the colourful people that are dressed in their favourite character outfits trying to get you to take a photo with them than ask you to pay US$10 for the picture, all you have to do is just say No thank you and you will be not hassled . But if you want a photo with them and you don't mind paying than go for it. I found The Hollywood Boulevard Street clean when we walked up and down where all the main attractions were. Definitely a place to visit and add to your list of sightseeings in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulettea621
30,Not as glamourous as one would expect,"So for those not familiar with the US and its gratuity culture, beware that those dressed up as your favourite superhero characters calling you in for a pic expect a 'tip' for the favour. Being Australians, we weren't privy to how this all worked and were quickly told! Apart from the star handprints, we didn't find anything special about hollywood blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rakimia
30,Stop by,It's a stop-by kinda thing. Personally I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place. I just happened to be passing through. Skip if you dislike crowds and aren't in search of tourist paraphernalia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nkfeng
20,"Not worth it, scummy dirty place","Complete scummy dirty place! We drove through, bums, trash, old dirty place. Nothing like what I thought it would be. Saw a few attractions on the way, but not worth it.. Now I can say I've been there and done that though..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwL7790US
50,Entertainment Plus!,So much to see and do along the Boulevard. We loved the enormous amounts of talent as you strolled down the street. It was very exciting as a couple of days before the big Star Wars premiere took place so the street was still buzzing from the event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseH9
30,It's okay,"Hollywood Boulevard is always busy. Honestly, I think it's just a tourist trap. It's fun to see, but be cautious. The character actors want to pose with you in pictures, but it's not free. It's for tips. Beware of the guys trying to give you a free CD. It's not free. But if you're looking for sight seeing tours, those businesses are mostly located on Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccerman4000
40,Interesting stores,Fun people watching and looking for the names on the Walk of Fame. There were many street performers and people giving out flyers for restaurants and shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiebedasse
10,It is supposed to be beautiful,"You know, people tell you about the glamour and it is beautiful. They are lying to you. The Hollywood Boulevard sucks! It is full of garbage, lot of smart guys trying to get some money from tourists, drug dealers, and closed shops.The only place that is fine is the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderJ910
50,Walk it !,The walk of fame is just one of those things that must be done when in downtown holywood blv. The Jimmy Fallon tonight show studios is almost as famous as the dolby now! Go Jimmy! - I am only sorry I did not make it to one of the shows. The kids loved thehr interaction with 2 LAPD - who very very kindly stopped for photographs despite being on 'special detail'. Fair play to them they were true gents.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeMayo
40,hollywood Boulevard,hollywood Boulevard street is awesome they like making a show on the street ( ART ST') and there's to much people it's fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657abadia
50,Sight seeing,Great to walk and check out places seen all over tv and movies. Shopping is all over and people watching is even more fun. Our teens like the chaos of people and lights at nights. We like the fact it's history and we are a part of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bacon111
50,walk and smile,"my kids andi loves to walk at hollywood boulevard whether it is day time or night time. during the day you wil; see the beauty of the places around you and will see clearly the names written on the stars and at night.... the lights, the impersonators, the feel of hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kryzkat
10,A yawn factory,"We were completely underwhelmed by Hollywood Boulevard. It's full of people peddling theirs CDs or trying to get you to part with your cash to take a tour.The Boulevard is dirty, looks shabby and is not worthwhile at all. If you do go, prepare yourself to be unimpressed.The only highlights were our hotel, The Magic Castle and a lovely little cafe we found, Hart's Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BikeMan570

40,Quite an experience,"There is so much happening over there with the street artists masquerading like cine characters, to kids dancing and musicians playing towards the stream of tourists who want to locate their fav star on the walk of fame - this is just another experience to have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMITSPVERMA
20,Over-rated tourist area,Go see Hollywood Boulevard if you have to but the primary spot is the Chinese theater mostly for the hand/footprints of some of Hollywood's greatest. Otherwise it's a tourist trap. Don't spend a lot of time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,If you do not live here it is great fun,It is not that long - from La Brea to El Centro... great walk.. used to be totally sleazy.. but in hotel last decade it has changed a lot. Get a map and find the start of your favorite.. but look at the ones you do no know and find out who they are.. it is important to remember who were the ones who made this famous..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
30,Can be a bit of a disappointment,"I guess this is another must-do if you are visiting LA. It all comes down to your expectations but if they have been building up over the years, this can be a bit of a disappointment. Not that there is anything wrong with the place - but if you are visiting during the day, you get constantly hassled by hustlers and touts (very aggressive ones) trying to get you to take guided bus tours to celebrity homes. And at night, the place can seem a bit dangerous if you are with kids, especially at the Hollywood and Vine end of the boulevard. Though there are many, many attractions here, try to visit during the day, and hopefully after they have cleaned the sidewalks, which usually smell of urine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
30,Nice to walk through,Lots of shopping options more or less standard across the US. You can see the Hollywood Sign from here. Only downside is that a lot of tour guides try to hassle you into taking their tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JA221
50,Awesome place to be on LA,Been here with my family in the month of June and the experience is of a lifetime. Little warm in the month of june but you will love the long days.

30,Doesn't Live up to its Name ...,"If you just ""Have To"" see it then do so by car, as walking it is just a peep show / freak show / hustle & pan handler area.

30,Cheap Souvenir Shops,"Did not spend long here, I think I expected more but in real life it's just a street full of cheap souvenir shops dirty sidewalks...I think I did expect much more from seeing this iconic place on TV but 10 minutes was well enough time...good to drive through Beverly Hills though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LGALO
30,"It's Ok, Not My Favorite","It's ok. Pay for parking, then walk. Overcrowded 24/7. ""Street performers"" are fun. Nothing really awesome. Maybe it's because I was born and raised in L.A......but was never really impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waunderlust_forever
20,Crowded all the time,"Never once have I seen this place empty. So unless your shooting interviews for a TV show, avoid at all costs. First timers, take a peak but hopefully from a moving car as it is not that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelinmd
30,Nothing to get excited about,We only had a couple of hours to fill so caught the metro out to Hollywood Highland station and walked 2 mins from there. Very touristy and really only a street with stars and names in it... The odd character like Batman wandering around on the street. A few tourist shops and restaurants. It seemed to lack character and whilst it filled the 2 hours we had I could have easily missed it. Easy enough to get there by metro thought if you want a look around- catch the red line towards North Hollywood. It took about a half hour from Union Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jandalz3
20,Not a favorite place,"We kept our time on Hollywood Blvd to the busy two blocks near the Chinese Theater. Touristy shops line both sides of the boulevard that can be enjoyed by all ages. A few blocks away it is dirty and the shops are not family friendly. There are characters of all kinds walking the boulevard. The later in the evening, the more characters and less family friendly. There are better places in LA to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wewannagoagain
30,Not Impressed,"Yes, there are famous designers' store located here but I think that's what saves this area. Even though it's not as rundown as the streets on either side (well maintained, at least), there is no available parking and there are so many people just hanging out on the sidewalks and streets. I don't get it. Most of these stores are in malls now. Parts of the street are pretty though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15LisaT
30,Disappointing!,"We started at a far end of the Boulevard which didn't help. It was dirty, it was grimey, their was no glitz or glamour. I was shocked and pretty disgusted.Sadly the pavements hosting the famous stars on the walk of fame were in dire condition in some areas and cracked, and filthy. I felt it was akin to an unloved graveyard.The busier area was very touristy, with lots of tacky shops, homeless people, and a few of the attractions. I'd imagined a really fun and lively place but something was missing here. TLC for one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53
50,Pretty neat,"You always see it on tv, so it was pretty cool to actually be there and see it for yourself. It was much different than I had anticipated. I thought there would be more people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716carolynb
20,"Dirty,unimpressive","Although i had been warned not to have high hopes Hollywood is very disappointing. It is dirty,full of people bothering tourists and I didnt feel very safe my entire time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eoinp158
10,Don't go to Hollywood!,"If you are expecting glitz and glam when visiting Hollywood - you are in for a shock. The state and amount of homeless people is heartbreaking. The obvious presence of urine - crossing footpaths from store fronts over the stars is disgusting. So you can imagine the smell in the heat of the day. My advice to first time visitors is to drive through Hollywood and don't get out. Its a tired, dirty, has been place that needs more than a prayer and a miracle to get back on its glamourous feet. Lots of customer service people struck up conversations with us (we were obvious foreigners) and all of them suggested other places we should have gone to and steered clear of Hollywood.On a bright note - the experience made me extremely grateful for everything I have. If you need a realisation of this proportion or you have spoilt, lazy children that need a wake-up call - take them here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diem6
40,Fun Time,"Great to see all the stars but it was a bit run down...didn't seem as ""star like"" as I had pictured it in my head. However, a must see if you are in the area and up for doing touristy things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieTigers

30,Short drive,I drove through this part and then came walk and walked through it. It is a nice experience and cool to see the walk of fame and you can see the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/699MichelH
20,The idea of Hollywood is nice,"Hollywood at night is a bit like Will Smith's movie I Am Legend, make sure you're inside before dark coz the creepy & weird ones come out. So glad we didn't have children with us this trip when we stayed off Hollywood Blvd. It's dirty. The idea of the glitz of Hollywood is great through the day. But if you're celebrity spotting, you're not going to find them here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieBaltazar
50,Nice walk,"This is a great place to just visit and amble along looking at the shops and sights/attractions. There are plenty of places to visit, shop and eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hebe_7
50,Like everything related to Hollywood- bit overrated,"Basically you are walking throu a boulevard with some shops and some theather.More than that ,is just a common street.Full with people in customes trying to get a tip for a picture with u.Suggestion: lots of water, comfy shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorisG1
40,The heart of downtown LA.,"Most great cities have pairs of iconic landmark streets. New York has 5th Avenue and Broadway, London has Oxford Street and Regent Street and Los Angeles has Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip.Full of characters and filled with lookalikes of superheroes and movie stars old and new (and a Marilyn Monroe - or two) the street outside the Chinese Theatre is an entertainment in itself. And as home to the Oscar ceremony, maybe we can also dream of stardom?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837derekw
30,Not so 'Hollywood',"My husband & I were in Hollywood just recently and whilst it was one of the places I was most looking forward to on our US trip, I was, rather sadly, and not to be a downer, a little disappointed, as I expected a lot more Glamour from Hollywood, the place where movies are 'set', filmed and celebrated! By all means, if you've never been to L.A before (as I had not), go check it out for yourself - you may love it, in fact, I hope you do! Hopefully you even get to see a real celebrity (unfortunately we didn't).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33katev
40,Fun Place to walk around,"This is one of the iconic location in Hollywood, you will find many tourists almost all the time. Specially at night, you will love the environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faisal021187
40,A classic must for out of towners,"It is what it is .. if you're visiting L.A. for the first time..it is the classic Hollywood stop. Park underground at Hollywood and Highland. You can street park but it so hard and frustrating it's not worth it. Buy or eat something at the mall above the parking lot and get validation. The wax museum was better than I expected. Ripley was less than I expected. If you have kids, Ripley s requires a lot of reading to understand what you are looking at. For you Easteners, Greco's Pizza, across from the mall and Ripley s, is one of your best choices in Pizza in the area. Souvenirs can be found for less elsewhere, but you have an exceptional variety here. If you take a picture with a street character, expect to pay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisaj_12
30,Not as I hoped,Having grown up watching all the stars have their names printed on the walk of fame I was let down a little by this place.It is a tourist trap where crowds congregate to get photos with people in costume.Having said that there is some nice restaurants and bars along here and the highlights are The Dolby Theatre and Looking for your favourite stars name.A little underwhelming and hard to believe what this once was and that The Oscars ceremony is held on this Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruud1
20,Did not meet expectations,"Expected more activity to be bustling here but on arrival, i didn't realise I was finally there until the cab driver told us so. What I experienced was a very much watered-down version of what it is usually portrayed. The place didn't feel very clean, safe, nor ""world-class"" for a tourist attraction site.Thought it was overrated. Not a must-do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrea2359
40,"Fun ""tourist"" activity","VERY crowded, but it is fun to walk around looking at the different stars on the sidewalk, visit all of the tourist shops and see all of the characters dressed up. Not as many restaurants near the main area as I was expecting, but you can get a pizza or hot dog easily. I think this is a better activity for a group of friends or couples vs a family with younger children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629brookeb
30,A must do BUT,"If you are in LA for the first time it is a must do, if only to spot the 'star' of your favorite artist. We had not been for many years and were horrified at how ordinary and tacky it had all become, though we did enjoy looking for our favorites, we probably won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrB876
10,There is no Hollywood Boulevard left.,"Over the past many years this street has been gutted of all life. There are very few places to go. Most buildings are new and very ugly. Hollywood Boulevard is now a case study in what happens when the ""real estate"" is considered so ""valuable"" that what everyone went after has been destroyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AquavistaNoHo
40,"So typical that it is a must, but lower your expectations","The Hollywood Boulevard, with all its stars, is a typical place for tourism in Hollywood. If you want to walk it completely save some time a it is pretty large and it goes also on some of the nearby streets. You may want to locate a particular star; there are websites and guides for that. Two interesting items I found beyond normal stars: the moon, dedicated to the landing on the moon (there is one at each corner or Hollywood Boulevard and Vine St). And there is also a Zoltar machine somewhere in the street (if you are a Big fan). In the streets you will find many shops and restaurants and a lot of peculiar people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek

30,A must see only because you are in Hollywood,"Hollywood blvd looks great on TV and Film, but when you actually get there, many are disappointed by the dirty street, busy traffic, hustlers, and the lack of elegant stores and classy restaurants. However, I recommend you go and see the walk of fame, take a few pictures in front of the Michael Jackson or some other famous artist's star. It's always a good photo spot. If you need to buy souvenirs, there's plenty of gift shops. Expect to see homeless people and weirdos. But the place is safe. Street performers are fun to see. And lots of people in costumes for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank

30,Disappointing,"I suppose I expected too much with all the hype and the constant TV/film exposure; I was not wowed by the place. I did not realise that I was on the boulevard until told by my tour guide. The boulevard is just a normal street with souvenir shops, cheap clothing outlets and restaurants. The Oscars theatre (Dolby) is accessed through an (upmarket) shopping mall which, like the street, has to close around the time of the Oscars ceremony and the shop fronts hidden. The walk of fame names are quite interesting as are the names in front of the Chinese Theatre. 90 minutes should do it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cosy504022

Good to take the family but try and go during the week when the crowd is undoubtedly less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mws2145
10,Glitz and glamour? Not.,"Even in one's most modest opinion, it's hard to say anything good about Hollywood Boulevard. There is hardly anything glitzy or glamorous here. The place is a dump. We are talking a pretty dirty street congested with traffic lined with tacky souvenir stores and smoke shops. There isn't even a nice boutique or restaurant in sight. It gets worse by night. The homeless and drunks line the pavements of the street and hustlers everywhere. I didn't feel all that safe walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaysonc166

20,Over rated location,"Definitely was not a fan of Hollywood boulevard. It's full of homeless people, and people spruiking their crap music. If they try to give you a CD, turn them down as they just want money. It's dirty too and the only thing to see is the walk of fame which you can do in 30min. After that, there's a few shops to see but really you can see them anywhere else. Don't waste your time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belweckert
30,Still fun just not what some expect,"If you find this helpful please click helpful below.For tourists:You may think of hollywood at glamorous and you precise idea of California, rich and famous and movies. This boulevard probably epitomizes that idea further.Well you'll be disappointed then.Go with an open mind, you can see the walk of fame, very cool, the theatre where all the stars go for red carpet premiers, and a few gift shops.You will likely find it equally dirty, a little run down, lots of beggars and homeless. Harassing characters. Just be safe, keep your distance and go for those three main reasons. There is paid parking behind the theatre, best option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripking07
30,"Let's face it, all tourists will come here","I'd heard that the boulevard was seedy and run down. It is slightly that but not unsafe. There are lots of homeless people here, but there did not present a problem. They keep to themselves. There are people trying to get you to buy things along here, so don't make eye contact with them or do not accept anything they try to put into your hands. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is interesting. Just across the road from the historic Roosevelt Hotel is the Chinese Theater with the very famous foot and hand prints of the world renowned stars. Just a bit further up the boulevard is the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Mall. Inside there is the Kodak Theater (think its now called the Dolby Theater) where the Academy Awards are held each year. You can walk up the red carpet stairs to the theater entry if you go inside the shopping mall. This is all within walking distance if you use the Roosevelt as your starting point. Also La La Land is along this section of the boulevard and is a one stop shop if you are looking for decent quality souvenirs. There is also a pharmacist/chemist as well about 20 meters from the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,Tourist must,"If you never been, it's a must at least once in life. Just to say you've been. It was a nice stroll when I went during spring, it wasn't too crowded. Walking on Hollywood Blvd feels pretty neat because you know numerous movies and celebrities had walked the same path you are on. There's plenty to see from shops, souvenirs, and museums. They have different attractions for visitors who want to experience more like the bus tours, which I didn't do.I do have to put out some disclaimer because it's not all peaches and hassle free. Do watch your kids because when it is busy and crowded...you will lose them easy! There are people trying to sell things on the streets that will get annoying very quick. Homeless on the streets that will ask for money as well, don't expect the clean, glamorous Hollywood we see on TV.If you're planning on taking pictures of celebrity's stars, be patience because sometimes there's crowds either standing or walking on them.Overall, I think it was a pretty cool experience but do try to map out when you visit so you can make the most of your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samantha8307

The stars on the pavement are OK, as are the signatures outside the Chinese Theatre, and you can see the Hollywood sign from here. That's it. The rest is cheap tat, hustling, some rather frightening people, crowds and crowds of people. Hot, stuffy, smelly. You are approached from every angle by people who are wanting something. it is exhausting. Go for 10 minutes, so you can say you've been - if you have to. Then move on and go somewhere nice. You can drive round various places - Rodeo Drive etc., but the traffic is horrendous. I would have happily skipped LA altogether and spent a day somewhere else on our road trip. I felt genuinely scarred here - nowhere else in the US has made me feel like that, and I have visited various places over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaK985

There is a urban mall to enjoy in the Loew's Hotel complex along with many eateries to satisfy your pallet. The is also the place to come to if you want to take a bus tour of the area.There is a stop for the Red Line Metro Subway right there to whisk you away to other areas of the city.Cons: There are many street people who are hawking their wares.

50,Safe Place for Kids,"This is the 2nd time my family has visited Hollywood Blvd, in fact we have a hotel room within walking distance of main area. There's about 3 block area around the famous Chinese Theatre which is the heart of the action. Very lively with street performers, tour buses, and lots of tourists. There's also a large outdoor mall area with lots of shopping and nice restaurants (with paid parking), so in my opinion the place is safe and clean in this area. There's also the famous El Capitan Theatre across the street showing the latest Disney movie and a Geherdelli Chocolate Ice Cream shop right next door. The entire place is lit up at night with lights, and if you're lucky you might see a movie star at a movie premiere at the Chinese Theatre. So in all, this 3 block stretch of Hollywood Blvd is quite safe and clean and worth a visit if you're interested in Hollywood attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cohoman
30,A must-do if you're a movie fan but a little disappointing...,"So as first time USA travellers and movie lovers (especially Pretty Woman!) we thought a trip to Hollywood Boulevard was a must. We got a bit of a buzz from reading the stars on the sidewalk as we walked down the Boulevard and taking a few snaps of some landmarks. The Chinese Theatre was a nice stop but very crowded. (BTW, it was so very hard to find a bathroom unless you were eating somewhere, we'd recommend going to the candy shop if you're in need) All in all, if you start your walk a few blocks out it was pretty dirty and smelly and it was sad to see so many homeless people around as well, but if you can see past this stuff then it deserves a quick stop in your LA trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappySStravellers
40,It's interesting but annoying,It's a fun spot to walk through. The constant peddlers definitely get on your nerves. You just have to keep walking if you don't wish to bothered. It's good to do for vacation. It's part of the whole Hollywood experience. The kids loved looking for stars or handprints. It's not an all day event but fun for a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pepmo17

10,Not at all like when I was a kid !,"Nighttime is the worst it brings out people who are urinating in darkened doorways, day time should be your only visit and walking if you want to see it. AVOID at all costs nighttime unless you use valet service at the restaurants. Its work famous but that attracts the ugliness of this society and its like visiting a human zoo, especially at night.

She’s from Harbin, China, 13 million people and we live in Beijing, 30 million people, omg! We came to America to get married by church and stopped in my hometown of Riverside. She thought Riverside was representative of America. It kind of actually is and LA isn’t but she has seen all the movies and wanted badly to see Hollywood. That was our first stop and she loved it. The Walk of Fame was her dream and we did that first. So much to do and so much to see. It was exciting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

But that is just all :/ One night, ok, but don't waste more time in LA.

30,See it only to say you saw it.,"It's really just one of those types of places you only need to spend a few hours in to see the main points and then leave. Seeing the stars on the walk of fame is cool. It's not just a block like most people think though, it's a really long stretch of stars. No practical way to really see them all.The Chinese theater with all the hand prints and foot prints is nice to see. Other than that, it's a dirty and grimy place. There are homeless people every few feet as well as other wackos out there trying to get in your face. It's not a good atmosphere to be in nor does it feel very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morganc689

We're talking about that area around the Chinese Theatre when movie star seekers come. It's crowded and dirty, lots of people will try to hustle you. OTOH, just inside a doorway here and there are really nice places. See the Hollywood Roosevelt or take in a film at Disney's showcase El Capitan theater.

It is very busy and there a so many people trying to sell you things or take pictures with you and someone dressed up... They act like it is free but after you take the photo they expect some sort of payment. I did not get sucked into this but I saw many other people who did. There are a lot of homeless people around but I guess that happens everywhere... It is also hard to find the stars that you are looking for as there are soooo many. You could spend hours there just looking for one star. It was the greatest experience but just kind of one you have to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tynnielle

Over the past few years it seems to have been revived as a pretty decent tourist attraction. You'll have to park at a meter or find a spot in a lot. There are still a lot of homeless people that can't be overlooked. There's also pressure to have your picture taken (for a cost) with pseudo mascots and so forth. I have visited this area with friends and by myself many times.

The walk of fame area is located at the corner of Hollywood and Highland. There is a new shopping/entertainment complex built there. There is also many shops and restaurants along the street. If you drive the boulevard you'll see everything from locally owned shops and restaurants, chain restaurants and residential areas.

Don't go down any side streets as there are lots of homeless and beggers. Don't accept any ""Free"" CDs or pose for any photos with characters as nothing is free.

So we went to our hotel, changed clothes, got there 45 minutes early, were kept waiting 90 minutes on the street and ended up being the final two they let in, with half the audience in front of us dressed like slobs. So that was both irritating and stressful. Once in, it was a fun show to watch live, but be prepared for much uncertainty of getting in unless you get there very early, ticket or no ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGPete

Go very early in order to get picture a stars on boulevard before there are so many people it becomes impossible. Many hawkers along both sides selling tours of the area/famous homes, once again beware as from what i have been told these days you can't get close to many if any star homes as they are in gated communities.

The multitude of dining options was great as well, as was the subway station nearby which gave us easy and cost effective access to Staples Centre and Universal Studios.Cons - the area is somewhat dirty and trashy, lots of homeless people to step over on the way to breakfast, lots of peddlers pushing CDs, DVDs, photos, tours, etc. This we were definitely unprepared for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RadekD75

My understanding was true to life. There are tour groups everywhere and panhandlers and all manner of interesting people. If you understand this going in it can make for a better experience.I went to a couple shops along the boulevard and looked at a bunch of the Stars. That is what most people will visit for. Unfortunately JImmy Kimmel was not filming the day I was there but this is another fun thing you can do. I would recommend spending 2 hours or less along here unless you are really into the Walk of Fame or want to shop you might spend more time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldgiraffe
10,Way below what we expected,"We were expecting much more; No sign of Hollywood glamor, not a single street performance when we visited, and filled with the homeless and crazy people. In the total of 45 minutes we spent there, we were stopped at least 10 times to take bus tours. We regretted the time we spent to go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13alirezan
50,The best & worse of the US all in one spot.,"Hollywood Boulevard is an eclectic mix of characters.....you'll see everything from homeless people, superheroes, people trying to get you onto tour buses, right through to Hollywood celebrities. If you time your visit right you might see the unveiling of another star on the Walk of Fame or a premiere at the Chinese Theatre. Take the good with the bad and enjoy the magic that is still there and has attracted people for generations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mafman74
30,Must visit but too touristy,"Hollywwod Boulevard is a place ho have to visit of course. I can't imagine to visit LA and don't see Walk of Fame, Dolby Theatre, Chinese theatre, or even donť see the Hollywood sign of course.On the other hand this area is a extremely touristy with many ""crazy"" shops and generally it is crowded place. As I mentioned it worth visiting place but it is not uaaaahh place..BTW, the best parking here is the Hollywood & Highland shopping centre, great location and very good price - recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielJanecek
50,Tourist cannot miss,"No one can miss to see Hollywood Blvd. Very busy street similar as Oxford Street, a lot of cheap cafe also very expensive one. Loads of characters Actors invited you to have photos but please prepare tips. Good fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayT33

50,Loved it!,"Wow, this place is crazy. And loud. And busy. But we loved it! It has such an exciting atmosphere about it! I especially loved looking at the famous handprints.There's also a great spot at the Hollywood shopping centre to take a photo of the iconic Hollywood sign too. Just fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joshane615
20,Not what you see in the movies.,"I was slightly disappointed in my first experience of Hollywood Boulevard. We went for dinner on a saturday night, which I am guessing is probably the busiest time to visit. It felt unsafe and we felt like outsiders not fitting into the Hollywood American cliche.I did however manage to go the next morning to have a walk on the boulevard which was by far much much better!If your into clubbing and seriously loud music, go on a saturday night, if you want to see the sites and experience it on a more relaxed level, during the day is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChelseaHopeW
40,Great Place to visit,"Hollywood Boulevard is really great place to visit. What makes it special is the fact that there are so many great shops and museums and landmarks that you can visit. This includes Ripley's believe it or not, TLC Chinese theatre, Dolby Theatre, views of the Hollywood sign, Ghirardelli, and of course the Disney Store. The only the only thing I have to add is that you should be careful with your belongings and always check your surroundings. Definitely a great place to visit your first day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/le0l0vest0travel
50,LA Hollywood Boulevard,"If you want to see Hollywood you must take a walk on Hollywood Boulevard. The shops, the tourist, the locals, the homeless. . . . etc. . .. . The street performers and the street vendors are on every block. We enjoyed visiting all the tourist stops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjwright
30,Tourist trap. Worth a quick visit.,"We spent. Total of 45 minutes here. It's swarming with tourists and there really isn't much to do at all!!Don't get me wrong, seeing the stars and the theatres was fun, but that's it.We moved on pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamadrag0n
30,Busy,Very busy road so keep your whits about you. traffic does its own thing here and so do the people. best to have ruff idea of where you want to go and get your bearing quick. but it is an amazing place to see and visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zerhara
30,It's Hollywood!,You should experience this garish and noisy thoroughfare for some of the most eccentric souls LA can thrust up. EVery nite is Halloween. For best results - enjoy it don't judge it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4masei5
40,As Unique as it can be!,"This was by far one of the highlights of our trip in Los Angeles this past week. The Boulevard is one of the most famous ones in all of United States and it showed while we were walking around it. There are so many characters all over though some of them get very creepy and are just looking to make a buck or two from every tourists out there. That being said, it is a very cool place to walk around and just people watch for a few hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
40,Worth The Visit,Enjoyable area to walk round and explore with plenty to look at and see. You can take a open top bus around the surrounding points of interest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghotchkies
20,"Crowded, noisy, dirty... ugh.","Ugh. Hollywood Boulevard is mostly just Asian tourists and sad/creepy knock-off characters. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime thing, in that I never need to go back there in my life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wisechel
40,Great place to visit,"The locations and attractions are great. Just like you see on television and in the movies. The people are mostly good and not too aggressive. When they close the street down for an event and block off the view of the event so no one can see it, it gets a little crammed and I don't recommend walking down the street during these times. Always stay aware of who is around you and where your valuables are. I could notice some people looking around and somewhat casing open purses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricR4444
20,Touristic trap,Many people probably expect much more from the mythical boulevard than it is actually is. The vast majority of the Los Angeles habitants never go there. Only tourists do.This is a very artificial destination. It is really not worth spending any more than 5 minutes there!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sipivu
20,Just spend 15 min,You are in Los Angeles so you need to pass here. But it is a tourist trap with a lot of crappy shops.Parkings available for 10 a 15 usd if you drive around and search,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398yannickb
40,nice day out,We didnt actually do any shopping here but it was great fun just taking in the sights the shop fronts them selves are great. we did this as part of a tour we saw the hotel and building where pretty woman was film and loads more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonC621
10,"Dont visit, full of imploite wanna be actors dressed as famous people","Do not waste your time visiting Hollywood boulevard, the stars on the road are just that, stars put in with peoples names on.The road is littered with wanna be actors dressed as famous people, they smile and be polite and ask if you want a photo and then demand money.There have also been cases of these people stealing from tourist, this road is a scammers paradise. Not worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamkidd
40,Good Time,I liked all the entertainment on the sidewalk and shops. Lots of places to eat and lots of tour buses available. Very crowded and busy. Lots to look at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277brittanyr
30,Hollywood Boulevard,"We were there 8/21/2014 and we wanted to see Grahman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We parked at the mall on Hollywood Boulevard and window shopped. Then we went out onto Hollywood Boulevard to Limited Express store so I could buy a summer dress. Hollywood Boulevard was busy with pedestrians and tourists. There were many people dressed in costumes offering for you to take your picture with them for a fee. I was happy to see Robin William's star on the Walk of Fame and the stuff people put near his star. It was very crowded and it was difficult to get to the ""Star's"" hand prints, footprints and the Star's with ""Star' names"". The City of Hollywood should move the Hollywood Stars' stars to another location similar to a Museum where they can be viewed by everyone instead of viewed by walking on them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749robinr
30,A lot going on,"There's a lot going on in Hollywood boulevard, hard to walk down without being stopped a few times but there's also a lot to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeganH71
30,Jimmy Kimmel Live,"I have visited Hollywood Boulevard several times. Things have certainly improved in the last decade. It is one of those places that everyone should visit once, with Graurman's Chinese Theatre being the highlight. The only reason we visited this area on this trip was to see Jimmy Kimmel Live. It might not be on someone's to do list if it's your first visit to Hollywood because it does take about four hours of your time. We found everyone at the show to be extremely professional, they keep you entertained while waiting, we found it to be an excellent experience and would definitely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmercase
20,Disappointing,"So obviously we were keen to do the obligatory stop in LA at Hollywood boulevard see the stars and Chinese theatre but were actually quite disappointed on arrival. Yes we saw the stars yes we saw the theatre but it all just seemed a bit grubby and the area not to nice, not quite the Hollywood glam we were expecting.Plus point it was nice to see many different films and people/characters represented here not just the usual well known candidates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairef162
50,Do not miss this Blvd,Is a nice Blvd for walking around and do some shopping.You even can see some actors and actresses walking all around or giving a speech for getting their star on the walking fame.You can also be part on a film if you are lucky to be there in the right time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antoniofP5385ZC
50,Experience Hollywood,"Our boys wanted to walk down Hollywood Boulevard and see the flash cars and the expensive shops. It was a nostalgic experience identifying all the stops from movie ""Pretty Woman"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624karenr
50,That will do it,"Not sure what guide took me to the shopping mall there, but that is the solution if you want to get a picture of the Hollywood sign and combine it with the walk of fame. Everything in one spot and fair parking as well that will get even cheaper if you buy something in one of the many shops. I am sure you will find the need to get a cup of coffee or something. Most confusion shopping ever, but all cool with direct view to the Hollywood sign. Great work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NIKE10TD
40,Best place to Kill time in Hollywood,A good place to roam around especially if you are alone....Hard Rock Cafe is one of the best joints to eat drink and hang out..Lot of shops to pick souvenirs....overall a must visit if you are in LA or surroundings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shilparajesh
40,Something to do once,"Strolled both sides from intersection of Argyle at the city end to orange Drive at the other. Something for all here with all types of humanity on display: the good, the bad and the ugly. The predominant feature of the boulevard is the el cheapo shops selling t-shirts (mostly 3 for $9.99) - been there done that on a trip years ago so best avoided for me. But plenty to look at with Madame Tausauds and Roosevelt Hotel at one end and Capitol Records at the other.For me I got my souvenirs from the Pressed Penny machines (see photos) where there were half a dozen places with machines and a nice selection.Something you must do at least once...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
40,Bucket List check off,"This is a very busy area of Hollywood, as expected. It was nice to visit, but all of those morons shoving tapes and cards and CD's in your face is annoying! It was a neat experience, but difficult to enjoy for all the distractions. Nice visit, but check this one off the bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellejoycreek
20,"Run down, depressing and a bit seedy","Very much faded glory, and a long time faded. Apart from the walk of fame this is a run down area full of seedy tattoo shops and smoke shops. The only place I felt a little uncomfortable.Unless you are desperate to see the walk of fame then nothing here for anyone other than loonies and druggies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michael186311
50,Jimmy Kimmel Live!!!!,"this is well worth the time investment! If you are in town, the tickets are free! Jimmy Kimmel takes such good care of his fans and appreciates and respects your time! We got in line around 230 for general admission, were in the studio by 430, taping lasted until 630. The wait went by so fast because you have the entertainment of Hollywood boulevard to watch!. The studio audience is appx 200 people and his staff checks on you often and keeps you updated. Jimmy interacts with the audience during commercials and the atmosphere is so fun! Must do if you are in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ216
30,Better to walk through while you're going somewhere else,"I was on my way to Citywalk and decided to walk through Hollywood Boulevard just to see what was there as well as the Walk of Fame. It was slightly interesting to see who has a star on the sidewalk but that really is it. Whilst I want to respect other people's beliefs, avoid walking past the Scientology building. They unfortunately got the best of my curiosity and I ended up wasting an hour (I don't know, it felt like an hour) bored out of my mind. In the end I got up before I finished the ridiculous test they gave me although it wasn't for a lack of trying on their behalf to get me to stay. Whilst I was waiting for a bus it was interesting to see some locals rapping and dancing to music on the sidewalk however other than that and the stars, you won't be missing much if you don't see Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/king776
20,If its your sort of thing...,"I was underwhelmed by Hollywood Boulevard. I did get a good picture of the Hollywood sign, and visited an enormous souvenir shop, but I was ready to go in 45 minutes. Tourists are everywhere and local street performers and ""tour guides"" were downright rude about getting in your face. Even the restaurants were mostly chains... I can't imagine trying to drive and park to get there; I took the bus and the train. I won't be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerMama2010
30,"Good to see, but tired & run-down appearance","If you've ever liked the movies, the star walk on Hollywood Boulevard is a must-see. Sadly, I found it looking very tired and run-down, but that didn't detract from the experience of seeing the stars for Stars that I recocnised from the past 60+ years of movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicholasBRoberts
20,"Worth the 30 minute stop, not much more.","See the stars on the sidewalk, freaks walking along, silly characters in sad costumes. Area is filthy, not gritty. It's fun to see the things you expect from TV, but expect smells and sights of 70s Times Square.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlyaV
30,Very over rated!,"Some of the streets reminded me of Double Bay in Sydney, nothing to write home about. Worth going on one of the sightseeing buses just to see what it's like. Don't expect it to be glitz and glamour. Very dirty section and some nice sections. Homeless people is rampant all over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186donnam
10,Just not the glamour you expect,"Middle of Hollywood so expecting glitz and glamour. Instead dirty, sleazy.Tramps in door ways, hawkers everywhere. The people trying to sell you a bus tour of the star's homes are every few yards and once they start their ""patter"" there's just no stopping them. If you have to come skip straight to the Chinese theatre, find your film stars name and then leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillh333
20,"slightly seedy, not glamorous","I was expecting a really cool experience seeing the iconic hollywood sights, but it was just sort of depressing. Reminded me of an old times square. Couldn't see the starts because of people pushing around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVH1014
40,Overall Good but street hawkers irritating and pushy,"The sites and scene in Hollywood are chaotic and busy enough without the disc hawkers and super heroes looking to take a few bucks off you. I really enjoyed the theaters, restaurants and Hollywood buzz other than this element. I was there for the TCM Film Festival. Hollywood is an experience I was glad to have once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyAW1234
20,Massively Huge Disappointment,"After almost a lifetime of imagining the glamour of Hollywood and all it entails and finally going there and seeing it all for myself, never in my life have I been as disappointed in something, as I was about Hollywood. It's London at it's very tackiest best .. but a lot worse .. Stepped out of the taxi and straight away was bombarded with people trying too peddle you tickets to see this and that .. Sometimes a no thanks was not enough .. and stronger words were needed.. Full of little tacky shops selling plastic oscars, and sitting on top of the Chinese Theatre eating a 13 dollar chinese takeaway was never, what I dreamed Hollywood to be like. The Highlight of this trip was getting a taxi up the hill to have our photo taken with the Hollywood sign... If your expecting glitz and glamour ... you will be very disappointed ...Horrible and seedy and needless too say... I won't be returning there.. ever",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliedenyer
10,First time giving something one star,What can I say it was probally a really nice place in its time. The stores were dirty and run down. Their are bums everywhere drinking and carrying on. Their is a nicer part past the chineese theater but I would say this was a one time visit to this street and I probally won't return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicae358
40,Great place to walk all by yourself,We stopped by Hollywood Boulevard to see all the attractions the city has.The area was a good walk and it had everything from branded showrooms to restaurants to Chinese theatre and madam tussads.The place was full of crowds and it was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riddhi26
50,Where's Elvis ?,If you looking for Elvis you came the right place.But his star is not where it's advertised. There are literally thousands of stars here and I'm ashamed to say I walked with my head down most of the time reading them. There are other great things to look at like chinese theatre and Kodak theatre etc.Loads shops and souvenirs to buy and plenty people to entice you on a tour.Elvis star by the way is on corner of Hollywood and La Brea along with the Beatles and by a silver canopy . They need a bit of a clean really but for an avid fan a must see .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellebeehome
20,Over rated pavement,"We were on our U.S. Road trip and felt we had to include LA/Hollywood. So we rocked up to the walk of fame and walked and walked - it's way longer than I imagined, which means it's populated with a load of people I had never heard of. The hand prints at the Chinese theatre are much cooler in my opinion.The boulevard itself is a hang out for various life forms and it was the only place on our entire trip I didn't feel particularly safe as the sun went down - particularly with kids in our party.I've been, can say I've been and not bother going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curmudgeonabroad
40,Go to the very end of the street,At the very end of the street is the iconic Beatles and Elvis stars plus a statue. Many people don't make it that far so if you're a fan of those groups it's worth it to get a picture. We also enjoyed the hand/footprints in the cement at the Chinese theatre. It's fun to put your hands and feet in the imprints to compare size.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vancitytraveller1
30,Just another popular area,"Aside from the walk of fame, this street seems to have the same things as other popular streets around the USA. Souvenir shops, street performers, annoying peddlers, historic theatres, and plenty of the usual modern-day shops.Now that we've seen it, If we come back to Los Angeles we won't do Hollywood again. See it once if you have to, but don't worry if you miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeStrachan
30,"Hollywood Boulevard sounds glitzy, right?","Was easy to get to via the Metro however, I think if you are going to visit Hollywood Boulevard, it would best be done during the day! It waz surprizingly skeevy - my 15 y/o's description!"", and I had to agree!As this was a mother and son trip, and a major landmark, I really wanted for us to have experienced it! We arrived early evening (about 5:00 pm)...early enough to get pictures of TCL Chinese Theatre (where the hand/foot prints of many celebrities are embedded) as well as to walk and take pictures of the Walk of Fame before it got dark...and thank goodness for that!!It was very, very loud with different street performers vying for your attention, and well, money! Add to this an over abundance of folks in costume that you could take pictures with, for a fee of course! This in itself takes away from the ambience of the theatre and walk of fame....to the point my 15 y/o actually asked to leave because it was getting too sketchy.I am not saying don't do it because it is cool. Just plan to do this during the day to avoid more of the street performers etc!Hope this helps in planning your trip to Hollywood Boulevard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pair-of-Pelicans
20,"A dirty, seedy disappointment","We were expecting glitz and glamour... we didn't get it...If you stay in the Hollywood & Highland centre you'll be ok, thats clean, pretty and lovely but if you stray up or down the blvd you'll very, very quickly find dirty streets, seedy shops, homeless people and a near constant smell of stale urine.Basically if you go beyond the Chinese theatre or cross the road to the other side of Highland you're out of the ""nice"" part.Waiting in line at Starbucks with a homeless guy who wanted to use the restroom for a wash and whatever pretty much sums it up.the ""characters"" who dress up in dirty outfits and harass you for photos would be funny if they weren't tragic and annoying.its nice to visit for 30 minutes just to say you've been, and we're certainly glad we went, but other than that....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeightonAndTina

30,Just to say you've been,"Not exactly exciting but it is one of those places where you go to just to say you have been. It is quite tacky and dirty and heaving with tourists.

40,Hollywood schmaltz,"I am not sure what people expect when they come to Hollywood Boulevard, maybe they hope to bump into a wandering movie star.I have been coming here now for 20 years and apparently it was a seedier area when I first visited in the mid 1990s.Its a tourist haven and where tourists go there is an ancillary industry. Here you will find scientologists, people dressed up in costumes offering photo ops, entertainers, pick pockets. All life is here and its in the heart of Hollywood, what more do you want.Its manic at the weekends but we loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Brilliant evening,Spent the first evening walking up and down the boulevard....reading the names on the stars. ...great to see so many stars of screen and music that I grew up with...also not forgetting the kodak theatre and Chinese theartre. ...bar and restaurants are a joy to be in and reasonably priced....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180bhupinderb
10,Disgusting Disappointment,"I guess I was expecting something nostalgic with old movie stars and stars along the walk and some neat history. What we found was strip clubs, tattoo parlors that were surrounded by the strong pungent odor of urine, vomit and old beer! The place is filled with homeless and aggressive tour guides trying to take you on their Los Angeles Hollywood tours. To try and find a decent restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard was also nearly impossible. Maybe a once-in-a-lifetime thing to see, I would never return! Disappointing, disgusting dump. Los Angeles should be ashamed of themselves for keeping Hollywood Boulevard in this condition! New York City cleaned up their act maybe it's time from Los Angeles to do the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weissman22
20,Disappointing,"Of course, nice to be there and tick it in your traveller diary. But fairly disappointing - somehow taking after Las Vegas style, but it is not Vegas! Absurdly expensive parkings, and not easy to find a lot. Quite aggressive asistants in most of the shops. Expensive food and everything else.The best thing there was a Starbucks near Chinese theater. Good coffee really.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pawel411

30,Nothing fancy.,"Typical LA dirty streets, lots of homeless people begging. There are shops and a few places to eat along the boulevard nothing I would rush out to see again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodobir
10,Awful,"I am absolutely shocked by the state of Hollywood Boulevard, especially as I read online recently that LA has done a lot in recent years to clean up its streets! I have never seen so many homeless / beggars and of all the cities I have visited in the world I felt the most unsafe here. We parked on a side street and took a walk around. After about 10 minutes we returned to the car (to find the road had now been blocked at one end by police cars) and drove through the streets instead! We felt glad that we have no children as this was certainly not a place to take them to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashakins09
50,True Americana,"What can I say about the Boulevard but it is a true American street. Full of life, full of possibilities. The Dolby, El Capitan, Grauman's The Walk of Fame, and yes Hollywood and Vine, so divine. I love it all, it is my home, my passion, my love. Hollywood and Los Angeles is the most beautiful city in the world and I truly miss it when I am not there. It is the Heart of the Lion, it is the City of Angels, the number one contender for the title and Los Angeles has my heart. Run don't walk there you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericab838
50,Not as crowded as we thought it would be.,"While visiting friends in Rancho Cucamonga we decided to take the Metrolink and Metro into Las Angeles. While we were there we decided to go down to Hollywood Blvd to see the TCL Chinese Theater, the Walk of Fame and the Hollywood sign.When we arrived it wasn't as crowded and overwhelming as I thought it would be, but I am sure in the middle of the summer it gets much worse.We were glad we had gone even if just for the experience. We didn't get to see the entire Walk of Fame as that can take a long time.If you are in the area I recommend going to see the area even just once, for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkerstens
30,Once is enough,I came to Hollywood Boulevard and spent about two hours here and that was enough. It is pretty touristy but you have to see it at least once because you always hear about it. People will try and sell you tours up and down the street but if you kindly decline and move on its not too bad. I wouldnt spend an entire day here but I would come here for an hour or two and then go see some other attractions near by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,Visit Hollywood Boulevard Once - Look for Vintage Cars,"After many trips to LA for business and family, I realized we had not seen Hollywood Boulevard. The Hollywood Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre were worth the visit to this iconic little stretch of Hollywood. My husband reluctantly obliged and we went, but he wouldn't visit again. Most visitors probably would visit Hollywood Boulevard just once. It was clean, with many visitors and surprisingly many vintage cars. The only disappointment we had was finding a restaurant in this area at Highland and Hollywood Boulevard. Since we were on our way to the airport, we wanted to have lunch and settled on a pretzel - can't remember the name of these pretzels, but they are good and well-known. My only suggestion is to have lunch before you visit this area or buy a pretzel (easy to find on Hollywood Boulevard). Then you've been there and checked the box!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA

40,A must see - but go before dark!!,"We really had to go see the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame which are all located on Hollywood Boulevard. This street is bustling with tourist shops, restaurants and ""entertainers"" - the later it gets in the evening the stranger the ""entertainers"" get so I would recommend starting early and leaving before dark. We went two days in a row, but never stayed too much past dusk - Lots to see and do and from this street you can catch tons of Hollywood Tours and can negotiate your own price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734patp
20,Totally overrated,"Great work on the marketing as it is a massive tourist trap... The street was full of promoters and buskers asking for money and trying too hard to lure you into one of their attractions. I will have to admit, the detailing put into the buildings was phenomenal, just like they pulled it straight from the movie set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dzee091
50,great experience,"fun and enjoyment the whole experience just blows you away, photos with spiderman, cat woman etc are great fun for just a few dollars, great atmosphere and ambiance a must for any visitor to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4443FWdavidc
50,Is pretty fun walk in this place.,To much people fashion in every single place in this area of Los Angeles California.In my personal opinion I love to back all that I can this amazing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717erikal
20,Wouldn't go again.,"My partner and I decided to go and walk along the street because it seemed like the thing to do when in Hollywood. I must say though, it was a big let down and a massive tourist trap. I didn't even really look at the stars because I knew if I stopped I would be swamped with people trying to sell me something. I had quite a few men push their CDs and DVDs in my face which I found quite confronting and rude. Most of the people that were trying to sell the tours were quite polite when you told them no thanks. Too much hassle in my opinion. I can say I have done it, but I wouldn't go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcat90
20,Not that great,"Stepped out here while dining at Musso and Franks. Expected to see a nice street and area, but was disappointed. In my head I thought is would be more glamorous, but it was just like a cheesy tourist trap town. Walked about a block and went back to the restaurant for dessert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesil41
30,Fun Touristy thing to do,"It is great to see the walk of fame, and the attractions on this strip, however, it is also very touristy reminding me of part of Las Vegas, Times Square or Niagara Falls. Touristy souvenir shops abound - really no need to go into each one. Lots of people selling tours, etc on the street.I would go, look for my favourite stars, take a few pics, and then move on. This place is not glamourous, but a fun kitchy stop along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dconnau
30,Do it once,"So many people told us not to bother going but we did anyway. Really busy which you would expect, we enjoyed walking around but didn't spend too long doing so. I agree like most tourist spots someone is trying to sell you something. Not somewhere I would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cma411
50,Wanna be a star? Take a ticket and get in line!,"This is the heart and soul of Hollywood. Every body who wants to be a movie star usually starts here as a street entertainer or as a waiter or waitress. This place is in a world of its own, in fact it's on a different planet! The noise the people the smells, it is just full on head spinning entertainment! Check out the Viper Room, Eva Longoria's restaurant and the chicken shop where Brad Pitt got his first acting gig as a chicken! Just mind blowing! Shops, wow everywhere you turn there are shops. Oh if you get your pic taken with Thor or Wonder Woman or Michael Jackson don't be stingy, pay the person, they gotta make a living till their big break comes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephencball
30,A must See,"Even though many parts are run down it is still interesting to look at all the shops. It is a great place to people watch, because you will see all types of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013
30,Nothing special,Don't go out of your way to do this tourist attraction. We only walked through here for 30minutes because we were in the area and trying to kill time. The street hawkers were so annoying and pushy and theres not much to see. We did enjoy In-N-Out burger around the corner though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66ninat
20,Not Worth The Time! Simply Cross It Off Your Bucket List!,"Tourist expect so much from this attraction. But in reality except for a few decent restaurants; a few OK stores, there isn't much here. Many celebrity look-a-likes that are willing to the anything for you to get a photo taken with them, very cheesy gift shops (though you can find some good deals); a lot of bad restaurants that mainly target the tourists... It's a must in LA so go and see it; find the stars of some of your favorite celebrities and then leave. If you really wanna spend time here go as far as Hollywood and Vine. The urbanization and redevelopment of the area is as close to old Hollywood glamor as it gets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SedaEg
50,Jimmy Kimmel Taping,"The show tapes at 6840 Hollywood Blvd which is next to the El Captain theatre and across the street from Hollywood and Vine shopping center. I requested tickets in November for the last taping of 2014 on 12/18/14. Tickets said to arrive by 3:30 (but recommended 2pm).. we got there at 2:15 and already 4 people in line... so very glad we got there early as we got seated in the front row. Absolutely loved this experience... Everyone involved in the show , from security, 1iota team, band, MC and Jimmy you can tell they love working there... they were so nice to Everyone and appreciated you coming out to support the show. Since we were in line outside till 3:30 when they take you into the studio we got to talk to alot of people (made friends with others in line)... found out that most of the staff has been there since the beginning (esp the production staff) and the pride they take with their job shows.Now... they take the no one under 18 very seriously, as well as everyone needs identification... our daughter is 19 but her picture on her license is from when she was 16.. so that threw them at 1st. Once your tickets/id is checked you get a wristband... then you go thru security screening...bag check and metal detector.Then once inside you wait about 30 min more (depends on where you were in line since its more because they have to wait for everyone to get thru security) at that time they let about 10 people at a time go to the bathroom which is downstairs (more so there isn't a huge line out the bathroom).Then they start bringing everyone into the studio for seating... like I said we got in the front row which was awesome... once everyone is seated the MC starts getting the crowd warmed up and explaining what to expect... then out comes Jimmy... he was great, in between breaks he talked with the crowd, asked where people were from and genuinely talked with people (including us which was fabulous). Once taping is done they usually have some promo's to tape so you get to watch that... just so happened it was the ones for the 'golden sharpie award' that he gave out during the Oregon/Ohio State game.If there is a concert that night they take you out the back to the stage area which also has a small gift stand. We finished up about 7pm.They do suggest you park in the Hollywood/Vine shopping center lot, which they validate when you enter the studio... even with that we still paid the maximum 24 hr rate since we had come in to town early and stayed till like 9pm (ate dinner after the show in the shopping mall).Would definitely recommend attending the show!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elphie1162
30,"As expected, tick it off and move along","A must see in LA, but once is enough. The street 'entertainers' and sales people do become annoying pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel8062
30,overated and run down tourist trap,"If yo are short of time, do other things. Its full of cheasy gift shops and tour leaflet peddling guys all for tourists. The glitz of Hollywood left this street years ago.Do not bother inless deparate to see a bunch of stars in the pavement.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwW8207MG

30,good not great,the area is interesting a lot of activities and weird places there but it's not special or any thing but you can will enjoy it more if you have other people with,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWF82
20,Sleazy tourist trap,"Hollywood Boulevard really is nothing special. Overly crowded, not one decent shop, the name is the only attraction. Did have a good meal at Mel's Diner just off the boulevard though. You soon tire of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erwinp942
20,Worth it? Sort of.,"Its a very long road to walk up and apart from the Chinese Theatre and the Stars in the pavement a lot less interesting than I thought it might be. Mostly jammed with tourists and way less interesting than other places in LA. Go if you have to cross it off the bucket list and you have time to kill, otherwise you'll get a lot more bang for your time spent somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/healywp
10,Beware of people inserting themselves in your picture,WARNING! Beware of people dressed in costume and insert themselves in your picture without asking and then they make you pay each costume character $10. Make sure you don't get rip off. Tell them you don't want picture with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deeee33
40,Interesting,"Always crowded with mostly tourists. Enterprising ""sales"" people try to hand out flyers & cds. Add to that the many homeless people, and you'll have a very interesting mixed crowd intermingling along Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bargain
40,Get there early and find out where your stars are!,When in LA you have to go and see the stars on Hollywood boulevard :-)My advice would be to go early in the day and also if there are specific stats that you want to find check out the website so you know roughly where to look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikijayeff
20,Not all it's hyped up to be,The girls thought it would be fun to see the Hollywood stars so we looked up the best place to park and went to park near Hollywood and Highland. We were surrounded immediately after getting out of the car by people trying to get us to take a tour in nasty looking vehicles and were bugged by tour people every 50 feet or so the entire time we were on the street. We made the mistake of heading east instead of west which was more of the same and some very seedy shops that were not appropriate for children's eyes. The kids were so tired of being bugged by the tour people that we did not walk far and left early. Definitely do not recommend going anywhere east of Highland unless you are looking for a specific star. We have checked that experience off our list and will not waste the time again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenm993
50,Tourist only,I wouldn't want to live here but it's the thing to do while in Hollywood. Lively with full of action for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
20,Rough,"Visited Hollywood Boulevard as it's an attraction that is always mentioned on things-to-do-in-LA-lists. Arrived via the metro - which, is pretty grotty itself. As we came up the escalator onto Hollywood Boulevard we straight away noticed how rough it looked. The area was inundated with beggars and for about 100m we were followed by a suspected would-be mugger. Great if you don't mind the possibility of being mugged or ripped off by tourist fleecers. Skip Hollywood Boulevard and head to Rodeo Drive instead - much nicer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FNQ7
50,If you like human traffic......hell yeah!!,I loved it probably because i was a tourist like everyone but really all i wanted to do was take a picture over Ray Charles' star and eat at the Hardrock Cafe. Its not bad and the bus ride didnt hurt either. If you're all touristy....its definitely for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbieA673
10,awful bum swindler place,AWFUL. AWFUL. AWFUL. Bums in every 2 store.Colored guys hand over cd and then ALL colored surround to ask for a fee for the cd. Then they run away with your money.L.A. SUCKS!NOT WORTH THE TIME WASTED.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesbW2590VR
40,Great Experience,It a must place to see for a day but not for any longer. The locals call this Hollyfreak!!! Its easy to see why.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CigarBaconBill
40,History,"Ok, so further down the street away from the main road its a bit of a mess and mostly bums sitting on stars that don’t deserve that!But the stars still being taken care of are worth seeing, it is a piece of history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sianarealla
40,Great tourist attraction,Very touristy; lots of interesting people and things to do. We've been several times and always see something different. Lots of shopping options,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieM985
30,nothing special,"We believe that we are going to see great things at Hollywood blvd, but we were quite disappointing. It is maybe good for people who look for just crowd to go up and down but you cannot enjoy anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manthosm
20,Recommend visiting during daylight only!,"We ended up on Hollywood Boulevard as the starting and ending point for our scheduled tour of L.A. It was a totally different experience during the day versus night. There were plenty of locals and tourists during the day (morning). We didn't feel unsafe stopping to take pictures of the stars on the sidewalk. During the day, the tour operators and souvenir shops will drive you crazy trying to get you to stop and buy something. BUT.....At night, the atmosphere totally changes. Some stores are closed and their steps become filled with homeless people. We tried to walk up the sidewalk to take more pictures of the stars but actually started to feel unsafe. One homeless man would jump out and start shouting at people for taking pics of stars on the sidewalk. We were approached and asked for money. The worst thing was the rapper guys handing out ""free CDs"" with a smile on their faces....but if you took one, then they'd get intimidating looks on their faces and say you ""took their CD"" and owe $20. We watched this happen to several people. If the tourists tried to give the CD back, the guys would get very confrontational. Not a good environment.One other thing....there are several ""characters"" you can pose with (Mickey, Superman), but be careful cause they only do this for tips! I watched them also get confrontational if someone took a picture but didn't give them money. This street is not the place to walk after dark! It also becomes dirty and filled with litter. We decided very quickly to get to our rental car and get off the street.I'm glad we went so we can check it off the bucket list...but I cannot imagine ever wanting to go back. Don't allot too much of your time here! There are much better attractions to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
20,Meh,"It's just a street, and a none too attractive one at that. Congested. Seedy in places. No present day connection to ""Hollywood."" Source of much disappointment to tourists. See it if you must, but do not have high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,The walk of fame in daylight turns to walk of shame at night!,"The walk of fame in daylight turns to walk of shame at night, when the tourist strip turns into a seedy and dangerous venue. Its worth the visit in daylight, but not worth the risk at nite,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveParryHK
20,Dissapointing,I was really excited to be going to Hollywood. I'd come all the way from New Zealand and had been wanting to go to Hollywood for ages. I got there and I was disappointed. Tones of people advertising there stupid tour things. Stupid cheap souvenir shops. Also not even that clean. Noisy as street to. Only good things was seeing the stars on the walk of fame.I would not go there again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TourMichaelNZ
40,Driving the strip,"Just had to put the top down on the Camaro and act like a movie star,loved spotting the sights as we drove down the strip,L.A isn't our favourite but you just gotta do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den-rick71
30,Betrayed expectations,"I probably expected too much from Hollywood boulevard: it was the legend, the icon of LA for me. The first time I came there my expectations were betrayed! Most of the time it feels vulgar, cheap, noisy. There are a few places worth seeing, such as Chinese theater, and you would like to see stars on Walk of Fame. Hollywood and Highland center next to Chinese theater looks like a new blood to decaying Hollywood, but it is totally different blood. Hollywood boulevard is still a history, and worth visiting if you keep your expectations low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/588olege
20,"Bums, rappers and dirt.","Very disappointed by this pig with lipstick. Its just a regular street with some stars on the sidewalk, that are sometimes broken or dirty. Annoying rappers wanting you to buy their cds, every second shop sells souvenirs, every first is fast food or bar. Rather go to the nature, take a hike to griffith observatory and hollywood sign. Thats something!POSITIVES:Cheap grocery store right there in the middle (fresh & easy), good public transport so you can get away from this place. Thats all cant think of anything else (because there isnt)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78andrejt
20,Whhhaaat?,"Well, there is not anything special about this place. Expensive souvenirs, expensive bars and annoying people who want to give you CDs or take pics with you being dressed up as Mickey Mouse or so.Boring! Nice to say ""I was there"" but that's it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13Traveller07
20,"Walk of Fame good - Hollywood blvd ""not so much""",We enjoyed the Walk of Fame looking at the stars but the neighborhood glamour of a long forgotten era is in much need of a facelift. Lots of panhandlers and sellers on the street that became quite bothersome after awhile. Was definitely not the glitz we had expected. Will probably not go back the next time we visit LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagerB
40,Trip to remember,Hollywood boulevard it is a difference of day and night. What you see in the daylight hours is nothing like you will see at night. The place looks completly different at night. Either way day are night you will enjoy youself. Lots of shops to visit again some are not open at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricko212
40,Tacky but fun.,"Interesting to see, very busy but fun to see the stars hands and footprints. Spotting the ones you know is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colcall
20,I don't see the big deal??,"In its heyday this would have been the place to see. But it's about 50 years past it's used by date now. The tacky tourist people make the place uncomfortable. The Chinese Theatre and the walk of fame are interesting but there isn't much more to see. You are better spending your time around Beverley hills, Santa Monica and definitely LA Central. $25 was the best tour offered to us with Celeb homes drive by, beaches and Madame Tussauds, that might be worth it if your into that, although I cannot comment on the value for money you get with it.Each to their own, but honestly don't build your holiday around this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbies_trippin

50,Great place to hang out on a weekend,"Saturday evening - the time for the bold and beautiful to be out for a great weekend party.

50,To Walk Amongst The Stars is Truly Amazing,"We had seen Hollywood Boulevard many times previously on TV as it must be one of the most filmed and photographed places on earth. We honestly thought we would be under whelmed and unimpressed. But to actually be there walking along Hollywood Boulevard is a truly incredible experience. You do not have the time to do and see everything and there is so much going on. There is the El Capitan Theatre the pace of the Oscar’s. You can view the Hollywood Sign from here. There are many many shops, bars and restaurants of all types including the Hard Rock Cafe which is excellent. Just to walk along and read & photograph the myriad of Stars and get your photo taken with some of the many, many characters including Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson, Elvis (Yes he is still around) or even Shrek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5200USmichaelw

30,must see just to say you have been there,There are about 2 miles of stars. The only ones that have the hands and feet prints are right in front of the theater. Was disappointed that venders were standing on some of the old ones that I really wanted to see. Do go up on the 2snd floor at the mall and get a good picture of the Hollywood sign. There is parking close by behind the mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waco042

50,Fun Place to Go,"Hollywood Boulevard is a fun place to go if you plan it right. For me, some of the many things I like about Hollywood Boulevard are:1) Crepes at Hollywood and Highland Center - Good Brunch; Great Way to Start the Day; its also a good location to people watch.2) Movie at El Capitan Theater - There is first an organ recital; followed by a Disney Movie. Graet fun.3) If lucky enough, get some tickets to Jimmy Kimmel. One can get these tickets on line. It guarantees that one will see celebrities and a usually good music group.4) Do a bit of the touristy things - i.e. find two or three of the Hollywood Stars that one wants to remember this trip - once one has found a few, stop. Its NOT the key thing to do here but is fun.5) Drinks at the Roosevelt Hotel - Yes, they are pricey. But the court yard area bar or one of the other ones makes one feel like a celebrity for a bit.6) Then go see a movie at the Chinese Theater. This is NOT a place just to take a photo in the front. This is where the STARS go to see premiers and once settled in one's seat, its amazing to watch the movie. Its of high quality on a large screen.7) Then take in one of the hokey museums like Ripley's. or one of the others.Its a place that one does not just show up and say I am on Hollywood Boulevard. There are lots of great little places to find. There is good theater at the Pantages.and just seeing how large that parking lot is at Hollywood and Highland is amazing.Now, one will also see the Hollywood characters milling about. Those people dressed up...or perhaps, one will see one of those funny stunts from the Jimmy Kimmel show where he sends someone out to ask questions of passer bys to his studio.The KEY THING is to plan the time one is going to go there....and then one will find the charm of this distinctive and memorable Hollywood Boulevard.By the way the Hollywood and Highland area is a great place to see the Hollywood sign.And if you like bowling, go bowling at the bowling alley there.There is a lot to do on Hollywood Boulevard but one needs to plan it. Our favorite time is to also come for the Holiday Parade. That is amazing ....albeit a little touristy .....but fun.One can also take Metro to Hollywood Boulevard.We have gone several times and never get tired of this somewhat kitchy but interesting area of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,A long walk,This was fun to pass on the bus but it was a long walk from where we got off to the Chinese theatre which was at the other end. We had children with us and everyone was exhausted walking the whole way along. First few stars we interesting but then we got bored. Best to take a map of the ones you want to see and just head for those.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julesr_7
20,The real Hollywood? Could have given it a miss,"Took the family to see the famous Hollywood Boulevard. It's not changed in a nice way since I last visited about 10 years ago. It's quite an intimidating for a young family. The hawkers are quite aggressive in their manner. The claims of money going ""to the children"" don't quite wash. The only positive being the $5 shop next to the Chinese theatre. Presents done, Hollywood Boulevard, tick. No more thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteS1_12
10,"Seriously? Simply Awful, Except ... Read This!","What does anyone think when they imagine Hollywood Boulevard and the famous Walk of Fame? Glizty shops, famous handprints and actors names in stars on the pavements (sidewalk), the cool and glamorous, etc. NOT A BIT IN REALITY!After arriving at Hollywood Vine metro station - which is actually a lovely station and fools you into what is coming next - you step out into the open air and after spotting the first 'star name' on the floor, you look up and around you and cant believe where you have arrived or what you are seeing.The street seems to be where the dregs of LA are hanging out. It is dirty, there are homeless people, 'gangsta' types, people begging or wanting to sell you something, tacky shops, you name it. And apparently, it used to be worse. Even still, didn't feel safe.We walked up to the Chinese Theatre, where you see the hands and feet in the pavements, etc, and to be honest, you really only need to see this part (think it was at Hollywood Highland metro stop). Unless you are looking to buy 1) souvenirs - good shops for those or 2) how can i describe? outfits that are suitable for drag events, fancy dress or those who need to dress exotically up in the bedroom ... note, i am not against any of these, just pointing out the fact.PLUS POINTS - 1) you have seen it, tick/check. 2) Hollywood Vine metro station. 3) had the best chilli hot dog from a street vendor during the whole time we were in California.Hope you found this useful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy_Edit
20,Be Careful,"The street performers and homeless ruin the experience. I have been to many of cities where there are street performers but the rudeness and aggressiveness of the ones on Hollywood Boulevard ruins the experience.Go during the day. Don't get sucked in to taking something, taking a pictures, or staring at something. You will not only get harassed, if you a couple dollars they will harass you more.It could be a five star experience if the area did not make a visitor feel uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556peteb
20,Not what I'd expected,"I hadn't done any research in to Hollywood Boulevard before arriving, so I was expecting something proud, impressive and glamorous.It's not.It felt quite dirty and a little unsafe - there were so many people in a small area (near the handprints) with men in your face trying to get you to buy their CDs.There really is nothing there apart from the handprints (not as many as I'd imagined) and a Madame Tussauds.Parking was surprisingly cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lepetitmanoir
40,Do it if you haven't,"I concur with Chris on a lot of this. If you've been here a lot, you kind of just end up treating almost like any other place, but if it is your first time, go. If you're with kids, only go during the day. There are homeless people but they mostly leave you alone. The CD's that get handed to you are ""free"" with a ""donation."" The shirts are always $5 (never seen them for $10). The people in costume expect tips for the pictures you take with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeW45
30,Standard touristic place,"If you are in Hollywood, you will go there anyway. But it is simply touristic place, dirty street with homeless, drunk people.

It is part of the experience being harassed by gents wanting to give you CD's of their latest Hip Hop creation, photo's with guys in character suits & people wanting to sell you the best deals on Hollywood tours. It all adds to the melting pot of the tapestry of Hollywood. Take a walk in daytime & night time to enjoy the different moods of the street.

10,Tacky is the best rating for this area,"This was such a disappointment. The walk of fame was not the glittery, clean area I expected. It was a very dirty area.

30,"Good to see, but thats it.","I found it one of those things (L.A has a lot of them) where you have to go and see to tick off the list while visiting - like the sign for instance. But its not overly impressive and it lacks so much character its ridiculous, there is literally no atmosphere what so ever. I think this is down to the amount of people there now and the shops along Hollywood boulevard. Almost every shop is one of those terrible souvenir shops selling replicas of the Oscar awards and hundreds more pieces of tat.So yeh, in a nutshell - nothing wrong with this at all, nice to see, but don't go there with high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743bradb
50,Find your star !!,"THE HEART OF HOLLYWOOD!! Chinese theatre,Kodak red carpet!!Hard Rock Cafe,Walk of Fame!!!SO much to handle!! You can make your own star ,on the right of Kodak Theatre,right on the street ,a little photo studio,where you can create your own star with your own name.Don't miss it! is only 20$.Roosevelt hotel .Beverly hills rides on the micro open bass..Wax museum,Guinness record museum,street dancers -is all in one word-HOLLYWOOD!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/planetearthlover8
40,The walk,"Holywood boulevard was one of our targets in L.A. Parking is almost impossible, very hard to find empty lot. (Hint: go the the shopping mall 's underground garage next to the Chinese Theater) The crowd is walking very slowly on the pavement, everyone is seeking the names on the stars, very funny when collisions happen :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndorToth
40,Make a quick stop,"Definitely stop and check it out when visiting LA and seeing the sights. See the Chinese theater, the Roosevelt Hotel, El Capitan (see a taping of Jimmy Kimmel). Be ready to deal with crowds, but still worth a short visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmo1980
30,"Somewhere you have to see once, but that'll probably do!","Hollywood Boulevard is a must-visit place for most LA first timers, there's the Chinese Theatre, the Stars with actors' names, lots of (mediocre) street performers, etc - but other than that it's a bit of a seedy area with many, many tacky made-in-China souvenir shops and very little in the way of decent restaurants or other entertainment except some museums.After arriving by subway from Anaheim, we immediately encountered a fim crew who asked to interview our teenage daughter about mascara, for Fashion TV. So she scored a free mascara and also got to be on TV - all this happened within literally 2 minutes of arriving. So, of course, my daughter is like ""I don't know why everyone comes to Hollywood and finds it hard - I've been here 2 minuites & I'm already being filmed for TV!"". Hahaha!So, yes, it's somewhere everyone should see, but after you've BTDT, there's not much that wuld make you revisit, I don't think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
20,TACKY!,"We were so excited to see the famous Chinese Theater and the Walk of Fame...and that's really all you'll get here. It is SO crowded, and if you keep walking away from the theater, is SUPER sketchy. There's not much to do on Hollywood Blvd. No good places to eat and a couple of bars, but nothing enticing. What makes it even worse is the massive amounts of homeless people on and around the blvd. Awful. And I guess unless you have a map of where certain celebs' stars are, you may not be able to find it, as the stars go way down the blvd and into the sketchy parts. One good part about Hollywood Blvd is the Hollywood Museum not far from the Chinese Theater. Other than that, snap your pics and leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyJennyLo
20,Disappointing,"I went 23 years ago when I was a kid and I enjoyed it but last months return was disappointing. Very crowded, far to many D grade 'performers' that only seemed to appeal to Japanese and Korean tourists, only a few places to eat, little shade and other than that names on the footpath and outside the Chinese Theatre there is not much there. Our tour bus gave us 3 hours there but 30 minutes is all that we needed, we were happy to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennc904
30,Not what we expected,So we weren't expecting the Boulevard to be quite as run down as it was. It felt a bit seedy and we wouldn't have liked to be there too late into the evening. There was pleasant street acts on during the day and it was a bustling place to be but not somewhere I'd be when it gets too late,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2SarahR2
30,Very crowded but a must see.,"I'm glad I finally got to see Hollywood boulevard, it's a place every first timer to Los Angeles should check out. Lots of people in costumes, and cd hawkers adding to an already crowded area. It's not a waste of a trip though, plenty of stuff to see if you want to . And plenty of shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650scottm
40,Ck out the walk of fame,"Lots to do in this area and can be a fun full day. You can ck out your favorite actor's star on the blvd, the famous Chinese theater, lots of restaurants to choose from and people watch, shopping, the Dolby theater, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RN2GO925

30,Crowded and dirty,"It's a super busy street, with a lot souvenir shops, theaters and tourist attractions, I'm sure that on Oscar night is different, but on a regular day is just dirty and super loud. I was shocked when I strolled around this area, a lot of homeless people (I was harassed by one asking money, and then cursing me when I walked away). It felt unsafe. The silver lining is the candy store called Sweets, a nice store if you've sweet tooth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaWQ
30,No awards this time,"Hollywood Boulevard, where do you start? Yes, it's on the 'must see' list, so you have to see it. Okay, in summary, too many people, lots of impersonators, drab and dirty sidewalks, tacky shops, two theaters, and the most depressing Starbucks we have ever visited. And that, as they say, is that. Been there, forget the t-shirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmh826
20,Freak Show Central,"Hollywood. Most people have a mental image of Hollywood, or at least what they think Hollywood is like. Glitz, glamour, movie stars.Yet nothing could really be further from the truth.Hollywood Boulevard is a combination of souvenir shops, retail shops, wax museums, carnival sideshow, and huckster alley. Yes, there is history here, and yes – Hollywood is much, much cleaner now than it was a decade ago. But there’s still a lot of scum and villainy here – Mos Eisley has nothing on Hollywood and Vine.I bring this up because tourists come here expecting one thing, and often find themselves experiencing another. Aggressive panhandlers, sweaty, smelly costumed “characters”, con men, pickpockets – they’re all par for course.The day we visited we were cursed out by a beggar when we didn’t give him any money, had a pitchman get in my face and insist that we needed to go on his Hollywood sign tour, witnessed two drug transactions, and got chased down the street by a “Storm Trooper” who was ticked that I was snapping pictures but didn’t tip him. (I actually wasn’t photographing him – I was taking pictures of the buildings, and he and his Darth Vader buddy thought they were going to harass/intimidate me. It was only after I recommended that we go talk to the Hollywood police about his problems that he backed off.)Look – I get that Hollywood is supposed to be a fun place. But it’s not the G-rated, family experience like you’d find elsewhere. The Michael Jackson impersonator standing on the real Mike’s star on the Walk of Fame won’t pose for a picture unless you give him $5.00. The guy in the “Elmo” costume was sweaty, gross, and smelled like urine. God only knows which dumpster he pulled that costume out of. (And you’d really let your little kids go up and hug this guy?)I saw several other tourists harassed and verbally assaulted for trying to take pictures without paying for the rights first. Supposedly there are rules in place about this, but they certainly weren’t in play that day.Overall, Hollywood Boulevard can be an interesting place, if you can look past all of the 21st century junk and try to focus on a different era. But it still won’t be what you’ve always imagined it’d be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cidbliq
40,Crazy busy,"We saw Hollywood Boulevard both during the day and at night. Though it is neat to see it all lit up at night, we much preferred it during the day when it wasn't as busy. It was neat to see the Walk of Fame and all the stars, and we also enjoyed seeing Grauman's Chinese Theater and all of the hand/shoe prints of the stars. At the Dolby Theater Mall, you could get a really nice view of the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenC974
20,Not What Its Cracked Up to Be,"Did a day trip to Hollywood from Las Vegas, how disappointing. Its dirtyand seedy, nothing like the image portrayed on TV or in the Movies.I can now tick this off my list and can say I have seen it, but will never have any reason to come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poultons
30,Dirty and Disappointing,"This is probably one of the most overrated ""attractions"" in the country. This is merely a dirty road full of tourists and run-of-the-mill performers trying to get by, which I can appreciate b/c everyone's just trying to make a living. Everything is overpriced and there's nothing to do or see. Don't expect anything spectacular, but it's still a must-see because you can't say you visited Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower, so the same applies here. See it but don't linger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phuc2014
30,Enjoyable,"Was fun to see the famous stars and of course the handprints at the Chinese Theater. Nice fro a stroll around and of course if you wish to go to Madame Tussauds etc or pick up one of the many tours they are selling. Usual touristy shops but also a nice shopping centre where apparently you can view the Hollywood sign from on the balcony walkway, although we didn't realise this until after we had visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyHops

40,It was good for a look around,"We stayed around the corner from hollywood boulevard, which was great for exploring this area. I did like seeing the star names on the walk of fame. However for all it's glory, the other thing that doesn't go I missing is the amount of homeless people, and street performers up and down the boulevard. At no point was this an issue, but it is a memory I will take from hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowieEngland
40,Another iconic LA spot you shouldn't miss,"I went here with my family and my kids just had to see Hollywood Boulevard! Here we saw the walk of fame with all the stars of the stars along with Madame Tussauds, Graumann's Chinese theater,Dolby theater, and a ton of people in costumes. My kids loved it but I thought it was just okay. Lots of questionable people milling about but its a place you should experience...once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyomingdan
40,Exciting place night and day,"I loved Hollywood Blvd. I stayed in a hostel on Schrader Blvd., which is only about 4 blocks from the Chinese theatre, Dolby theare, Mme. Tussaud's, and the Hard Rock Cafe -- the best spot in Hollywood.Hollywood Blvd. runs quite a ways east and west, so you want to focus on the area between LaBrea Avenue and Vine Street. To narrow it down even further, the spot between Highland Avenue and LaBrea Avenue is where most of the activity is. Lots of museums, people trynig to grab you for stars' homes tours, and of course the famous Graumann's Chinese theatre where a multitude of stars past and present have placed their signatures and hand and footprints in concrete. You'll see a variety of street entertainment, including break dancers, impersonators, and artists to make you stop and look. If you like them, give them some money. Some of them do deserve it--but not all.To get here by public transport, just take the Metro and get off and Hollywood and Highland. Well worth a visit ... or two or three!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freed0mt0travel
10,A little disappointing ...,"Coming from Australia felt we had to check out the Boulevard. Leading up to it all we saw was homeless people and run down buildings. When we got there it was overcrowded and a little unpleasant. We stopped in at Madam Tussaud Exhibition, but if it wasn't for that there was nothing else appealing. Glad I went, because I wanted to tick it off my list - but a quick visit was more than enough. Wouldn't visit again and would not recommend for families - especially with young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barneyb421
10,Do not go on the weekend!!!,"It was so busy, you could barely see the stars on the walk of fame. I could not take two steps without being harassed to take pictures (for a cost) with someone or buy someone's cd. We literally stayed there for about 30 minutes, it was all I could take. I've heard it is very nice, but I think I picked the wrong day to go. Go during a weekday or maybe in the fall. It was a mess during July.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811terryr
20,Would have been great... in 1972,Don't bother... looks like it peaked in the 1970's and it's all downhill since then.. Cheap souvenir stores... terrible street performers... smelly... Just don't bother.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marita1054
20,Scary Place,"Not a recommended family tourist attraction at all. If it wasn't my desire to see the walk of fame, I would have stayed away from this place. Too many homeless people and hawkers around. There is no glitz or glamour about this place anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jyothinj
20,"No Glitz & Glammer, just Filthy & Freaky","I've never really been into celebrity worship but went here some time ago because of the hype. If this place was supposed to be a tourist ""attraction"", the city leaders really need to visit other REAL tourist destinations. This was truly one of the most tasteless, disgusting, creepy places full of creepy and freaky people and as a family of tourists, we certainly didn't see the ""attraction"". Don't waste your time or money - stay at home and visit the sleaziest area of your city instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djhm
30,Fame Walk,"Rather disappointing, apart from the walk of stars the street is full of adult shops and dumps. Don't expect the grand elegance you might think when associated with LA. Spend maybe 2 hrs max but not too long because you'll only wish to leave",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfinity88
10,"Dirty, smelt of urine and homeless people everywhere, did not feel safe","We have this vision of what we see on the academy awards, then we got there and we were speechless, we had a conversation the first night with a local bar tender who lived there and he said that during the Academy Awards they pay or bribe all the homeless people to leave, clean it all up and portray the place as the opposite of what it really is. To say it was horrible would be an understatement, we did not feel safe, we were harrassed constantly for money off beggers who would be forceful sometimes, it was very expensive for very little. After spending time in Vegas and Hawaii we were enjoying the USA but LA was a shock and disappointment, to top it off we got ripped off in a cab being charged $78 for a trio from the corner of Vine and Hollywood boulevard to Venice Beach in the middle of the day on a Thursday, then we had to endure a bus back which had several homeless people on it doing bizarre things and yelling at passengers and most people on the bus didn't flinch while this was going on. We dined at the restaurant at the bottom of the W hotel and when we got the bill it was 15% tax ( rip off we know it is only 4.75% everywhere else roughly) plus 18% gratuity included.. Personally for the expense to get there and pay $330 a night for a hotel with no breakfast just to go the universal studios and Venice beach, there is really no reason to go back..Wish we had something more positive to say but the whole thing was terrible apart from Universal Studios",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel_4075
40,Street performers were dope,Loved seeing the poppers like Midnite(Black/white manniquin) and the Silverman. Snap and Gizmo were great as well. I went back many times there on the corner of Highlands. The cheap shops with t-shirts had some good things but i always think of the poor people in countries where there are sweatshops and i avoid buying anything. There was also a guy drumming on plastic bins. Wow what a talent. Oh and the magic shop had things that are hard to get in Australia. I did fall for one dude with his cd's but i am an emcee/rapper as well and we had a dope conversation. Weather was great. Oh and the Fresh n Easy is opened 24 hours so i got plenty of organic/vegan goodies there at a great price. Not far away on sunset boulevard there are two vegan places to eat at. Veggie Grill(two stores on sunset) and Life Organic(raw not totally vegan even tho they say they are). Veggie Grill is all over LA and the food is pretty good but lots of processed stuff. If your leaning is raw veganism then Life Organic is better but dont be fooled and ask if something has honey. I am not plant based but a real vegan so this is important. They had a raw vegan ice cream that was dope. Anyway good experiences for me. Oh and i am here for the OG Poppers Picnic...so google and come,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rapattack
30,Worth a quick look only,"Great to see something as iconic as Hollywood boulevard and the attractions it has to offer, but it's actually quite tacky and you will be constantly harassed by street entertainers. Felt a bit seedy in some bits. Worth a walk along to see the stars, but wouldn't come to LA and see it more than once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthernLaura31
40,Sort of a fun walk,You pull over along the way get out of your car and just walk along. Look at all the stars on the walkway and the shops behind them some are nice and some are,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
30,Nice to see...,"*I actually went December 2006 and July 2013, they make you put a date*I liked seeing Hollywood Boulevard. Except for the religious groups handing you flyers. And the escort services handing you flyers. It gets a bit annoying. But there is a lot to see here. I would recommend going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk1323
20,Rip Off,"From New York and I've been to Los Angeles a couple of times. Hollywood feels like a rip off of Times Square. There isn't really an attraction that brings you there again and again. Other than the Chinese Theater, it's like any normal street with shops and restaurants. See it once and you won't need to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alihaiderm2014

I defy anyone to walk more than 10 paces without stopping to point to a name on the sidewalk and comment on it. They even put out the red carpet for the night my friend and I arrived there (they tried to make out someone called Jane Fonda was getting an award). Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas even came out to greet us! Other than the Dolby Theatre and putting your feet in Marilyn's, there's not much more to it. Oh, and the apartment from Pretty Woman is behind it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosamund_bone

40,Nice experience,It was nice to experience this once in my life. To be there where the Oscars takes place was a nice feeling because you see it all the time on tv. But it was fun for one time. There is not much to do. I took a lot of pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeanella2014
30,Good experience,It was nice looking at all the stars names on the street. However got a bit boring after awhile. There was a lot of police walking around so you felt safe. Lots of nice restaurants. Nice to experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleWyatt2010
30,A Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"Hollywood Boulevard alone can be an interesting place. If you overlook the awful touristy shops that line it, and shady parts of this old boulevard, you'll discover some fun and interesting things to do: visiting the Graumann's Chinese theater, the Egyptian theater, the Roosevelt hotel, checking out some of its historic restaurants like Musso & Frank's Grill or watching a musical at the Pantages.For the review, I thought I'd put more focus on the boulevard itself. It's interesting to people watch as you stroll down the boulevard. Its like people watching while in a Parisian cafe except you're walking. You'll get to see a lot of characters and people from all walks of life. It's as if they're all going after a dream. You can easily spot the drug addicts as well as excited tourists with their pervasive cameras. You can also spot aspiring actor/ musician types and transients with their luggages in tow as they go up and down this grand street.Each has a story to tell, and I wondered how many of them actually make it in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/631joes
50,Fun But Always Crowded,"I've been here a few times and Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood freeway are always crowded. It's hard to find a parking place and there are thousands of people everywhere. I like the shops, the museums, and the historical buildings. Luckily the rest of Hollywood isn't so crowded but this particular street is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014
40,Fun to visit,"It's an interesting street just to walk along. All the lights, you never know when they will be doing a movie or TV shoot along the Boulevard! We have visited three times and I always like to walk along it. Don't miss it if you are visiting LA! It's cheeky, but, it's Hollywood with all the glitter!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brendermac

30,Joseph Was Right,"Wambaugh that is. Was not disappointed as a fan of the Hollywood cops portrayed in Mr Wambaugh's books and all the characters he describes were evident in the area, so nothing really special only a glamorous past to trade on. Not a big area and the percentage of the weird, wonderful and those who exist outside the law, well above the average. Worth a visit if on a tour but only the one I have to say on this showing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgeg624
50,loved it,"I am confused as to how people would be expecting something glamorous...its not the 1950s anymore. I visited alone and was walking around at all hours of the night taking photos, and people watching... felt perfectly safe. I think you either hate it or love it. I loved it because of the wacky people who provided me with much amusement. Yes you will get approached by some weirdos but just be polite and then move on. Exactly what I was expecting.. very touristy and seedy...what more could you want?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonamesavailableyay
30,Not as expected,"The reviews on here are pretty spot on. Its not what I expected at all. I thought the walk of fame area would be in a more glamorous area but it wasn't. There were plenty of shops, food, and bars in the evening to go to and during the day which was the plus but it was like any old major street in any major city. If you ignore the characters and people in general you should not feel afraid of walking down this street. Its not scary just keep to yourself and act like you know how to travel and they will leave you alone. I'm happy I was able to see hollywood blvd but I would most likely not return. Its definitely something I would still do after reading all these reviews because its a major part of LA just dont expect glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl713
50,Cant Miss the boulevard,"You cant do LA without going here. You've got all the stars with their names engraved which make wonderful pictures, and in the evening its popping with the nightclub scene. Jimmy Kimmel's talk show studio is nearby, and we actually SAW Jimmy on the boulevard I think he was shooting a skit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13alecs

30,Day-Trip,Good place for a day-trip. It's fun to walk along the walk of fame and see the theatres... however the area was rather dirty and run down. Fine for a day trip but I would not stay in a hotel here or stay late into the night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leanna1821
30,Crowded,"This place was pretty crowded with tourists and locals dressed up as movie starts alike! The Beverley Hills tour was a WASTE of time and money - most mansions have huge walls and you can't really see anything except their front gates and video surveillance cameras.

Go early to avoid crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaLoweinAZ
10,A total let down,"Don't bother! It's not worth it. Yes you'll see some under maintained stars with some great names on but that's all. The whole street smelled pee and filled with homeless. Those people who dressed in costumes of carton characters, I understand that they were trying to make a living but in such an aggressive way that I consider it a rob, especially when going with family. It's sad to see such a historic spot had became so tacky. Be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YonnieYawn
30,Once in a lifetime...only in LA,"Okay... so this is something we had to do just once in our lifetime...experience the glitz and glam of the famous Hollywood Blvd! Not quite what we'd expected- very interesting characters abound- saw some of the costumed people without their masks on (because of the heat) and it wasn't a pretty picture.Sorry...but it was kind of frightening and these people are pushy- remember, they are trying to make a living out of it... My hubby couldn't wait to get out of there but I enjoyed taking pictures of my favorite stars and standing in their footsteps and all the regular touristy stuff that you do when in la la land for the first time;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaChHa
10,Not For Families,"We never plan on coming back to LA with our family, so we wanted to see Hollywood Blvd. Ugh! This place was scary. There were people dressed up as characters, as some others noted in their reviews. However, these were not top of the line costumes, they looked like they were purchased from the clearance rack at KMart. So bad to the point that it was creepy wondering what petifiles were dressed up in the Spiderman and Hulk costumes. Don't get me wrong, some of the costumes were nice, and people were handing their small children over to these individuals for photos, but it still led me to question, who/what was under the costume.What freaked me out the most is that these individuals come at you,to pose for photos. Which at first, my kids thought was cool, but then they realized, they want $$ for the pictures. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience.Later that evening at our hotel there was a new story about an incident on Hollywood Blvd. A girl had taken a photo with one of these costumed individuals, and then refused to pay. The results were not good. I won't give all of the details, I am just issuing a warning I wish I had read before. Please be cautious and careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abcboys
50,FANTASTIK,"I love it!!! Make sure to take some extra change to tip the people dressed up like characters. I saw Storm from XMEN, Batman, Bumble Bee from Transformers. This guy had a Boa Contrictor. I loved it. There is a place right on the corner, where you can have a photo taken with any celebrity you want. Also there is the Hollywood Hills tour bus thats right on the corner. I loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayR1984
40,Very interesting,"In my opinion, you can't go to LA and not visit Hollywood Boulevard at least once! Yea, it's sorta tacky and wacky but what do you expect? I thought it was funny to see all the people dressed up! It is definitely an experience. The only thing I didn't like was that sometimes the sidewalk would get kind of congested but it wasn't horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peanut2rec
20,Suprised!,"I was amazed at how tacky this was, people in lousy fancy dress of spiderman, Marilyn Monroe etc all touting for your cash! Overall the whole place had a dirty, dodgy feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMole
10,Do not go,"This is supposed to be a major LA attraction but is actually dirty, tacky aggressive major tourist trap full of scam artists. In a 2 hour walk we were verbally attacked by firstly a young man giving out flyers for a bus tour who after finding out we weren't doing it that day said he had no time for our type of people as he grabbed the flyer back out of my wife's hand to a second who after they refused his CD started being extremely verbally abusive to my wife and son. The street is totally rundown and full of tacky look a likes who constantly pester you to be paid for taking their picture. Avoid at all costs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777junek
40,fun looking at stars,"We had a good time walking up and down Hollywood boulevard looking at the celebrity stars and those we recognised and those from a by gone era. Outside the chinese theatre was interesting to see the hand and foot prints, liked dame Helen Mirren best as she obviously made a unique imprint like no other ( no spoilers here)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaRB
20,Not worth it!,"My family and I didn't enjoy this experience at all. It's a massive tourist trap, with people trying to scam you all day. We enjoyed getting off the main drag, where things were less busy. You can get a good glimpse of the Hollywood sign if you head up to the Dolby Theatre, just follow the signs. There is also ample of paid parking in the back of Hollywood Boulevard. Overall I think there are better things to see and do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Stylie1
20,A godforsaken street,"A friend had initially told me that there is nothing to see in LA. I would not fully agree but, at least, that did sum up well Hollywood boulevard.One of the most well-known attractions and, in the end, just a dirty street full of tourists and a bunch of weird to aggressive people.Definitely a place for tourist-hunting but, as a visitor, really not much to enjoy. I would summarise the best experience of it as stopping at Hard Rock Café and sipping a cool drink while listening to good music and chatting with a (at last) nice person.I guess tourists have to go there to tick the box but that is the most of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamPavin
40,Tourist Central,"Very touristy but a must-see destination for first time visitors to LA. Lots of places to buy souvenirs, the Disney shop is a must, so is tracking down the stars of your favorite celebrities. We had a walk end to end, popped into a few shops for souvenirs, and that was about all there is to do here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaximRossOz
30,Touristy but interesting,"The boulevard is all about tourists - plenty of opportunities to pick up your tacky souvenirs! - but still an experience. Wander from end to end hunting stars of people you like (be warned that some are off on side-streets - e.g. John Wayne is off up Vine St.), marvel at the fancy dress guys around the Chinese Theater (I had Bane, Spider-man, Darth Vader, a Minion...), and have a look at the Chinese Theater cement-hand-prints.Fun to go though - especially if you're a bit of a movie buff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussH592
40,Very touristic place,Hollywood Boulevard is a very touristic place as it is here you find the Walk of Fame. There are many tourist buses and stuff like that there are using this place to acquire new customers.It is a place where there are a lot of history and very interesting for movie fans like me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadsP_12
30,A tick in the tourist box,"Of course you have to see this place. It has all the tourist things, you've got the star plaques, the Chinese theatre and the dolby theatre. You also have tourist shops with lots of memorabilia. It's always busy with lots of tourists milling about. Near the Dolby theatre there is I suppose you would call it a balcony and from there you can get a great photo of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH
40,It is what it is,"Reading the other reviews I have to ask-what do you expect? If youre looking to spot film stars, or eat gourmet meals go to Beverly Hills. On Hollywood you have history. Gaumans, The Dolby, Pantages, Capitol Records, Walk of Fame. There are excellent eateries as well if you look. The Lobster Bisque at the Pig and Whistle is mindblowing, the coffee and snacks at the Coffee Bean are excellent, and Mel's Diner is a must. Add to that the odd Film Premier, and the wannabe's parading their wares, its brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
50,Awesome,Hollywood Boulevard is great place to see - had a great day here. Just so much to see and do in Hollywood - the whole place is just buzzing. Lots of tours leave from here to Hollywood Hills another great place to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShelleyN437
50,So much History,"Stayed on hollywood boulevard for 6 days at Loews Hollywood Hotel. I'm a huge movie buff so Hollywood was on my bucket list and Hollywood Boulevard is where a lot of the history is. At night it gets a little iffy and it's very touristy, but the best time to walk down hollywood boulevard is early am! like 7am. noone and you can enjoy the sights. Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve
20,What a dive,"Obviously you're in LA and you have to check out Hollywood right?What a let down.The characters dressed up are grumpy, smell bad, their costumes are pretty worn and they want money from you.A guy put a CD in my hand telling me it was free then tried to get money out of me. When my other half have it back to him he got VERY abusive, accused us of being racist etc. I felt extremely afraid as this guy was shouting and threatening us and NO ONE came to our aid.The stars get boring after a whole, the Chinese theatre was very busy and too many people are trying to get photos of the hand prints that they literally push you out of the way.We went to Ripleys and it was similar to the one in London but we liked that so it was our saving grace.I wouldn't tell people not to go here, but I would tell you to not expect the Hollywood glamour you may think....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teags86
20,Tourist trap,"Not sure why one wants to go there, other than :A. To say you didB. you didnt know what a tourist trap it isC. To look into distance and see Hollywood sign(but I'm sure its visible from other locations).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurie989
20,What a let down,"There's a lot of hype about visiting Hollywood, and then you get there, and its just a street. Nothing special. We just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible The thought of the amount of terrible traffic we had braved, just to get harassed by touts trying to sell jeep tours of celebrity homes and what not, makes me sad even now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilsusername
40,Hollywood Boulevard an anticlimax but Universal Studios good fun,"My three sons (17, 19 and 21) and I stayed two nights right on the Boulevard, I had been before, and my sons also found this area a bit of a let down. The walk of fame is punctuated by junk and 2 dollar shops all the way, no quality stores at all. But you still gotta walk overthe star spangled pavement. Starbucks by the ChineseTheatre has free wifi. Beverly hills homes tour well worth doing, and a day at Universal is also great. There are basically three major rides on the lower level....3d Transformer was beyond awesome, Jurassic Park, Mummy . Make sure you have a meeting place, easy to get lost. Skip the line tickets are well worth it, it would be really annoying having to wait in those lines. My older kids enjoyed the flagship sweet shops on the upper level.....Lollies in a thousand different ways. If you buy skip the line tickets before the USA you need to find the 'group' ticket window, show your travel agent coupon , and then you will be issued with a plastic card, you then need to get in line to go through the turnstiles at the entry gate. If you gon on the mummy rollercoster, you have to put bags in a locker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieW454
20,Meh,"You will understand that it is all about production in Hollywood. The strip has almost nothing in special, you may spend 2-3 hours tops. There are too many homeless people and guys who tries to give you a tour. It was a disappointment for me but it is a place to see. Don't expect something great and enjoy your time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hasano591
40,The street of dreams,This strip is one of the most amazing places you can visit in Hollywood. There are a number of attractions to see from Wax museums to theatres to restaurants and everything in between. This street is a must to see and worth the time to stop and check out. The street does not have a lot of facilities but you can find a restaurant somewhere. Parking is easy on the side streets and you can walk every where. To see every thing you need almost the whole day. This is where the the Stars have there star on the side walk. Definatly check it out. We went on Christmas Day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonialouish
10,More security required.,"As one of major tourist attractions, i think more police officers are required to provide us ( the tourist ) a safe feeling while traveling around!Too many homeless and 'strange' people around!I wouldn't put this under my safe place to visit. consider walking in a group for your own safety specially during night time!Many con will pretend to be a famous person by using somekind of mask and persist you to take a picture with them which later they will ask you to pay for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanA532
40,Specially for movie lovers,"Excellent place to roam Los Angeles discovering all the stars in Hollywood. The Chinese theater, The Ripley Museum and lots of things more than any movie lover enjoyed without hesitation, A lot of shops to get some souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinistryGM
40,Movie Location must-see,"A must see for any tourist, it has the Walk of Fame, lots of museums along the way and also of course the street from Pretty Woman :) There are plenty of tours, touristy shops, and things to do so take your pick as to what you're interested in. City Pass gave me a tour which was very interesting and went past all the theatres. Definitely worth visiting, why come to Hollywood if you want to avoid this area?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon
40,Don't expect much and you'll enjoy it,"I had heard some pretty negative feedback about LA in general so I wasn't expecting much but I still went to see the Walk of Fame and the attractions around there. I found it enjoyable. Yeah sure, there are hawkers trying to sell you stuff, but if you've ever travelled in Europe you'll know what to do. Just ignore them. I did find the shops there a bit expensive, they surely make their profits, but it's all part of the experience so I didn't care much. I felt safe the whole time and as I'm a woman travelling alone that's important to me. There's a good mall there which I didn't expect too. I found the tour from LA City Tours quite good. They actually gave me a discount too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionag870
50,A must visit in Los Angeles,Visit Hollywood boulevard and take pictures with our favorite actor/actress stars is an experience if you are in LA. you will find street singers and characters of your favorite movies. You will find good restaurant too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjveles
10,What a Waste of Time,"Seriously, I don't think I'm ever going to understand the hype surrounding Hollywood Boulevard. We were in LA for the week and wanted to go hit up some of the local attractions.... we went to Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Monica Pier. Basically, the way that went was that the Pier was pretty good and worth going back to.... Hollywood Blvd. sucking so bad was the reason we went to the Pier for dinner.Seriously, we saw lots of starts... in the cement pavement. And, unless you like reading name after name after name after name after name after name after name after name after name after name after name... after name written within those stars, then there's really no reason to venture out this way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimZ_13
20,Disappointing,"We were disappointed by the Hollywood Boulevard. It was dirty and there were a lot of people trying to sell you something. CDs (if you don't want it, don't take any, don't even touch any), Tours, pictures... The walk itself was interesting, but not well maintained.Luckily, we were there when they introduced the star for Janis Joplin, but that was about the only exciting thing we had.To avoid being ripped off, we had lunch at McDonalds. Even here, it's like the worst McDonalds I've ever been. It was dirty and they forgot to give half of the things we ordered, making me to go back 2 times to get it. Besides that, a guy was screaming around and yelling, spitting on the floor, making the situation pretty awkward, even a bit scary.The walk of fame is one of the things we just go once in to see, but never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyN_13
20,"dirty,ugly,creepy and dissapointing!","Spent two days in Las Vegas and then drove from LV to LA to spend two days in Hollywood . LV was awesome ,it was clean ,full of attractions, safe and fun. That said I guess we expected too much out of Hollywood . Man ,what an ugly, run down ,dirty, dump . I live in Ohio and it's a 1000 times nicer than Hollywood. Imagine that, Ohio nicer than Hollywood . Something is seriously wrong with that town! Don't want to go back! it was cool to see it ,but what a big let down. I noticed most of the homes had barbed wire around their steel gates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661ericg
10,Don't bother,I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about. I guess it's just one of those things that you have to tick off your list but it wasn't for me. I can't think of one redeeming thing to say.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AusTripPlanner
30,Worth a visit,"The Hollywood Boulevard is not as good, as big as I thought, but with still it's a pretty busy place, and there are quite a lot of things to see and make it worth a visit, for example, all those people dress up as super heroes and characters from movies are quite fun to look at.But I'm not sure if I would go again if i visit L.A. againUnlike some other reviewers, I don't find the place dirty. Or maybe I didn't really look hard enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232RichardW
20,It is unlikely that you will visit a second time,"I am sure most visitors to LA will visit Hollywood Boulevard but unlike the Plaka district of Athens, it is highly unlikely that you would visit a second time! It seemed that most of the out of work 'actors' of this movie city were masquerading as Michael Jackson, Eddie Murphy, Mickey Mouse, Chewbacca, etc. The 'Stars' on the Walk of Fame are interesting and finding your favourite may take a while. The buildings in the street are a tad garish but there is some real history here with both Grauman's and the old Kodak theatres. Crowded - Keep an eye on your possessions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarEastTraveller33
20,Disappointment,"This is definitely not like it is shown in Hollywood movies. Don't even think of going there in the evening... it is really dirty. The Hollywood Walk of Fame turns into Walk of Shame at night, seen people pissing on it. There's a Ripley Museum and Madame Tussauds along side but nothing as compared to the one in London. I visited LA and Vegas on this trip, my savior was Vegas. Don't want to go back to LA ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vkeer
40,Glitz no Glamour,"All the glitz and no glamour...it's not like the movies...people everywhere and dirty, dirty, dirty! So many tourists, what'd you expect? Can say the excitement of seeing all the fuss from movies like Pretty Woman and every other Hollywood movie makes you feel like a star, for about 5 minutes. Was neat to see the stars names on the blvd...other than that, high priced trinkets and filth...oh well, LA at's it best. And I loved it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_colts2009
20,"See it, take a pic, then walk away. Very fast.","I drug my husband down here because I felt like it was a must see since we were in LA. I live in Orlando, the tourist capital of the world and I still was like WHOA. This made International Drive seem like Rodeo Drive!!! It just seemed so dirty and grimy. Cheesy tour operators. Harassing you. So many gross dressed up characters. Harassing you. Thugs handing out CDs. Harassing you. I read reviews so I knew not to take one but I forgot to tell my husband - I freaked out on him when they handed him one. Thank goodness the guy took it back without drama. I held on to my purse. Tight. I suggest you do the same. Take a pic of the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood & Highland Center, get some pics of the theaters, then leave. We were there maybe 30 minutes and that was plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktown25
30,A bit overrated,"It's pretty much like any other street in Hollywood. The only interesting bit is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I did not get a chance to see all the stars, but I managed to get pictures of the more popular ones. The Chinese Theatre is also located along this road, as well as the Ripley Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjoelseow
20,"Go if you must, but it is very missable","We went to Hollywood boulevard, we were told don't miss it when in LA. It is a very ordinary tourist destination. The street is full of people, dressed in all sorts of costumes, seeking your hard earned dollars for no obvious benefit. The area is pretty grubby, the shops are uninspiring, and no good food options. Go if it is on your bucket list, but don't plan to spend too much time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fitzroytraveller
40,I love the street crowd!,"I love being amongst the tourist crowds. Everyone's so bubbly as they walk through Hollywood. Okay, the tourist shops and tour agencies are a bit tacky and the same goes for the street sellers and the dress-ups,. But, hey, who cares? This is Hollywood. I love reading the star names in the footpath and the notices on the lamp posts telling you about vintage happenings on certain sites. I rushed into hotels and the mall and took in side streets and visited lots of Hollywood iconic places along the way. I stayed in a cheap hotel just off the Strip so as to be close to happenings and it was a wonderful decision. Oh, and I watched a guy being arrested for being a nuisance, and I took a photo of Tinkerbell. I ate Mexican, Italian and American food. I had a smile on my face the whole time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixiehat
20,At least it's free,"The Boulevard is a very dirty , grimy, seedy street that may be worth a look once in your life but I can't imagine anyone wanting a repeat visit. My 16 year old daughter who really wanted to visit Hollywood said it was not what she expected and gave Hollywood a 6 out of 10. Also watch out for street husslers trying to force CD's in your hands ( for a fee ) and hold on to your purses. At least it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sprymgr
30,Odd,"As many have said previously, it really does need to be done, but it is extremely overrated. We found the general area to be quite run down and dirty, and we did not feel safe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soph_ee_london
40,Nice,"Not what I expected,the best part was in front of the Dolby theatre and Chinese theatre. that block had it all like the walk of fame and MADAME TUSSAUDS.tHE BAD part was all the comic book characters wanting you to take photos for a charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbyclobber2010
30,Other than the Stars in the street it's simply a city!,"It wasn't what I expected at all, and I certainly wouldn't be going back for more than 2/3days....However that being said it is a place you've gotta go to once in your life!! Just remember it is a city! Definitely do a star home trip which takes you around 90210 postal area... That's something to look at :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amyhunter1981
40,Touristy Hollywood Attraction - worth seeing,"Over-crowded Hollywood Boulevard, especially by Grumann's theater (formerly known as Chinese Mann Theater), this street is a must-see for those visiting Hollywood, CA. With stars aligning the street on both sides, whether you are a music or movie afficionado, do take a stroll on Hollywood Blvd. Park on local streets which run parallel to Hollywood Blvd - there is 1 and 2-hour free street parking, so you don't have to pay $20/hour in the parking lots of the area. Take a camera and plan on spending 1-2 hours strolling down the street looking for your favorite movie actors/actresses stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YayeMama
30,Overated,"If you are here just to sight-see due it's popularity as a tourist attraction, then there's nothing much interesting to see actually.It'll be very difficult to find free parking nearby (if any).You will find some ""famous Hollywood theaters and some branded shopping outlets, along with people dressed like some famous Hollywood characters who will trouble you to pay them to take a picture with/ of them!!! The famous Hollywood Walk of fame is there (which to me was nothing very interesting itself), also a couple of different museums like the famous Madam Tussauds wax museum, Ripley's believe it or not museum (which again was not to my personal satisfaction/ interests).If you REALLY want to get it off your list of attractions, go ahead and invest the time + money to visit the place at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShamiJ
40,Fun day visiting the historic street.,Went with 16 and 8 year old boys. They were entertained for a while by the walk of fame. There are lots of stores selling t-shirts and odds and ends souvenirs so don't rush to buy there is likely another store with same or cheaper prices. You can get a deal on the bus tours if you negotiate. Be careful of the characters dresses up they work for tips and it gets expensive quick. You can see the Hollywood sign near the Chinese Theater in what appears to be a food court/mall. There is also a fountain court for the kiddos to cool off on the ground level of this mall. I was disappointed in the world's record museum. I thought it was over priced for what it was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hutchens74
50,Excellent place to visit!,"The place is great!!! It has great views and great places to visit, although the prices are a bit high, food is good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JurgenK22
30,Always something to see here,"I would have to say my favorite part of Hollywood Blvd was just watching the people. You have your tourists--like us--easy to spot camera's around the neck walking with their head down reading the names on the stars. Don't miss the outdoor mall. I think it's the 3rd level that there is a beautiful spot to take a picture of the Hollywood sign. Don't stop for the characters--we saw Super Woman, 2 female, scantily clad ""police officers"", Transformers, Michael Jackson--they will all gladly take a pic with you, but that is how they make a living so be prepared to pay. Go inside the Roosevelt Hotel. It is beautiful---and haunted! :) May be really boring for younger kids unless you go to the Wax Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nina0912
30,"Go... partake in the good, mediocre and terrible, but the best people watching in town.","If you stay around El Capitan, Grauman's and don't venture too far past Highland, its a decent experience to take family from out of town, but don't be surprised for the disappointment and the slight resentment your guests will have towards you for cursing them with the knowledge that Hollywood Boulevard is incredibly underwhelming.There are bright spots to the street, but the further you get past Highland the more decrepit and filthy the street will get; though the saving grace of this street that pushes it out of a poor rating is the people watching. All kinds of people from any and all walks of life mix while traversing the streets odd shops and restaurants.So go for a visit to say you've been there, but don't overestimate the streets charm. And don't keep your eyes glued to the walk of fame beneath your feet or you'll miss the true majesty of the people who are walking right besides you.** Not really a kid or conservative mother friendly street for the most part. If you have kids take them to the Disney soda shop and keep it on that block and you should be safe, same with any conservative mothers or visiting family.Also no public restrooms for 98% of the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
20,"It has to be done, but do it quickly. In fact stay in the car.","Unlike many people we really like LA, but Hollywood Bvld was quite easily the low point. As others say, it's dirty, full of down and outs and others trying to get you to part with your hard earned dollars. It's also the only place in LA we didn't feel safe.The street is badly maintained, full of smoke shops and shops selling naughty undies, they looked like sex shops, but I don't think they were.If I were a star, I think I would refuse to let them put my name here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road811157
40,Worth the time,"Sometimes a ""must see"" is just that -- you see and move on. Hollywood Blvd was a good site-seeing stop. The walk up and down was fun as you check out all of the names on the stars on the sidewalk. There are plenty of souvenir stores (more than you care to stop in), but also the regular shops, as well as Ripley's, etc. Be sure to go into the courtyard across the street from El Capitan. Not only is there a fountain with water shooting out of the pavement, but more stores, and another ""photo op"" of the ""Hollywood"" sign. We found a street with free parking, but that was a rarity. There was a lot for $7 down by Arizona St., and one for $10 off Highland (at the elementary school) just above Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillyBob20
30,IT COULD BE BETTER,"As we had high expectations, we were dissapointed. It was very crowded, not very clean and generally not impressive as supposed to be the Hollywood Boulevard.We saw the Kodak Theatre, the Guiness world records museum, wax museum, the Historiv Chinese Theatre, we walked and find some famous stars, we had starbucks coffee that i like a lot and had lunch at the Fresh fire kabob. Definetly we coulden't leave Los Angeles without being there......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AthinaT_13
30,Could Be So Much More,"As a lot of the other reviews say this place offers a lot and delivers very little with it basically being a hangout of hustlers, druggies, vagrants and other forms of lowlife which survive here.I would still say go and have a look but keep your expectations in check or else your starry eyed ideas of Hollywood might fall woefully short.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mozzroom
40,Go earlier in the morning to visit,"We went and visited Hollywood Boulevard on a Sunday morning. It was a great time to go, it was not too crowded, there were not a lot of people dressed up in character costumes, or people handing you cds to bother you as you walked past. We were able to take photos of the stars and hand/foot prints quite easily without the crowds, so would highly recommend going earlier in the mornings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliBla
20,Hollywood Boulevard. More like Anus Street.,We recently went to LA for five nights and so we did the obligatory visit to this dud of a location. Soon as we got into the Main Street it was just mayhem.And not in a good way. Anyone who came remotely near was asking for money. Homeless people to Star ratio was probably 1:1. I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to see that. Would have rather spent that two hours of my life biting a tyre or something.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoeChuck
20,"If you want to see everything that's wrong with LA in the one convenient location, visit the Hollywood Boulevard","LA is known for and has some brilliant tourist destinations. Universal Studios, Disneyland, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Santa Monica Pier to name a few. Arguably the biggest one is the Hollywood Boulevard. You would therefore justifiably have high expectations and big hopes for a memorable day out. And a memorable day out you shall have, however it'll be for all the wrong reasons.You will get harassed on literally every street corner by a combination of the following: homeless people, sightseeing vendors, wannabe rap stars and their terrible CDs, people dressed as recognisable movie characters who will more often than not greet you with the line ""Got money?"" instead of ""Want a photo with me?"", shady looking characters trying to pedal all sorts of narcotics, women clearly under the influence of many illegal substances selling themselves so they can afford their next hit, the list goes on and on. And it gets very annoying and very old very very fast. It's not an enjoyable experience. Except for a miniscule section of the boulevard, the rest of it feels like you're visiting the slums.One of the notable attractions, the Hollywood stars, are in no particular order and just serve as an indication to all the oh so delightful folk mentioned previously that you're a tourist and therefore an easy target for them to harass/beg/annoy.My friends and I went on one of the tours that gets shoved in your face, seeing the Hollywood sign and seeing celebrity homes. For all you know the guide could be pointing out random houses and saying ""Ooh such and such lives there!!"" when in actual fact it's just a random house. But we did see homes I did recognise like Elvis' old home, and the house that Michael Jackson passed away in. And to be fair, the tour was a bit of fun.I imagined a classy strip of Hollywood elegance, chic cafes and delicious dining, shops where I could max out my credit card in one afternoon buying all sorts of great clothes and accessories, and lots of awesome tourist attractions.. What I got was a filthy ghetto-esque run down street filled to the brim with bums and hookers, a couple of dirty fast food chains and the occasional cafe or bar that looked like it wouldn't give you a disease just by sitting on a chair inside, and shop after shop selling incredibly tacky touristy cheap crap and dodgy looking electronic goods, and people dressed in crappy costumes annoying you for your hard earned dollars just as much as the homeless.Is it a must visit whilst in LA? Absolutely not. Do yourself a favour and don't waste a precious day of your vacation here. The very few good places you can visit, like Madame Tussauds and Planet Hollywood, there are plenty of them in other, more clean areas of the US. And in closing, I didn't see one police officer there in my entire day and evening spent at the Boulevard.. Incredibly odd for a place that is such a big tourist destination. Instead go to the nearby Beverley Hills. A polar opposite to the Hollywood Boulevard, and it's exactly what I imagined the Boulevard would be like. You'll have much more fun there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradFraser
20,"Such a disappointment, dirty and full of homeless people","I really wish I could give this a better rating. I still can't believe that is the ""famous"" Hollywood as I was really looking forward to seeing it.Basically, there is nothing to see here. You don't even get a chance to relax as there are people bothering you all the time, trying to sell you their CDs, pushy people selling bus tours and LOTS of homeless people.Hollywood Boulevard is dirty, with lots of souvenir shops, dirty restaurants and people trying to rip you off. ( they tried to charge us for a extra meal that we never had). We didn't even take photos, it was that bad.Honestly, don't go there. Don't waste your time. Rather spend a extra day on the beach or tour one of the film studios. We wasted half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cestovatel25
10,Full of scum,I came to Hollywood in may and it was not what I was expecting at all.I've been to some extremely rough places over the years but this place is the worst. Everywhere you go there's people begging for smokes or money. It's very hard to relax with people constantly bothering you. By the second day I was on the verge of snapping.Dont even get me started on the rappers trying to sell CDs either. There needs to be more police because this could be a good place if tourists weren't constantly being harassed. If you expect this place to look like it does in the movies you'll be disappointed. Unless the film youre thinking of is boys in the hood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9DaveG
20,Over-rated,"It was fun to see the Chinese Theatre with the stars hand and foot prints. But we expected the area to be clean and safe. The reality is that it is chaotic, with people soliciting all sorts of things such as their CDs. Over-rated as an attraction, but still something you should do if you are a tourist in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveurope22
40,You Must Visit if You're Touring LA!,"Yes, it's a little trashy. Yes, there are people everywhere dressed as Superman & Michael Jackson. Yes, there are people trying to hand you their CDs. My advice: IGNORE THEM & keep on walking. We spent a day here and had a blast!We started by visiting the Grauman's Chinese Theater. A great piece of history! I was in heaven when I got to place my hands where Marilyn Monroe did many years ago...of course, I needed some hand sanitizer afterwards. LOL We then tried to find our favorite celebrity's stars on the ""Walk of Fame""...followed by Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, which was awesome! The statues looked very real and it wasn't busy so we had plenty of time to take as many pics with the wax figures as we wanted to.We sat outside & had appetizers and margaritas at ""Cabo Wabo Cantina,"" which was located in an outdoor mall right on Hollywood BLVD...lots a fun shops and restaurants.Our final stop was the TMZ Tour, which left from the BLVD and it was so much fun!If you are touring the area you have to spend a day here,,,just to experience all the craziness and just to say you did it! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathryn6586

10,"Dirty, run down and full of tourists","You may think you need to go here... you don't unless you want to see some gold stars set in concrete a LOT of tourists... the kind that wear over sized shorts, sun hats and have a camera strapped around their necks, fanny pack/bum bag and possibly a floral shirt... WHY, WHY, WHY!!!But they do have all the over priced brand stores where you can purchase lots of thing you don't need.Also the street smells like Urine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebackandforth
10,Worst Part of the U.S,This was one of the worst vacation experience I've had. The people on the streets trying to sell tours are pushy and obnoxious and got really mad when i didn't want to buy from them. The whole street smells like urine and my wife felt quite threatened by a number of people who looked like they were on some sort of drugs. It meant that we cut our stay short in LA and spent more time in San Diego.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foleyk5
30,grimy and just a little sketchy,"We visited in the evening.. Our first experience was with the dishonest parking attendant about a block down on Highand. The sign said 10.00 , he asked if we spoke Spanish, when I said no, he told me that it would be $15.00.. I said that the sign said 10. and he said... 10.then.. What???In general , it is rather dirty and some of the people make you feel as though you should gather everyone close and move on.There is a great souvenir store to the left of the Chinese theater.. We paid five dollars each for our stuff rather than the 13.00 just down the street for the same thing.See it once and that's enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorothyL
40,Great people watching,"Walking up and down this road is fascinating and great for people watching. It has a kind of seedy, slightly faded, gritty glamour which is an improvement compared to my last visit 14 years ago. There are groups of Jesus shouters (literally), tourists posing next to their favourite star on the Walk of Fame and children posing with ""Jack Sparrow"" and ""Spiderman"". There's a large number of tattoo parlours and judging by the walking works of tattoo art they are very busy! There are also a large number of ""smoke"" shops - possibly more than souvenir shops! The vintage clothing stores are amazing and well worth a look. There are street people but they don't seem to bother anyone. Check out the street vendors, especially the palm artists - they make amazing things!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northerngrrl
40,Don't be mis-led by the other feedback,"Not as bad as some of the other reviews, sure it's not the cleanest place but with the amount of foot traffic it is to be expected. Yes there are hawkers but this is the case at any area where there are going to be tourists (think about London bridge, exactly the same). People selling c.d.'s, bus tours etc do not hassle with a simple ""no thanks"". It is very ""touristy"" and if you want to look at stars names in the ground great, but there is little there other than to be able to say I saw it. I went with my wife and teenage sons and felt safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robwelf0
10,"Except for one block, this blvd is sad and dirty","The only nice part of Hollywood Blvd. is around the Chinese Theater where there is a shopping mall and a few theaters. Most of this area is relatively new and somewhat kept up. There is the beautiful El Capitan Theater right across the street and a few high end designer stores.However, if you wonder away from the area and start going east, you run into the awful underbelly of Hollywood. The sidewalks are extremely dirty and many storefronts are closed. There are bums and runaways asking for spare change. The stores that are open consist of shady electronic stores, nothing special gift shops, and clothing shops. The Egyptian Theater is in this area and is a great place to see, however, you have to get to it by walking thru this area.The people that frequent the area can be a little scary and the type that makes one feel a little nervous. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has been trying for years to clean up the street, but they have only succeeded near the Chinese Theater...they have failed miserably for the rest of the street.A little advice...Enjoy the Hollywood and Highland Mall during daylight hours...the Mall area gets a little dicey at night after 9 PM. A different crowd surfaces and is quite different than the daytime crowd...it's what I call the ""heavily tattooed"" crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob

So many landmarks close by, this trip might take up your whole day! come here if you are visiting SoCal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiem910
40,Pretty much like Times Square,A definite must do if you are in L.A. for the first time. Its pretty flashy and filled with touristy things. Mind you that it gets very crowded and the prices for souvenirs and restaurants are inflated but it is worth spending an afternoon or an evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez
50,Really cool.,This is certainly really cool. Although there is not a whole lot to do other than wonder around and take as many pictures as possible. I enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrEg0n
30,Tick off the list of things to do,"I can't say I got out and walked along here, soaking in the atmosphere, looking at stars on the footpath or anything like that, we just cruised slowly down the Blvd looking out the car window. Have to say that movie stars and the like are not really my thing. Still, when in Hollywood...well, you know how it goes. As a tourist I guess there is a slight fascination in seeing something different, but it's basically a street, with a few shops, lots of places to buy touristy stuff. The Chinese theatre was an interesting looking building and maybe Madam Tousards might have been worth a visit if I'd had time. Anyway, 5 or so minutes later, I can tick the list and say I've been down Hollywood Blvd. Sure I may have seen more getting out of the car, but really, not something that interested me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariceNZ
40,Street of the stars,It is a good place to hang out and walking around to shop for souvenirs and taking pictures with your favorite stars autographs and finger prints in front of the famous Chinese theatre. It is a must place for tourists and friends from other states or foreigners.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fred007_10
40,Interesting to see,"It was interesting to see the stars but apart from that, it's just a regular street (maybe with more strange people than somewhere else).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasnaM798
10,A DUMP AND AN EMBARRASSMENT,"Biggest letdown of my entire trip. I've read it here and I heard from friends and relatives about this place but I still wanted to see it for myself. I would never go back here, ever. The movie stars and studios and the local politicians should do something about how dirty, disgusting, and dangerous this place has become. It's a shame that LA would let this legendary attraction become so bad! There isnt just homeless people here but degenerates, addicts, and lowlife leeches feeding off of the tourists good nature, or sleeping in doorways in filthy sleeping bags cover up over there heads-the blvd of broken dreams. The Hollywood I dreamed of seeing is gone forever. The stars in the pavement are not placed in the same direction, so you have to constantly walk and turn your head to read them. Well, if your walking with your head down, they'll spot you two blocks away. Parking behind the businesses was a mere $7 but you'll have to walk back there to get your car. Be forewarned-do it in the daylight. When the stars come out for an event (like when we were there), they close off streets, roll out the carpets, but the minute they're done.... forget about it. You'll still go see it but please, be on your guard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadtripperAmerica
50,Hollywood Heritage Walking Tour,"If you are a fan of Hollywood's Golden Years and the early days of film, this tour is a must. For only $10/person, we had a 4-hour walking tour with Dave. My husband and I were the only guests that day. Dave had a binder of photos of how various places we saw once looked, and a wide knowledge of the past, present and future of these buildings. Many interesting stories and photo ops. In addition to being knowledgeable, Dave was very pleasant and friendly. A highlight of our visit to LA, we highly recommend it. (Wear comfortable shoes and take water and a snack; Dave pointed out where we could use a bathroom.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mignonette-7
30,Been there done that...never again!,"Yes it was brilliant to see it...the stars, fingerprints etc. but I certainly wasn't hanging around here...was pretty dangerous and alot of crazy people! I was by myself and was a little frightened, protecting my bag was the most important thing on my mind. Even at some points I was hesitate in taking out my camera. I would recommend going there as it is a central part of LA but just some common sense and caution is needed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidayExperiences12
10,Waste of an afternoon,"My experience of Hollywood Boulevard was marred by a couple of unfortunate incidents that appear to be all too common an occurrence, having read some of the other reviews.I took the Metro to Hollywood and Vine and took a walk along Hollywood Boulevard. The area seems to have gone downhill in a big way since I visited a few years ago in 2009.I initially went into the large McDonalds but turned right around when I saw how busy and dirty it was. There was a small sandwich bar literally next door to McDonalds where I ordered a club sandwich. A photo on the wall of the sandwich bar showed a picture of a club sandwich containing real chicken and bacon - but what was delivered was cheap sliced meat with salad. Whilst I was eating - I saw several families being hassled by guided tour operators who are located just outside.After I left, I crossed the street to the Grauman Theatre where I was immediately hassled by people trying to sell CD's. One guy in particular struck up a conversation with me. As I'm normally quite polite I listened to what he had to say. He said he was trying to promote his CD by giving away free copies of it - but that changed to - he was accepting contributions to cover the cost of the CD - and then that changed to we normally ask for ten dollars. All the time, he was asking my name and signing the front cover of the CD. I was holding the CD, but I told him I didn't want to pay ten dollars for it - he said he would have to take the CD back. So much for promoting his CD. I knew it was a scam - but sometimes you have faith in human nature.A few moments later, I was approached by another person with the same scam and I just told him I wasn't interested.There were the usual people wearing movie costumes and to my disgust, one of them lifted his mask and said to his friend, who was also dressed in a costume - ""these tourists are just so stupid"". By that point I'd had enough and I left Hollywood Boulevard via Hollywood/Highland Metro station, feeling like I'd wasted my entire afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonewayfarer
30,Dirty,Imagine what you think this place would be like and it is the absolute opposite.The boulevard is dirty and full on crazies. It is nice to see the stars on thr ground and the hand prints but it is a little scary.

10,A giant Slum in the Heart of Hollywood,"Between drug addicts,crazy homeless people (We had one try to sell us a baby rabbit - that was a weird and surreal experience) and the hustlers trying to separate you from your money it can be pretty unpleasant trying to take a few pictures of the Stars along the boulevard,of the shops we saw along the boulevard most were cramped and overpriced but with all the mayhem carrying on outside it's not like you'd want to announce the fact that you're a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooke138

10,Run Away,"Went down Hollywood Blvd and it is dirty and run down. There were people doing drugs right on the side walk, lots of homeless people and the worst part were the desperate musicians throwing their CD in your face...they are everywhere. The souvenir shops would have been nice but you can't look without the owner hovering. The wax museums were fun but the people on the street.....horrible. I will never go back & by the way don't carry a purse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Booboohand
30,Must see,"Well when LA this will be on your list. Just enjoy it for what it is, for each person that will be different.

30,unless you are a big fan of famous people this road sucks,"i like some of the footpath stars, the street was boring though, it was dirty, expensive parking, not much to see or do apart from walk and look down. basically you need to know someone who lives in los angeles, be a millionaire or be famous to have a good time around here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelsea1425
30,Not What You'd Expect,"Everything looks different on television and in the movies and Hollywood Boulevard is no exception. Others on this site have used the word ""seedy"" and I'd agree. To that I'd add ""very touristy,"" which shouldn't be surprising. There are lots of stores selling souvenirs, restaurants, and some well-known places. If you're in Los Angeles on a one-time visit, you shouldn't miss this, but there's no reason to go back. The further you get from the Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theater, the dumpier it gets. There's lots of relatively reasonable parking in lots around Hollywood Boulevard. We went in the morning and didn't have any problems finding parking or navigating the sidewalks. By late afternoon, the area was crowded with tourists. The salesmen hawking movie star homes tours are out bright and early and are somewhat aggressive. Public restrooms are few and far between.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsctraveler
50,The best Blvd in L.A,"The Blvd is a great place to go any day of the week but specially on the weekend, Its very lively and theres lots to see and do. Make sure you have ample storage in your cameras and pocket change for when you take pictures with all the different dress up characters on the Blvd. I recommend catching a movie at El Capitan Theatre or even the Chinese theatre. Dont miss all of your favorite Hollywood stars along the Blvd. Growing up and going to Hollywood high school nearby, there was always something fun to do at Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kedsbabe
30,Glitter,"Not sure .....Time Square wannabe??? Nice to see the Theater and the handprints, but the rest reminded me of a cheap version Las Vegas, Time Square....plenty of touristy shops and a mall....I think I may have expected more historic places and not an exploitatious strip....Two hours was way enough to cover the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SybilleW
30,Crowded and cheesy,"Imagine lots and lots of people. Nice and long palm trees. Garbage in the floor. Graphites in some walls. A myriad of people in oddly looking costumes. Neon lights. Jammed traffic. Plenty of tour operators in the walkway and some stars in the floor, all in line.More or less this is how it is Hollywood Boulevard.I ran into a friend of mine that happened to be visiting there. He wasn't liking it to much.I returned the later during my stay in LA because i wanted to give the place a second chance. I didn't think it was as bad when i returned and that's why i am giving it 3 stars.I think it is very overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorerFromToronto
20,Not nearly as glamorous as they make it sound!,"Basically this place is a dump! Besides the stars on the side walk, its not a great place to be. There are homeless people everywhere and constant annoyance of tour guides hounding you to take their tour. The tour people will literally swear at you if you refuse their flyer. I find it extremely rude as I am saving them paper when I know I will not visit their attraction. They will follow you and hound you so be sure, if visiting, to keep your wallet in FRONT of you locked up! I had my husband take his out of his back pocket and put in my purse, zipped up.Right around the popular area of hollywood boulevard where the stars have their hands in the ground is a so busy! There are all kinds of people dressed in various drag, costumes and will take a picture with you if you PAY! They will not tell you this up front but constantly say through their smile ""we work on tips"". My husband took a picture with a few gals dressed up in cop uniforms and between me taking the picture and walking away (about 30 seconds) they told us 3 times they work on tips and when we said okay and walked off they followed us! They got in our face and kept saying it. Finally I pulled out a dollar bill and they were so upset they stomped off. Be careful!Overall I wouldn't recommend this area. If you want to see it, go during the day and just look at a few stars along the boardwalk and head out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macbabe08
20,Too stressful!,"I guess if you are in LA you have to go, but walking around here was one of the most stressful experiences I have had. You can't move for being hassled by people trying to sell you CDs, get you to have a photo with someone in costume or give you leaflets for tours. One of the guys selling CDs wouldn't take no for an answer ( they put the cd in your hand then demand money) so it was really quite unpleasant. I certainly wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
20,Seedy,"Very touristy, lots of people stopping you for a tour or to buy something or the other. The shops had overpriced souvenirs. The people dressed as characters were interesting to look at, just don't try to take a photo of them - they'll want money. I've been now and not planning on going back. I'm glad I went with my husband as it didn't feel safe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueanniecamp
20,Scary at night,Do not go here at night. There was none of the glitz and class that you would associate with Hollywood on this street. AVOID AFTER DARK!! We took a cab back to our car after we walked about 4 blocks to a probably the only acceptable restaurant on this strip(Public kitchen and bar in the roosevelt). There were all creepy people walking way too close to you. There were people definitely on drugs having fights on the sidewalk.Walk down the busier end of the street during the day time... then go to sunset blvd or somewhere else at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MH9727
20,Several Bright Spots and Much to Like Surrounded by Filth,"Hollywood Blvd has come a long way in the last 10 years. The Kodak complex (Hollywood and Highland) and surrounds were a great addition. It added nice shopping, a great theater venue, great restaurants and much needed parking. Grauman's Chinese theater is still an amazing historical and architectural experience. The Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripley's believe it or not and the Guiness Book museum help transition you to the touristy and kitschy hollywood and the balance starts to get pretty filthily. Don't venture too far East with kids or teens or you will have to explain the window displays in the adult shops. Unless you are callus, you will also quickly be affected by the transient and underground population that is mostly tucked away during the day, but still very evident. This area is still the world capital of teenage runaways and teenage prostitution and the derilict and homeless population thrives as well. Unfortunately, there is really not much left that is truly glamorous left here. I would not discourage a visit to see it in this light, but with limited time in So Cal, this would not be high on my list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kumstone

10,So filthy!,"Really dissapointed. Couldn't believe how filthy Hollywood Boulevard was, how many homeless people and prostitutes were there and how many spruikers were chasing us to attend a tour.As the iconic, ""Hollywood"", I was expecting a glamour similar to Rodeo Drive - boy was I suitably shocked and also horrified that LA don't clean this part of town up to live up to the ""Movie Magic"" pull that is Hollywood.I also got a bit stoned from the second hand smoke of medicinal marijuana emitted by a number of locals as we walked the ""walk of fame"" ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mischiefdebs
30,The stars are worth to be seen but the boulevard is not that nice,"The boulevard is not as beautiful as they show ot on TV. It's not that clean and they are loads of people with old, dirty Batman or spiderman suits asking for money for a picture. In front of the chineese theather, there are guys putting a CD in your hand and ask money for it. But the stars are worth to be seen and pictured. Difficult sometimes to take pictures of your favorite stars as there are loads of people and there is often a foot at the time you take the pic.

20,Thought this was supposed to be cleaned up???????,"After Hollywood Highland opened the rest of the Boulevard was supposed to be brightened up. Then came the high-price clubs, with high-priced parking. These places are only open at night, so the street-scape during the day is dominated by metal roll-downs with movie stars faced painted on them. In an effort to make more money from parking the city has jacked up the meter rates, especially on weekends,so a trip to Hollywood Blvd. leaves you feeling gouged. And don't get hit by a skateboarder on the sidewalk. And watch out for the ""characters"" that hit you for $$ if you take a picture with the. The whole experience is totally down-market and there are no stores, even in Hollywood Highland, for people who live here. Fergedaboutit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayT917
20,Always too crowded and obnoxious,"I understand why tourists want to come and see it, but it's always packed with people around the Chinese Theater and Walk of Fame. It's hard to walk around. I like the Theater itself. I just wish I didn't have to battle so many people to get to it. And so many people dressed like super heroes take photos with tourists--this slows things down even more. Wish the sidewalks were bigger, but not sure that would even solve it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2Connelly

30,Enjoy the history! (Keep you eyes open...),"All Tourists and weekender Locals should visit Hollywood Blvd at least one time. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is magical. The history is fun. The people-watching is the best. But, wallets in the front pocket and don't take pictures of those costumed superheroes with expecting to tip them (they're known for their fist fights!). I suggest Hollywood & Highland, The Hard Rock Cafe for lunch and the Disney Soda Fountain for dessert. (Mel's Drive In is also good)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHSwift

30,Had higher expectations,First time visitors need only allow 45 - 60 minutes to see this part of LA. A high tourist trap area - head out to the gorgeous beaches and Runyon Canyon to see a beautiful and more memorable LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacJac82
40,A 'MUST SEE' IN LA,"You just can't go to LA and not visit Hollywood Boulevard, one of the most famous streets in the world!!!! We were on a 14-day coach trip and visited the area on a morning tour of Hollywood. This meant we only really had a 'snap shot' of it as we must have spent no longer than an hour there.We enjoyed seeing the hand and foot prints at the Chinese Theatre and the stars on the Walk of Fame. Also enjoyed walking up the steps of the Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak) where the Oscars are held, and seeing the Roosevelt Hotel where the first ever ceremony was held. The Hollywood and Highland complex had some nice shops and a good vantage point for viewing the famous Hollywood sign.The area was, needless to say, heaving with tourists, and also lots of people dressed up as characters who try to get you to pose with them for a photo and then charge you, so beware. But where else would you see 'Spiderman' waiting to cross at traffic lights!Madame Tussaud's is also on the street and Rilpey's Believe it or Not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DONNYLOVER
50,Touristy but fun,"If you are visiting LA then of course you will visit Hollywood Blvd. Interesting looking at the stars on the walk of fame and counting which of them you know. There are restaurant, theaters and shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT
30,"Tourist trap, but you've gotta do it once.","The theatres, the tourist shops, the vagrants dressed as various people you'd reconize, and the Hollywood tours. You have to see it once, I mean this is part of why you came to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jharks1979
10,Don't bother,"I suppose if you want to see the chinese theatre and the stars in the pavement then you have to go but on a three week road trip from the uk this was the most disappointing point of the whole trip. It is dirty, overcrowded, inhabited by a large number of people who have fallen on hard times (some of the sights where truly shocking and not what you expect from the richest nation in the world!) The shops are cheap and you are constantly approached by street sellers. Walking from Sunset Boulevard up to Hollywood Boulevard was the only time I felt slightly uncomfortable during the trip. Sorry to be so down on it but it really isn't worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHandS-Leics
30,Only worth a visit when you have low expectations or nothing else to do.,"Not so special. Fun to see though, but don't plan on spending much time here. If you like crappy imitations (Pokémons ""Team Rocket"" in clothes two sizes to big for instance) you can have a happy time here. Or when you enjoy to see how quick illegal food stalls can move away when they sense the presence of cops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessad791

30,Grotty,After visiting NY city I was suprised at how unclean this area was for such a tourist draw. The street acts were great and those who tipped could get great photos.

Hollywood Blvd is a blast if you wish it to be...good food, Hollywood folks (and you will know them)...just don't let all the sales folks trying to get you to go on every tour bother you.

30,Check it off the bucket list.,"I envisioned something much more glamorous than what I saw. Basically shopping and small shops with a sidewalk of stars.

10,Why God Why,"Just don't do it. There are no stars here. There are too many people here. There are no good restaurants or sights.

30,Take it or leave it....,"Glad we went but now that I have seen it I would say you can take it or leave it.It's a very busy street with shops and stars on the sidewalk. About 2500 stars to be exact.Other than that there are many street vendors, performers, and shady characters. This was part of a bus tour and in hindsight I would have preferred spending more time at The Grove.Seen it once and no desire to see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KingCityDancemom

30,"Nice to have been there, but...","Nice to have been there. Its famous and we have all seen it in movies/TV shows. But unless you are the type of persons that need a picture of every single famous persons handprint in the cement its not worth spending more than a few hours there.

20,Been there .... done that!,"When you visit LA for the first time you almost feel obliged to make a pilgrimage to Hollywood Boulevard because it’s the “ holy of holies “ of the Hollywood myth machine.Whilst I wouldn’t try to put anybody off from visiting it, I’m sure the Boulevard has seen better days. We had the sense of tackiness everywhere so that after walking around for a while we were glad to get back on the bus. The only thing that has stayed in our mind was a chance look inside the old Roosevelt Hotel with its gloomy Art Deco architecture and decor which seemed like the back-drop for a 1930’s movie.Unfortunately the sense of tackiness and ""deja vous"" seemed to persist for the rest of the visit, along Sunset Boulevard , Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive included. Luckily the tour guide of Amazing LA Tours, Phil, managed to deliver an amusing running commentry during the whole trip, so that even though the tour was boring we weren’t bored.The upshot of this trip, in our view, is, go to Hollywood Boulevard ""et al"" if you’ve never seen it, avoid it if you already have. We’re sure there are many other more interesting places to see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darwin1859
40,Foot Prints,Over here you get to see many foot prints on the cement of the movie stars. There were be people dressed up in different characters for you to take a picture with but tips is expected. There is really nothing much to see here or perhaps you could visit the wax museum. I guess I was looking forward to visit Universal Studios then :).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeginSingapore
50,Have to do Hollywood Boulevard,"You must start with the Footprints at Grauman's and then take in the Sony (formerly Kodak) center. Once you've exhausted that area, just walk East until you hit Vine on one side of the street and then cross the street and come back looking at the star's names at your feet, seeing the weird and normal people on the street and breathing in all the things we've seen in the movies all our lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latrvlr
40,Great place to people watch,Great to see all the characters about that you can have your photo taken with near to the Chinese theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caz_crock
40,It is its own culture,"Problem with Hollywood Blvd, at least in the ""busy"" area around Hard Rock, Dolby Theater (renamed from Kodak Theater as of this past Monday), Jimmy Kimmel's studio, and all, is on weekends, you will be hounded by tour companies. Take a day trip to some place, take a tour over here, see the homes of stars (seems more like stalking to me, but for some that may be fun), etc. It wasn't so bad on weekdays we walked along the Boulevard, but on the weekend it was passing up several tours per block. So be prepared to just keep on walking. Don't let them stop and hound you like I saw some poor foreigners at a stop light at some point. Tell them no means no, because they are persistent.The Boulevard itself is better kept towards the busier area. As you walk along the walk of fame, further you get out, more dirty and in disrepair it seems to be. Walked the whole thing this past weekend. It's still worth visiting and enjoying for what it is, at least once.Also, be aware that there are a lot of costumed characters out there. They cause a lot more traffic congestion in terms of walking than should be there. A lot of them are poorly dressed and if I had kids I wouldn't let them take pictures with them. But to each his own, if you enjoy that more power to you. Just be aware that they are lurking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MukuSix
50,I Love Hollywood!,"Hollywood Blvd is amazing. Sidewalk stars and Stars hand and foot prints, Grauman's Chinese Theater.

10,SCARY,"There should be warnings about walking down this street, I was approached by someone in a scary costume who, despite my averting my eyes, decided it was appropriate to get in my face. I screamed hysterically (I was terrified!) and had to return to the safety of my hotel, which was luckily only a block away.

30,Lots of traffic!,"drove through here just to say I saw it, very busy traffic, no place to park, lots of homelessness evident, garbage cans overflowing, some neat buildings to see, never saw a celebrity, sirens every 1 minute. Not really worth it unless your into this type of attraction, the palace pier and santa monica was more worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andypegonthego
40,Hollywood Heritage Walking Tour,"There's no Trip Advisor listing for this great little tour so I'm putting it under the Hollywood Boulevard search. It's run by the local historical preservation society and your guide will be a volunteer. It's educational and will give you an insight into the story behind the buildings. Don't miss the tiny bar The Frolic Room, with its great old mural of famous caricatures. Our entertaining guide was George, a designer for stage and screen, so it was great to get a local's perspective. Not a tour for kids or star spotters, they would be bored. Top value at only ten bucks. http://www.hollywoodheritage.org/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntyJoy
20,Disappointed - Reminds me of pre-Giuliani NYC,"Disappointed - Reminds me of pre-Giuliani NYC.What you will find there:1. Homeless people urinating and harrassing you2. Run-down buildings with exceptions3. Historic, cool venues and building separated by a lot of liquor stores, tatoo shops, lingerie shops, and souvenir shops that gouge you or falsely advertise sales that are about to end, but actually never do end4. Shady people in customes that want to earn a living by getting you to pay for pictures with them,,,guess it is a living for them. I would not want my kids near those guys5. Crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrobertlucas

20,The crowds will slow you down,"If you live in LA, avoid Hollywood Blvd. The crowds WILL slow you down even more than the normal traffic, and it's frequently blocked for premieres. If you're visiting and there is a premiere, don't expect to get close enough to see anything.Also, Hollywood Blvd is choked with gaudy tattoo shops, trinket shops, adult ""book"" stores, and bong shops. The trashiness of Hollywood can really come out here at night, too, as this is club central, where you get to pay a high cover charge to go hit on girls who are too drunk to take home in good conscience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596aarong
50,Fun Place,"It was fun to drive, explore and people watch! Hollywood and Vine to see stars imrinted in sidewalk, Beverly Hills to look at stars homes.

30,Hollyweird Booleevard you say?,"Since I had to be in the area anyway, I could not help noticing that there was more hype than hip.

20,Very Dissapointed,"We were on Hollywood Blvd.March 10th.We were shocked at how run down it was. The street vender's were would not leave us alone. The walk of fame was interesting but even someof those were in bad shape. { SOME WERE MAJOR STARS.} The sign was really neat to see in person as, was the Kodak Theatre.

30,Hollywood Once--Holly-wouldn't twice,"It was great to be on Hollywood Boulevard and to see the stars on the Walk of Fame. Each of us five got excited about different ones and wanted pictures of our favorites. The sad thing was that within 15 seconds of our parking and beginning to make our way down the sidewalk a guy approached my 16 year old who was a few steps ahead of us and asked him if he wanted to buy drugs. A little way down the road we were met with another group of people that had my husband corralling our kids--(older teens) because they were sort of aggressive and very interested in our girls.We loved seeing the Kodak theater and loved that they were setting up for a movie premier a couple of hours away for The Vow. Overall, we are glad we went, but feel no desire to ever return. It was pretty dirty, lots of pretty sad down-on-their-luck people who probably embody the Hollywood dream gone wrong.Great for people watching because there are lots of, um, freaky folks that were very entertaining, but still freaky.

40,"Walk, Don't Drive","It's so much better to walk because you can stop and stare and not worry about rear-ending someone or vice versa. You can check out the stars on the ground. Feel free to take pictures with costumed folks, but pay a fee. Much more fun to go at night because of the lights. Plenty of places to check out like Grauman's Chinese Theater or even be in the audience for a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live. There's a parking structure on Higland and Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenacostasp
30,Finding the magic of the Hollywood that never was and always will be,"It's a shame that so many people land here and expect to find Rodeo Drive. The key to a 1st time visit here is ""editing."" I would recommend the stretch from Orange to Highland.You also get what you pay for...if you want free, just check out the Chinese Theater courtyard (a worthy stop) and move on to Beverly Hills and the beach. You can spend as little or as much time here as you want. For classic old Hollywood glam, check out the Roosevelt Hotel lobby (reminds me of Disney's Tower of Terror Hotel) and its classic 50s pool.The Renaissance pool deck has nice views as well. Like many downtowns, nice bathrooms are at nice restaurants and nice hotels.I'm a hardcore movie fan (majored in film) and I loved the quaint Hollywood Museum in the beautiful Art Deco Max Factor building. For a peek ""behind the scenes"" I enjoyed the Kodak Theater tour (where they give you the scoop on the Oscar Awards production.) Seeing a film in either Disney's El Capitan or the Chinese Theater (main theater, not the cineplex) is a step back to the ""Golden Age"" if you can spare the time. If you're not as into movies, Tusseaud's Wax Museum is a world class attraction worth the premium ticket. Someday I'd love to return to try out the Cirque show ""Iris"" at the Kodak Theater and a musical at the Pantages.I did the Hollywood Citypass and couldn't fit it all in in a day. The Starline Tour thru the Hollywood Hills to Sunset Strip to Beverly Hills was fun and I only felt slightly cheesy for doing it.Hollywood isn't for everyone. If you're not into the messy vitality of cities you might want to stick with a studio tour (I'd do Warner Brothers without kids or Universal if you're with kids), or just go to Disneyland and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpcotPlanner

40,a must see for visitors,It's really cool to walk down a street you've seen numerous times in tv and film. The only real draw back to the area is the occasional aggressive costume character or CD peddler. The street has a lot of character.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet

50,"If you don't like it, you don't get it","Its true. Hollywood, in person, doesn't look or seem anything like what you've likely seen in the movies and on tv. For decades, Hollywood has had a seedy, decadent quality to it. When I moved here in the late 90's I was disillusioned, to say the least. The streets were filthy, people were shot outside of my building, bums and homeless punk rockers were everywhere. There was NO ""glitz"" as you might put it. Over the years, much has been done to improve and beautify the main drag of Hollywood blvd. Much of it has been commercialized more than beautified, with the addition of a new mall, Kodak Theater and corporate business like Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters. Most of the homeless and panhandlers are gone (though there are still some) and much has been done to upgrade the image of Hollywood blvd. Also, much has been done to make this a safer place. Its heavily patroled, and, at one time was touted to use more surveillance cameras than any (most?) places in the country. If you cant see the difference between the Hollywood of the 90's and the Hollywood of today....then you didn't really come here. As for the negative reviews I've seen posted here, I have to say ""This is Hollywood."" Not the Hollywood you've seen in the movies, but the REAL Hollywood, where those movies were made. The Hollywood that inspired those movies. And YES, you may be disillusioned. Hollywood isn't an amusement park. If thats what you're looking for, you may be better off going to Universal Studios, and calling it a day, because the truth is, 95% of Hollywood exists for the people who LIVE in Hollywood. It's still essentially a seedy place. It's not a place to bring your kids. Remember that most of the people you see, live and work here and unless they're in a service industry, have nothing to do with making tourists happy. If you wish to visit Hollywood, my suggestion is that you come with an open mind, and enjoy it for what it is. This is the REAL Hollywood, with much to do and enjoy, once you drop your expectations. If you want, you can dis it. Or you can simply come and see how we live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyB80

Once you've seen it that's really it. Since the first time I went here in 1992 until now the Boulevard has become more crowded, more dirty and filled with more or less amusing look-alikes of everything from Elmo to Jack Sparrow, the latter being actually quite good and almost fooling the kids. The sad figure who had donned a really bad rubber Hulk suit however didn't fool anyone - more scary in fact!If you're looking for a particular star in the pavement good luck - and the hand/foot prints in fron of Graumanns don't change that much.

I drove down the boulevard, but didn't get out, because it didn't even look safe. I've often wondered, reading articles about tourist attractions in the L.A. area, why Hollywood Boulevard is rarely mentioned amoung them, given it's fame. Now I know why.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertAS12
50,"Gave me one of the best days of my life, so exciting.","Was not too impressed with Hollywood at first, but then fell in love with it. So exciting, always something going on, something to see or a celeb appearance. What made it for me was when i got asked if i wanted to go in the audience of the Jimmy Kimmel show, & sat 15ft away from David Beckham & Wes Craven, i was buzzing after & will never forget my stay in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jools490
30,Cheesy but fun,"Its a fun walk from the Chinese Theater down to Hollywood and Vine to check out the stars. It's very touristic and most shops are cheesy. However, there are some nice art deco buildings along the way, including some old movie theaters. I can recommend have a bite at Umami Burger just off Vine and Hollywood. There is also a great record shop (Amoeba) just one block down on Sunset and Cahuenga.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karabiber
40,Tramp central,"Was great to finally see Hollywood after only ever seeing it on tv. The walk of stars, the Chinese theatre etc. 1 major complaint. Too many beggars pestering for money. One even came in mcdonalds and the staff did nothing. For such a iconic tourist hotspot I find it astonishing that this is allowed to go on. Where are the police.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bintheredunthat08
10,Scariest Place I have ever been,I have travelled the world with my friend and we have been to many places but I have to say Hollywood is the scariest place I have ever been. Hollywood boulevard is nothing but a dump with tramps form one end to the other it was a horrible place that i will never return to. Beverly Hills on the other hand was a lovely place that i will return to but never again will i go to see the tramp ridden place that is Hollywood boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Girlytraveller25
20,Hollywood Boulevard,"We parked in a multi-level lot on Cherokee Ave near Hollywood blvd. It was a decent location but I wished I would have parked in the city lot adjacent to the Kodak theater. That one is much nicer and has bathrooms. This one was pretty seedy and $2.50 per half hour with a $10.00 daily maximum. It is always fun to walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame because it is cool to see the different names of people who have worked in the entertainment industry. My son and I really enjoyed it. We wanted to go into some stores but needed to find a bathroom badly. We had to walk about 10 blocks to the Mc Donalds before we finally found one and that one was really dirty with pee on the seat and everything. Plus it only had two stalls. We wound up eating there before going further. I would have rather gone down further to Baja Fresh to eat (across from the Chinese theater) but we were already there at Mc Donalds. After eating, we stumbled upon the Ripley's Believe it or not Museum. I liked the one in the Dallas area of Texas much better. This one was much smaller and pretty run down. We also went to the Guiness World Records museum. It had a broken seat in one of their mini auditoriums and a bathroom stall door completely missing. It was also very outdated. For instance, it has a big wall about the worlds largest ocean liner and it was from around 2002-2006 I believe. Other records were also very old. You can obviously tell that they have not put any money into this place for a very long time. The third place we saw was the wax museum (all three places were for one admission). That place had the nicest bathrooms and the wax mannequins were ok. However, when we saw the lobby of Madame Toussad's wax museum we had wished we had gone there instead. We found a decent pizza, I think it was called Luigi's. But the booths were ripped and again the place was badly in need of an upgrade. In front of the Kodak theater it was packed with tourists (it is next to Graumman's Chinese Theater)and all kinds of people dressed in your favorite characters like Spiderman and even Michael Jackson (his star is just to the left of the Chinese Theater) The mall where the Kodak Theater is is very nice but pretty upscale. You will find good restaurants in there and very nice shops. There is even a nice spot toward the back upstaris where you can get a good photo of the Hollywood sign.My main beef about Hollywood boulevard is the total lack of public bathrooms. I KNOW we would have bought a lot more stuff at the shops if the community had public bathrooms. So park in the garage behind the Kodak theater because you will find bathrooms in there or arrive hungry so you can eat somewhere and use their bathroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akidcagal
40,Best Free Thing To Do In LA!,"I read the ""not worth a special trip"" review, but went anyway.HAD A BLAST (we love people watching, the best area to do so!)Stop and visit with the people/characters, most of them are nice folks ( are few are jerks!). A special nod to wonder woman and superman!..super people!.Easy walk as everything is pretty much within 2 blocks of the theater.Stop at the baja fresh for cheap/good food. As an added bonus you are a short drive from Beverley Hills and Rodeo drive.Parking sucks! best bet if you do not want to pay to park..just drive around the block awhile until something turns up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truckin-bob
50,Must see for movie buffs,"I just came from my dream vacation which took me throught three states but my first stop was at the movie capital of the world. I arrived late at night so I had to wait for the next morning but it was met. I went with my my daughter and mother along and we parked a block away from the chinese there which later I learned I could had saved nearly $10 bucks if I would have parked at the highland parking garage and validated the parking ticket by just buying a soda at one of the stores. We started walking and the first thing we were happy about was seeing the famous walk of stars, to someone that only has seen it on tv and the movies for decades and finally getting the chance to experiece it is quite dramatic. We took many pictures and I used my brand new hard drive camcorder which was the perfect place to take. We crossed the street to the kodak but I first wanted to get to the chinese theater first. We we got there we notice the place was being prepared for the premiere of MI3. So we manage to take pictures and video of half of the footprints but it was full of people, also there were people in full custumes portraying movie characters. It was a perfect opportunity to take pictures, they to ask for a tip but all you really need is a dollar and it is worth it. We toured all of the remaing highland complex and continued down hollywood blvd untill we reached the vine which had the famouse capital records building and across the street you can see the panteges where movies like judy garland- a star is born premiered. This is definitely the heart and soul of hollywood. I explored many other places but this was for the hollywood blvd experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prmass
20,Not worth making a special trip,"As a LA local, I am always mystified by the tourists wandering around Hollywood Boulevard. While the “Walk of Fame” is an icon, and featured in movies and pop music, it's not particularly a nice place to hang out in LA. The Mann's Chinese Theater is fun because you can see the foot prints and hand prints of celebrities, but the stars along the street don't capture anything about the people they represent. Unless you are in the area for a show at the Kodak or the Pantageous, or there so see a movie at one of the old theaters like the Mann's Chinese, I don't think it's worth the bother of going there. The shopping at Hollywood & Highland is not that great. And the smaller stores are good for only for gawking at the hideousness. That is, unless you are in the market for junky trinkets or a wig/platform heels/spandex marketed to prostitutes and drag queens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VC1850
