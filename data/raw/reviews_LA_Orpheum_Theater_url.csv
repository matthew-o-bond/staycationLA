50,Beautiful Theater,"I have been to this theater before for a movie showing, this time it was for a live show. The theater is absolutely beautiful and completely restored to its original state. There is not bad seat, even in the balcony, you can see, hear and enjoy the show. If you are able to go, definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellstar4
50,Beautiful Beaux Arts styling,"Unveiled in 1926, it underwent a major renovation beginning in the late 1980s. Thus it is the best preserved movie theatre on Broadway.With gorgeous Beaux Arts styling it makes for a striking picture, especially if viewed from across the street.It now hosts concerts, movie premiers and is also a popular setting for film and video scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Awesome venue!,Gorgeous theatre - loved how small it was! Nice seats with cup holders - sound was good. Calexico & Iron and Wine were fantastic 😆,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SailMeerkat
50,David Foster Show was the bomb,"Have seen several shows here, but David Foster PBS special was the greatest show yet. If nothing else you must go just to see the theater itself and all of its old time glory. not a bad seat in the house. Downtown so Parking in sometimes hit or miss and gotta get there early due to traffic but soooooo worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179pamt
50,What a classic,"Had the pleasure of attending a Snarky Puppy concert (my son's birthday present). The staff were kind and helpful. The theater was a flash to the past (20's I think) that made it hard for me to keep my eye on the entertainment. It's gorgeous, well maintained and acoustically sound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizB754
50,David Gray is coming this June!,I am so excited to see David Gray here. I have seen him in this venue before and is AWESOME! The theater is beautiful and acoustics are awesome! There is great parking too. It is a smaller theater and more intimate than many others - thus the specialness of the venue. I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE HIM in this location!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kikisd2018
40,Great old style theater,I really enjoyed going to the orpheum theater. The scariest part about going to the theater is if you miss it and you turn down the wrong street it gets kind of shady in downtown LA real quick. I'm seeing stand up comedian is before here as well as concerts. We always have such a good time hanging out in the evening in downtown LA and enjoy a great show and a great staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
50,Throw back in time,"Built in the 20's and still amazing today, an awesome place to see any show that is there. Saw Neil Schon's Journey through time what an amazing night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3006PJmichaelb
50,Great Little Venue,"This is such a great little venue! We were there for a concert, and it really didn't matter where you sat, the view is awesome--you are so close to the stage. I love the dècor of yesteryear, so classic! I am sure this place has been worked on, 'cause it looks pristine! It's got it's own lounge and bar/snack area. I was delighted. If there is one comment that will tarnish this review it's that the seats (leg room) are not very comfy after a while--tall people beware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricsandimas
50,"Oh my, so fantastic","What a gorgeous place to see a concert. Little security when we walked in which I didn't like but other than that, its a wonderful place. Old school. Love the marquee outside. The acoustics are great. The Orpheum Club for drinks is super fun, open to anyone. Lots of restrooms. Clean. Seats very close to the seats in front of you and I am a small person. Loved it and the decor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovept
50,A Beautiful Old Theater that Reminded Me of the East Coast Theaters of My Youth,"Attended a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS victims and families providing housing and support. The opulence of the theater was an appropriate venue for the ""Best in Drag"" competition put on that evening. Whatever the reason for visiting this restored gem of the past you will not be disappointed. As a movie venue it would be excellent but it shines when presenting live theatre of any type. When back in this area and a live production is offered we would not hesitate to attend again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9dietz

50,"Beautiful, classy & opulent venue","This is a very classy, lavish, nostalgic, intimate, well-maintained, old theatre. It first opened in 1926. It is primarily used for movie premieres, live concerts/events, and location shoots. The sound quality is amazing. The ceiling, walls, and hanging chandeliers have a rich, opulent look. The seats are comfortable. The theatre has a beautiful, large lobby area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer

50,One of the Most Gorgeous Interiors,"Holy smokes, the Orpheum is absolutely GORGEOUS! My breath was taken away when I got to my seat. I don't think there was a bad seat in this entire venue and hope that I get to come back one day. There is parking not too far away in multiple locations. The area it is in could be a bit more desirable as there is a lot of trash on the sidewalks and many homeless as well. I would definitely come to the Orpheum for another event as it is such a gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robonski
50,Robert Plant and the sensational space shifters!,"Love this venue! I am a native Angeleno and moved out to another part of Southern California 30 years ago. I went to school here and work here, and this area of downtown LA(DTLA) Has been undergoing rehabilitation and resurgence over several years. This is a theater designed in the 20s that has been immaculately restored. Many great, iconoclastic performers in the performance arts have come to the Orpheum for decades.I forgot about the Orpheum until I saw Beck a couple of years ago. Now I look for acts I would like to see at the Orpheum. I make it and event. I book a hotel, come a little early to find some nice food and whatever flavor food you want nearby, then see the show. Have a nice mini staycation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33nicks
50,"Beautiful Theater, Great Staff.","The Orpheum Theater is stunning. It is totally redone to look like it did when it was built as a vaudeville house in the late 20's. Every detail is seen to, every piece of wood perfected, all of it beautiful. If you are ever in LA, this is a must stop. They have concerts, plays, ballet and movies now and again. At night, the neon lights up and takes you to a far gone era.Every seat is a gem. I prefer the Orchestra to the Mezzanine, but all the seats are very good and pretty comfortable. The Mezzanine has a sharp incline and that can be a tad trying for a play. For a concert it is great.They have a full bar, great bathrooms and several places to get snacks or whatever is being sold that night.The staff is amazing. I love them! They are kind, patient and helpful.Last night we took our grandson to see Robert Plant. Our grandson is 11 years old and has special needs. He loves music. Upon entering the theater all go through security and, of course, security needed to ""wand"" our grandson. Normally this is not an issue, but for whatever reason, he was having no part of it. He was afraid of the wand, the security employee and thought someone was going to touch him. He began the sad process of what we call melting down. Security immediately reconized this little boy had an ""issue"" with the wand. Instead of inflaming the situation Security calmly addressed us and our grandson. They were able to calm a child who was about to lose it. Security was able to do their job and help a little boy calm himself so he could have a great night. It is not often that people notice or are trained to deal with people with special needs.Upon entering, all employees were so nice to our grandson. They assisted in seating and were so friendly to him. One employee was walking around offering hearing protection, something I have never seen at a venue. I think that is just great.You will love The Orpheum. It is the best place to see an event. Parking is also easy. It is right behind the building and a short walk to the theater. Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Awesome,"This place is awesome. The courtesy, professionalism, attitude. All that. It seems like everyone in their employ is happy . That says something about management. These people are obviously allowed to make judgement calls in an instant and just make things happen. They went out of their way to make our trip there a pleasantly memorable one, and they succeeded.If the owners don’t offer profit sharing to that group of men and women they should. It would be money well spent.To explain briefly. G-3 was on the menu. Satriani being my wife’s demigod......at least, and a meet n greet was scheduled with photos and signings. A really big deal to anyone into quality guitar playing and composing, but such a deal to her as she’d walk though a mile of burning glass.So we get to LA hours ahead of time and call in to verify everything. We’re told that the meet n greet is gonna be late, 5:30 instead of 3:30, so no big deal, we hang out in the parking lot 100 yards away around the corner.We show up and are told that we’re late, it was at 5;00. Imagine what may have happened had security, and event staff of every level not jumped into action without a wasted breath.These people did it all and made it happen in a fashion that would make a person believe that they are their only customer.Thanks folks, and thanks to the astonishing trio of guitar masters. Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, and Phil Collen. Quite the bunch of senior citizens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabs1369
50,An incredible concert theater,"I thoroughly enjoy visiting all the vintage theaters in Los Angeles, with the Orpheum not leaving me disappointed. The vintage architectural design is incredible, besides there is not a bad seat in the house. For sure a trip back in time! Can't wait for another excuse to come for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pjveetwin
50,Beautiful Historical Theater,I love the ambience and the detailed nostalgic design of this theater. It put you in the feeling of being in the original theaters from the past. It is very well kept and clean as well. Love this theater. Although there is parking available at nearby lots within walking distance I preferred to use Uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelibradiva
50,Stunning Theater! (Bob's Burgers Live),"I'm a sucker for the grandeur of these classic theaters and The Orpheum was something really special. Gorgeous lights and marquee. Amazing detail in the old ticket booth. Grand lobby and foyer. Really beautiful auditorium and space.Conveniently located near several large parking lots and tons of good bars and restaurants, it's easy to take in a nice dinner, show, and cocktail.Saw Bob's Burgers: Live at this venue which was absolutely phenomenal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink

40,Comedy Central taping of Kevin Hart's The Next Level,"I did my due diligence and read quite a lot of reviews before I went to this theatre because I wanted to know what I was in for. I made the mistake of getting sucked into a review that talked about how horrible the leg room was and how poorly placed the cupholders were..........WELLLL, I think that reviewer must never have been to the Staples Center, Oracle Arena, etc. and so on, to see a sporting or musical event because I can tell you, I am a 6'0"" woman, my son is 6'6"" and when we sat in the plush seats and when our knees weren't shoved up into our larynges, we were delighted!!!! I am used to sitting sideways at every venue I got to - and here, I DIDN'T HAVE TO! OH GLORY DAYS! The leg room was very good. We were sitting on the floor, maybe 10-12 rows back from the stage and the view was completely unobstructed even with all seats in front of us filled. I read the brief history of the theatre prior to going in, so I was just in awe sitting there and knowing that Judy Garland, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, little Stevie Wonder, and many more, had performed on that very stage. It felt really neat to be a part of that. , I hadn't been here before so I'm not sure how the theatre has looked historically, but I see that many people are saying it was recently renovated - anyway, it is beautiful, just beautiful. I can't speak to refreshments because I didn't have any - but I did make my way down the stairs to the ladies room which had me walking through a super cool lobby below. Because I didn't have the opportunity to have refreshments or see every part of the theatre is the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, but with regards to seating, ambiance, sound quality, and view, it was absolutely magnificent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanaM1091
50,Lewis Black,"The Orpheum Theatre has been completely restored to its former glory, and is a cozy, quaint and intimate venue for comedy performances. The sight lines are clear and unobstructed with clear views throughout the theater. The seats have all been updated and include drink holders in front of each seat. The sound system is amazingly well done without any echo or feedback. Lewis Black simply killed it in his performance. Since we are now living in an alternate universe the lines between the daily news and comedy have basically been obliterated as was so comically demonstrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matth733
40,Great venue,Recently renovated. We always enjoy going to the Orpheum Theater. Plenty of parking nearby. Well worth the drive into the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaGarboFranklyn
50,Concert- Gregory Porter,"Building was built in 1926 was used on the vaudeville circuit and silent films. It houses 1 of the few organs used in that area. The acoustics in building is heavenly. Staff is excellent, seats are comfortable. My only complaint is the parking and that's not because of the Theater; downtown LA is just a happening place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monbuf52
40,Tedeschi Trucks,Saw Tedeschi Trucks perform. The venue has an old Hollywood charm in Downtown LA. We sat in one of the balconies off to the side. Good sound system. This area is becoming rejuvenated so there's lots of good eateries around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isunwin
50,BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS ON STAGE - THE MAJESTY TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY!,"It really doesn't stand out from the street, in fact it looks just like a theatre. That is until you walk inside. I have never seen such beauty as this reconstructed edifice to the arts. Nothing modern can compete with the paintings and statues and even the stage curtain makes you pause and try to absorb it all at once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
40,Beautiful venue,Saw a rock/pop concert here. The theatre itself is gorgeous. Sound was good. Sight lines from floor were good. Nice little bar lobby area for pre-show drinks. Even had a funky little taco spot for a quick dinner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaHMansfield
50,Great venue,"This is a beautiful old theater, built in the 1920s. It is well maintained and clean. We sat in the mezzanine and the view of the stage was great. If you are short, this is the place for you since the stadium seating allows you to see very well no matter who sits in front of you. There are lots of stairs here, going down to the bar area as well as up to the mezzanine and balconies. For those who need or prefer an elevator, you will be treated to an old fashioned attended elevator that is the size of small room. It certainly brought back memories...yes, I am that old that I remember when elevators had operators. Also, the theater is accessible on public transit. We decided to park at the train station and take the Metro Blue Line to downtown. The walk to the theater is less than a mile and you pass lots of restaurants and bars. The downtown area is rather seedy at night, but I was born and raised in the city, so I was not intimidated by it. I highly recommend this theater should you have reason to attend a show there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwillard
50,Beautiful,"This is a stunningly beautiful theater. Outside, the marquis is lit up like Vegas and the inside is ornate and gorgeous. We sat in the front row, mezzanine, and got an amazing view from our seats.The sound is great. Location is close to Staples Center and LA Live. We stayed at the Milner Hotel and had a short walk to the Orpheum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mslaylalayla
50,Ben folds concert in world class venue,Fantastic intimate venue. I saw Ben folds and ymusic.

40,Something to be prepared for - cash only bar,"The Orpheum Theater is a famous old theater and is a beautiful building inside and out, but to get there was scary.It was in a crappy part of old downtown Los Angles although everyone said it was the “hipster” part of town (it smelled like piss and greasy tacos, no real restaurants around to eat at, etc.).Know the bar is cash only!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyRichie

40,Celtic Thunder,"I have been a Celtic Thunder fan for years now, when I heard they were coming to LA I had to get tickets. As I walked into the theater with my mom and younger cousin we were in awe of the beauty of the theater. The ceilings were beautiful and lighting was terrific. However, the seats were a little to tight for fitting. As the performance was fantastic, couldn't help but to worry about the guys and hoping they wouldn't run into each other on the stage. Very tight fit for them. The staff was not the friendliest but overall it was a great experience to watch them perform.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mafprincess
50,CELTIC THUNDER - GREAT SHOW!,"Have watched Celtic Thunder on PBS for a few years, but nothing could have prepared us for the group actually performing live on stage - they were great! The opening drums set the stage and it only gets better after that.The instrumentals and backup performers all did their part and really help make the show what it is - it is awesome!Get your tickets early and spend the money to sit up close and personal.Go see it when you can!Hope this helps.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3678JOHN
40,Annie Lennox - PBS Recording,"Was lucky to have a seat for the Annie Lennox PBS Recording in January.The theatre had been in blackout since Xmas, but was brought back to life beautifully for this extraordinary concert.Seats were comfortable, acoustics were good, not great. The theatre is however beautiful.Queues for drinks were too long at the interval, but quite honestly when aren't they!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_G_1970
50,Classic Theater,"The Orpheum is an amazing old theater from the early days of Los Angeles. You wouldn't expect how ornate and fancy it is inside by the look of it on the outside.We lived almost across the street from the Orpheum for a year and it was so great that we were able to see a couple shows there. There's nothing like walking to a show, getting dinner afterwards next door at Umami and getting home in 2 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddHata
50,Dream Theater,"My first venture into LA was to this historic theater to watch my favorite band perform an evening with Dream Theater, and I was not disappointed at all. While I know not much of the history of this location I honestly spent the time of the opening doors to the beginning of the show exploring the details of the theater. While we sat on the last aisle on the floor seating, the sight to the stage was great and not bad for a short guy like me. The theater's acoustics in my opinion was exceptional, the lighting was soft and mellow for a rock concert. The styling of the theater feels like a flash to the past and I was walking around mesmerized by the decor and style of the theater. I hope to have another chance to visit this theater for another show of some sort in the near future. Thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danimal3474
40,Great location but...,"The theater is beautiful, you can’t get a bad seat, and the sound is excellent the only down side is they only take cash! So if you want anything to eat or drink bring cash because they don’t take credit or debit cards",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pda575

10,BEWARE OF OBSTRUCTED VIEW SEATS FULL PRICE,"3/6/13. THIS IS ABOUT THE VENUE AND HOW THE EMPLOYEES TREAT THEIR PAYING GUESTS. (HINT-NOT WELL) Looks like they haven’t finished the renovations in the women's bathroom downstairs, and that was the highlight of my evening tonight at the Orpheum. The show started after 8, I left there at 9 and I got home well before 10PM as I write and I live in South Orange County and I did not speed. I spent $125 to see YES row F seat 35. I had to be one of the first to purchase my ticket since rows A-E was for those opting for meet & greet. BEWARE. Seats on the extreme sides CANNOT SEE THE STAGE OR THE SCREEN. There are balconies overhanging and the seats are too far out that I could not see Steve Howe or Geoff Downes, who I came to see. There should not even be seats there-at least the last 3 seats in my row could not see the middle to left of the stage or screen. Someone came over to me before the show and wanted to know what I could see because he was sitting in my seat tomorrow night 3/7/13. I told him not much. He advised me to search out a guy in black with an earpiece and he is usually a manager, they keep house tickets on the side. It gets worse. Either the people there are incompetent or are poor at playing a game and lying because I was not fooled. In fact what happened at the end p****ed me off because JO Joel security who probably dropped out of school for this high end job made it worse and had the smirk on his face that he was throwing his low testosterone around and mistreating a 59 year old woman. I hope it made him feel powerful in his own small world. I spoke to no less than 6 people before I talked to the supposed general manager Ed, who was standing less than 2 feet away from the 1st person I spoke to who opened the door without scanning my ticket and sending me to the ticket booth. I got grilled while trying to get back inside. Told I had to talk to the usher, no this person then that person on & on. I finally got to explain my situation, he went to talk to someone 2 FEET AWAY, said he had no tickets, to come back to see him during the show possibly someone wont show up. People were coming in ridiculously late and standing in the aisles watching the show. Cant believe this is allowed. People taking seats and moving up & around very distracting. The people sitting in front of me said they were supposed to be sitting next to me. Well, she was playing air piano 3 feet above her head, and the guy to my right in their real seats appeared homeless. Now it is time to get up and go talk to Ed. I am talking to the blonde woman with glasses ""guarding"" the entrance to aisle 1. I asked her about Ed. I tell her that I cant see and that it is BS. She says I should get a refund. Shouldn’t have shot her mouth off by sympathizing with me JO Joel security comes by. She says he is Ed. He says he is Ed. I say no, this is Joel. Well, I guess they didn’t like that much, JO Joel tell me that ""You don’t need to take it out on her"" which I wasn’t, it is called a conversation, something that he has never had. JO Joel security says he is calling him now. He wasn’t. Fat guy with glasses and dark hair asks me for my ticket, goes upstairs, comes downstairs with a ticket-one that I was told earlier that none existed. I am sorry, by this time I had enough, I have had 3 back surgeries, I cant be walking around here there and all over only in their attempt to jerk me around. JO Joel security refuses to allow me to talk to Ed or maybe Ed couldn’t be bothered, in which case he lied-again. JO Joel security tells me to complain to Live Nation. Well, Live Nation, didn’t install the balcony, or the seats in such a way and so far out to the sides that you cannot see the stage. My intention as I told blonde to let Ed know that these *** should be marked*** ""obstructed view"" ***and not be charged full price.*** Bottom line. GO TO THE WILTERN, BETTER ARCHITECTURE, A BUILDING IN BETTER SHAPE, BETTER EMPLOYEES, A BETTER TIME .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71Deanna71

My only complaint was that at the basement bar there was only one bartender and a line at least 30 people deep (that's the only reason it doesn't get a 5/5). He probably could have used some help.
