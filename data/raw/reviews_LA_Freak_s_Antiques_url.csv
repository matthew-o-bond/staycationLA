40,Interesting place,"Very interesting antique store with freaky decor and medical instruments antiques, etc. Knowledgeable proprietor. Good parking. Wheelchair access would be difficult but other handicap access is possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448adrianat
40,"""Very unusual, never seen any place like it.""","If you want to see a Howdy Doody Puppet, a coffin with a doll in it, old surgical equipment, dolls hanging from a fake tree limb, an ancient embalming table then this is the place. Believe me there is much more to be purchased and seen. It is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epuya
