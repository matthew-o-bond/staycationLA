50,"Thanks to my intagram-loving daughter, we saw this special place","Our 12-year old daughter wanted to go here because she found it on Pinterest. I am so grateful to her for suggesting it - what a beautiful place, far from the hustle and bustle of LA, but with gorgeous views of the Hollywood sign and quiet nature. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7496KPjenniferd
50,A surprising find in the heart of LA!,"This is a wonderful walk and an amazing view. Up the windy road from the city only a mile or two, it feels like you are in a different world. Go most of the way around the reservoir (can't make a full circle) or just a short walk across the dam. Either way, it's well worth your time. It's even free! What's not to like? Great for solo walkers, photographers, couples or families. We saw all of these on our time there. At the entrance, there is a porta-potty and none other on the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401barryw
50,"Hollywood sign, FaZe house, away from the tourist traps","Only went here as our teenage son wanted to see the FaZe house where professional gamers live. It is right next to the reservoir. Glad he made us make the trip.This is a hidden gem. We were the only ones there mid week but apparently gets crowded with 2000+ people in weekend.The was the closest and clearest view of the Hollywood sign (much closer than Griffith) and a relax hiking destination.Super friendly ranger just happened to be on hand and was full of info. He pointed out some celebrity houses, explained history of the reservoir and some quirky stories, like when it was closed so that President Clinton could jog the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
50,Great walk with reservoir and Hollywood sign views,We wanted a pleasant level walk with good views of the Hollywood sign. It was a hot day so we decided against the 3.5 mile hike up the hills to the actual location of the Hollywood sign. The 3.5 mile walk around the reservoir was a perfect choice. We saw some amazing properties and got some great photos of the Hollywood sign. There was ample free roadside parking from the reservoir drive and the view from the dam was unimpeded by the fencing which surrounds most of the reservoir.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
50,You'd never know you were in Los Angeles,"This oasis is one of the best kept secrets in town, and you'd never guess it was in the heart of Hollywood. The towering pines and freshwater breeze off of the water make you feel like you've been transplanted to upstate New York, or maybe even Vermont. There's no better place to escape LA's concrete jungle.It's one of the best spots in town to photograph the Hollywood sign, and keep your camera in hand, because you may also see full size deer, turtles, dragonflies, rabbits, owls, hawks, foxes, coyotes, and if you're really lucky, the area's resident bob cat.Built in 1924, the dam is another iconic William Mulholland project. It has two reservoirs; an small upper that then feeds into a much larger lower lake. Some of the houses surrounding it are spectacular.When looking at the panorama of the city on the waterless side of the bridge, also make sure to look down and see the California brown bear heads guarding their fortress.The loop around the lake is 3.3 miles and takes about an hour to walk, or 15 mins on a bicycle (which are also allowed-- sadly, dogs are NOT). Or you can just hang out on the bridge and daydream. Joggers, skaters and baby strollers abound, but in truth, it's never that busy.There are three different entrances. Weidlake Gate is closest to the dam and has the most parking, also Tahoe Gate and Lake Hollywood Drive Gate. Hours change according to season, but it's basically sunrise to sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulart99
50,Great hiking spot,"Really enjoyed this hike today. It's about 2.0 miles, no cars to contend with, and lots of scenery to enjoy and reflect on. No hills, so perfect for all ages and abilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizd775
50,Great hike and great views of Hollywood sign!,"This is a little known hike in LA which follows the rim of the Hollywood reservoir. It is an area maintained by the power and water service of LA and it is open during daylight hours for a 3 1/2 mile hike. It is mostly flat, except for the drive up in to the hills to find it. There is a fence and parking on the street and in a dirt lot near the gate. Home owners in the area do not want tourists driving through their posh, hilly neighborhoods, but it was the best place for us to get that perfect Hollywood sign picture. You wind around the reservoir and find elusive views of the sign. It was a great way to spend our first active day in LA. Search the internet for the reservoir and follow signs and voila!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaW873
40,Paved surface good for baby stroller,"We really like this walk. In the fall & winter it's pleasant any time of day, in hot weather you'd best avoid the high sun times. Great exercise, pleasant environment, you can push a baby stroller here, it's never crowded, the reservoir is behind a fence & there are electrical cables overhead, but you stop noticing these very quickly as you focus on the body of water, the nature, the quiet. There's public port-a-loo but I've never used them. There's a public water fountain at one point. The full circuit is quite far - maybe 90 minutes at a decent pace walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlastairCookieNYC
50,Fantastic place for a walk,"Historic Hollywood reservoir is fantastic for a walk. Need private transport to get you there, but it's a terrific hiking venue. No facilities, so take sustenance and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
40,Beautiful hidden oasis,"We visited as a part of our Hollywood tour to view the sign. The unexpected benefit was a wonderful overlook of this oasis. While I had seen the sign from many different areas, there was no way I would have ever know about this location. It is very hidden to all but a few even in Los Angeles. In addition to be being s verdant as compared to the brown hills that surround it, what I remember is how quiet is was compared to the rest of the city. A very cool find if you go looking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,Tranquil beauty in the hills,"This is a great place to workout, hike, walk, bike. Neighbors get together in the mornings and workout then walk around the reservoir which is just over 3 miles. Lots of wildlife and views of the Hollywood sign as well as the city from this tucked away gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPVM13
40,The Lake Below the Letters ...,"For getting to the Hollywood Reservoir just take 101, then exit Cahuenga and follow the signs, map and GPS. you'll get pretty close then hike the way up to the reservoir. Quite pastoral and very LA. Take water because you'll need it. Great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Get a good hike & fun! Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Awesome hike,Hiked up to the reservoir and got an awesome view of the Hollywood sign. Great way to spend the afternoon. Also got a great view of the city skyline!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachelrowe14
40,"Small hike, beautiful views","I have been here just yesterday and loved it. I did not walk around the reservoir as I went there by bus (222 out Barham/Lake Hollywood Dr), walked down to the reservoir, took the right wing and down the hills. It is a little bit sad, that it is fenced. You have to take photos through it at the wall you can take great photos of the Hollywood Sign and on the other side of Hollywood Skyline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saloma76
40,Solitude in the middle of the city,"The Lake Hollywood Reservoir is a nice little hike where you can take a fabulous photograph of the Hollywood sign over the reservoir. The best part of the walk is the bridge (about at the half way mark). This is the spot from which to take your photos. Looking down into the water from here, we spotted 5 large turtles.It's a 3.3 mile walk around the reservoir on concrete - most of the way it is on a road that is closed to traffic though for a little while is is on sidewalk or trail on the side of a relatively busy street. It is flat and not all that shady.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankb357
50,One of my favorite places to be in L.A.,"I've been to the Hollywood Reservoir a couple of times over the last years. The first time I came there, in 2012, the hiking trail around the reservoir was closed due to a landslip. It's open again and the walk around it, it's just wonderful. It's peaceful and you can see deer, birds and turtles. Also, it's the only way to take a photo of the Hollywood Sign with water in front. There's also a hiking trail up to the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eat-a-roo
40,"Beautiful Flat Walk, Great Photos at the Bridge","The Lake Hollywood Reservoir is a great place to live like a local while in Los Angeles and take a fabulous photograph of the Hollywood sign over the reservoir and if it's a clear day you can snap a great shot of Downtown Los Angeles as well.FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: Bring water! This is a nearly four mile walk around the reservoir and there is no way to stop to buy or get water along the way. I would also make sure you're wearing sunscreen as much of the walk is sunny.This is a great walk for someone who doesn't want to ""hike"" but rather prefers a flat walk. I have sciatica and can't do inclines and declines without some pain so I definitely prefer the lovely, flat walk. It's perfect for me. The path is not NEARLY as crowded as Runyon or Fryman so sometimes you can go a few minutes without passing a person which is very nice -- it's like finding a little bit of nature and solitude in the city if only for a few moments.For me, the best part of the walk is the bridge (about at the half way mark). From the bridge you have a perfect view of downtown LA on one side and the Hollywood sign on the other. It's really pretty -- I always stop for a few minutes and take it all in, watch the ducks in the water below, birds flying by, etc. For me, it is like an oasis in this busy, crazy city!Also, make sure you go to the bathroom before you get there because the bathrooms are Andy Gumps at the bottom of the trail and they are REALLY, REALLY GROSS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yardsusa
40,Great hike right in LA,When you're on this hike its hard to believe you're in LA. Its a very easy walk as the path is paved and the elevation change isn't much at all. It offers nice views of the Hollywood reservoir and excellence views of the hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539samt
50,Just Do It,"It's a great drive to get up there. Beautiful views. Surrounded by historical homes and the Hollywood sign. There won't be a lot of people there. And, it's all just a few minutes from ""the touristy stuff"". Check it out. Google gives fine directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/movieland
