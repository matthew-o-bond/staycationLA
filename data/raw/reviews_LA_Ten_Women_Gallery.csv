50,A Great Find,"After you have done all of your ubiquitous shopping in Santa Monica, stop by Ten Women Gallery at 1128 Montana Avenue for something interesting and different to put in your suitcase. Ten Women is a co-op art gallery, showing different genres of art from 24 women artists. Here you’ll find glass art, jewelry, ceramics, leather works, photography, painting, paperwork, woven works, etc. that you won’t find elsewhere. Prices are very reasonable, the store is open daily from 10:00-6:00, and there is parking in the back. I had a lot of fun trying to decide what to take home with me... so many choices.",lovestravel100Ca
