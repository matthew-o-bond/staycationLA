20,Disappointing,"My daughter and daughter-in-law had worked here as teenagers and really liked it. I was disappointed that it was very dirty. The animals did not have straw, especially the chickens and ducks, and their pen was very smelly. I raise chickens so I know what it should look like. The poney rides were very unorganized. We waited in line for over 1/2 hour, and just as it was our turn, they decided to change out the ponies, While this is a great thing, they had only one girl there. She had to prep the new ponies, unsaddle the retiring ponies and take care of them. You pay extra to “trot” rather than walk, which means that the person runs with the poney about 1/3 of the way around the loop and walks the remainder of the way. While I would not want this job, I do not feel that it is exactly as advertised. The management is doing a great job, as far as I can tell, by rescuing cats and preparing them for adoption by neutering, chipping and giving them shots. They are commended for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeA87
40,ponies for children,"Wonderful experience for children able to ride little ponies around a ring. Can find this place off of Carson St. in Lakewood. My Granddaughter and Grandson had a lot of fun riding the ponies. There are other little animals for them to see and also horses. Tennis shoes or boots are the best things to wear for riding the ponies. 2 hrs was the appropriate time to spend there with small children, even though they want to stay longer. Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honesty62
30,BNice,It's a nice place to take the kids. Its clean and safe and they will love it there. It's also a couple of miles fro Downtown Long Beach where there are some good restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunterRogue
50,"Pony ride, petting zoo","We came for the pony ride for my 7 year old but my teens were entertained plenty. They have cats, bunny and plenty of other farm animals to care for and feed my 3 kids loved the experience and my 7 year old wants lo go back ""like everyday""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
30,Pony Time,"The staff here is always friendly, but the facility has begun to look more run down than when we visited three years ago. Some of the animals appear to be overexerted (at least on the weekends).Entry fees and pony rides will increase in March. We will probably visit Griffith Park next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsColleenOlsen
40,"Inexpensive, fun petting zoo for children","Admission is free to come, see and pet the animals. For as little as $1 you can buy a small amount of feed for the animals. My toddler son had a great time and I was very pleased not to break the bank.The vibe is pretty rustic, which I actually love. I like that you can get in the pen with the animals, but if you're an overprotective germophobe mom then this place may not be for you. I personally think this place is a gem and important for city/suburban kids to get their hands a little dirty and actually play with farm animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s30hansen
40,Something Different,"With a $1.00 entry and $5.00/$6.00 pony rides for the children it is a fun way to spend a couple hours. The feed for the petting zoo is a little overpriced, but it would be at any facility. The animals seem well taken care of, even if the property is a little run down. Overall it was an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsColleenOlsen
50,Farm in the city,"All the places my grandkids had their pony ride this place is the most fun they had. Adults can ride the well trained horses with the little ones too. For 20 bucks we had a blast. There is a small petting zoo filled with well fed animals. A duck with a crown and chickens with feathers all over. A cow, llama, donkey and nosy goats. You don't have to travel far to spend a day in a farm. Entrance is a buck. 5.00 for kids pony ride. Just make sure you pay attention or you will miss the entrance to this place. Located between the freeway and a mini strip mall and across the street are restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
