50,A nice diversion on a Sunday mornning,"If you have an hour or two to spend on a Sunday morning, this is one of the better farmer's markets in the valley (albeit on the small side in terms of selection/size since it is only one street long). There are fresh produce, some cosmetic and lotion products, and cooked foods from Asia and South America. Seating is limited, so be prepared to stand or sit on the sidewalk if consuming food. Prices are somewhat high for a farmer's market, but quality is very good and freshness is A+.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWTTC
50,Always worth the time,"The market is filled fresh fruits and veggies largely with an Asian flair - but you'll also find various prepared food vendors along with fresh eggs, flowers and honey. Everyone should visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeeP_13
10,Too small,"I wish this farmers market is bigger and sell a lot more varieties of organic fruits and vegetables. I wished they sell more bakery goodies and hot cook food to eat too. But unfortunately, it's only one block big so option are very limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/380bella
