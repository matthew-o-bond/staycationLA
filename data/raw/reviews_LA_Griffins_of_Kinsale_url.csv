40,Lively Irish Pub with food,My friend was having birthday drinks and desserts for her boyfriend over the weekend at the bar they had their first date at. It also happened to be their anniversary which was super cute too. Griffins of Kinsale was able to accommodate her with plates and utensils for the cake as well as having the band sing happy birthday too. It’s a darkly lit Irish pub with heavy wooden pews bolted down into the floors. They serve Guinness on Tap for cheap and they have two different sizes of shepherd’s pie. I ordered the “wee” pie for $8 and my friends tried the burger and the wings. The shepherd’s pie hit the spot but it took them almost an hour to get our food out. The crowd gets lively on a Saturday night. The service was good despite it looking like they were short-staffed. I left my tab open in case I wanted something else but ended up closing it out for the night. There is street parking available nearby and it’s in a quiet area of South Pasadena.,Trina D
