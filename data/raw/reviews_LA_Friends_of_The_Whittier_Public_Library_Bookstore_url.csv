50,Tons of Used Books and Vinyl Records,"Usually, non-profit library bookstores are small. This store is in a large corner building selling used books and vinyl records. (all donated from the local community)Hundreds of used books both hardback and paperback. Very large Science Fiction and Romance sections too. Very much a treasure hunt if you are looking for something specific. Run by volunteers so prices are great. The majority of children's books were 25 cents each, popular fiction $1 to $2 (hardback or paperback) They even sell CD's DVD's, VHS tapes and one room is filled with current issue magazines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmarzy
