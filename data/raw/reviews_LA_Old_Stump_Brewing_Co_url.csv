40,KFI News and Brews,My wife and I attended the News and Brews gathering with two of our friends. Nice place. Lots of room inside and outside. We tried a number of different beers and they were all very good. Parking is a little tough and they need a better sign but overall we had a great time. We will go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snscc
40,Great brews and entertainment,"Old Stump has great brews on tap. No food, just food trucks. Some folks get food delivered. Dudes Got Blues performing on Saturday. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eljuezcubano
50,Great Beers & Nice Entertainment!,"I am writing this review as someone who is not a beer drinker. However, I am married to a beer snob! I love coffee and so I love a handful of of their dark beers that remind me of the dark robust flavor of Java. Out of all our local breweries, this one has the most amount of beers that I will drink. The have a great milk stout as well as a coconut stout that is delicious. P-town porter is delish too! More recently they had a fruity beer that was quite tasty too.They have some great bands, movie nights, food trucks and even cigar nights. They have board games too. You can actually bring your kids as well. Most of the breweries seem to cater to an atmosphere that is family friendly.If you don't want to partake in their food truck, you can bring outside food as well. They also have an area that can be rented for private parties for a very reasonable price. I've gone with just my female friends and feel totally comfortable doing so. It sits in an industrial park that is off of a main street (Bonita Ave). It really is worth stopping if you want to go beer hopping and check out the local brewmasters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalGina
