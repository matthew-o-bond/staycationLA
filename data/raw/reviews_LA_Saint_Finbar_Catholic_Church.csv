50,Elegant profile,"This glistening elegant church dates from the early 1950s, residing in the largest Catholic Burbank parish.Lovely in its own grounds it presents an impressive profile, particularly against the deep azure of the skyline.A grand belfry towers heavenwards. Moving inside we viewed a spacious nave, culminating in an unpretentious altar with a crucifix as it centre point.Pleasant lighting abetted by the ambient provides a tranquil atmosphere. Stained glass enhances the prayerful purpose.",permia
