40,"Yes, Conan is tall in person","We had a great experience. Three of us were visiting L.A. for two weeks, and requested tix online earlier that week via 1iota and got the date we wanted right away. We got to the parking garage (where the queue was) right at 1:30 and got our security passcard, and then drove to a nearby eatery (Olive & Thyme) we found online--plenty of time to get back by 3:30. This was easy to do because parking was free and right in the same place as the line-up (fun Team Coco items spread around the garage waiting area). At 3:30 we got a free walking tour of the Warner backlot as we all did a long trudge outside to get to the Team Coco studio. At around 4:30, a warm-up guy (a great heckler) had us all laughing, then Conan came out and did his half-hour show (this one was for Valentine's Day, guest was Will Arnett--you don't know who the guest is til you're in the studio). It was a funny interfiew, and over quickly. Not much interaction with the audience, but that's fine.All the Conan staff were smiling and friendly, a big difference from the 6-hour ordeal we'd had a few days before at The Masked Singer where we felt like a clapping herd of cattle (I guess #1 shows can get away with that!) Both shows offer free tickets, which is great for an afternoon of entertainment.",leklekblue
10,Waste of time,First of all...the check in is at 130pm and they say to be back by 330pm when they start to walk you over to the show...they make you park in a parking structure that is not near any place to eat. The security treat you like criminals when going through security. We were walked over and at about 4pm a very unfunny comedian comes out to warm up the crowd. Conan comes out and shows little effort or energy . And the show is over after 30 mins. Conan just walked off after the guests left ...such a let down. The new show format is horrible and Conan has lost all his passion. So over 3 hours of waiting for bad comedy for 30 minutes. Don't waste your time with a Conan taping. The only way they will improve is if people stop turning up .,notgoodenoughmyfriend
50,Worth the wait,The check in process went smoothly. It was nice getting an automatic reply when we first requested tickets. The warm up before the show may have been my favorite part.,CarolynHHP
50,Great Experience!,"Extremely well-organized: Explicit instructions, free parking, knowledgeable and on-the-ball staff. Great pre-show events. Enjoyed seeing Conan and Andy.",Lori P
40,"Live, free parking, free show, fun for tourists","Once you get into the show it's ""in and out"" in under 50 minutes. Sitcom tapings are sometimes 5 hours which can get brutal. The warm-up man (Gary? I think) is full of energy. He yanks people up on stage to dance. It's Conan in his studio television habitat, which is fun. Oh hey, look, there's Andy too (cutie pie). Hi guys! They are in their human form and stuff. There's a few things they could do to benefit themselves and the audience before the show, but I'm done giving great advice for free. The seating staff was friendly and efficient enough. As for the show on 02/04/2020, the comment below about Iowa skit is a little weird for TripAdvisor. The show was fine. After taping, Conan did a little ""Oh, Hi there, girl with a tiara celebrating a Birthday today."" followed by some self-deprecating joke-as usual, then he bolted, which was a little strange. Hollywood is kinda' strange overall so it's just the norm. Anyway, It's a good destination if you're touring Los Angeles. It's a free show with free parking. I attended alone since I was in the area that day, so I was seated in the weirdo loner seat next to the camera pit. It was fine. The audience is a mixture of age demographics. I hung out with a nice 23 year old young lady who just moved to Los Angeles to become an actress. I enjoyed her enthusiasm. The audience is for 16 and older. There's a security guy named Gregory who is good at his job while still being friendly. If you want to buy Conan merchandise, you'll need to do that before the show. There's a booth. I mean, it's Conan. He's still a big deal. If you're near Burbank you should go to a show.",graciediane
50,Funny as ever,"I am a huge Conan O'Brien fan, so I had high hopes for this and it did not disappoint. The show is free, but you have to make sure you request tickets in advance. We got in line about 2 hours early and about 30 minutes into waiting, they gave us numbers in how we were sitting and said we could leave and come back at a certain time. This was really nice so we didn't have to wait in line. Much appreciated. When we came back they called us by our numbers and we walked over to the Warner Brother's lot. They seat you according to your number, and we ended up being able to sit in the front row. Conan's show has gone down to 30 minutes, so the show seemed super fast, but still worth it. He was so funny and genuine. They had a great warm up audience guy as well. Would definitely go again.",Fallon B
40,LA Trip,Good exp. Show producer was great at warming up the audience. Just would have liked for show crew to allow audience to go to WB gift shop upon exiting.,Grundy Traveler
50,Conan is so awesome and funny!!,I definitely recommend anyone to attend a taping of Conan! The tickets and show is FREE!!!! The warm up person was so funny and the show is really fast. I would definitely like to go see Conan again!!!üòäüòÉ,Harmie P.
40,Love Conan!,"This experiance is a bit long, but I think worth it. They start you out in a parking garage at gate 8. There are some Conan props to look at, not much else. You can get there early if you like. but don't go too early cause you'll just be staring at cement. Around 1;30 Conan reps come in and they give you a wrist band and a number (so no one can line jump you) and tell you to come back at 3:30. At 3;30 they start hurding you across the street to Conans studio. The warm up comedian is very good, and explains how things should go....The show starts, Conan comes out, and the fun begins! Compared to the long ordeal leading up to it, the show goes FAST! Love Conan, love the show, wanted more.",dwy1
50,Great Fun,"Attended a taping of the show with my husband and twenty something son. The actual ticketing process went smoothly. Requested online tickets, received a confirmation and showed up at 1:30 on the Warner Bros. lot to get the actual tickets and entry number. Left at 2:00 for a late lunch ( ‚Äú Smokehouse‚Äù ). Highly recommend the restaurant. Old Hollywood feel with leather booths, valet parking and decent menu. Prices weren‚Äôt crazy and the location is right around the corner from the studio. Returned by 3:30 to be escorted into the studio for the taping. There is a comedian who warms up the crowd, tosses out a few Conan tee shirts and gives instructions on when to applaud and how loud. Martin Short was the guest and he was very funny. Nice give and take between Conan and Short. During commercial breaks, Conan interacted with the audience, was very down to earth. Good time- would do it again.",tdl253
20,"Carson & Leno great, not O'Brien!","Been to both Late Night Shows with Carson and Leno, and those guys were funny! Unfortunately late night ""comedians"" are no longer funny, preferring to be political hacks instead of talk show hosts. Colbert, O'Brien, and Kimmel are nothing more than SNL extensions without the ""comedic genius"" of Alec Baldwin. Carson and Leno had political commentary back in the day as well, but it was funny and not one-sided, ribbing Democrats as well.",Jerry Crawford
50,This is one of the things to do,"It was a blast, Conan Delivers, good pre-show warm-up. Sure lots of waiting, but that is the nature of the beast with TV shows. All in all totally worth it, aside from the fact it was FREE!",ET-MCMLX
50,Awesome Experience!,"Went to the last taping of the final season for the Conan show. It was a great experience! Basically got a tour of WB at the same time. The check-in area is really cool, you see other shows guests waiting as well. Once inside, you see all the different studios where filming/taping takes place. So cool! Also, they select guests to come on stage and do hilarious stuff and I was selected and won a t-shirt! Didn't like that they hardly show the audience on TV after the taping, that was a big letdown. (But we did get to see 5 seconds of ourselves)",Ladee Vee
50,"Great Show, Conan Taping Is A Blast","The free show was a fantastic time.Conan is an American comedy legend. Andy is funny, the warm up guy is hilarious! It's free! Just set up a 1iota account, request free tickets and enjoy the show. Warner Brothers studios is legendary and thrilling.Such a LA classic.I seriously recommend this to anyone who wants to see a live taping.",RangerNate
50,Great Experience,"After reading reviews and instructions, I‚Äôm not sure if waiting early is necessarily required. Check in is from 1:30 to 3:30. Some people wait as early as 11:30am to check in and get the closest seat. We thought that was too excessive so we opted to arrive around 2:45-3pm to check in. We still got our seats despite the information saying they overbook. We ultimately were 75th out of 80ish and our seats were in the last row but because the set is so small, the seats ended up being really good (all the seats are good). After check in, they start bringing people to the studio around 3:30 and show starts at 4:30 and is very quick. The experience was very good and I highly recommend trying it out!",illiemako
50,Awesome!,Great time - he was so fun and we had a great guest - Matt LeBlanc!! You have to book the show pretty far in advance but it was well worth the time to see how its done. It was only a 30 min taping but lots of fun the entire time!,tdbosse1
40,Great Show,I've watched Conan since he took over David Letterman's time slot 25 years ago. He has a great sense of humor! The jokes are funny and I love the way he makes fun of himself every now and then. I highly recommend seeing a taping of this show when you get a chance.,The Sushi Guy üç£
40,"Great show, waiting section could be improved","As many pointed out, it's best to be there (the Garage) at ~1pm. After you get your definitive ticket, take a Uber/Lyft to Universal City Walk and enjoy your time. Get back at 3pm, go the the studio, enjoy the show, get back to the Garage.One thing to improve: Just place a TV showing Conan clips in the Garage would make everything a lot better.",OliverBchr
50,Must see when in L.A.,"My wife and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the Conan show while vacationing in L.A. It was a highlight of our trip and Conan is still halarious.The crew that preps you for the show were were organized and professional. Once inside the studio, the guy who revs you up was really good at his job. The pre show was almost as fun as the actual show.In our opinion, the Conan Show was a far better experience than the sit com taping we went to later that week. If ot comes down to a choice of two shows, go with Conan!P.S. Be patient after the show. The parking lot then street traffic can be a little intimidating. We were in such a good mood following the show that it just didn't matter...",Bobbert63
50,Just amazing,"This guy has lost nothing over the years and I am so glad we got the chance to do this. We haven‚Äôt watched Conan for a few years, but loved it back in the day. Loved today that we were able to pick up just where we left off. They do a good job of making the experience very cool too.",haroldInToronto
50,Amazing!,"Got tickets last minute and we were so excited. We love watching his stuff over in Australia and to be in Los Angeles watching Conan live was awesome!Interactive with the crowd, my partner won a shirt. Would go again if we could.",Grace J
50,A GREAT EXPERIENCE! SO MUCH FUN!!,This was such a cool experience. I am so glad we went. I love Conan and have loved him since he did the Late Show. Mila Kunis was the main guest when we went. Made our honeymoon so memorable. Just be ready to walk! But that was enjoyable as well. Conan was super nice and spoke to the audience after the show. I would definitely go again!,Courtney P
50,Fun!,"Great overall experience... my first time seeing a TV show live and was really fun, Conan was funny too. even the walk on the lot was fun for me because i am e TV nut and could see some of the plaques on the walls of previous shows filmed there.",U2042ZPalexanderg
50,Went to see a show in May 2018,We had the best time ever actually the best time started after we got seated after many long hours of getting to that point lol. When we finally sat down I wish I remembered the guy's name that tells us all about the show how to act and what to do basically he was a comedian. He made us laugh and get in the mode for some fun. He was giving out t-shirts and I was the first one that got one for the most of the most enthusiastic member of the audience. I was thrilled and after that my 19 year old granddaughter was picked to go on the stage with about 20 other people to do a dance. It was a song to do with dancing your booty off or something to that sort. She went up there and shook that booty and believe me I was cheering her on like the most enthusiastic member could ever do. We had a wonderful evening and it was worth the wait. I definitely have some fun memories at night sharing with my fiance Larry and my granddaughter Mikaela. There we are sitting in the audience and we have a lot of pictures for memories but my fiance is sleeping and the video of my granddaughter is in his phone and you'll have to trust me on the shaking the booty hahaha hehehe,Sue H
30,Free is for me,"The beginning process was easy. We were able to leave after checking in to use the restroom or get a drink. The wait wasn't bad. The bad thing was the walk to the studio Conan was taped in. We walked through 26 studio buildings! I enjoyed the show though, Conan is great! Burbank is an interesting place to go too.",michelle1524
40,Conan delivers!,"I‚Äôve been watching Conan since the late 90s and due to living in Switzerland was never able to attend. Now I had the chance and the show itself was awesome as soon as we entered Stage 15.It‚Äôs just too bad that the waiting times are so long. Make sure to go get your tickets early enough. It says 330 but we went there at noon and were not the first ones! Be prepared to spend 4-5hours for the whole thing.Conan and the others were absolute pros, although I was at least hoping for a few mins of interactions or Q&A by Conan or Andy af ter the the show. They came, had a great show and left. Still a great experience!",Largo78
50,Great Show!,"Even though I have never really watched Conan - my wife has always been a fan. I have to say that it was a lot of fun and well worth the time. I will warn you - you are looking at about 6 hours from beginning to end, but at the end of the day - worth the trip! From my point of view - he would be the best of out of all of themCONAN ROCKS!",Rick H
50,LOVE CONAN!,"The show was so much fun. Got there around 2 PM to check in at the garage and got number 50 but still sat prime view! After checking in, we had time to grab a drink before lining up to walk to the studio around 330. We had a fun warm up and some of the audience got prizes. The show actually went by pretty quick and we didnt get to interact with Conan much since it was so fast paced. The show was funny and the music was great. I wanna go back!",bessie s
40,We got free tickets,"We got free tickets while taking the Warner Bro's Studio Tour (5/5 stars) so we went. The show was decent. I'm not really a fan of Conan O'Brien, but my grandma really enjoyed herself.",Alexa L
50,Great Show ~ Funny and Fun!,"My family of four went to a taping of the Conan O'Brien show and had a great time. We were lucky enough to score tickets the day of the show following the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood and had excellent seats. The process to seat the audience was very well organized and the warm-up was a fun time with jokes and t-shirt give-a-ways. Conan came out and talked to the audience prior to the show, which I thought was very nice. The show was great and the guests and Conan were funny, and we ended up onscreen during an Andy Richter sketch, so we were able to see ourselves later that night when we watched the program on TV. It was a totally awesome experience.",Linda S
50,Lots of fun!,My husband and I went to a taping of the Conan O'Brien show. The show was very funny that night and we even made it onscreen during an Andy Richter sketch!,Lisa B
40,Highlight of our trip,My husband loved the show! Said over and over it was his favorite part of our trip. Conan was hilarious and so were the guests. I only removed a star as I didn't like that the tickets online are oversold and you have to show up 2 hour prior to get tickets. Then you're hurded like cattle and stand another hour before getting let in. It Really takes a large chunk of your day.,Brittney
50,So Much Fun -- But Arrive Early,"I met my son and daughter in San Diego for a few days, and each planned a day's activities for us. My son made arrangements for us to attend a taping of the Conan O'Brien Show, and we had the best time.First, you have to know that getting tickets in advance is a must. My son booked at least a month ahead of time. Interestingly, both my daughter and I worried that he might have dropped the ball and tried to get tickets about two weeks prior to the taping. There were no tickets available for either of us to get. Also, these aren't necessarily guaranteed tickets. They are guaranteed possibilities for tickets.We arrived at the parking garage at 11 a.m. To my surprise, parking was free, and that was great. We made our way to the second level where staging for the Conan O'Brien Show was to take place. We waited only a few minutes before security arrived to check us in. We were actually the first people to arrive and were seated at the very front of the pack for tickets, thus guaranteeing that we would get into the studio audience. With only 200 seats available, those arriving late risk not getting in even though they went only and got ""tickets"" ahead of time.We sat in those seats until 1:30 p.m. At that time, were were moved into a line where we received our passes, and I was so excited to have #1. That meant we were the first to enter the audience seating area and first to select our seats -- in the front row.Helpful hint: Waiting around for three hours in a little long, and once we received our passes and wristbands, we had about one hour to find a place to eat. Nothing was within walking distance, and the food trucks that were supposed to be nearby simply weren't. If we do this again, one of us will leave the area to bring back food (like Subway) while the others save his/her spot. We simply didn't know the system.The show itself is so much fun. Between the band and the warm up people, we were so excited before Conan even walked out. When he did, he was jacketless and was chewing gym. He bantered with the audience, and we loved it. I couldn't believe I was seated about 20 feet from Burt Reynolds, the first guest. See how the taping actually works and everything that goes into the production was so interesting, and I laughed so hard that I actually hurt.If you get a chance to be in the studio audience for Conan, do it.",Denise R
40,Always an interesting show.,Parking is free and you check in for the show in the garage. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. It is a long walk to the studio where the show is filmed.,Colleen B
50,Wonderful Staff,"I've been to a CONAN taping twice now. I use a wheelchair, and so need some extra assistance and had to go through a different gate than most other people. The first time, on April 20, 2017, my friends and I had such an amazing experience. The PA helping us (Erick) learned how much I loved Conan, and even mentioned it to Conan's Assistant. Because of this, Conan came over to my friends and talked to us, and even hugged and kissed me! He was so ridiculously kind to me!This recent visit, on March 8, the staff was just as kind and helpful. We sat in the front row again because of my wheelchair and Conan and Andy both were awesome to me and my friends again. This time Conan sang to me and took my hand and growled at me! :DAlso, I've not met a single staff member on the show that wasn't just as awesome! This second trip, Joshua and Paul were especially kind, as was Josh's supervisor, Sara. Thanks, guys!If you get a chance to go to a CONAN taping, you'll have a great time. Conan and his staff genuinely enjoy what they do and want you to have fun. Side note: The studio is very cool, so bring a sweater!",ashleycaveda
50,Awesome Experience,"Got tickets online through 1iota a few weeks before and they confirmed via email about 1 week prior to the show. Arrived around 1pm at Gate 8, parking is free in the entire parking garage. Then checked in and we all sat on benches in the bottom of the garage for about 45 mins until staff from Conan came and gave us wristbands and a place in line so we could leave and come back and not lose the order. We went for lunch and returned at 3:15pm and then they got us in our original order and we walked over to the studio. They sat us down and the comedian guy came out and got us hyped and ready for the show. Then Conan came out and did his monologue and then onto the guests (Tom Papa and Wanda Sykes, Mt. Joy). After what seemed like no time at all, it was all over and we were done. I'm a big fan of late night TV and was always curious as to how they tape the show and all of the logistics surrounding the show's creation. It definitely was not what I was expecting. It was much shorter and faker than I expected, but then again, isn't all of Hollywood fake to some extent. Overall, very fun and cool experience. Conan was great and the show was awesome. Wanda's jokes didn't seem to land very much with our audience, but Tom Papa absolutely killed it. Every joke he had landed and overall he did really well. I had never heard of him before but this made me want to see more of his work! Would recommend you see a taping of Conan if you can while you're visiting LA.",MG3
50,Our trip highlight,"We thoroughly enjoyed our Conan experience. The TripAdvisor reviews below were very helpful in guiding us about arrival time etc. I don't believe I can add any details about the logistics that haven't already been addressed before but I'm happy to respond to any direct messages of you have questions. His staff are very friendly and the entire event is well coordinated. They get 200 people from a parking garage to a studio 8 blocks away, which is good people management. As for the show, he's the best and it was the highlight of our LA trip",maxpaste
50,A good way to spend some time,If you are in the LA area its always fun to go and watch the show be taped on the Warner lot. Be sure to get tickets a head of time,Pam S
50,It's CONAN!!! It's FREE!!! Here's the technical info...,"Here's the process. Request tix online, they send you an email of the tix or put you on a waitlist. If you get the tix you print them & bring them with your ID & everyone in your group. You meet at the WB parking structure Gate 8 which opens at 11am. Conan staff doesn't come out until 1:30pm, but people can start sitting & lining up at 11am; so it's up to you how early you want to get there, the cutoff is 3:15pm. They have fun Conan statues to pose with, including a giant bobblehead & a merch table while you wait.When they give you your lineup# at 1:30 you can leave & come back at 3:15. There are places to eat just a couple miles away.At 3:30 you are lead from the structure to the studio in the order that you lined up & they seat people from front row to back based on your line up in the garage, so early birds do get better seats, but the studio is small, so all seats are still good. Random audience members get chosen for a dance contest before the show tapes & win a free shirt. Be enthusiastic & crazy if you want to get noticed. I was stoked to get chosen!They love laughter & energy from the audience. The show tapes in an hour & you're out by 5:30pm. You can't take photos or videos during the taping, but ok before & after. Conan talked to the audience briefly after the taping & I took a quick pic, wish it had been a video. It was a fun experience! Very surreal & actually flies by kinda fast. It's Conan! If you love him, it's worth it. ;)",Briana G
30,Kinda disappointed,"We were waiting a LONG time in the parking garage waiting area which was extremely hot and uncomfortable. We were the last group bussed over and were then seated in the last row, having missed most of the warm-up show. So I hope you have a better experience!Interesting to be in the studio and it was free. After the taping, we sat through a long video that they planned to edit for the next night. Finally walked all the way back to the parking garage. If you a die-hard fan, and the weather is cooler, you will be okay.",Beautifuldays2013
50,Great show to see,"Super smooth process to see Conan. Reserved tickets online ahead of time- could only do 4 at a time but we had a group of 5 so we made a reservation for 2 and for 3 and were able to combine them there no problem.12:30ish- arrived and got in line. Metal detector and IDs checked. This happens in the parking garage which was warm but there was a water cooler1:20ish- production assistant comes out and looks up your name and gives you tickets and a laminated number.Free time- we left and got lunch3:15 - returned and a little more waiting3:30- started calling people by number, load you onto a bus4:00- bussed and seated in auditorium4:15ish- warm up comedian comes out, talks through the process and pulls people on stage to do a dance contest for free T-shirt‚ÄôsFrom there it‚Äôs pretty much exactly like you see on tv- andy richter comes out and intros Conan, monologue, guests and close.We were done by 5:30 and then had to walk back to the car. It took up a whole afternoon but was very stress free and entertaining. Not to mention the tickets are all free to begin with!",Kaleigh K
30,"Weird, yet fun","You have to arrive prior to 3:30 pm and get out around 5:45 pm. The waiting area is in the bottom of the free parking garage with a couple of photo opts (as seen below). Ensure you get the security stamp prior to leaving to go to the set, other wise you have to go all the way back. The stay was the most laid-back of any talk show I have been to. They allow you to stand up to take pictures of the set. Conan or Andy themselves do not have any crowd interaction, but the band will walk through the crowd. The show itself is just like on tv... no crowd interaction. I found it funny to see count Andy's non-smiles when not on camera and how many times he appears in the tv shot he isn't in.",Josh W
50,Conan was the best among the 3,"Went to conan, Kimmel and cordon. Conan do interact with the audience at the end of the show! He would talk and interact more if the audience is more hype IMO. It was so good that I went second days in a row.",Kai
50,First class all the way,"Went to a Conan show taping, and the entire staff from checking in to security through the actual show was extremely friendly. This is a first class, world class operation. If anyone in your party has trouble walking, ask for the tram and you may get a small sample of a studio tour. Highly recommended.",fllyover
40,Fun!!!!,"This was well worth the visit and I had no problems getting the tickets online. As an added bonus as we were waiting to get on the set, Ellen drove by on a bicycle with her entourage and actually waved and said hi to everyone. The show was a hoot. Good music and guess. I would go again.",RADARSHE
40,You have to go to a show taping at least once in your life.,"After stalking Conan's website for a couple of months, and not being able to secure tickets to Kimmel, we ended up at CONAN. Hey, he's also one of our favorites, haha! Snoop Dogg was announced on our show so we were pretty excited to at least know the guest. Tickets are free and if you're diligent, you can score them as soon as your dates become available. I had ONE DAY to work with, and thankfully, this came through. Just Google Conan tickets, and you'll be directed to the website. Tip: Make your account in advance. Don't wait until your tickets become available for your date to then make your account. We arrived at Gate 8 (as specified on our confirmation email) around 12:30 after our WB Tour. We Ubered from the tour entrance to the Gate 8 parking garage -- pretty cheap ride, under $5. We arrived at 12:30, and there was already a bench full of people lined up to check in. You must go through a security check point and metal detector. The area you sit and wait to check is under a parking garage, and there's CONAN items hanging around so you know that you're in the right place. It is shaded, and water is available (free water cooler), and vending machines and bathrooms are as well just outside of the security check point. We were hungry though, so were hoping we wouldn't have to wait long. Right before 1:00 PM, two Conan staffers showed up to get our names checked off the list, a line number was given to us, and wrist bands were placed on us. At that point, we were told to be back no later than 3:15. We arrived back at 3:00 PM, went through security again, and then staff were handing out popsicles (since it was SO hot that afternoon). After about 15 minutes, staff members began calling our line numbers, and we lined up accordingly before starting the 8 block walk to the Conan stage. We were in a holding area briefly for about 20 minutes before hiking the rest of the way. If you have mobility issues, or anyone in your party does, PLEASE ALERT THE STAFF. They know it's hot and that it's a long walk, and they are willing to work with anyone who cannot make that 8 block haul to the studio. There's lots of security and staff on hand that will get you to the studio safely, and water coolers are placed in the holding areas as well. Once we arrived in the studio, we were given gatorade and directed to seats. We were seated in the 4th row, on the right hand side of the stage (if you're looking down at the stage from the audience). So great seats. We were above the cameras, so our view wasn't blocked at all. We were allowed to take photos of the stage before the show started which was cool. After about 15 minutes, the ""warm up"" comedian came out, and sort of explained what our role was (basically you cheer and clap at everything whether it's funny or not), and he did some ice breakers with folks from the audience for free t-shirts. The comedian was entertaining. After, the band came out and plays for a few minutes, and we practice cheering for them as well. There is an ""applause"" light above your head, so that is accurate to what you may have seen/heard about in movies. The show began around 4:30, as promised, and Andy and Conan are introduced. All in all, it was really cool being that up close to a show being filmed. It's like a well oiled machine when it comes to the crew in particular. So it's interesting to watch go down right in front of you. This is one of those things in life that you should do at least once. Conan didn't interact a lot with the audience (which I hear is not as normal), but overall, I figure they have a job to do, and that's get the show filmed in the time span that they need so it can be edited/aired that same night. We got to watch our episode that night in our hotel room. We couldn't hear ourselves laughing at all, but I did see myself on camera for a brief second. Of course, the folks in the front row with better access to Conan are more easily seen especially if they do something particularly funny (the guy in the front row at our show stands up and rubs Conan's shirt covered nipple, yeah, weird, but he was definitely worthy of the camera time for being kind of out there). Overall, we'd check out another one of these tapings if we had the chance.",Sarah T
30,"Fun, but true look of Hollywood","We were in town for business, but had a free afternoon. I never been to a talk show so i thought I would check it out. Looked online, saw they were tapping and tickets were available. Cool part is they are free!What didn't make sense was they mailed you confirmation, but you had to go there early that morning to get the actual ticket and then come back 90 minutes for the show, when you get back, you wait in another line and are moved like cattle from area to area.When you finally do get in, they give you a random seat, it is nice they do allow you to take a photo before hand for the set. A warm up guy comes out and gives the whole shtick. But basically you sit, watch them tape a show and leave, there wasn't any interaction with the cast, no q&a, and a short thank you and bye type ending. It almost felt like we were lower class and didn't belong in their level.I guess for me if you expected me to wait all that time and ask for me to hype up your show, there would be a little more interaction. I got to experience a Hollywood talk show, but don't think I would do it again.",BCOUBER
50,A Fun and Entertaining Experience!,"The other reviews were very accurate. Easily accessed, free parking; the waiting area is in the parking structure where water is provided along with a stand selling Conan souvenirs; a long walk to the studio; friendly staff; drinks and candy offered to the audience; a comedian performed the warm-up act, explaining what the audience was supposed to, then bringing up randomly selected members of the audience on to the floor before eventually announcing that we were going to have dance contest to see who would get a free t-shirt; and a fun show. It was very amusing to participate while watching Conan, Andy, and the many cameramen and support staff performing their jobs. Since you have to reserve your tickets way in advance, you just never know who the guests will be until that week but that was totally okay and we enjoyed the experience. That day we saw Leslie Jones, Jeffery Toobin, and Mac DeMarco. Highly recommend attending the show.",Stu Y
50,Conan Show,"After reading many reviews prior to our trip, we arrived at 11 expecting a crowd. My son and I were the second and third person is there and it stayed that way for a long time. Finally at almost 1 PM we were given wristbands and told we could leave until approximately 315. Yes our early arrival gave us wristbands number two and three and we were admitted into the show in that order and sat in the front row. But really there was no advantage to that, there is not a bad seat in the studio. We could've arrived at 12:30 with our tickets and still seen the show from a great seat. There is a comedian who warms up the group and runs through the audience. The show is shot very quickly and efficiently. I think we were out of there in under an hour and a half. We obtained tickets online ahead of time. The celebrity guests posted online about a week in advance. I was excited for my son to see Mike Tyson in person but there must have been a change because there was no Mike Tyson. However the guests were fun and entertaining. Overall I recommend it.",Fern R
50,nice tight show,"been many times, show is tight doesn't take too much of your day, of course really depends on the guest, cross your fingers",Douglas William M
50,An Enjoyable few hours....,Entertaining from the preshow thru the actual taped show. You must arrive NLT 3:30 to ensure seating for the 4:30 taping. You will wait in the parking garage at gate 8 until the number you are assigned is called and then walk accross the street in a group what amounts to at least a quarter mile to the studio. Finish will be about an hour to hour and a half depending on what is scheduled. Then another 15 minute walk back. If you have the time be sure to request tickets and enjoy,6sandy6
50,Great Fun!,"Had such a good experience during the Conan taping. It was a long day with waiting but once you have a wristband you can leave and come back which is fantastic. We got some lunch then. Everyone was super nice and I even won a t-shirt during the warm up! Conan is a professional, he flew through the taping and he was funny. If I had the chance to go again I definitely would. Got to see a peak of Stars Hollow set (from Gilmore Girls) when leaving too!",bflynn
50,Great Time,Went to show on Monday night. My flight was delayed and I was worried about arriving late but got there about 2:40 p.m. and still was able to get a ticket. We left check area about 3:15 and headed over to another area for about 15 minutes where they were showing a Conan special from a few years back. Then we were led to stage 15 where the show is taped. A guy got the crowd all fired up before the show and then the band played which fired everyone up even more. The show recording started about 4:30 p.m. and we were out of there by 5:45 p.m.. I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back when in the area.,Douglas H
50,"Conan taping, perfect right after Warner Brother's Tour","Had heard Conan show is extremely nice to it's fans, so I decided to include it on our Spring break trip. My fiancee's teenage sons were visiting CA for the first time. I signed us up for the first tour of the day and we were done around noon. We immediately drove to Conan parking lot and got on line. We only waited about 30 minutes, got our number and left to get some lunch. Came back around 3 pm for taping. There is a walk from parking lot to the actual stage (about 8 blocks) but it was not strenuous and lots of guides along the way. Once you get there, it goes by fairly fast. Lots of entertainment prior to the actual taping. It's a great experience, especially for those who have never been part of a live taping. Everyone loved it, including our teenagers. Loved how WB tour advertised the show during our tour, hyped it up for our teens.",Perla P
50,"March 13th, 2017 taping: Great experience, even while you wait","When you sign up for show tapings like this, you have to know that a lot of time will be spent waiting.In the case of Conan's show, at least the waiting part is entertaining, and civilized. The initial wait for tickets at the parking garage is at least sheltered from the sun, and there are photo opportunities (e.g., giant Conan bobble-head) in addition to a pop-up gift shop.After receiving the tickets (which for us was about 12:45pm), you are excused for over two hours. We used this time to go shopping at Costco, Nordstrom Rack, and Marshall's. After you are back at around 3:15pm, eventually you are led across the street to an outdoor (but covered) waiting area. During this time they play the funniest clips from Conan's show, which was quite entertaining.Finally, once you are led into the studio, you get some pre-show entertainment from the warm-up comedian. I was one of the unlucky (or lucky) ones selected to 'twerk' on stage to the song 'I like big butts.' As I was the first one picked to go on stage, I got to be the 'butt of the joke' for the comedian - I was made fun of for wearing a 'fisherman's jacket'; was told that if that night's show sucked, it was my fault; and that I looked like someone who couldn't get into Dr. Oz's show, and so settled for Conan. All in good fun! At least I got a free Conan t-shirt out of it, which they were charging about $30 for in the first waiting area.The 'waiting process' to get into this show was more civilized than it was for Big Bang Theory, which we attended the following day on March 14, 2017. With Big Bang, we were initially waiting outside in direct sunlight; security staff seemed to enjoy barking orders at the crowd; and the TV monitors were not playing any clips from any show.",product-of-canada
50,FUNNY FUNNY SHOW,"My husband and I went to the Conan Show it was super Funny! Whatever the check-in time is, I recommend going earlier to get your tickets, stamp, wrist band and number. You will not have to wait there, once you pick up these items just come back at check-in time or whatever time they tell you to come back! Doing this will POSSIBLY get you a closer seat. üòÑ",Mybestme
40,fun but almost not worth the long walk,i think getting to the conan show could have been made more convenient for people. Like maybe tour carts to take us there. It was hot and having to meet in a garage isn't very professional. But once you get there it was really fun. I wish conan would have hung out and did a few autographs but i still enjoyed it,Marie H
40,12:45 or later is fine,"Yesterday we went to see Conan taping with Sir Patrick Stewart and Jerrod Carmichael. We showed up at 12:30 and we #35 in line and by the time we left at 1 there were maybe 15 others behind us.We grabbed great cheap Mexican lunch at Poquito mas and came back at 3:15, perfect timing. When we got back there was double the amount of people and folks still showing up to register.I must say the waiting time is not long, you get the warm up routine, 10 audience members picked to dance on stage, band warmup then boom your live into the show.Great laughs, and every seat in the house is good.",Nicq
40,Conan is really thoughtful,"On one of the commercial breaks Conan came over to a teenager sitting beside me, autographed his ""Conan"" poster, and spoke to him for the duration of the break. It was a wonderful gesture that the TV audience would never see.The Show's waiting area is in a sweltering parking garage that is not near the Warner's our Guest Centre, and involves quite a hike to get to the studio.",daviddD3505IR
50,Annual Tradition!,"We go to a taping at Conan every year, and we love it! We get to the audience check-in no later than 930 to endure we get front row seats. Bring a game or a book to kill time while you wait to check in. Once you check in and get your spot reserved, you have a couple hours to explore or get food before you have to come back to go into the studio. The people who go are usually pretty awesome...it's a nerd haven, so let your freak flag fly! The show is an amazing experience, and I will always recommend that you make a sign to show Conan and Andy some love! Also, they release the guest schedule at the end of the week before, so take a peek so you know who to expect. No matter who the guests are, you WILL have an unforgettable and unique experience. I cannot recommend it enough!",laceyfacey
50,Conan is a must see,Loved this experience. I grabbed up a ticket online. Go early the day of the show and secure your ticket. They will give you a wrist band and give you a time to come back for the show. They are very organized and the show itself is exactly like what you see on television. This show is taped live and no retakes. I have tickets to go back in Feb.,kp1128
40,It was ok,"We didn't know the 2 people they had on his show. And Conan DOES NOT interact with the audience at all. We saw Jay Leno 1 time and he was great, talking to the audience. Drew Cary is really cool too. Conan, not so much. The band was great.",Karen B
40,Had a great time at the Conan Show,"Went to the Conan show and overall it met all my expectations. As provided in other reviews you don't need to arrive until 12:30PM to check in and the process is very simple. You'll be told to return by 3:15PM so figure out somewhere to go because the check in is inside the parking garage and there is nothing to do. We went to Glendale to eat a Porto's and had plenty of time to eat, walk around and get back in time. I can also recommend the Golden Road Brewery in Glendale highly. When you return be prepared to be taken on a guided walk quite a ways from the garage to the studio.The show experience was great. It lasts about an hour and a half. Very enjoyable. The staff at the show was very nice and of course Conan was funny. Higher seats are preferable as the lower rows may have there vision blocked by the cameras and crew. We were in row four on the band side and our view was partially blocked.",greg b
40,Lots of fun!,We got free tickets to Conan after doing a WB studio tour. Great surprise and very funny show. Staff were very welcoming.,nmcnair2016
50,Fun and Funny,"We went to the gathering area with our pre-ordered Conan tickets right after taking the WB Studio tour in the same complex. Doing both makes for a fun day of activity. We love Conan and so it was great to see him in person and enjoy a show with our free tickets. A warm-up guy tell jokes and entertains the audience about a half-hour before starting, and the band plays some songs. It was a great time.",Mary Jane D
40,Glad we went,"Me and my wife were visiting family and friends in the area. Since I have only been to one late night show, David Letterman in NY, many, many years ago, I figured we would try Conan. I managed to get tickets for a Wednesday show which featured Norm McDonald and ZZ Top. You do have to get your confirmation response before you go to the show.After reading reviews here we decided to get to the check in area early. We arrived about 11:30 a.m. The area was in a parking garage across the street from the Warner Brothers Studios, the site it is taped at. 11:30 a.m. was way too early. We were one of only three other groups at this time. We waited until 1:00 p.m. when they started handing out the wrist bands. We were group number 3. We were allowed to leave and were told to come back to the same area by 3:15 p.m. You do have to go through a security check before you go into the waiting area in the garage.When we came back they led us by groups to the studio which it seemed was about a half mile walk. They kept a very close eye on us as we walked, plenty of security. We were brought into the studio and seated by our group size. We had second row, I guess that was a perk of getting there at 11:30 a.m. However when the show started we were blocked from seeing the stage by all the cameras they use. We watched most of the show on the monitors. I would suggest getting to the check in area not so early so you get seated higher up in the studio. It's a small audience, about 200, so sitting higher up is not really a disadvantage. However in sitting in the second row we did managed to get on TV.Everything was well organized. They had a comedian(?) come out before the show and instruct us on how to act....applause, laugh, etc. Then Jimmy Vivino and the band came out and played, coming up into the audience to get us excited. A short time later Conan came out and the show started.I must say although I am glad we went and it was fun, I was a little disappointed on how Conan did not interact with the audience during the breaks. I thought he would have at least talked or acknowledge the audience.Overall, a good show, glad we went. Probably would not do it again.",Ron P
50,Amazing amazing amazing experience,"Kudos to the Warner Brothers staff! From security to crossing guards, to team Coco!! Everyone is so super nice!! They treat you like a welcome guest instead an animal like some other late night shows ( James Corden) do! They give you water and candy. They go out of their way to accommodate you. Conan is the funniest guy on tv! IDK what any stupid award show says! He's hysterical üò≠!! I'm such a huge fan!!! This was by far the highlight of my entire trip!! Thank you Team COCO and Warner brothers for treating your fans so well!! If I could give this experience a million stars I would!!",Dawn L
50,Easy! Happy First time attending a taping!,I Have heard taping and show horror stories! This was so well organized easy and efficient and fun! No long waiting or lines! All of the Conan staff and Warner brothers staff were friendly and more than accommodating to make this all happen! His show is awesome too! Everything smooth and funny of course!!! Good way to spend and afternoon and it's FREE! Team coco is great! Must do in Burbank ifYou have the time totally a must see!,Ashley K
50,Very cool,"What can I say, it's conan. The whole operation from parking to seating is very well organized. They really know how to put on a show. Not a dull moment. All aspects of the experience move along very quickly so you never get bored. Around 2 hrs. From start to finish. I want to go again soon.",Jeff G
50,Wow!!!,"We attended two shows while in the area and the Conan O'Brien show was by far the best organized. Make sure to arrive early to at least get your tickets and your pass (this will correspond to the order you will get into the show!) and then once you have the tickets and line order tag, you are able to leave and come back at 3 pM. There were plenty of places to eat and shop while you waited. The parking was right next to the area of which you checked in, the waiting area was inside the parking lot, so it was very comfortable, and you can even get some fun merchandise. When the show time came, you did have to walk quite a distance with the staff to get to the actual show, but they were great with accommodating if you could not walk. (We even saw Bob Saget on our walk!)Overall, this was an amazing experience and we will definitely go back to the Conan show next time we are in Cali!",Alisa
50,So great and it's free to get tickets!,Our family is a fan of the Conan O'Brien show. He is hilarious and he has the best guests. The tickets are free. Go to teamcoco.com to book. You never know who will be on the show far in advance but you will definitely see a well known celebrity or two during the taping. We had the best time and the film crew and audience staff rock! Conan is so great with his fans as well. He's super talented too!,Bee P
50,Hollywood tourist,I have lived in Hollywood all my life and decided to be a tourist one day. I went to the Conan show which is filmed in Burbank near Hollywood. So much fun. The staff is friendly and the show was awesome. Give this show a shot you just might be in camera.,lisapF1459DM
50,Conan,"So much fun!! Interesting to watch a taping. Conan doesn't really talk to the audience but still great to see him. Get there early to guarantee a seat, you can go for lunch after then be back for 3pm",Susan G

Tried unsuccessfully to get to see a Jimmy Kimmel orJames Corden taping but Conan was available and was an excellent experience!!! Don't miss it!!!,Cindy D
50,Best Part of My Trip,"I'm a huge Conan O'Brien fan (more from the Late Night Show). When I found out that he filmed in Burbank, I wanted to get tickets immediately for my Burbank trip! Tickets are released on his website (google conan tickets) basically a month in advance. I signed up for tickets a month in advance and about a week before the show, my tickets were ""confirmed"" (with the caveat that they purposefully oversell tickets). Tickets were free. He was going on hiatus so the filming was at 1:30 in lieu of 4:30. We arrived around 11:30 (20th people?) Around 11:55, his people came to check us in and give us wrist bands and our slots (#10). We were told that we could leave and come back by 1:15. We got some food and came back (there's water and a pop-up gift shop). At 1:30, we were lead into the studios in placard groups of 10 (so 30-50 people). It's about an 8 block walk into the studio, then up some stairs, and down into the audience chairs. Yes, if you are in the front, you are blocked by the cameras some times (that sucked), but still, it was amazing to be so close. After that, there was a warm up act, and then conan came on (what's really cool is that the show is basically filmed ""live"", all the takes and camera cuts are live!) We were pretty lucky in that Conan needed to film an extra segment, so we got to see that as well!Overall, a FANTASTIC, free thing to do! (though, time-consuming. We started waiting at 11:30 and left around 4:30).",justsand
50,A must for every Conan fan!,"Been a fan of Conan's for more than 15 years and it has been my dream to watch him live. I specifically included LA in my vacation itinerary to do this. Requesting tickets was easy. Just go to the website of 1iota and register, then select which day you would like to reserve tickets for. I think 1iota opens the waitlist about a month before. My request got confirmed within about 1-2 wks prior to my selected date. You have to print the confirmation notice. You have to arrive at 12-12:30 noon to get good seats I guess. My friend and I arrived around 12:40 and about 1/3 of total audience was there already. You will enter at Gate 8 of Warner Bros Studios and wait in a designated area in a garage. You will undergo security screening and stamp you with invisible/ultraviolet visible ink on your right hand. You will then wait in a seating area in the order you arrive. The Conan staff arrives 12:45-1pm - they will check your printed confirmation and then put on your Conan bracelet on your right wrist and give your tickets. By this time, you can roam around. There aren't a lot of places to go to if you don't have a car since the immediate vicinity is really the studio area. You can use google maps to find somewhere to hang or eat lunch. We came back around 2 or 2:30, I think. At this time, there was a merchandise stand full of Conan memorabilia for sale. I got a mug, magnet, tote bag and keychain. We were then escorted in groups (by number) to the other side of the street where the security scans the stamp on the right hand upon entry. It is about an 8-block walk. So be prepared for the weather - check weather forecast and dress appropriately. There was a little rest in between upon reaching the second holding area (no seats though) with tv monitors showing clips of previous episodes. Then the final walk would be towards the studios/stage/sets. We passed 2 Broke Girls and the Big Bang Theory. As we entered Studio 15, there were 2 Conan ""sculptures"" that greeted us along with a guy holding a basket of chocolates. Then up the stairs we go to the audience area. You don't get a say where to sit because an usher will decide, depending also on how many there is in a party. We were seated in the middle, 5th row which is good because our views weren't blocked by cameras though it is a little far from the main interview area. A warm up guy is the first to come out who chooses audience members to go up front (for a dance showdown) or give a few t-shirts. We were also briefed on what to do in case of emergency. Then the Basic Cable Band went out. They were really great! Then Andy went out, announced Conan, marking the start of the taping. At the end of the show, Conan sang the ""End of the Show song"". Then he talked to us if it was okay to shoot another segment/guest with us as the audience, to be shown the next week. It was a bonus for us. Everything was great! It was fun seeing the behind the scenes of one my all time favorite shows. If I ever I come back to LA, or wherever Conan will be, I'll definitely sign up to be a live audience again. The process was smooth and the staff who handled us were great and organized.",Jessica G
40,Smooth experience!,This is organized very smoothly. The wranglers are efficient and friendly and they make everything quick and painless getting to the lot. There are clean restrooms in the waiting area.Definitely don't get into the first few groups though. You wanna avoid sitting on the first few rows because you can't see a lot when the cameras move in on Conan and his guests. Middle of the pack is best--trust me!The warmup was fun. The show itself went by quickly and we were ushered out as easily as we were brought in. Conan did some crowd entertainment after the show but not a lot. We walked away with a free t-shirt because we acted like idiots during warmup.,Anna H
40,Conan,"Great free entertainment. Very efficiently managed process of assigning tickets on first come first served. Very orderly process of getting audience seated. Great pre-show entertainment. Interesting to watch behind the scenes live taping of the show Guests are entertaining, and if you like Conan, even better. Conan is not my style but the show was well done and the family enjoyed it.",Mark T
50,Fun Activity with Free Tickets,This was well organized and a lot of fun. I recommend it if you're able to score tickets. There are no bad seats in the studio and the process of getting people checked in was seamless and orderly.,OliviaATL
50,Absolute highlight of my trip to LA!,"Fun and memorable experience. The Basic Cable Band performed two songs before the show and one with Conan after the show. Would love to do it again in future!Free parking, visited teamcoco.com for tickets.",Ken
40,Interesting,"Although we enjoyed ourselves the language could have been toned down. I'm sure much of it was bleeped out on tv. It was interesting to see the whole production in action. I was surprised that there was no interaction with Conan and the audience at all, even during breaks. Definitely well controlled and organized.",theheatonfamily
50,Wow! We were at Conan's for Batman vs Superman show,"Conan is one of the most visitor friendly talk shows in LA. Most important, its a fun, high energy experience. Second, they go out of their way to be helpful. Early checkin, free parking, seating while you wait. I keep going back.",PDR90293
50,One of my greatest Memories!,"Watched the internet and got our tickets about 6 weeks before the show we wanted to see. Wrote to the question email address and they were very nice to answer questions. Got there early and got into line. They are very organized and tell you exactly what to do. We were the 2nd group to be seated and got the 2 seats where he comes up to you and offers to feel his nipple. We were thrilled! On national TV and rubbing Conan's chest! They do a really good job before the show starts with the band and getting the audience warmed up. Go!! You will not regret it, it is so fun and it is great!!",Sherree K
50,Awesome show,Great show to go to. There were no retakes you do walk a lot. CONAN WAS GREAT AS USUAL. Book early and get there an hour before 330.,Mike T
50,What a fun day.......,"Wow, we went on teamcoco.com for tickets. Arrived by the 1230 check in and then went to lunch. Arrived for transfer to studio. What a great event. Wonderful music by the house band. Conan was just FABULOUS. Guest was Bob Costas. If you can plan and have the time do it. Very worth it. I loved walking thru the Warners lot as they were, at this time, filming Supergirl, 2 broke girls and others. Just fun. But Conan delivers a great show!",Betsy R
50,Conan tickets,I went in October and decided to again now as I return to Cali. Conan does a great show! I even got pulled on stage for a dance off and won free shirts. Highly recommend!,Tanya S
40,Fun to see in person,"It was fun to see a talk show taped, Conan show was well run and very organized. Staff was pleasant. Glad we did this and you can't beat the price...free...",C0llz

40,Great fun!,"I loved this taping as it was easy, fun and not too long! Many tapings can drag on for hours, but this was a well oiled machine! They got you in, made you laugh, had great guests, entertained you and got you out! Very fun afternoon! And it's free entertainment!",MarcelleLA
50,A lot of fun and really easy!,"Conan makes it easy on it's audiences. We showed up at 11:00, the ticket staff showed up at 12:50 and we got our wristbands, tickets and group # card and was told we could leave and to come back no later than 3:30. Awesome experience!! Would do it again.",sjostan
50,Pretty easy and really fun,"Conan makes it pretty easy on its audiences. We showed up at 12:30 to try to get good seats and ended up in the 4th row, still very close but above the cameras so nothing was blocked. You then return around 3 or 3:15 and hang out in the parking garage audience area until they walk you into the studio. The taping took literally 1 hour and was really interesting. They send out a comedian to do some crowd work and hype up the audience (sadly it's no longer the great Jimmy Pardo, but this guy was funny as well), then the Basic Cable Band does a couple songs and amps up the audience participation. They treat the audience right but it still feels silly being basically required to give a standing ovation to some ""celebrity"" you may or may not care about (gave a standing O to the girl from Dr. Who, which I've never seen, and a comedian I imagine nobody in the audience had ever heard of). But they have to get that energy across on TV, so I get it. Anyway, still really cool to be part of a live taping and get to see Conan, Andy and the guests so close.",Columbiankramer
50,Great experience. Get tickets if you can!,"I have been to two Conan tapings. The first time, I showed up early in the morning, and was lucky to get a stand-by ticket. Back when the Tonight Show with Jay Leno was also taping in Burbank, it was pretty easy to get tickets online, and for most other talk shows, it's not that difficult, but Conan tickets can be hard to score, as he is extremely popular. This is evident when you witness a taping and you see your fellow audience members being super excited.Attending a taping of a talk show requires a lot of waiting. The time you have to show up is well before you are let into the studio, and the experience usually includes waiting in a parking garage for 2 hours or so. Once inside, you get a seat assigned and while most seats are good, you may risk getting placed near the back. To be fair though, the order in which you enter the studio is usually the order in which you arrived in the morning, as everyone gets a queue number.The actual taping is a fun experience, and you get to see the whole thing in the same order as it will be aired later that evening, and sometimes they also do some promos in front of the audience. Conan is a great host and there's usually some really good guests on the show.",Rasmus H
50,Great experience !!,"Went to Conan last Monday with JAck Black and Boy George as the guests. Went on 1iota and got tickets several weeks ago( very easy). We arrived Monday about 12:30 and there were already ~ 80 people there. You pull into the parking garage( put gps in, no problem finding it), free parking. To the left there are several; large signs that say Conan. You pass thru a metal detector then sit in rows and wait. About 12:50 they showed up, you went up in order and got a wrist stamp, wrist ban and a card for your group. My wife has walking issues so we got a "" purple card""( more in a few) We were told to return by 3:15. we left , went back to hotel( loews) for awhile. We returned about 3:05, they have shirts for sale( return to the same spot where you initially meet) At 3:15 she called out for the purple cardss. We walked across the bridge and got a a WB tour golf cart and were taken to the set. BUT, since we were early, then gave us a mini tour of WB studios in the golf cart which was great( we did the WB tour at 9:45am that morning and we saw different stuff in the PM.!! We were taken to the fron door, entered and had a candy basket, and were seated in the first 2 rows ! Started at 4:30 on time, band played during the breaks, finished about 5:30, got back into the goldf cart and left. Very easy experience, no issues at all, went to the hotel and watched our episode that night at 8pm !!",iritis
50,Really good experience,"Based on other reviews, we chose the Conan show over the Tonight Show because it seemed like a less intrusive and day-hogging time commitment. It went exactly as others have described it- we arrived early around 12:00 and waited in line to get our tickets, numbers, and bracelets. We were allowed to leave and get lunch nearby and actually had time to go to the Hollywood Sign lookout before we needed to be back at 3pm. The numbers hold your place in line so you don't have to feel chained to the parking garage and it was a very stress free way to make sure you got a good seat. The actual show was fun to watch and took a little over an hour. It was a pretty painless way to see something pretty cool.",Ann A
50,"Great experience, very organized","First, you park in the garage at Gate 8 at Warner Bros. You'll see the place to gather for the show on the first floor of the garage. Once you've parked, you'll go through security, and be given a number in the order you arrived in. If you're given a white card, you're guaranteed to be seated at the show. The yellow numbers were standby. Once you have your number, you can leave an come back by the quoted time, ours was 3:30. You won't lose your place in line because you have your assigned number. They passed out free popsicles while we waited, and bathrooms are available.Next, once it's time, they'll line everyone up according to number, and they escort you to the studio by crosswalk. It's a little bit of a walk.Finally, you're seated in the theater. There's not really a bad seat in the house. We were in the last row and it was great. Before the show, an opener comes out to warm up the audience. He was fine, but you're there to see Conan, or the celebrities.Be energetic and have fun! And put your phone away and enjoy the show!",missarahbeth
50,Well organized and fun show!,"I love the way that 1iota organizes the tickets for this show. You show up early, get your tickets, and then come back for the check-in time. This avoids having to wait in line for hours before the show. We went to the theatre right at 330 (the check-in time) and the show started right at 4:30. There was an additional segment to be filmed for a show later that week, so we had to stay an extra half hour. Overall, an excellent experience!",Den665
50,Great experience!,"We love Conan and we checked every day waiting to get tickets for the show that we planned on attending during our visit to LA. Tickets are free but they do sell out quickly. We got there somewhere between 12:30-1:00. After you check in, there's a lot of sitting around and waiting, so we walked around for a bit. There was a food truck right down the street, but we had already eaten lunch because we weren't sure to expect. They walk you from the ""pen"" across the street through the WB lots, then you wait in line a bit longer, then you walk over to the studio.We ended up being in the second row right in front of the ""monologue"" spot. It was so cool having him right in front of us! The band plays a bunch before the show to get the crowd up and it's a lot of fun. There were three guests and a surprise guest that was actually for a show later in the week, so Conan and Andy switched ties and pretended it was Wednesday, which was pretty funny. It's very interesting to see how the show is taped and how the whole show goes down.You have to commit a lot of your day although the taping itself isn't all that long. I highly recommend a visit to Conan!",etak8
40,Good Experiece,"Decided to try this just to have the experience and see how the late night show format worked. It was very interesting and took only two hours which was better than the 4/5 hrs that the taping of the sitcom we saw took. We were treated very well, it was as we expected and were well entertained.",billm736
30,Fun,we had a good time. It was a quick taping. Loved to see how filming is done for a talk show. Be aware when you go to a taping of the age restrictions,Michelle T
50,Super fun show,"Loved it... entire show taping lasts one hour, unlike sitcoms that can be 2-3+ hours. Conan was hilarious and had great guests.",Kirsten R
40,Great fun,"This is a fun afternoon ! I found it easy to get tickets online through team Conan. Most people show up at the car park which is listed as the address on the tickets about 1230. I think it saids to come t 2pm but you should go earlier. You can pick up your tickets and you have to be back about 3pm. On the morning we went for a studio tour which was great fun too. Good to combine the two for a great day. When getting your tickets or when returning at 3pm there is very little queuing, in fact there are seats all the way. When it's time to head across to the studio they take you in groups across the road to the studio, it's a little walk but not too far and very interesting as you walk through the studio lot which is interesting, keep your eye out for a star or two. The staff are all very friendly and I'm told more friendly than a lot of the other shows. You can't take a camera but you can take your phone and they do let you take a couple of photos of you in the audience before the show starts, but once they say phones away make sure you do, cos there is a very scary looking security guard watching the audience the whole time. Prior to the show they hype up the audience and really get you into the spirit of things. The show is great fun and at the end Conan sings a song to the audience that you don't see onTV. He comes into the audience singing the song. After the show you are escorted back to the carpark across the road. You see the back lot at night as you walk through it and i a real romanced feeling of the old films that would have been filmed on this amazing lot. It finishes about 5ish. I'm not from a America so it's amazing to see this kind of show filmed and see some real live stars. The staff are great and very friendly and look like they really love their job. It's a wonderful experience!",Ero40
40,It was a fun entertaining afternoon. Conan is brilliant,"So they say they have 12 writers and 8 good ones. That was the case with this show. The material was a bit ""off."" I find Conan to be funnier when he is winging it and just adding his own humor. But we enjoyed the show and you will too. Be prepared to walk a long distance to get the studio.",traveltheworldcs
50,Fun afternoon outing!,"We went to a Conan show while I was about 6months pregnant, which ended up being awesome because they ended up carting us over in a golf cart, and escorted us to some prime seats for the show taping.Never have been to a taping before, and it was a fun experience, definitely would recommend.FYI can't use bathrooms after you leave the ""holding area""",A_honeymooner
50,conan was being conan,from getting into the parking garage where you check in to getting to the studio was not bad at all. there was a walk involved but it have you a chance to walk around some of the WB studios on your way to the show. Funny show and Funny conan,fred3235
50,Love Conan? You'll love being in the audience.,"I was very impressed by this experience! The show clearly cares about keeping the audience happy.The ticket suggests arriving at 3pm, but it turns out it's worth arriving as early as 11:30am / noon. They hand out numbers on a first come, first served basis... we arrived at noon and got #59. You can then leave and return by 3 to actually see the show.There's free parking so that isn't an issue. In the waiting area, they have a small stand selling overpriced t-shirts, #teamcoco wristbands and hats. On the day we went, it was rainy, so we had to walk for a bit in the rain before a pit-stop in a covered area. Then we continued our walk through the WB back lot and into the Conan studio.As soon as you walk in, you're offered a little chocolate, and you grab your seat. At #59, we were a bit higher up than half way, but still had a great view. The band performs for a while, then there's a warm-up guy who is genuinely funny. Finally... the man himself, right on cue.The show was 'live to tape' so once it starts, you'll be out in an hour. We caught a great show with the cast of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.""This is a great way to spend the afternoon. Highly recommend it!",lespanman
50,Go see Conan!,"My family and I attended a taping of the Conan O'Brien show last May. Tickets are free by requesting them online on the show's website but do so in advance. (Minimum age is 16). Once you are awarded tickets, show staff will correspond via email with your reservation and show information. On the day of taping, you will meet at a parking garage near the studio in Burbank/Los Angeles (they suggest arriving between 1:30 and 2:00) to sign everyone in (take a photo id with you). You will have to wait in the assigned area (bathrooms are available) until staff walk you over to the studio. Backpacks and other large items aren't allowed in the studio.Once you are seated in the studio, someone will warm the crowd up, the band will play, etc. The show starts taping at 4:30. Conan and everyone else was great! My family loves his show so it was a trip highlight to go to see him.It is somewhat an investment of time, but we did the Warner Brothers Studio tour (also great) that morning, had lunch, and then did the Conan show. Highly recommend!",VirginiaJean2
