50,Stores ARE nearby,"Someone commented that stores and gas stations are more than 7 miles away. Not true. I live just over a mile from this park. There is a Super Walmart, Stater Brothers, Aldiâ€™s, gas station and at LEAST 10 fast food restaurants 3 miles northwest of the fields.",Peaches1468

40,Weekend Soccer,"We had a wonderful time at the So Cal Soccer Tournament in Lancaster, California. The parking attendants ran the parking lot smoothly,and the fields were well kept.",Robert L
40,Big Field for Soccer Events,"This park is fairly big, and surrounded by desert. There isn't a conveinces store/gas station for several miles (7+), so be prepare to bring your snacks and drinks, and have your car fueld up. There isn't much shade around the park, but if there is, there ar some tree's for shade.",Cristina Weaver
40,State Cup Soccer here we come!,This is the 2nd year we've traveled to Lancaster for state cup soccer. The fields are nice although a few of them looked like they suffered a bit from the water shortage. There are permanent structures that contain bathrooms (yeah no port-a-potties here). There is ample parking (paved) and several play structures for younger children to play on. Not alot of shade though so bring your own umbrella or easy-up. Beware it can get very windy here too. Parking during tournaments is $6.00 per day.,craftywriter
40,Allow Extra Time to Drive Here,"When you start going down Ave L from HWY 14 you are going to feel like you are driving FOREVER, because you are. But when you get to this complex, it will be worth the journey. Our youngest two sons practiced soccer here with their schools and leagues and they played games here. It is super well maintained and clean and I hope it stays as a Lancaster gem that our community can celebrate while allowing our kids (and adults) to get the exercise they need.",EllieRKay
30,National Cup,Fields could use some tending. Grass was not recently mowed. Areas of dirt on the fields. Quite weedy.,Pherby
40,Too Long Drive for Good Fields...,"The facilities at the Center are great. The parking is excellent. The fields are amazing, especially the FIFA fields. Two things absolutely kill this place: 1) the drive and 2) the weather. We are from San Diego. It is horribly inconvenient to get a team up there. Well, this year (2014), in contrast to previous years, the weather was amazing. Yes, the tournament was rained out one weekend. The other three weekends were just beautiful, with no wind. Now, if somebody could just do something about the drive...",Daniel K
40,Great Soccer Park,"I haven't been to the Soccer Park, in years however we spent many week ends with our kids at the soccer park, and it is great for the kids",inspectrdad
40,Lots of parking!,The fields are pretty good but the parking is excellent! You can pull up pretty close to your field so for unloading chairs and team benches it is a breeze. Speaking of breeze.... the wind blows pretty constantly!,Susan P
