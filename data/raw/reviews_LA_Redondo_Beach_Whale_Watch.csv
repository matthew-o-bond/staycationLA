40,whale watching,"I went on whale watch boat on Feb 17, 2020cool winter day for southern Californiagreat crewI was in Cali for a weddingvisiting from brazilWe didn't see whales that daybut captain searched high and lowany time I am at seaI am happy!!!!",africanmatrix
50,Probably the best thing you will do in California,I sometimes work in southern California. My go to place when I arrive from the UK is always Redondo Pier. My go to place at my go to place is the Redondo Beach fishing and whale watch. I have been on numerous fishing trips and caught some great fish. I have also been whale watching and seen Blue Whales and Gray whales along with Humpbacks and dolphins. The wildlife in the sea here is unbelievable with pelicans and sea lions everywhere. In the 2 years I have been coming I haven‚Äôt had the need to explore the Glitzy side of LA. The beauty and surprises of a few hours at sea put everything into perspective. There are so many amazing things to see here.It is truly something special.,Dne66
10,Watching deck hand picking trash out of ocean NOT WHALE WATCHING,"We book this whale watching trip online as we have been on this boat several times before and always seen whales. However, after driving all the way from Arizona which was a 7-hour drive and going on the Monday February 17th 2020 two and a half hour whale watching trip, we then realize about 30 minutes into the trip that we paid $75 to watch the deckhand pull trash out of the ocean and not doing any whale watching. Granite I'm all for Pulling stuff out of the ocean and making our oceans cleaner hands down, but don't charge me $75 to do it. When a customer pays $75 you need to primarily focus on finding whales or some sort of sea life and not worry about picking up trash. Also by the way this is not the same Captain as we once knew that ran this boat nor is any of the crew members the same all new crew members all new captain and very crappy service. What's even worse is they were some naturalist on board which was two females in red jackets who was walking around the deck and informing everybody of very knowledgeable information about the whales. But once we started picking up trash which was about 45 minutes into the trip these two females were nowhere to be found LOL. Until my wondering eyes looked up and seen the Captain entertaining the two females up in the wheelhouse and not focusing on finding whales for the 42 paying customers. So just think about this, 42 people paying $35 each which is a grand total of 1,470 dollars they made off of paying customers hoping to find and see some whales only to realize we're cleaning the ocean. I know this is a long review but hopefully you are still reading it at this point and will then realize that this is not the whale watching boat you want to be on nor pay for. So save your money and find another whale watching boat because you might have better luck because you will not see nothing but the water Birds and trash on this whale watching boat in Redondo Beach California on the Redondo Beach Pier.

50,Redondo Special 1/2 day,"Beautiful day, Good ExperienceThanks to all the Crew.It was a good day for fishingThanks again12/21/19",Masato T
10,Horrible customer service,"The Asian attendant inside the boat was rude, never smiled , only time he spoke he was barking commands at someone to not do something. Two family members got sick and you are forced to throw up over the side of the boat - when someone falls over they will change that rule. It was an overall boring trip, would not recommend.",Josie M
50,Redondo Beach Whale Watch,The crew and captain were very friendly and informative. Overall a very relaxing and nice ride. We will do it again next time in town.,Lzangari
50,Great boat ride!,We really enjoyed this boat ride off the coast of Redondo Beach. Very friendly crew. We saw sea lions and dolphins within minutes of heading out. The gentle swells were enjoyable. Great for kids and adults - young and old.,KathyHibbs
50,Outstanding,"Wonderful trip with very friendly and knowledgeable crew. We saw hundreds of dolphins, sea lions, and humpback whales. We were all thrilled with the experience and can‚Äôt recommend it enough! Worth every cent and consider it a Do Not Miss!",Kathi
50,Whale watching,"This was worth every dollar of our trip to Cali, the Captain and crew were awesome and seeing the Dolphins swim next to the Boat was Beautiful.. üê¨",Jose
50,Adventures on the open ocean,"Was very happy with the entire experience with Redondo Beach Whale Watch. Even though we didn't see any whales, there were many other ocean dwellers to entertain us. The crew did a great job entertaining those on board with information about the ocean, the ocean inhabitants in this particular area, and the surrounding beach and coastal community. They even let everyone on board know that Alan and Bonnie were celebrating their 55th wedding anniversary and also gave popsicles to the kids after the trip. I thoroughly enjoyed my time and plan to go again soon.",Culture14383
10,"no whale at all - should be called wildlife watch, not whale watch",We didn't see any whale and were very disappointed. This trip seemed more like a cruise than whale watching trip.,Extraordinary327352
50,Good fishing with good crew,We did the fishing charter at 7:30am. The captain and deckhands were all very helpful with setting up our rigs and putting us on the fish. My wife got sick and the crew did what they could to help her out. We caught a lot of fish and had a great experience. Thanks for everything.,Scott V
40,Family fun,Parking was super easy and only two dollars with validation. We didn‚Äôt see any whales but had some amazing experiences with a couple pods of dolphins. The staff was incredibly friendly and informative. They had a wide variety of drinks available for purchase on board as well as some packaged snacks like granola bars and chips. We had a wide age range in our group from 6 years old to 65 years old. Everyone enjoyed themselves. Just keep in mind that the seas can be a little bumpy and Dramamine may be a good thing to have on hand. üòâ,Sarah F
40,Great experience,"Booked my 10 year old son a morning of ocean fishing, his first time. John the deck hand was awesome and gave Blake all the help he needed and then some.We fished 3 or 4 different spots and caught at each one. Some were not keepers we tossed about 20 back but we kept 20+ mostly rock bass. My only negative was the fish were on the small side for the most part. Overall I had a great time and I recommend using these guys.....I know i will again.",Sunseeker
50,So good we went two days in a row,"We did this trip two days in a row. The first day we saw big numbers of three types of dolphin - bottlenose, common and the unusual white Rossi. The bottlenose nose were very playful jumping clear of the water. We had great weather and the crew were brilliant. We weren't sure what to do today so figured we'd go again, didn't see as much today with just common dolphins but they were delightful bow-riding. We will definitely do this again if we are back in Redondo Beach, it's great value and maybe next time we'll get whales - only mother nature can decide that for us. Thanks for a couple of great boat trips.",DiTaylor65
50,Amazing experience!,"This RB Whale Watching experience was really superb. We got lucky as we did it on a beautiful, sunny day and so we even got to see lots of rare Rossi dolphins! The staff were really amazing, being consistently kind, accommodating and very entertaining. The tour took exactly 2.5 hours as announced and is suitable for absolutely all age groups. A great morning out, can only recommend it!",Mita
50,Whale Watching Tour,"We had an amazing time on our very first trip ever out on the ocean, within the first 30 minutes, we saw our first whale, followed by several others as well as sea lions and dolphins. The captain and crew went above and beyond to accommodate everybody and make the trip fun and educational. We will 100% do this again if we ever make our way back to California!!!",Kelliespinosa
50,"Relaxing, delightful, and exciting all at once!","Our trip with Redondo Beach Whale Watch was lovely. The boat was small enough for us to get around and meet fellow travelers, and the staff were helpful and friendly. We learned a lot about the sea animals and their habits. We saw lots of dolphins, a real rush as they race with the boat, and we had two sightings of a blue whale--HUGE! We were a little confused about where to meet the boat, but just look for a blue and white boat, INDIAN, on the southeast side of the pier by the restaurants. The boat docks below the ramp. I'm SO thankful we took this tour, and I'm sure we'll go out again.",amershon
50,Worth it! Great staff.,We saw 2 fin whales and 50+ dolphins and other sea critters. It was exciting and so fun for the kiddos! Staff were informative and helpful. The Boat was clean and comfortable and easy to move around on. In addition to seeing amazing wild life... I personally think it is totally worth it to take the excursion to see the breath taking California coast line. Take the time to explore our beautiful ocean! RB Whale watching did a great job. Thank you.,Colleen F
40,Great Whale Watching on the Indian,"The Reservation Office, the Indian, and its crew did a great job for a morning of whale watching. Two to three hundred common dolphins, three or four California Grey Whales and one Fin Whale. If you have the time, this is a great trip.",FrederickBurg
50,Great trip with very good crew,"We had an opportunity to see an extensive amount of marine life. Unfortunately no whales today. On the other hand, we literally saw hundreds of dolphins and sea lions and other wonderful marine life. Definitely a good trip. Good service",TJP7301
50,Great tour!,"We enjoyed this experience. Numerous whales, dolphins, and seals. Tour guides are very helpful and knowledgeable. The harbor is a nice area that you would want extra time to spend in. I would do another tour.",Robin W
40,Knowledgeable & Fun Staff,"The boat tour is approximately 2.5 hours. Sightings cannot be guaranteed but the staff watches for the telltale signs of a whale in the area and the Captain will get the boat to the location. The Staff also provides some tips on what everyone can be looking for to increase the chances of a sighting up close. Throughout the tour they include facts and statistics to round out the experience. There are two restrooms on board. Drinks and snacks are available for purchase.On our particular tour we saw 3-4 Gray whales, a Fin whale as well as a pod of dolphins which is considered a great day. Note that this tour is designed to see and track whales. The boat generally goes slow which means lots of motion as the waves pass. You may want to take some precaution to prevent motion sickness if you're not sure how your body will react. We saw several people learn that they do get sea sick and the captain can't take you back to shore.Our entire group enjoyed the experience and those of us who live locally will definitely consider doing it again next year.",Christine L
50,Best whale watch trip ever !!,Whale watch trip yesterday was absolutely incredible! I have been watching whales for the last 10 years (onshore and on the water) and never had a trip like this one. This was my second time on the Indian this year and both trips could not have been better because of the outstanding crew. Megan's enthusiasm is awesome and thanks to Captain Dave's experience we wound up in the middle of a mega pod of dolphin (2000 or more ) along with 7 humpback whales and a rare sighting of a fin whale just 20 feet from the boat. The price is most reasonable and nearby parking validation is only $2 for the day.Do not hesitate to book this trip.,lbrucker
40,Different boat from the last time I visited,"The price has gone up significantly from the time of my first review a few years ago. The charming old boat with all of its exterior deck space has now been replaced by another craft that sports extensive interior space that is a welcome relief when the climate cools, which happens just about every day at sea when the sun begins to set.",Primo54
50,"Gray whales, dolphins, sea lions, and more","The 2.5-hr tour is awesome. We saw a gray whale and a bunch of dolphins and sea lions. There is also a variety of birds that follow the dolphins to 'clean the plate'. Even the view of the marina is just breathtaking. I would say the hand rail is kind of low, and so walking around the ship can be tricky.",skim12
50,Awesome experience,"We had a great time on the Indian. Captain David was very professional and kind. The crew was helpful and informative. The boat was clean and never felt overcrowded. This is a great value for the money. Even if we didn't see whales, the view up and down the South Bay coast us lovely.",gusngladisP
50,Gray Whales and Dolphins,"Great boat, nice crew. We were so lucky to see the migrating Gray whales and dolphins Beautiful trip in the South bay. The view was amazing. Also we saw several sea lions gathered together in a Raft.",That Dude
30,Fun cruise but no whales today,"Went on the morning cruise but sadly there were no whales anywhere. However the boat was comfortable, clean and safe and the person on the loudspeaker didn‚Äôt talk too much (thank you) but did point out things to see and brought us alongside many clusters of the sea lions and their barge, they did have snacks and drinks available and restrooms. The guide pointed out points of interest along the coastline and explained about the various sea birds. It was a wonderful day at sea so anytime on the ocean is good. We enjoyed our trip.",Cheryal
10,Liars,Paid for a trip and turned up !!!!! Cost me $35 and $60 to get there !!!! Only to be told the sea was to rough and wouldn‚Äôt be going out !! Truth is they sold only 5 tickets and didn‚Äôt want to take a hit and lose money !!! Disgusting treatment !!! Honour your trips !! Or at least have the decency to be honest.,Edward_Lawton
50,Very nice and calm Beach,"This beach is a hidden gem, wish I would‚Äôve known about it sooner. When you drop down to the waterfront feels like you‚Äôre in a small town. If you hang out long enough you are bound to see wildlife swimming about. An added bonus is the beautiful park next to the",Bryan T
50,Great morning out!,"We were staying in Torrence for a few days on a work trip. We spent the morning on this trip. Fantastic value for money, saw lots of dolphins and sea lions. Sadly no whales!But what a fabulous way to spend a morning for $35!",brit99
50,Great afternoon on the water,Went as a family group. Great boat and crew. They get you close to the action. Had good views of humpback whale and lots of dolphins.,tollyg
10,Staff should have compensate us,"Two bad experiences with this company.Day 1, good weatherFirst the boat was full. 41 persons on board, with at least 10 children. 42 max. they said to us. We were with three and they did not let us enter. They did not want to make an exception for 2 extra persons. Afraid of the coast guard regulations. Yeah, right.Day 2, bad weatherIt was a misty morning the following day. Bad luck. We tried our luck, bad didn't see anything. No compensation for all the 22 people on board. The staff did not even try to give us some compensation. Easy money. No service at all.",John M
50,The overall boat ride was fantastic!!,The Captain and Russell made everyone feel welcome and offered excellent customer service. We did not see any whales on our trip but had several dolphins jumping and swimming in front of the boat. The boat ride alone was fantastic!! I did get a little seasick but nothing 7up couldn't help. Beautiful day spent out on the water with a great crew!!!,chrisbishtx
50,What a fun day,It was a fun day. Not to many whales but a few that the captain followed so we could see. The crew was outstanding. Would love to go back in the future.,anagirl
50,Whale are a Gift period!,"You'll never experience a true JOY, untill you see a Whale breach out of the water, it's so exciting and beautiful energy. I keep hoping my Whales here in Redondo, could breach as much as thee Maui Whales do, but just watch them as often as I am able is a Gift and true heartful Joy.",Longlegponi
50,Rave Reviews,Loved the Captain and the Crew...Saw lot's of Dolphins and Whales with Baby's Very nice trip~~I can not wait to go again...hoping grandkids will visit and all of us go~!! Redondo Beach is awesome..Voyager is awesome,ODW2014
50,Great way to spend an afternoon,"I'm a local so I've been on the boat several times. It's an older boat and has a lot of character. I love sitting (mostly standing) near the front bow. I've been on trips where we've seen a dozen whales in two hours and some trips where we saw none. It's all good. Even if there are no whales around, the dolphins typically come out to swim in the wake and there are always sea lions out and about. Winter days with Santa Ana wind conditions are the best -- the ocean will be like glass. I like to watch the weather forecast and as soon as I see those conditions coming, I head to the pier.",LaSerena
50,"Gray Whales, Fin Whales, and dolphins","Expect a friendly afternoon, relatively calm waters, relatively warm weather, convivial shipmates. It's not a big boat. It's not a fast boat. But it gets you there, and the captain knows where to go to find active surface sea-life. The fact that as soon as you exit the harbor you're motoring over the deep Redondo Undersea Canyon certainly helps to get you into the thick of things straight off. A truly pleasurable time. I try to make one trip aboard every winter/early-spring season.",Primo54
50,very knowlegeble,we didn't know what to expect. The crew was very knowledgeable. The water was rough that day and still we spotted whales. In fact one breached. Spectacular.,michael m m
40,"Great boat, great crew","Our trip was uncharacteristically rainy and cold, but the crew made the most of it. We saw dolphins and sea lions, and had a great time on the ocean.When we go back, I'll take another cruise on Voyager without a doubt.",HoosierTraveler71
50,Amazing day in the South Bay,"The crew is knowledgeable, the boat ride is smooth, the view from the boat to the shore is breathtaking even if you live here.We have gone four times, the whales and dolphins have been abundant this year so your odds are good.Even if you do not experience any whales or dolphins the coastal ride is worth the time.",Gfamily90278
50,"a ""Must do"" if you are in the area",We had a 4 hour boat trip looking for whales on a blisteringly hot day in September.Boat was not that crowded and mainly fellow Europeans.We sat on the top deck - both to get the best views and also to experience the ocean swell.Boat crew clearly were both very professional with their boat handling but also knew exactly where to look for whales and other Marine Life. We did see a minkie and a young Hump backed whale - but on this occasion other types did not put in an appearance. Never mind - we do understand that there are no guarantees and we still had a great memorable morning on the Ocean.,BobandJosie
50,Highly recommended!,"For only 25$ you can spend 4 hours on the Ocean, see some whales, dolphins and sea lions! Sounds like a good deal!The crew is amazing and very informative so we learnt many things!However, there could be one big problem - sea sickness! Several people from our group suffered, I was one of them, so most of the excursion was painful for me. Strange, I have been many times on the boat before and this never happened. So, think about this in advance...",Milan L
50,Amazing,Had a amazing day with. Captain Ryan. This is a must do in the area. Had a 7 year old with us not the child and adults loved thus trip. Saw dolphins . sea lions. And whale. Beautiful area tour.,Wendi W
50,Great little ocean boat ride!,"Enjoyable 45"" cruise along Redondo Beach coastline to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Clean boat, very friendly crew, affordableand no reservations required for trip that leaves on the hour. Little ones were invited to help steer the boat which is always a big time!",Rebecca A
50,Fabulous family entertainment!,Each and every one of our four generation family had an absolutely fabulous day on the Voyager! We saw Whales and every kind of sea and flying creature! Everyone on board Had a really terrific time and the crew was fabulous in describing what we were seeing and when - even gave tips on ocean ecology and Conservancy! I was very impressed when that huge boat was able to pick up a balloon off the surface of the water in one pass! Can't wait to go back!,Eagle S
50,Great trip,Thank you Captain Jack - the tour with you was just great - lots of dolphins and a lot of grey whales too.Karin thank you for your help and friendliness,Gerino
50,awesome!,The staff here is so friendly! We saw about 8 whales while we were out. It is so great how the captain points each one out. This also isn't too pricy and people of all ages can do it.,Darian C
50,Excellent Whale Adventure,"My husband and I had a wonderful time with Voyager Whale Watching. We went on a Friday morning and had made a reservation because the boat was full the prior Saturday. For the two of us, the cost was $45. My husband is a senior.We saw at least ten whales and some dolphins too. The whales did not get too close to the boat, but they get close enough to see. The captain said they had to stay at least 100 yards from the whales. One whale did pop up about 30 yards away.The boat headed south towards Palos Verdes, and we stayed fairly close to shore. The whole trip lasted about three hours.There were a couple naturalists onboard who talked about whales and answered questions. They were friendly and helpful.The boat is nice enough and it has a restroom. They sell snacks like chips, granola bars, and candy bars for $1. They sell drinks too.When we got back to the dock, there were several people lined up for the 1:30 trip. If you want to avoid a crowded boat, go during the week on one of the 10:00 AM trips. There were about 20 people total on our trip, so it was nice to easily roam about the boat on both levels.",cherold598
50,Superb superb superb - you MUST do this!!,"One of life's great experiences, and not to be missed. We had a fantastic afternoon last Tuesday with the marvellous crew and naturalists aboard the Voyager. Thanks so much to Barb, Bobbi, Vaish, and everybody else from the English couple! And for just USD25 - unbelievable. If you do just one thing at lovely Redondo Beach between December and April, make it this.",Flooj12
50,Love the Voyager!,We went out on Sunday 1/18/15 and saw so many whales and dolphins. Best trip yet on the Voyager and we will be back for more whale watching!,BablovesKurt
50,See Sea Life!!!,"What a great boat ride!!! We saw sea lions, and dolphins!!! Everyone was so friendly a helpful! I strongly recommend this!!!",Irene4re
50,I am so glad we added this to our trip!,Very nice crew. The kids had so much fun but it wasn't overly long (all under 11) so they didn't get restless. We saw lots of dolphins and sea lions! I was worried about bathroom trips with the kids so the fact that there was one on board actually helped our decision to go on this trip. (we didn't even need it.) So much fun seeing sea life on a boat.,d rays
50,Excellent Whale Watching Operation,"We've been out with these folks numerous times over the years. These professionals really are very, very adept at locating the whales and getting to their location without scaring them away. When we have out of town visitors, we pay to go out with Voyager, even though we could take our own boat out instead.To date, we've NEVER been out without seeing at least one whale (usually more). The docents are from the American Cetacean Society - LA chapter, and they can answer just about any question AND describe the whale behavior (feeding, breeding, cruising, playing) you are observing. We've seen grays, fins, humpbacks, blues, minkes and both common and bottlenose dolphin, along with the usual sea lions.",Lisa F
50,Best part of vacation!,This tour is hosted by naturalists so you get lots of great information. We saw several grey whales plus some other interesting sea life. Don't forget the sunscreen because you are out on the water every minute of the three hours promised.,lampj
50,Whale watching,"What a great trip! Saw 6 gray whales, thousands of dolphins and seals!! Spent a lot more time then we were supposed to which was a treat with all our sightings! Loved it !!",dmp31563
30,Would have ranked higher if boat was non-smoking,"Great crew, nice boat. Easy access to whales and pelagic birds at a reasonable cost. Was first in line to get best spot on boat for photography and was disappointed to have large group of smokers end up sitting nearby. Was surprised as I have never been on a wildlife watching boat (Ecuador, Trinidad, Costa Rica, New Zealand, USA [Washington, Hawaii, S. Carolina, Florida, etc]) that had smokers on board. That was the only negative about the trip. Would be an Excellent if they made the short trip (2.5 - 3 hrs) non-smoking.During the late February trip we saw 5+ Fin Whales, Short-beaked and Long-beaked Common Dolphins, California Sea Lions, Common Murres, Cassin's Auklets, Scripp's Murrelets and numerous gulls including a single Black-legged Kittiwake. etc.",MangoverdeCVG
50,Beautiful weather + great crew,"Very easy nearby parking + casual indoor/outdoor cafe next door to enjoy before or after...food looked very tasty + spectacular day + great, good-natured and informative crew in addition to the lovely folks handling matters in the office--------- Okay, there were no whales on our trip. However, there were pods of dolphins with one very crowded sighting just about surrounding the boat and seals and ocean birds and a gorgeous flat ocean that made the coming and going just perfect. A relaxed weekday outing that included locals like myself and some international tourists. Not too crowded so a number of us socialized throughout the journey. The water was sparkling, the air was brisk and shot through with the warmth of a bright sun, and the ever changing views made for a delightful day!",SMGalNewDiscoveries
50,So Much Fun!,"We enjoyed our 3 hour morning excursion on the Voyager very much. On my Bucket List was ""See a whale"" Check! They don't guarantee that a whale will be seen so we were fortunate to see two pretty close to the ship! What a thrill! Lots of dolphin too! The crew was great and made us feel very welcome. Will do this again when in the area.",evans7
40,Great trip! Take dramamine!,The only thing I would advise is to take dramamine before doing this. The experience is so great you don't want to miss it by being sick. Even if you don't noramlly get motion sick the waves can be rough. I wish the ticket sales people would have advised us of this or sold dramamine at the counter when we purchased our tickets. The captain did suggest it but we were on the ship at the time. A little too late for that advise. The guides were great and knowledgeable!,DebTWiltonIowa
50,Can only agree with other reviewer,"A great afternoon, saw a number of Fin Whales.Naturalists onboard provide information that adds value to the trip.Excellent value $12 per person as we are 55.",Inths
50,Great value trip where we saw Blue Whales and Pods of Dolphins,"We only had a couple of days in LA but the signs up at Redondo Beach stated that there were Blue Whales in the area so we decided to take this trip.We took the afternoon trip on a Monday in August, The cost was $15 which is very reasonable for 3 hour voyage. The boat is capable of taking 100+ passengers but on our's there were only about 30. There is plenty of room up top but more limited down below for those wanting shade or somewhere warm in winter.Like many such trips there is no guarantee of seeing any particular sea life and as the boat is large and slow it can't cover a huge amount of territory or react at speed to where whales are surfacing.On our trip we came across several pods of Dolphins and saw them close up riding the bow wave of the vessel. These in turn led us to two Blue whales; a mother and her calf.It was an excellent and relaxed trip which we thoroughly enjoyed.",Dagog
