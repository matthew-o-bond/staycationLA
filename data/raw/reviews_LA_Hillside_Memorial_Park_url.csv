50,A quiet place with big-name entertainers,"We spend a rainy morning exploring this tranquil cemetery and paying tribute to those who entertained us. Al Jolson's memorial fountain is extraordinary, and it's easy to find Leonard Nimoy. Milton Berle, Dinah Shore, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene are just a few of the others who rest there. It's located near our hotel and Dinah's Diner, where we had breakfast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LunieSt_Paul_MN

50,Peaceful Sanctuary for Leonard Nimoy,"I visited Hillside Memorial Park last June to pay my respects to the beloved actor, writer, director, photographer, singer, and philanthropist, Leonard Nimoy. I could not have imaged a more lovely, respectful, peaceful resting place for my friend, mentor, teacher, and beloved actor who played Mr Spock on Star Trek, the Original Series and in the TOS movies that followed. Extremely helpful, understanding park personnel helped guide me to the lovely location of Mr Nimoy's burial spot, a beautiful rocky area with a waterfall, lots of flowering plants and trees, and simple marker. I sat for two hours simply talking to my friend and praying. A very compassionate young rabbi came by to comfort me as I mourned Mr Nimoy and provided me with a prayer book in Hebrew and English. When I left, I felt as though I had truly spent time with someone so important in my life and felt as peace. I shall be returning this June to visit Mr Nimoy again and spend some time visiting some other wonderfully talented Jewish greats buried at this peaceful and blessed park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJMK
50,Been visiting my relatives for over fifty years.....,"Although the location is surrounded by traffic, businesses, shopping center (being right off the 405), it is still a place I come for solace and comfort. Once one goes through the gates into the park, all the nonsense of the world is left behind. Some of my most loved ones are residents so my main goal is to visit them. I find peace and calmness whenever I visit as I spend the majority of my time in the masauleum. It is quiet and I am left alone with my thoughts and my tears. When I leave, I feel refreshed and renewed.In all the world, this is my favorite place to go just to sit and think and reflect.I realize many people will go simply to visit the celebrity residents but I hope they will take the time to visit the other areas. Every maker has a story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blnaq

Because it is so vast we asked a worker for directions & he took us to Michael Landons gravesite & also Lorne Greene""s. The grounds were immaculate...just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trudymacey
50,Beautiful Place - Unfortunately Located Near Interstate,"The grounds of the cemetery are beautiful and immaculately kept. It is located right near the 405 in Culver City, so it is perhaps not the ""most quiet"" resting place one could have. There are many celebrities buried on the grounds and locations and further information can be found on the cemetery's website. The staff was very helpful and friendly. To find specific resting places, you may have to do a bit of walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaW718
40,Wonderful Cemetery,"Hillside is a Jewish cemetery.It's open every day except for Jewish holidays. It is a very big place and all the stones in the ground are flat which makes it difficult to find a grave. There's a huge mausoleum as well. The grounds near the Al Jolson fountain and near the mausoleum are beautifully landscaped. The employees are very friendly and helpful and will help you locate any celebrity grave your looking for. We initially came to see Moe Howard's gave from the Three Stooges but ended up seeing lots of other celebrities as well. Melton Berle, Nell Carter, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene are just to name a few. We enjoyed our time visiting here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aerowing
