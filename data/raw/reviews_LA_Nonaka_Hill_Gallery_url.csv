50,New art gallery featuring Japanese artists,"Rodney Hill and Taka Nonaka have partnered to open a new art gallery specializing in contemporary Japanese artists (i.e. post-1945). Their artist line up and exhibition plan are unique within Los Angeles (and probably within the United States).Many of their artists are unknown and under-recognized in the United States but are major figures in the art scene and contemporary art history of Japan. Nonaka-Hill presents monthly exhibitions of their artists.Rodney has a long and distinguished career in contemporary art in Los Angeles and New York. I don't know what Taka's background is but since he's the one who deals with and talks to the artists, I assume he has a good grounding in the arts as well.They have an attractive gallery space in the blossoming arts district along Highland Ave. It is located next door to the fine dining restaurant, Tres Mec. There is gallery parking.If you're looking for something that is fresh and different yet serious minded regarding the arts, this would be a good place to visit. Both Rodney and Taka are friendly and willing to share their knowledge of the artists and the art world, in general.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorrinw2016
