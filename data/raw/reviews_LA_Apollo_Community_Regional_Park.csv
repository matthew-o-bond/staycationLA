40,Please don‚Äôt feed birds bread.,"Lovely park. I‚Äôm a bird watcher so mainly I came to look at birds and stroll around. Please don‚Äôt feed the birds bread. Many people may not realize that many birds end up with deformities, especially wing deformities from eating bread. I saw several birds that were effected. Please educate yourself and your children. You can search ‚Äúangel wing‚Äù which is the name of the deformity. A nice name but a terrible and avoidable condition. If you must feed them at least give them real whole seeds/grains. Thanks!",Koride K
50,Beautiful park,Plenty of parking. Bathrooms are clean and there is handicap accessible areas for getting to the BBQ and picnic tables.,compcrzy
40,Great place to walk,"Spend many summer evenings in this park, riding bikes,feeding the ducks, watching the airplanes, playing with the kids on the playground, or just walking and watching the bunnies in the grass. When the park first opened, it had an actual Apollo capsule in an glass enclosure that visitors could look at. Fishing is also permitted in the lakes filled with reclaimed serage water, but swimming is not allowed.",H8900IJdonnap
50,Perfect lil park,"Apollo had long been one or family's favorite local parks. Great for walking clubs, birthday parties, BBQ's, picnics, enjoying nature, feeding the ducks, fishing, (if your into that), and a general relaxing atmosphere. Three different lakes, multiple playgrounds, and picnic areas, clean restrooms on campus, nearby fox field so watching small planes take off and land is always entertaining especially while lounging on one of the boardwalks. Don't forget on the drive over to Apollo Park to literally drive over the musical road that plays the William Tell overture. See if your friends and or children can name that tunes. Take lots of pictures and don't forget to bring bread for the ducks!",DeShara B
40,Nice park,This park has 3 man made lakes where there is fishing and walk ways around the lakes... Used to take the kids to feed the ducks and walk around the park often...,jenjetmd
50,"Those Ducks will Chase You. Go Anyway,","We love this park. It is huge and the kids will have a blast. It has geese and other birds. The lake is lovely and connected by bridges. You can grill here and even fish. I have never fished here so I can not tell you about that.What we love is the vast area to run and the several playgrounds for the kids. It does get super hot in the summer, so try the morning and late afternoon.Now, the geese and ducks may be assertive in their desire for you to feed them, so I don't suggest that. Besides it is really not a healthy thing for the birds. So, when they come at you, it is okay, you will not die. Just move away a bit from the water. Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid
40,Family outings,Nice place to take your kids. You have a choice of 3 different parks you can go fishing even feed the ducks. Keep in mind if feeding the ducks they can get a little aggressive because they will continue to follow you until they see you are no longer going to feed them.,Noah_821
50,A series of lakes connected by bridges,"Looking for somewhere new where the kids could play on a warm, sunny winter afternoon after almost a week of cold, rainy weather, we found this wonderful big park full of geese which were quite playful with children. The playground facilities in the park were actually divided in two and widely separated, with plenty of equipment to choose from. There were also picnic tables. Although lacking in grass there was a calm atmosphere to the place with space to breath and relax in.",bfindysz
10,Closed on Christmas Day,"It‚Äôs rather disappointing that when we came to the park on Christmas Day (December 25, 2018) it was closed. We were not the only ones to arrive and see the doors closed. I saw a couple other cars that came to spend their time off with their kids and had to turn around. We were looking forward to walking around the lake and seeing ducks.",Katya M
40,Very relaxing,Great place to take any age kids. Very relaxing. Hardly ever crowded. Try your luck fishing. Lots of bluegill. Trout are stocked in the cooler months. Playground equipment for the kids. And GRASS.,Russell A
40,Nice place to take a walk.,"Apollo Park is a nice place to take a walk, walk the dog, enjoy the ducks and geese, have a picnic lunch. We used to take our girls to this park to ride their bicycle when they were little. It's a perfect place for this.",Crystal R
50,KB,Really nice park. I like to come early and walk in summer. Lots of birds if you are a bird watcher. Fishing is available and recently we discovered there are alot of turtles in the lake. My son and I found one laying eggs in a hole she dug on the shore. Great shade trees. Several clean restrooms around the 3 lakes. Since LA county Sheriff took over policing the park its been great. No gangsters or shenanigans at the park,Kyle B
50,A Great Park with 3 Lakes !,"This is a great park to walk around. There are three separate lakes and several paved paths. Three separate play areas, barbecues, lots of grass. Lots of geese and ducks to feed if you bring bread. I know, your not supposed to. Anyway, this is a passive park, meaning there is no one on duty to provide service. You will see maintenance and landscaping people, but no one to serve the public. Go enjoy the lakes, trees, grass, and wildlife.",joe L
50,Great Park in the middle of nowhere!,Super busy park but on huge grounds so it didn't seem all that busy. Lots of mini-lakes to fish in and loads of BBQ areas with tables for a real family picnic and day out. Well worth the trip,nickwarrilow
50,A great nice surprise in the desert,I have lived in the Lancaster area just over a year. I was told about the park and went to see it for the first time on Friday Jan. 12 2018. I was checking it out before deciding to take my wife there also as she is limited in walking to much on rough ground and I did not know what to expect.It does look wheel chair and even walker friendly as well as Cane friendly in case someone has walking issues. My wife has had total hip replacements and it looks to be a great relaxing place for her to walk at.I was a little surprised as it was much much cleaner then reviews I read about it. I did NOT have to watch my step because of duck mess around the lake area.It was clean and looked very well maintained.I watch some fishing people catching some Trout. Not a fast catch but a relaxing take you time and enjoy fishing time. I do plan on getting into the fishing end at the lake. I just have not got it together yet to go fishing as I still need to get my license.There are a lot of shade trees around the lake so shade is available and there are covered picnic tables and grill available..It is located a couple miles NE from the Antelope fair grounds and you can even drive on the Musical Road which is just North of the Antelope fair grounds to get to it.,retiredoldsarge
40,Respite from the Desert,"Apollo Park is a lovely park. It has many large, shady, trees, lawn areas, sheltered picnic tables and grills. Everything you need for a nice picnic. There are also bathrooms in every area of the park. The cement walkways make it easy for everyone to enjoy the whole park. The large lake is filled with waterfowl of all sorts and fish, which people do seem to catch. There is even a place to clean your fish. Generally on weekends there is an ice cream truck in the parking lot.",Amalthea7c
40,Geese and Ducks Chasing You Around!,"You don't even need to throw sacks of bread around the way some people do to have hundreds of ducks and geese follow you around honking and quacking like crazy. It's pretty hilarious (I don't have footage yet but you can find some on YouTube.) It's not good to feed wildlife, let alone Wonder Bread, but you can't stop others from doing so, I guess. Birders love this park because there are lots of interesting species here, and plenty of room to take long walks.",SoCalRambler
40,Nice place to walk,Well kept up. Nice place for a stroll in the middle of the desert. Walkways around the water were pleasant. No grass to speak of.,CLC48
50,"We went in search of the space capsule, but it has been moved to Washington DC üòï","My 95 year old Grandma wanted to know if the capsule was still there, so we took a drive after visiting the Antelope Valley poppies.We searched and searched but couldn't find it. Asked a few people, but nobody seems to remember it. We searched the Internet and found that it had been moved.The park is lovely. Great, mature trees with lots of shade. Squirrels, several kinds of ducks were playing at the shoreline. Picnic tables and bbq's too! There was an ice cream man who made us a snow cone, It was delicious!I climbed a tree and just sat staring at the calm water. Great place to picnic, or w walk, bike or bring your leashed dog. I highly recommend Apollo Park!",email4saundra1
30,Going there for years,Bring back our Shuttle...The lake has NOT been stocked why pay for fishing permit if NO fish...Tournament was just couple 2 pounders...really people... I found a nice quiet place to fish and was bombarded by a huge family of Mexicans...Have some manners!Like everyone else I was looking for quiet not some screaming brats and elderly quaking at the ducks. When you see people fishing GO AWAY! as for the lake itself CLEAN IT! the bugs and mesquitos are coming out and the lake is again green... wheres the maintaining that used to be done. I have been going to this park for over 20 years... they used to take pride in it! What will it take to clean it up and STOCK it???,Melody H
50,Apollo park,"Apollo park is a wonderful place to take your family for a walk, to the park, to fish, bbq, or even picnic. You can feed the ducks and enjoy life! Absolutely love it here!",rebeccawH3153OZ
30,Pleasant,"This is a nice park. Good for walking, bike riding, skating or having a picnic. Away from the noise of the city and anything city like. The only down side is the drive to get there. It's a good distance away and the only ""services"" around are bathrooms.",LadyVG
50,BRING YOUR BIKES,"not far from (downtown) Lancaster is this great FAMILY park. rarely busy except for special events they offer 3 levels of playgrounds, trout stocked lakes, covered picnic areas w/bbq's, & a 1/2 to 1 mile (depending on you) walking/ bike path (recently resurfaced). my favorite local park. dogs on leashes o.k. bring bread for the ducks & geese.",jaypluskaren
40,Nice park to relax at,"The lakes of this park serve as a migratory bird stop. It is refreshing having the lakes in the middle of the desert and the trails around the lakes are a good way to get in a little exercise. You can also hear the cars on the musical road from here so combine these two attractions on the same trip. This is not recommended as a destination for a major outing, but is very worthwhile if you are in the area.",Steve R
40,Pokemon hunting ground!,"I took my son on a Sunday morning because he heard there were alot of Pokemon there to find. There were alot of families out walking, riding bikes, and picnicking. We walked the path around the lake. The lake itself appeared clean as was the lakeside. The actual park was free of trash except for the bird droppings which were to be expected. Unfortunately, despite the many signs throughout the park there is alot of dog feces because people don't pick up after there dogs. This was frustrating because so many children were running g around. As for the Pokemon, my son found quite a few including Pikachu!",lisa c
50,Great park,I have always love apollo they have fishing plus the playgrounds my daughter loves and its just so peacefull and nice to be there best part of the av,denisechristine91
40,Family fun,"Great for family outing. Lots of fishing spots. Children can feed the ducks and play on the many play area things. Skate, ride bikes. Or just walk around the lake. Something for all ages. Just be sure to check the wind. It can get very windy at times. And hot to.So be careful picking your day.",Lora C
50,Have always loved this park!,"Apollo park has always been great! Tons or room to spread out. Great picnic site, bike and walk/run path, and play areas for the kids! There are two decent size pond/lakes to fish and feed the ducks. You cannot go into the water to play at all. It's not really clean water but it's still nice to hang around and look at the water life.",952candicel
50,Nice park to visit,This is a nice park to go visit. Often you can even feed the ducks and geese. I think you can even still fish in the lake. not sure what type of fish are in there but i am pretty sure there are still fish. Lots of trees and shaded picnic areas too.,brandon F
30,Semi Hard to find due to there being only one entry way,"This is a decent park with a nice man made lake stocked with fish. There are ducks, geese and turtles that live here which is cool for everyone to enjoy. NEGATIVES: this is a large park with many shady blocked off areas where sketchy people hang out. The two times I've been here I've seen sketchy junkies doing laps around the lake. Bottom line : don't come here by yourself and wander off deep into the park. Lots of play areas for kids. I recommend going with a group for security",My Info B
50,A little rain and upkeep made a world of difference! BEAUTIFUL!,"Months ago, I took my dog for a walk only to find that the trees were dry, grass almost non-existent and trash in and around the water. This is an amazing park with so much potential. Recently I went back after the rain and WOW! What a few drops of water can do to such an amazing place! People were fishing again, grass was growing and the trees were blooming as they should be in spring. The birds looked healthy and the water much cleaner than before with only a few plastic bags tossed from the wind which we were able to retrieve and dispose of. The picnic areas were cleaned up and though it is closed today, it is only for a maintenance project preparing for Mother's Day and a fishing competition. If you have not experienced this park, it's a must. Thank you to who ever is responsible for reading our posts and going the extra mile to bring this amazing place back to life. Thank you to whoever took those amazing photos. The photos shown are only a small glimpse of what beautiful birds call this park home. See you there.",RLDrPH

50,KB,"Great park. One mile walking path around the outside of 3 lakes. The path was repaved and is smooth used by bikers, joggers and roller skaters. Fishing allowed in the lakes with valid fishing license. Lake is stalked with trout. Huge shade trees. A couple of fishing derbies are hosted at the park. Three or four large play areas scattered throughout the park. Several species of ducks and geese if you bring some older bread or popcorn they will glock around you for the treat.",Kyle B

40,oasis,Apollo park is a nice day outing. you can picnic there are grills for cook-outs (you have to bring your own charcoal) The ducks and geese always like bread. You can even fish if that's your thing. The play areas are nice for the kids. a lake man made or not is always welcome in the desert. No swimming but the breeze off the water is nice.,Gretchen S
30,A Hidden Gem,"Due to the severe drought, this park has suffered from dying grass, decaying trees and wild life illness. Trash in the waters have created a stench that should be maintained to protect the beautiful birds that call this park home. This has the potential to be a hidden gem, and a memorable experience for locals and tourists alike. The walking trails provide a memorable experience for those of us who try to stay fit. Restrooms can use better maintainence but for the most part, it's still a nice place to spend an hour or so if the Park and Rec would clean it up.",RLDrPH
50,Apollo Park is a large L.A. County Park with lots of parking and play ares for children.,"Appolo Park has a paved one mile plus path wrapping around a waterway.

40,"Nice, peaceful park","Nice place for quiet and peace. It's out in the middle of nowhere but there are plenty of spaces to BBQ and they have many playgrounds. There is a nice jogging/walking path. The park is big but not many people come here. The only negative thing about this park is that there are a lot of ducks and geese droppings. Overall, if you're looking to relief stress or go for a little walk, this park will suit your needs.",Ting Y
50,OOTW,I have been a visitor to this park since it was first built. Many years ago they had great fishing derby's that I attended with my dad! Lots of fun and great memories. The one thing missing from the park is the Space capsule located at the entrance. I believe it went to a museum !,Joni S
50,Perfect for Photographer's,"I am a digital certified photographer, often times it is hard to find a location that would look great to photograph families and couples. With a man made lake, and trees throughout the park, Apollo is my destination of choice. I have captured many great images at this park, perfect for families and gatherings, and they have grills to barbecue and have a good time. If you are a photographer and looking for the right park to photograph families, this will be the park of choice.",Max A
30,The Apollo is Gone!,The park is okay unless it is windy. It is fun to feed the ducks and relax. BUT the Apollo is no there any more!,Khattykathy
40,Don't forget to bring bread for the ducks!,"This is a nice lake and park. There are lots of ducks and geese around the lake. There's no swimming or boating allowed because it is actually recycled sewage water, but people still fish here. The lake is even stocked with fish. The grounds are clean but can get very crowded. The premises is also heavily patrolled. Still a fun place to visit once in awhile. There is also a musical road on the way to Apollo Park. If traveling west-bound on Avenue G, just be sure to stay in the left lane!",GuiltlessTraveler

50,Awesome Park for Families.,"I've been coming here for over 40 years as a child and adult. There used to be paddle boats, canoes and row bows you could rent in the 70's and early 80's. On of the Apollo Space capsules used to be on display and no longer is. The lakes are full of fish, ducks and an occasional swans. Lots of trees, picnicking areas, bbqs for groups large and small. You'll find bicyle riding families, skateboarding teens, fast and slow walkers, joggers and those enjoying a romantic stroll. Bring your bread for an enjoyable ducks & geese feeding frenzy for your little ones. The park is located in a windy area of Lancaster which is windy 365 days a year.

Truly is an amazing place to hang out with your family especially if you have kids. The ducks chase after you if you have bread sometimes but they don't bite. The park is so much FUN!

There are three lakes, lots of ducks and geese, great play structures, places to picnic, bbq, and a walking path. The lakes are for fishing, fishing licenses required if over 15 of course; fishing derby's in Spring and Fall. The walking path is mostly level. Unique and creative play structures spaced throughout. A nice place.",alisaj_12
