30,Trendy. Cool.,"Fairfax is a trendy cool part of LA. Lots of interesting shops and places to stop by. Its all fairly spaced out in terms of its geography and not in reference to cannabis consumption which is legal.Many opportunities for eating, shopping and browsing. a cool place to visit.",MrBill

50,vintage market,sunday morning vintage market was the coolest thing ever - seeing pieces that you have never seen before from as far back as the 50s - retro streetware alive and thriving in LA,Zachary R

40,"Busy area, visit Beverley Grove...","About a mile south of Melrose Avenue is Beverley Grove, a large shopping complex with a farmers market open on Thursdays.Well worth a visit, eat drink and be merry!",JohnTripAdviser
40,A little too hipster these days,"you can still enjoy walking the neighborhood as there are still a few Mom and Pop places, and there's always Canter's, but the new hipster places have really taken over. Not that these places are bad, there's a lot of really good food options, it's just that it's a very different vibe from the old neighborhood.",JohnRyan724
50,World Renowned Canters Deli & Edgy Grand LA Culture,"The Fairfax district has morphed over 75 years, but it is completely hip, and historical. Very current restaurants, old historical Deli, and Kosher bakeries. Art and trend setting clothing. A must see LA place indeed.",TonyFi18
30,Nothing special for a visitor,"Stayed close to here for a couple of nights but found little to appeal. Yes, shops and restaurants but no better than anywhere else.",RonWamberal
30,Can get crowded,The Fairfax District is a good mix of hip and trendy restaurants and shops. It can get very crowded on the weekends and rush hour.,itsthetravelguy
30,Stay off this Street,"During traffic times, this street turns from one lane to 2 lanes to 1 lane again, other than that don't go here during rush hour, which in LA is 24/7. You have little Ethiopia which has a row of good Ethiopian restaurants. I suggest eating here when you have a chance, just choose the one with an ""A"" in the front window",sethmichaels2017
30,Great for Ethiopian Food,"Fairfax is a very mixed location. North of San Vicente is ""Little Ethiopia,"" which has an array of fine, inexpensive, Ethiopian restaurants, including vegetarian and vegan. The food is spicey and delicious, although clearly not to everyone's taste. Then comes the 3rd Street Farmer's Market (an array of shops, restaurants, etc -- informal and tasty places), Whole Foods, etc. -- and then North of Beverly (the equivalent of ""lst street) it turns into a mix of old Jewish places (kosher bakeries, the famous 24-hour Canter's Deli) -- since this was once the heart of the Jewish community -- and much more hip (and expensive) restaurants. It's a ""scene"" -- very, very, L.A.",Miriyam
