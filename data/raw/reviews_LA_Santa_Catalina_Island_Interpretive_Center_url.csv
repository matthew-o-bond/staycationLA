40,"Friendly, Helpful Staff, Good Information","This is a fairly small center, but they have a lot of information on how the island was formed, wildlife issues and clean bathrooms. We enjoyed visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohtobeinsandiego
40,An informative stop,We stopped here on our walk up to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens. A nice spot to sit for a quick rest and learn about the preservation and restoration efforts on the island. Friendly staff.Informative - I recommend stopping in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brando62
50,I always stop in here when walking to the Hermit Gulch Trail,"I always stop in here while walking on this road. There is info on the indigenous people who used to live on Catalina, endemic animals, geology, etc. I find I learn something new each time I am in here. The man at the front desk gave me a lot of info on the soap stone quarries, and artifacts found here on the island. I recommend stopping in here- it's free, well done exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keywestelaine
50,Learn what makes this island so precious,Very knowledgeable of Catalina's history and the flora and fauna of the island. Definitely becoming a member to help with the conservation of this precious island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205dougm
50,Catalina Island,Our first stop from Carnival Inspiration cruise was Santa Catalina Island. The island was small and you can go around the island by renting a golf cart. Beautiful views when you get to the very top. You can also stop by at the Botanical Garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OneSource921
40,great history.,Catalina Island is highly diverse. We learned many cool things there that we observed later in the day while driving around. The woman at the desk was very knowledgeable; I don't remember her name. The displays were well set up and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131bills
50,Girls trip to Avalon,"Very interesting! I did not get the name of the woman there when we visited the morning of November 1, 2014 but she was knowledgeable, kind and helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenf977
50,Get There,"A lot of information, videos and freindly staff. Learn about the island and you will appreciate it more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmL6623DW
40,Good Insights to Island's Flora & Fauna,"A pleasant stop to learn a little about challenges to the island's plant and animals. Although you have to stop one of the busy volunteers to ask about the Native Americans who clearly used to inhabit the island but who are not mentioned in the materials. Still, a good side trip on the way to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonomaValleyWoman
40,I enjoyed this Interpretive Center - great views & Info,"I really enjoy visiting Interpretive Centers like this one and the location is great. You can reach it by hiking or by tour, which is how I did it the last couple of times I have been there. The views are great if the weather is cooperative, the information in the center is very interesting and I consider it worth the time to visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaA819
50,Hiking in Catalina Island,"From the Wrigley Memorial we hiked the Garden to the Sky trail as recommended in the interpretive Center. A little steep on the way up, but the views were spectacular. At the top one can see the ocean on both sides of the island. The trail continues for another 6 miles to Avalon. It is 2.8 miles round trip from the interpretive Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betita60
30,Pretty much what you'd expect.,"This is cool if you just ""happen"" by it but wouldn't thrill a cub scout by way of a field trip. On the other hand I enjoyed the presentation and learned a few things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
50,Great stop,free little joint that shows some of the geological history of the place. Well worth the stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateH128
20,limited,"really sorry to see the island so regulated that you have to pay for everything... even hiking.Yes, the hike is free but you go thru the fee area to get to the summit. The nature center plants were fairly redundant and most were not labeled.We would have rented a bike for under $10 but you have to have a permit that costs $35.. oH.. it is good for a year.. well, yoo hooo... we live in Oregon.. not across the bay,We were even stopped from walking around the outer roadway.. a paved legal road.I loved .. repeat LOVED .. Catalina about 10 years ago... this time I was showing my hubby how great it was, and we couldnt enjoy most of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl503
40,Interpretive Center is Neat but Small,"My Family and I stopped at the interpretive center in our rented gasoline golf cart and spent a few minutes viewing the exhibits. The Center is dedicated to the preservation of Natural Santa Catalina and the exhibits are both interesting and eye catching. My only complaint, there was not enough time (due to our rental contract) to spend more time there and that is certainly not the fault of the Center.I would recommend a walk up from downtown Avalon and a 30 to 45 minutes to drink in all the exhibits and the film (which we did not have time to watch). The building is rather small but they have packed it full of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeawChan
