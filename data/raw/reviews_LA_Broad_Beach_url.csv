40,"Nice sand, beautiful homes",Incredible homes on this stretch of beach. The sand is softer than Carbon Beach. At high tide you cannot walk on the beach though. Parking is very limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live-n-theMoment7
50,All summer and winter it’s the bomb,"This is my local beach. NO lifeguards, hard to find the gates but if you find them you have a wonderful beach that is normally fairly light in foot traffic. It’s a “dog friendly beach” in that no patrol come by so a lot of locals bring there dog. Erosion and housing of course has ruined a once dynamic shoreline but it is a still a small oasis between Zumba and El Matador state beach ( which are both pretty awesome for their own reasons).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ntsp8
50,"""I want to love there again!""","12 years ago my wife and i rented a fabulous house on Broad Beach with our two young kids. It was one of our favourite times ever and we have just returned there with two rather larger kids now and their younger sister. It's a gorgeous secluded beach with Lion rock in the middle ( our kids named it) and although the public do have access to it, it's mainly the owners of the wonderful houses above that use it. Lucky people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theFulhamFoxes
50,Billionairs Row,"What more is there to say? If you are able to get onto this ""beach"" you probably will experience what the top 1% have. Just don't venture too close to their fabulous homes! Spectacular (for them). Envy for us?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbw933
50,Great beach for paddle ball! Very loud waves! Great for a picnic!,We found this cool beach after stopping by the Vintage Grocers to get some good organic food lunch. Located in a quiet neighborhood and easy to find beach access this is a cool place for couples or families! If you have your pet with you at the beach be aware of people running or walking with theirs untethered. Many people get in the water no matter what the temperature is. It must be that cool refreshing feeling of the salt water and positive ions all around you! This beach is also great for skim boarding and walking. The sand isn’t loose it is tightly packed and perfect for biking too! Another great beach in Malibu that is always a pleasure any day of the week!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
40,Love this beach but it's getting too very crowded,"Nice beach but I have to say, people pick up your garbage! It's getting very very busy. Lot's garbage left behind. It's a shame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel
20,I would go to Zuma first,"the beach is nice, but the winter has been tough on it, I would advise going to zuma beach first, the sand is better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
50,Great Beach!,"As a local, I love to visit this beach. The views are amazing and I can look at the beautiful homes too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayegarrow
40,Perfect for sunbathing and a swim,"Broad Beach in Malibu has lots of place and good parking available. The beach offers a wide stretch of sand, with good swimming conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochassot
10,"erosion has killed the beach, private properties","Unfortunately accessible only at low tide.properties owners put rock to limit beach erosion, and access to the edge of their properties.few are interesting in terme or architectural approach, but as most in Malibu, most are just we properties.Very expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etretatc
40,Rocky shoreline,"Great beach experience a bit rocky but lots of fun, this was uncrowded and easy to experience try it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
50,Nothing like it!,"This place is not for you unless you a fan of any of the following.....majestic ocean views, multi million dollar real estate, unique home designs, assorted wildlife and marine life, soft brown sand, never ending waves. Park right on Broad beach Rd and take a walk up and down this beautiful stretch of coast line. No shade available so be prepared for direct sunlight. Photography opportunities are plenty. Worth a visit 100%.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hakimom
30,"Not so broad anymore, difficult access","Broad beach starts at Trances and goes north 1.5 miles or so to Lechuza point.Not sure why it's name is bird as it's always been narrow (even before the massive erosion)There is very limited access: Trancas at the south and also 31344 Broad beach road.Low tides it is a nice beach to walk on with terrific views of the ocean on one side and very expensive houses on the landslide.The community has been losing/erosion sand and beach width along with the dunes for years. Sand is gone at higher tides and homes are now protected by riprap and rock piles. They are trying to replace the sand costing them anywhere from 20 to 30 million dollars.Average beach, limited access and parking---gets an average review",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Always nice to see and hear the ocean!,"It is a regular haunt when in Malibu and the reasons are more sentimental than touristy. Quiet part of the beach, just beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeawoosKsinKS
40,"A good beach, not so easy access",There is better access points now but you have to know where to go to get the the beach. No crowds and an upscale area. Bring everything you need because there are no places to get anything on this beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
20,"Unfortunately, the beach is gone",The once aptly named Broad Beach is now so depleted of sand that neighboring homeowners have created a special assessment district to replenish the beach. Don't bother visiting until after it's done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
40,A nice uncrowded road for house browsing.,The accessways put you on a beautiful beach with good swimming and a sandy bottom if you can ignore all the massive boulders that run parallel to the surf line for the entire length of the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,Just past Zuma and very quiet,This is a wonderful and much quieter alternative to the busy Zuma beach. Just be careful of the tide coming in in the late afternoon...there won't be any beach left!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubagirl302
20,Narrow beach with little access,"As a local living nearby, although Broad Beach would be a great place to live, it is not a good beach to visit. There are too many other great beaches with easy access in Malibu to waste time going here. There are 3-4 public access entrances along Broad Beach Rd., but the beach itself is very narrow and not very inviting unless you go at very low tide. There are great beaches north (El Matador, Piedra, Leo Carillo) and south (Zuma, Westward) and these beaches are within 3-4 miles of Broad Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
30,Don't waste your time here,"They purposely make it difficult to acquire access to this very small beach. There are too many better beaches with less hassle. We drove through the Broad Beach Drive and felt like it was a closed neighborhood...so they pay the taxes let them enjoy it. Very limited parking, keep going to more friendly areas....reminded me of Massachusetts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998

20,why bother unless you are going to a house,"the beach is public, but the access quite difficult unless you can enter thru somebody's house. furher, the beach just isn't that good here. Avoid!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
40,more of Malibu's magic,"if you can find portals and parking, (left off PCH at Trancas) and the passage ways to the beach, great for a stroll, and depending on the weather, a swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey802948
30,"Good for shore diving, but not much else","We used to take our dive students there for shore diving. It has an easy entry and some nice reefs about 200-300 yards out. You have to come early to get a parking spot (on road) near the access paths and then carry all the equipment down to the beach. The path itself is almost level. The visibility under water can range from nil to about 40 ft on a good day. Since it is somewhat sheltered there is typically not much of a swell or current. That would make it appealing to families with little children as well. There are no bathrooms or changing facilities available, but a Starbucks is not far off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalSll
20,This beach is not broad. There are too many people on the beach .,I remember when this beach was much wider. Now it is really narrow and there's not much place to put down your towel. Now there are lots and lots of people too and not a single bathroom or water. The parking is free but you have to walk a lot longer way to get to the entrance. I don't like it any more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore24826
