50,“Just the best thing to do on a warm sunny day - coast walk”,"If you are in the city and surrounds and want a perfect walking day out here is what I recommend. Start at either Clovelly (take the 339 from the city) or Coogee (372) and walk to Bondi or Maroubra (different directions) or anywhere along the coastal route. Personally I prefer the Coogee to Bondi route as it's a good 90 minutes and there's a lot to enjoy. At Coogee you could get a lovely breakfast at any of the local cafes but if the Coogee Palace is open, go there. Wonderful! follow the walkers over the cliffs and down to Clovelly, cross Clovelly beach. Clovelly is a good spot to have a safe swim in the rock pool or the little cove there as it doesn't get affected by rips and is safe. It's a little inlet. Then walk across the cliffs up to the Waverly cemetery and cut through there and then through the cliffs down to Bronte. Cafes again. Rockpools and on the weekend a train for children. There are good bbq areas here (as with Clovelly). Then follow the cliff walk around to Bondi - you might be able to get into the Bondi Icebergs club if you are an international visitor for a drink one of the best views on the planet. Check out Bondi for lunch, I recommend the RSL club, or any on the northern side (not so much the south side) and if you have pre-booked Sean's Panorama, a great place for a lunch or dinner (check times they are open). Take water, beware of runners, make sure you are covered in sunscreen (even on a cloudy day). Even on the most humid of days in Sydney, this is a cooling and relaxing thing to do. And apart from the bus fare and food, it' free fit's f"
50,“One of Sydney's treasures”,"Walked Waverton to Woolstonecraft -great variety, fantastic views, interesting industrial sites, gorgeous gum trees, boardwalks and aboriginal art. Mostly in shade. Also zoo to Balmoral beach- great views of city and opera house and out to heads and Manly. Apparently there's a plan afoot to link all harbour walks."
50,“Indian Pacific - fantastic!”,"Every aspect of the journey from Sydney to Perth was fantastic. Very well organised, everything works to a plan and schedule, and the information given out during the journey makes it feel like a huge family is doing the holiday discovery together. You can meet new people every hour by sitting in the lounge car or you can enjoy the quiet, passing scenery and informative 'programs' run on Indian Pacific Radio in your very comfortable cabin. Bathroom and toilet are very well designed, beds are very comfortable as is the lovely long seat where you can move around. Just magnificent comfort. I was told it was good but it exceeded my expectations. Whistle stop tours are excellent also, and very informative.Meals are top class and actually too much for a small eater like myself, but just right for my husband. It was the 'trip of a lifetime' but I will be doing it again, and would like to do the Ghan as well [they say it is even better! the mind boggles]. This is train travel in luxury, comfort and with everything taken care of for you for an entire 3 days and nights. You just have to choose which tour to do and which meals to eat. I didn't want to get off when we got to Perth. Hubby loved it too. Thanks Great Southern Rail!"
50,“Hunters Hill to Woolwich walk 3.6km”,"What a way to spend a half day :-)From Circular Quay Stand C catch the 506 bus. After approx. 30 minutes alight at Gladesville Road Hunters Hill. Walk back across the main road and then just wander along the central road (well signed) through a most historic and well maintained suburb of Sydney.The homes are just picture perfect, some with historic plaques explaining in detail.The actual village of Woolwich has many places for refreshments and you can dream as you browse in the real estate windows.There are many vantage points along the way to enjoy a variety of harbor views.Catching a Circular Quay from the Woolwich wharf ours stopped off at Cockatoo Island. We hoped off as a last minute decision and spent another amazing few hours.... buts that's another review for another time."

50,“Travelling in Sydney”,"I have recently returned from Sydney and on previous trips found the cost of getting from the Airport into the city to be quite expensive. This time however, I managed the trip for $5.50.On walking out of the terminal, walk under the carpark opposite and access the Bus Stop for the 400 Bondi bus service. One stop on the bus brings you to within a short walk of the Mascot Railway Station and the trip from Mascot into the city is at normal prices. The return trip is exactly the same in reverse, picking up the 400 Burwood bus on the opposite side of the road to where it stopped on the way from the airport. This bus runs half-hourly and stops at the Domestic terminal.I had carry-on luggage only and it was no problem to use a normal bus, if large pieces of luggage were involved it could be more difficult to use normal buses.My hotel was near Central Station and in George Street there are stops on both sides for the 555 Free city circle bus which travels to Circular Quay and back every 10 minutes between 9 am and 3.30pm weekdays and until later on Thursdays."
50,“Diverse Sydney culture”,"My husband and I spent 3 weeks in the Liverpool/Sydney areas of Australia. We were lucky enough to stay with a family in their lovely home, and traveled by subway into Sydney on occasion. We were taken to the Blue Mountains, to the ocean, and to Sydney:)Interesting how the air smells like eucalyptus in the country:) In the city, we were warned to keep strictly to our own business - and out of certain cultural areas completely. Our host family, though with a lovely ranch home, has an 8-foot brick wall surrounding their back yard, and a huge watchdog to maintain security. Even while bringing in groceries, they set their security alarm between each armload!!! These extra security measures struck us as extreme until we learned that Australia has outlawed guns (so basically the only people who have them are the criminals!!!) So they are very much on the defensive. Unfortunately.The food we had was FANTASTIC - it seems food is very important to the Aussies:) Just FANTASTIC - everything from fresh seafood to fresh fruits to fresh veggies and strong Italian coffee - the prawns (shrimp) were HUGE!!! No wonder they love to ""put 'em on the barbie!"" We were there in August - which is the peak of their ""winter"" - because everything is backwards in the lower hemisphere. Never got below 50 degrees F - which was just fine with us:)We had a wonderful time in Liverpool/Sydney, and would come for much longer had we the money/choice!!! Australia is basically the size of the entire United States, so plan enough time to see what you really want to see!"
50,“Syney - agreat destination”,"We recently has a long weekend in Sydney - fantastic. We went on a ferry on the harbour, saw a show, took a long walk in an historic suburb, did some shopping and toured the Opera House. It was all great."
50,“Down Under........ Worth the Long Flight!”,"Loved the City of Sydney and outlying areas. Great City, very clean, beautiful harbours and night life. Great restaraunts, including Jordans and Blackbird. Loved the Opera House and The Rocks. Lots of vegetation throughout the city making less of a concrete jungle. Skyskrapers nesteld within a forest and next to tons of beaches! Manly and Bondi are my favorites. Some great places to check out outside of the City are Botany Bay for historical sights and Cronulla/Caringbah very nice place outside the city for suburban coziness. Just a 40 min drive into the city."
30,“Very Expensive City”,"Sydney is a very expensive city to visit. A cheap hotel room in Potts point was $130 Aus, a Diet Coke was $4, transport around the city was expensive, and the exchange rate for the American dollar is terrible. Although the sights in Sydney were impressive, we much preferred Cairns and the things we could do there. If we go back to Australia, we will rent a car and spend most of our time outside the major metro areas."
40,“Attractions”,"We visited Sydney for a mini break. Whilst there we visited Taronga Zoo a short ferry ride from Circular Quay on the South side of the bay. Spent an excellent day walking around most of the animal exhibits, but a must for all is the Elephant display. We were lucky to see all 3 new baby elephants. If you are a pensioner visiting Sydney you can buy a ticket from the ferry services offices located at Circular Quay for a whole day travelling on buses or ferries for $2.50 this is definately a bargain. We also visited Balmain another short trip from the city by ferry. But be warned, Balmain is rather hilly and if you have trouble walking uphill and for distances a bus will transport you to the shops at Balmain, you can use your ferry ticket for this trip. Visit Adriano Zumbo's patisserie near Woolworths on Darling Street for a treat. Or if you stay on the bus visit Rozelle to visit his small cafe, well worth the effort. Don't forget to visit Darling Harbour. The Opera House at Bennelong Point. A teat for all you gastronomes is a visit to the Guylian Belgian Chocolate Cafe at Circular Quay and another at the Rocks. Also a visit to Pancakes on the Rocks at Darling Harbour."
50,“Beautiful Sydney”,We recently spent a wonderful week in Sydney. Definitely recommend the Hop on Hop off bus. $35 fo all day. We rode around once just to get an overview and then again getting on and off at the spots that interested us. Make sure you visit the Hyde Park Barracks Museum for the convict history and take the backstage tour of the Opera House. Featherdale Wildlife Park is great letting you pet the animals and the Blue Mountains are a must. So much to see and everything is relatively inexpensive!

50,"“A memorable trip to Sydney, Australia”","My wife and me ?I visited Sydney between the 27th of February and the 12TH of March this year from our Home base outside Philadelphia in the USA. It was meant to be a trip of a Life time and not to be repeated even though we have Family in Sydney.I must confess we had some pre concieved notions which I am glad to say have been destroyed by our experience. We found the people uniformly friendly and it reminded me of Barcelona in some ways. We will be back and I thought a brief description of our trip may be of help to other travelers.I am 6 feet and 3 inches tall for my sins and Boy I was so glad to choose Premium Coach as opposed to Coach and a happy compromise as regards Business Class.Our USAIRWAYS flight from Philadelphia was rerouted through Minneapolis and we missed the connection from SFO and had to spend a very happy day in the Airport Hilton with all the great views. We did reach Sydney with a 24 hour delay.As regards Hotels I have unqualified praise for the Sir Stamford Hotel near Circular Quay and We would always look to stay there as the first option in our future visits.We were in the happy position of being able to walk to Circular Quay almost every Morning and throughout the day. Our dining experiences were uniformly Great with the exception of the Roaches in a Restaurant in the Rocks. We did find it expensive as compared to the USA and the even exchange rate did not help.My relatives were kind enough to take us to the Blue Mountains for a day where we saw the Three Sisters and the Scenic World with the skyway,Rail etc. I suspect one needs to plan a few days stay here to get a sense of a wonderful place.We were also taken to the Southern Highlands for the day where the Bradman Museum was a great delight besides some nice scenery and waterfalls.Places which were memorable included the Tarongo Zoo and the Sydney Tower besides Darling Harbor which was very pleasant. The Ferry system is a life saver and not to be missed. We missed the Bridge climb as we are not getting younger . Cockatoo Island on the last day was a diversion not to be missed.I could go on and on. The bottomline is we will be back in Sydney and in Australia and sooner rather than later inspite of the 20 year flight in total. I have had to shorten my report to prevent making it a bore.You have to understand that we had memorable experiences every day in Sydney and describing each one would be a big Travel Book which I am not competent to write. The people of Sydney are uniformly a credit to Australia."
40,“Beautiful”,"It a beautiful city, a walk to Opera house and view to sydney bridge is a must, you will defenitly enjoy. If you have time have tour inside Opera house, and if happen to be like operas, enjoy it too. Very close to it are the ferry to mandy, if you love beaches then a great place to be at.In Sydney you can also enjoy outdoor activities like hot air ballon ride, or a Helicopter ride, which i did and the exprience was for lifetime, which changed my view for Sydney. If you are adventureous you can also enjoy the high speed boat ride with its twist and turns or a climb to sydeny bridge.Harbor and beaches are must see, and at the same time do some Pearl and Opal shopping. You can also enjoy some damn cheap shopping at paddy's market."
50,“Few hints when visiting Sydney”,"Sydney Australia is spectacular , especially in Summer. There are many attraction for everyone everywhere. If staying in the city there is bus number 555 riding people for free in inner city from 9.30-15.30.To start with it go to George st. and pick up the green painted bus. You can also buy $ 20 whole day ticket at any train or ferry station.You can ride unlimited rides on inner city trains, buses and ferries. One day we spent all day just traveling on ferries and have seen most of the bay , while normally you would pay $35 just for 2 hours with a Cruise Ship. Make sure to make trip to Watsons Bay for nice seafood platter by the ferry station, walk up to Watsons Bay National Park,easy walk for anyone ,on the way to Lighthouse there is a small public nudist beach one can swim in still crystal clear water.If you like seafood the Sydney Fish Market is a must. There are tables with umbrellas to sit and eat freshly made seafood , you can buy a wine from bottle shop to go with it."
50,“Awesome metropolis!!!”,"When thinking of Sydney, many see images of the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach. And honestly, these three already make Sydney a place worth visiting. I spent 8 weeks here from Feb 2010 on and instantly fell in love with this place. It is laid back and bursting with energy! You can visit a mini art gallery in the morning, go shopping around noon, head for the beaches in the afternoon ease out of the day with an ice cold beer and breathtaking views at the Opera Bar! Go there, man!!!"
50,“Superb Sydney Experienced”,"Samuel Johnston said ""when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; "" I realise it was said in 1780.s, but had the same Mr Johnson the opportunity to experience the vibrant city of modern day Sydney, then this quote would be most appropiate to this wondeful town. This is my second summer here, and I still have not experienced all that the city has to offer. From museums to theatre, to restaurants, to coffee shops, to beachs, to shops, it has everything. Combine all the above ingredients with the australian ""can do"" attitude, the weather and the wine,and the resultant mix is one of deliousness that cannot be surpassed.Sydney is not for a few days visit, you really must spend a couple of weeks here, to soak up the athmosphere, and feel the sense and vibe of this modern metropilise.Put it on the top of your list, of 10 things to do before you die.."
50,“Sydney - a friendly city”,"Spent 4 days in Sydney at the beginning of November. I don't particularly like big cities and prefer not to travel alone in them, but would quite happily spend a week in Sydney on my own.My top tips would be1) to get a ticket that covers, buses, train (in zone 1) and ferries. We paid $41 for a weeks pass but it had paid for itself by day 2,2) Don't bother with Harbout cruises just use your ferry ticket and go to Manly and you get the same experience. The ferry to Darling Harbour and Olympic Park were also fab, in fact if you see 'a cruise' added to Blue Mountain trip - it is the route from Olympic Park to Harbour.3) We were going to pre-book trip to Blue Mountains but thought we might hire a car so didn't. The prices from Harbour kiosks were much cheaper and had good reductions for next couple of days.4) Take time to walk round Botanic Gardens, very pretty, fab views of Opera House and Bridge, lots to look at. (Is very good place to see wide variety of birds - only place we saw galahs).5) The Opera House has a very reasonably priced self-service restaurant - was recommended to us, we looked at it but didn't get time to go."
50,“The best city in the World!”,"Many things have been said about this city both good and bad, but it is without doubt my favourite city, that I have ever visited. I'm not the most widely travelled person but have visited Sydney twice and both times fell head over heels. Immediately I felt comfortable here, especially when in the harbour and it's surrounds.Of course like every city in the world it has it's not so lovely points, the CBD is the most hectic and busy place I've encountered, I found Chinatown manic and chaotic, Kings Cross was a bit scary to walk through at night (not recommended), but these all add to its character and personality.It can be expensive in places and heavily rides on it's fantastic harbour to sell itself but this aside, it's welcoming to all and the diversity and variety of places to visit, eat and drink means there is something for everyone.I recommend - Climbing Sydney Harbour Bridge - there's nothing like it, try and get a late afternoon climb and watch the sunset from the top of the bridge. See an opera or concert - the acoustics in the Concert Hall in the Opera House are amazing and I've never before heard anything like it. Darling Harbour for bars and restaurants, we returned here several times for good reasonably priced food and drink. The Rocks for history, shops and character. Botanical Gardens, relaxing, beautiful and fascinating. Blue Mountains - take a day trip and visit scenic world for the vertical train and cable car.Buy an all day travel card (or weekly one if there long enough) this gets you on all state public transport - buses, trains and ferries. Take the ferry trip to manly, worth it just for the sights from the ferry."
50,“My favorite place to spend a long vacation”,"Date: April 2010.Reviewer: New Jersey, USAVery nice weather, nice beaches, friendly people and lot to see and do. Wonderful variety of Chinese and other food. Lot of clubs and restaurants to try and enjoy. Lamb and seafood are extremely good. Take some time to get use to driving on the opposite side, Staying in hostels is an inexpensive alternatives to hotels and motels."
50,“An Aesthetic Gem”,"Sydney is absolutely breathtaking. You have the Harbour, the Opera House, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and Darling Harbour. Not to mention that you have great vehicles to experience the beauty of Sydney with including budget-focused ferry to Manly to the more expensive bridge climb. Although Sydney does not have as much to do as other large cities, there is definitely much to see. I would say the best things to do Sydney is just walk around and explore."
40,“australia a wonderful place to visit”,"syndney australia , is a great place to visit and hasmuch to offer travelers . we visited lots of places there and loved seeing the natural beauty and the wildlife they had to offer. we went to the blue mountains and rode the worlds steepest rail car and believe me it was steep i was afraid i was going to loose my son out of it . i had a death grip on him. we also visted the jeanolan caves and looked at the formations they had several caves to choose from and the one we went through had over 1000 steps in it and my husband had to carry my one year old son in a baby carrier on his back let me tell you he was worn out when we were done. we went to the taronga zoo. we had to take a ferry over from sydney harbour and you should give your self all day to look at this because their is lots of walking and it takes all day if you want to see everything . you also will several animal parks where you can pet kangaroos and feed them also some of them will let you touch koala bears which was my favorit thing to dol"
50,“the most lovely place to have a date”,"Sydney Opera Bar is hands down the nicest spot in Sydney to have a romantic moment. With the twinkle of the lights of Luna Park across the water, the Harbour Bridge to the left, and the Opera House sparkling in the moonlight above you, you'll be as blown away as we were. My husband and I decided on our vacation to go there for a glass of wine and enjoy the scenery, and it was so romantic! They usually have a live dj or band on the weekends and otherwise there's always great music playing. It's a neat place to people watch and is really accessible by transportation (as Circular Quay is right there and Wynyward Station isn't far either). It's an open air lounge bar and there are spots to sit fringing the Sydney Harbour. I think everyone should get a chance to try it out...just gorgeous!"
50,“Stunning Sydney”,"Just had a great week in Sydney. Found some great new places and some hidden treasures.My kids asked for swings with a view: Cremorne Point, Blues Point, Pyrmont (we walked from the bottom of Anzac Bridge towards the city and found two beauties. Climb any stairs you find for extra fun).We ate by the water:UTS Rowing Club Drummoyne. Great seafood and really reasonable. Go on Saturday for lunch for best specials.Ripples, Sydney Wharf. Great food and service.Best pizza in Sydney (be sure to book)Rosso Pomodoro (BYO)91/24 Buchanan StBalmain NSW 2041(02) 9555 5924Paddington Market, Oxford St Paddington on Saturday 10am-4pm for great clothes, jewellery, art, etcAny beach is fabulous but our favourites are Bilgola, Freshwater and Balmoral.Always remember to go over the Harbour Bridge, not under."
50,“MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN THE WORLD”,"A stunning city combining all the advantages of a huge city and a tiny town at the beach...despite its size, Sydney is totally relaxed - great ambiance, nice and friendly cosmopolitan people...you just feel so at ease!"
50,“More to it then just the Opera house and Harbour bridge!”,"Sydney was the highlight of our 4+ city tour of Australia! We spent 3 days and it was not nearly enough time to check out the basics of what Sydney has to offer. We loved the harbor ferry to Manly, and the trip to Bondi beach. The Fish market and Darling Harbour was a bustling area and the rest of Sydney and the Botanical gardens were awesome!"
50,“NICE & COOL SITY”,This is very cool and nice and attract to traveler
50,“I'm Free walking tour of Sydney”,"When visiting Sydney recently I chose to the ""Im FREE walking tour. It runs or approx 3 hours and takes you all over the city and to places you would have seen had you been on a reguler tour (one you would have proberly paid $30 for). The gurl who runs it is an architech on her 5th year of uni, and she gives you information no only on the sites but also the arcutechture o the buildings. I highly recomend this tour for anyone either new to the city orjust visiting. It does rely on tips but it is entirly up to you what you choose to pay."

We spent an enthralling 3 hours walking through and around some of Sydney's most interesting places. This tour set us up for the remainder of our time in Sydney as we were left with a wonderful sense of where everything was. This tour operates on a 'tips only' basis but be prepared to tip generously as Justine is well worth it!Peter"
50,“Sydney in 10 days!”,"I never thought it would be worth going from the UK to Sydney for just 10 days. However, I had a fab time and it is totally 'do-able'!Would recommend that you go with Emirates (with only ONE stop over in Dubai). Emirates have a great network of flights that means you don't have to wait long in Dubai. They also have a fantastic entertainment system that means the very long flight can be filled with 100's of on demand movies, TV programmes, games, etc.Once there, here's what I did:Day 1. Drive to Palm Beach (aka Summer Bay in Home & Away), then back to Sydney for dinner (seeing harbour sights at night).Day 2. Trip to Hunter Valley for wine tasting (dinner & overnight stay).Day 3. Beautiful sightseeing drive back to Sydney for dinner.Day 4. Local sights. Shopping on Pitt and George street. Picnic in Botanic Gardens. Views from Observatory Hill. Local dinner.Day 5. Taronga Zoo in morning. Manly in afternoon (beautiful walks and cafes).Day 6. Blue Mountains (there and back on train in one day).Day 7. Eastern beaches and coastal walk (Bondai to Coogee).Day 8. Watson's Bay and South Head walk (and whale watching).Day 9. Walk around Mort Bay and Ballast Point (at Birchgrove and Balmain). Head to airport to go home!!!FANTASTIC - Sydney is so easy to get around. The ferries are particularly good."
50,“Blue Mountain Walkabout”,"I was in Sydney last Nov.Took a train to the Blue mountains for a guided walkabout with an Aboriginal guide Evan Yanna Muru.This was seven hour hike in the mountains that included Aboriginal lore,samplings of bush tuck and cave paintings and petrglphs.It was one of the best days of our two week vacation.Evan was knowledgeable and fun.I highly recommend this tour."
50,“We loved everything about Sydney”,"We have just returned from a week in Australia. Sydney is a magnificent city. We loved everything about Sydney, from it's tax system, health system to it's polotics, healthy low cost fresh food in abundance, sun sand & sea. The public transport is mainly by Ferry but it also has buses trains & mono rails. The weather & the architecture of both the traditional colonial style homes & the city itself is so refreshingly different from USA. We found the people both friendly & tolerant of tourists. It seems like Paradise compared to life in the USA. It's obvious why life expectancy is so much higher & people & both happier & healthier.We bought our airline tickets so cheap at www.cheapeasyflights.com and we have never experienced such incredible service before. We paid $778 per person which we thought excellent value. Overall I would say this is probably the best trip we have ever had in on holiday and I am extremely fussy! Our kids are 13 and 15 and they enjoyed it."

50,“Sydney City Tour”,"With Suanne from Real Sydney Tours I spent a great day in the Sydney area. After an excellently guided tour through all the city and along the wonderful beaches in a very comfortable and clean car, she provided a picnic with a view, containing delicious snacks and cool drinks, topped by an excellent sparkling wine. The atmosphere was completed by the lovely decoration with tablecloth and napkins. It was an outstanding picnic in a very scenic environment.I can absolutely recommend doing a tour provided by Real Sydney Tours!"
50,"“Harbour, harbour, harbour”","Stayed at Quay Grand Apartments at Circular Quay in Sydney. Fantastic three days. Crap weather but staying at Quay Grand I was able to change, warm up and relax between trips to Opera House (2 minutes away), the Rocks ( five minutes away) and my very favourite pasttime, ridiing the ferries, just 1 minute away. Also, walked along the foreshore of Botanic Gardens even in the rain daily. Favourite restaurant Fratelli Paradiso at Potts Point. Walked there for breakfast each morning."
10,“STAY AWAY FROM CLUBBACKPACKER.AU.COM”,"Booking a trip with CLUBBACKPACKER.AU.COM is not a good idea. It is a very mismanaged company. Once I paid in full, I never received an itinerary, and hence missed the bus in Sydney. I also missed the day of snorkeling In which I paid for. The tour itself was ok, but the company refused to issue me a credit for the snorkeling that they DID NOT provide me. CLUBBACKPACKER.AU.COM does NOT return your phone calls and all and all aren't worth the hassle. There are many more viable tour groups out there. BEWARE of CLUBBACKPACKER.AU.COM"
50,“fabulous cottage in the Hunter Valley”,My mother and I had been enjoying a wirlwind trip around Sydney trying to see all the sights but how were we to know that just two hours away by car was this heaveenly place Mountview Cottagesin the Hunter Valley.The welcome we received from Delia and Brian were as if we were old friends.A sumptuous and generousbreakfast pack was left in our beautifully equipped cottage which nestled in the trees.While enjoying the open spa Mum and I just lay back in the bubbles listening to the bird life and watched by inquisitive Walleroo. We thought we had died and been transported to heaven.
40,“Food lover's Sydney Adventure”,"I went to Sydney a few weeks ago for ten days, and overall found it to be a great experience. My focus is food and cooking, so I spent my time seeking out the best the city had to offer. Australia produces pretty much everything a cook would want- grass fed meat, gorgeous dairy products, fresh organic fruit and veg. Even a quick meal in a little cafe is guaranteed to be above average as the ingredients are so good.I explored the cooking stores, and found a varied mix. Victoria's Basement had great merchandise, but it was displayed like a warehouse- dusty, messy, over-crowded- not a nice shopping experience. Kitchen Capers in Crows Nest was slightly better though it had a bit of a seedy feel to it and seemed confused as to whether it was marketing to the home cook or the industrial chef. I went to Essential Ingrediant in Melbourne, and was favorably impressed. Nice combination of quality cookware and ingrediants. Am guessing the one in Sydney is similar.Best restaurant I ate in was Rockpool. I walked in without a reservation and with a bunch of shopping bags. As a female diner alone, I was fully prepared for disdainful treatment, and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. Staff was gracious and welcoming, and the food sublime. Wine stewart took time to help me pick wines that complemented each course, and he over brought over all the cookbooks written by chef Neil Perry.By contrast, I was turned away at the door by the staff at Quay on a Monday night. They claimed they were ""fully booked"" and was I aware that they had a set priced menu? Read between the lines ""you don't look like you can afford to eat here."" Very arrogant. Instead, went downstairs to seafood restaurant Oceanroom where I was warmly welcomed and seated at a fabulous table with a view of the opera house. Service was spotty, but more than made up for by the lovely Japanese-inspired seafood.Main complaint about Sydney is lack of visitor friendly public transport system. Subway system was old, expensive and underdeveloped. Buses are frequent and everywhere, but difficult to figure out. Ended up renting a car and enjoyed the freedom it gave me to stop where I wanted. Drivers were overall patient and courteous, which is more than one can say of many other cities around the world. Tolls were extremely expensive though, so if you rent a card, plan your journey carefully. Signage was also not great, and my GPS unit led me astray more than once.Manly ferry was a nice trip one evening when I was too tired to walk anymore. Being on the water and seeing all those mansions as the sun was setting was a lovely experience. Manly itself was a bit of a letdown, though I didn't really know where to go when I got there. Ended up walking a bit then having a glass of wine at a restaurant on the pier.Overall, really enjoyed my Sydney adventure and look forward to going back again in September."
50,“Beautiful city”,"Sydney is a charming city with a beautiful locatiion by the harbour!The harbour bridge and Opera house are the 2 most remarkable and memorable icons of Sydney!Walking on the bridge gives a stunning view of skyline of sydney and view of Opera House.The sydney opera house is a stunning piece of architecture and well worth doing the tour which is cheaper booked online!Well worth booking a concert or show to view the interior and acoustics are superb.We did a free walking 2 hrs tour of city center(www.imfree.com.au) which was a very good starting point to get your bearings.Our guide Ross was very good and informative about history of city.We did tip him well as we felt if we had gone another prepaid guided tour,we won't have covered as much!Definitely worth doing this!Lots of lovely eating places especially around Darling harbour and the rocks.Sailor thai in the Rocks area was lovely for lunch! Best Som Tum salad I have eaten outside of thailand and very nice Pad Thai.Mother Chu's was one of the best vegetarian Chinese restaurants we have been to and very big portions!For a special dinner,Zaffran on harbour side in Darling Harbour was lovely with stunning views of sydney skyline lit up at night!Sydney is a very easy city to walk around in and travelling by trains and buses couldn't be easier!Must do a daytrip on the ferry to Manly or any other locations as its fun!Would love to go back and spend more time especially on some of the more remote beaches!"
50,“best place in the world”,"we stayed in circular quay at the intercontinental. We had a harbour view room that was fab.The city has so many sights and things to do.The weather was great and most things are centered around the water.We did the bridgeclimb and taronga zoo.We visited the beaches of Bondi , manly and palm beach(home and away location).Each beach is individual but great.The whole sydney area was special with a good vibe.We felt very safe at all times , with the locals very friendly.We ate on the run most days and dined at the outdoor opera bar at night. What a fab place that was.cant wait to return."
50,“Sydney is a great city.”,The city is very walkable. Bus 555 is free (intercity). The Opera House is in a class no one can match. The food is great. The people are friendly. I enjoyed my visit very much.
50,“Trendy city”,"Beautiful, trendy city for young fit stylish people, great atmosphere, and lots to see and do!"

20,“Sydney cooking”,HelloI thought any travellers from overseas would want a good review of my city and if youre new to visiting in Pacific.There has been much talk about Australias demise in tourism but with economic recession there is plenty see do all over country.If you have visited Opera House Harbour Harbour Bridgegone to Manly on northern beaches by ferry or just visited theanimals at Koala Park(west Pennant Hills) or Taronga Park(Mosman) Sydneys people are vibrant.I have lived in city 50 years and while it is much busier and car travelling is good to avoid peak hour the resturants of cityDarling Harbour Cruises on Harbour Rapids sailing on Coloriver in north west Sydney or just quiet day at Penrith Leagues Club at foot of Blue Mountains will give you few days to enjoy the city before you take holiday and rest in other beauties around country.Dont desitate contact me to ask anything of Sydney or rest Australia I have travelled and lived in many places in Australia and can give you good reports on many places!
50,“My Sydney experience 2010 by Alphonsus.”,"I have been very fortunate to have visited Australia three times now over the last nine years, and I am never dissapointed by the sheer enthusiasm and energy of the people. I was fortunate to be able to visit Sydney, what a city, it is so alive and vibrant, sure it has it's unsavoury areas, but so does every major city. With areas like darling harbour, where you have plenty of good places to eat and have a coffee. Take a ferry from circular key to Manly, which itself is a lovely and energetic place, the views opf the opera house and the massive Sydney bridge which stretches majestically across the harbour, the botanical gardens, and if you are fortunate the glorious weather. For me Sydney has everything, good hotels, shops, bars, markets and last but not least people. The Australians are without doubt a mixture of people who just want to get on with life, sure you will have a few who will attempt to abuse the system, but in general they are a great bunch of people and sydney , well go and see the place."
50,“Stunning city”,"What a fabulous city! Bright, shiny, clean, happy and upbeat. The food is wonderful and not expensive compared to the UK. People are welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. There is no obvious racial tension which is surprising considering the huge number of different races living here. One will never feel nervous or threatened walking alone day or night. Only one downside - the exchange rate against the GBP is very poor now which means our money does not go as far as it used to, but there is still good value to be found."
50,“Beware of Travelex's very own foreign currency exchange rate.”,"Sydney is a jewel of a city. As always I recommend something like an on-off transport (tram, monorail, trolley, bus). In Sydney it was the monorail. Buy an all day ticket. It is fine. Get off at the Victoria building. It is glorious.Then for not much more money, take the Sydney Harbor Ferry that narrates all the wonderful places you can go via the Ferry in Sydney Harbor and you get a fantastic view of the Sydney Opera House from the water.Do not stop there. Take the tour of the Sydney Opera House. It take a little more than an hour, but the history of its construction is worth the money and trouble. Whereever you go in Australia or New Zealand, if you a a senior, let them know. Most times it will get you a discount even if you are not an Australian or Kiwi.Some hotels use Travelex as their credit card manager. On checking out of the hotel, we were told the current foreign exchange rate that day was 0.99877 or some such. They did or didn't bother asking if you wanted to pay in AUD or USD. The answer should always be, in AUD. Be sure to look at the receipt before you sign. We were in a hurry and I thought it was quite a jump in AUD value from when we left home.I went on my laptop that evening at our next destination. The exchange rate that day was 0.9152 or some such. What Travelex does is charge an exchange rate that gives them about eight percentage points of your bill, and they call it the 'foreign currency exchange rate'. The hotel probably gets a cut. Of course this about negates any benefit you may have had from a desirable exchange rate.So the lesson is be sure your agreement is to pay in AUD, and make sure the rate which should show on your receipt hasn't been puffed up. This happened at a hotel in Brisbane as well."
50,“Aussie time”,"Good to go to the beach/surfGood to live and studiesGood culture attractionsGood, good, good!Just loved have lived there!"
50,“An experience for all”,"I love Sydney. It has things to do for everyone. It has amazing sites you won't see anywhere else. Take the Sydney Harbour Bridge for example. It is great to see and also climb. The age you have to be is only 10 yearsold so is great for thrill seekers. very close to there is another amazing attraction. The Sydney Opera House. You might go in and see a show or maybe just admire it from the outside, whatever you do its still amazing. The city is a great place for shoppers while familys with young kids may enjoy the rocks. The rocks is a suburb containing shops and the famous Rocks market. Its sure to be a hit with everyone. Cafe Sydney Is a wonderful dining experience as you look out over the harbour and enjoy a 5 star cuisine. The ferrys run very regulary around Sydney. For people who seek adventure, take the first ferry that comes and go with the flow! Sydney contains many great sites and is sure to be loved by many tourists!"
30,“Nice to visit but not good enough to go back...”,"Sydney was a good visit, but it's just another very large city. Plenty of good things (Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Wharf, etc.) but I had enough after 2 days.We visited Jan. 4 & Jan. 8, 2010. We took the double decker hop-on hop-off tour. This was a good way to see the major sites in town.The best thing I did was see Avatar on the 7-story IMAX at the wharf. It is billed as the largest IMAX screen in the world.To be fair, I am not the big city kind of person. I went to Australia to visit the Blue Mtns., so Sydney was just the first & last night to catch flights."
50,“So Friendly”,We spent almost 6 weeksin Australia. Mostly in and around Sydney. It was the most relaxed and friendly major city that we have ever visited. No matter where we we went people had time to chat and were always courtious. There is so much to see and do that will suit all tastes that we challenge anyone to not find something to interest them. We were lucky enough to be in the city for New Years Eve. We had front row seats for the fireworks at Peter Doyles. Worth every penny and we would recommend it to anyone. The organisation and crowd management to and from the ferries was second to none. The police were briliant and we saw no unpleasantness on our way home. It might be a long way to go but well worth it.
50,“Beautiful City”,"My husband and I travel few times a year...Our main destination is usually Europe...The reason we choosed Sydney was because of the storms in east coast during christmass time 2009..Flights were cancelled from LAX to NYC to make our connetion to Europe, so we decided to go somewhere west..We choosed Sydney, Australia....Everything was last minute , we didnt even have time to check what it is in there....We are very happy with our decition..(we are still in sydney )It is a beautiful city, people are extremly nice every where...Food is very delisious...service is excelent...We didnt have any bad expeiences here..Wonderful country and wonderfull people...."
50,“My favourite place Sydney”,"Well every year i love going to Sydney, it has always been my favourite place in the world and it always will be. The people are very friendly and the transport system is excellent. The shopping centres are fantastic as well. my favourite shop has to be Target"
50,“Sydney is the Place to be”,"If you love California, then you're going to love Sydney. It was fusion of Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco. I was exposed to much diversity; like the melting pot you'd find in the Bay Area. The people were nice and friendly. Please note, that Australians love Americans. I met some really great people and would recommend it to anybody looking for an adventure down under. Cheers! -Rob"
50,“Lots to see”,"Amazing place with so much to see. I travelled by myself and did so much research beforehand so that I wouldn't be overwhelmed and yet there was so much I couldn't anticipate. So based on my experience here's what I would recommend. Note that you have to get up EARLY because everything closes between 5-6pm and be prepared to walk alot so bring comfortable shoes.Day 1 - around 5:30-6am if you look out your window you'll spot some bats flying around. Depending on where you're staying your route may differ but here's an idea - walk your way towards Hyde Park and walk through and make a stop at Hyde Park Barracks Museum (which opens @ 9:30am) then walk towards the Royal Botanic Gardens (which opens @ 7am) once in the Gardens look up as you'll see where those bats were heading. Then walk towards Mrs. MacQuires chair - the view along the way is amazing and the birds you'll spot are beautiful. Once you get to the chair head back along the waterside towards the Opera House (depending on your pace you may get to the Opera house between noon-1pm). Stop for lunch anywhere you find interesting. Then continue your walk towards the Rocks (schedule a 2:30pm walking tour of the rocks (2pm if it's a weekend - it's about 2 hours of interesting history). Once done walk across the harbor bridge towards the Northern part (again depending on your pace it could take 15-20 min). For $9 you can make a stop at Pylon Lookout (open 9am - 5pm) which will take you to the top of the pillar for a panaramic view. (If you have 4 hours and $200 to spare you can actually climb the bridge) continue North head towards Luna Park (an amusement park-check park times depending on the month you'll be visiting). Once you get there you can walk or take a ferry back to the city (which by the way is pronounced circular 'key'). Have dinner before heading back or once you're in the city.Day 2 (ideally Weds-Sun) visit Darling Harbor a beautiful place day or night. Start at Paddy's market (open 9-5 Weds - Sun) there you can get lots of souvenirs at great prices. Then head towards to the Wildlife World ($32) where you can have your picture taken with a koala ($20 for 1 and $10 for each additional) walk through the rest of the 'park' (skip the aquarium it's small and overpriced). If you plan a tour to featherdale park you can take pictures with a Koala, kangaroos and wallabies for free. After the Wildlife world visit the Chinese Garden of Friendship which is located right next to a big ferris wheel ($6 to get in open daily 9:30 - 5) it's really pretty and you can have tea and a snack (their sampler is really good with Jasmine tea). Through Grayline schedule the 2:10pm Sydney Highlights & Manly tour which ends at 5:30pm. If you're not exhausted after this long day you can head toward the Sydney tower and go up to the observatory but don't just go up and look sign up for the skywalk - it's an awesome experience (unless you have a fear of heights). If you're too tired go for dinner and do the skywalk another day since they are open from 9am - 10pm but the last tour is at 8:45pm.Day 3 - Many talk about the blue mountain tour & the 3 sisters and honestly for ME it wasn't a big deal but it's a great place if you're into birds or a botanist or have such interest.Day 4 - Take a 20 min bus ride (380 or 333) toward North Bondi and do the Bondi to Coogee walk. It's a long walk but on a beautiful day it's worth it and you get a little exercise as there are plenty of hills and stairs. Bring lunch and water so you can make stops at the beaches you'll pass along the way or you can eat at the various cafes along the way.Day 5 - for those of you into the Olympics take a ferry from circular quay to homebush bay (50 min of beautiful scenery for $6.50 one way) then take a bus to the stadium area ($1.90) you can pay on the bus or buy a ticket prior. Then sign up for a tour of ANZ stadium (1.5 hrs) 11am, 12:30pm, 2, & 3:30pm. You can buy a round trip ferry ticket or for a quicker return get on the train back to circular quay or central station (depending on which is closer to your hotel - the train station is very close to the statium. You can also have lunch at homebush bay brewery before heading back to the city but keep in mind lunch is available 11-3 then dinner 5-8. They are closed on Sunday, unless there's an event.There's so much more you can do but I hope this helps any of you that are visiting for the first time. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. I can also share more photos if you like. I could only upload 3 due to the MB.Happy Travels!"
50,“Favorite things to do in Sydney”,"I can't say enough good things about my recent trip to Sydney Australia. It was a fun 3 days there as the last leg of my 13 day vacation in Australia.There are so many things to do. I loved the shopping, street markets and ferry rides around Darling Harbour. The various modes of transportation (buses, trains and ferries) make it easy to get around and see the city.The fun and exciting Captain Cook's sunset dinner cruise was wonderful. I had a wonderful meal and enjoyed many fine wines and beers. The experience was the best of the entire trip. People are friendly and helpful and eager to point you in the right directions for site seeing and dining.The hotel offered a beautiful view of the Circular Quay and Harbour.. I would have loved to had more time to spend in that city."
40,“Highlights of Sydney”,"On a sunny day, walk along the eastern coast from Bondi to Coogee beaches. The natural scenery is itself beautiful and if you time your trip right you can also enjoy the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition at Bondi.Go to Taronga Zoo, the zoo with a view. You should take the ferry from Circular Quay (or get on at Darling Harbour) and take some wonderful camera shots along the way. If you attent the free flight bird show, you will also get a really nice view of the Sydney skyline, including the opera house and bridge."
50,“Seeing Sydney”,"We just returned from a week in Sydney. What a fun city!The best choice we made was to purchase a 7 day See Sydney and Beyond card with the travel option. We saved over $1000 on attractions alone for two people! The list of covered attractions was incredibly long and included all the ""biggies"" that we wanted to see anyway. It was usually the entire entrance fee that was covered, and you could go back every day if you wanted. On the one rainy day we just museum hopped, and spent time on what interested us and zipped through the rest. The travel portion allowed us unlimited travel on bus, train and ferry throughout Sydney and the surrounding areas. Public transportation is excellent and we were able to get from Manley to Bondi beaches and out to Olympic Park and Featherdale Wildlife Park. One clerk said that residents of Sydney even buy the card because it is such a great bargain.Sydney was very easy to get around in on foot as well - the city feels safe in the areas we stayed in. People are very friendly and helpful. People tend to dress well in the city - nice to see.We found prices in general to be higher than we expected. Food, especially.All in all, it was an excellent trip!"
40,“3 days of bliss in Sydney”,"Ah Sydney. As soon as you get into town, you can feel the hustle and bustle of probably the most well known city in all of Australia.However, before we get there, a note of advice for all of you, do not go to the Information Desk at the airport and please do not take the Airport Connect shuttle. Find an alternative mode of getting into the city. Airport Connect is a horrible service and I would wish no one else experience the incredibly poor way to get to the city, so just be warned!Now on to the beauty of Sydney and some of the activities that we did and how we enjoyed them:1) Mrs. Macquaire's Chair and the Royal Botanical Garden-where else can you get a beautiful and majestic view of the Opera house and the bridge? The best place to take photos? Many wedding photographers we saw there thought so! It's free and a gorgeous view. The RBG is also beautiful and the grounds are immaculately kept.2) Walking along Sydney Harbor-tons of restaurants and cafes, it's the perfect place to catch the sunset and the Opera Bar is a great place to people watch! We love how all the gals in Sydney dressed up to go out!3) Bridge Climb-At $195 USD, the price is a deterent for sure and we contemplated about this one but decided to splurge for when in Sydney, do the climb. Was it touristy? Yes. Worth it? Monetarily-it's pricey but for the experience and the views-Yes! If you can try to amend your budget to fit this in, you won't regret it4) Opera House-tour or no tour, this structure is architecturally magnificent.5) Yum Cha (dim sum in the USA) is a must given the large # of Chinese people that reside in Sydney.5) Sydney Fish Market-off the beaten path but totally walkable, come here for great seafood and fresh sashimi! Delicious!6) Darling Harbor-great for day and night. Tons of things to do for adults and kids. Great restaurants and great views. We had dessert at Lintz Cafe and the belgian waffle is heavenly.7) Bondi Beach/Manly Beach-no trip to Sydney would be complete without a visit to its beaches! Surfers and tons of all around healthy, active, in shape Australians for you to people watch. We also ate dinner at Bondi Beach's Hurricane Bar and sat next to an athlete! The ribs were so delicious too!8) Shopping! Whether you swipe that credit card or just window shop, it is truly a shopper's paradise. QVB is a gorgeous arcade and there are shopping malls lined on every street in downtown it seems. The perfect place to get fashion inspiration.9) Paddy's Market-go there for your cheap souvenirs and knick knacksTips for Sydney:--plan your itinerary and consider buying an all day ferry pass--try all the different cuisines available--it's expensive so be prepared to shell out the $. atms have the best exchange rates. We used that and our credit cards only.--opera house +harbour bridge+ sunset=ultimate romanceWe love Sydney! would love to be back and explore some more =)"
40,"“very chic, a lot like America”","Summer is the perfect time to visit Australia, its very cool, around 70's when we went. Not unlike southern California winter, just mild.If you stay in downtown Sydney, by the Darlin Harbor and Chinatown area, you can walk to all the main attractions without going too far. Sydney Opera House, Darlin Harbor, Chinatown and Harbor bridge. Although you will need to get on the ferry for the Topanga Zoo, and if you want to visit the Blue Mountain for the Kangaroos or Bondi beach, then you must take the bus.Overall, it was pretty good trip for summertime to escape the heat."
50,“What a beautiful city!”,"We went to Sydney over the summer (which was winter time there) and had a blast! Though we didn't get to swim in the beach because it was a bit cold, we had a wonderful time sight-seeing. My husband and I took our 6 yr. old daughter. Her favorite part of the trip was going to the Taronga Zoo. We rode the ferry there from Circular Quay. The view of the city from the ferry ride was spectacular and breath-taking! We went to all the tourist spots...Sydney tower, Darling Harbour, the Harbour bridge, and of course, the Opera House. If you are brave enough to climb up to the top of the Harbour Bridge, they have tours daily that take a small group to the summit of the bridge. My daughter is still too young for that but we'll definitely do that when we go back. Everything in Sydney was more expensive than in the US but the trip is all worth it!This was my second time to go there, and it is even better the second time around. We can't wait to go back!"
50,“Stay by the Rocks”,"Stay close to the Rocks if you are only going for a few days. Most of the attractions you want to see are within walking distance. For example, you can get to the Opera House, the museum of Australian History, the Zoo, a harbor cruise, and very nice restaurants in the harbor area. Getting into the center of town is also easy from this location."
50,“Magical Sydney”,"My family of 4 spent my husband's 3 month sabbatical in Sydney, Australia. We were there from April through July 2009. What a beautiful city! Breathtaking, really. The Opera House, the beaches, the bridge. And the people are so genuine, friendly, and without airs. We honestly wanted to stay on, and are hoping to have the opportunity to return again soon. Maybe permanently! We visited many museums and historical landmarks (Queen Victoria Building, Art Gallery NSW, Museum of Sydney, Customs House, Circular Quay, Manly Beach). We found the public transportation -- buses, ferries and trains -- very convenient. The city is, however, quite expensive. Bottled water can be $3.50. Coffee $3.50 and up. And the US exchange rate is declining as we speak. Oh, well, we'd still love to return."
50,“Great Value for Getting Around”,"Even though it rained our entire time in Australia, the cost of everything was sky high and the television selection is weak, we found the best value to be in getting around town using a TravelPass. The TravelPass gets you access via bus, ferry or train along all lines in Sydney. $38 for a weeks pass is one of the few bargains in Sydney and maybe in all of Australia. While the food was very good, it was beyond expensive and it rained, but we were able to sightsee relatively cheap by using our TravelPasses. We highly recommend it."
50,“one of my favorite places on earth”,"Fulfilling a long time dream of seeing the ""land down under"", I took a 14 day trip to Eastern/Southern Australia in August 2008. My itinerary included Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane. This is my experience in my first stop - Sydney.In Sydney, I benefitted from the presence of a ""mate"" who lives there and served as my guide for the 5 days I visited. With no transport issues, I was able to venture down the coast to Wollongong, which was a beautiful area and where the rugby team's stadium is next to the ocean. If you haven't seen an NRL match, it is well worth the time (dress warmly!). Also in the area and situated within's a stone throw of the water is a restaurant called Lagoon - one of the most amazing seafood restaurants at which I have dined. The food and service were first rate and the view is unlike any I have experienced.Back in Sydney, I climbed the Harbour Bridge (a bit pricey but well worth it). Our guide (for a group of about 12) was very well versed and quite personable and the view once you reach the top is one you won't soon forget. They also take photos at the top which you can purchase after the climb. The whole tour takes about 90 minutes.One day was a trip to the nearby Blue Mountains - not to be missed. Very scenic, lush and features a glass bottom tram ride. It was misting/light rain the day we visited but were still able to see a great deal including the famous ""three sisters"" rock formation. On the way back, it snowed! (quite an experience for a Californian in August.)Another excursion to be enjoyed is the ferry trip to Manly. A very scenic and relaxing trip across the harbor to this beachside area which is lined with shops or you can just stroll along the water. The ferries run fairly frequently, the cost is reasonable and the views can't be beat (especially as you return with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge coming into view.)Speaking of the Opera House, seeing this iconic structure up close is everything you might expect. Take the tour and get a view of all the various performing spaces or do what I did, get the tour as part of a package that includes an opera performance. In my case, it was Don Giovanni. I had many envious friends when I told them I had seen an opera there. The great thing about the Opera House is that it's not as formal an environment as seeing opera in the U.S. There's no real dress code and it's all about enjoying the music. The acoustics are obviously top notch and for the price, the opportunity shouldn't be missed.Unfortunately, I didn't get much of a chance to spend time in the Rocks area near the harbor but what I did see was very interesting. This is the historic area of Sydney with warehouses, shops and restaurants. Next time, I will definitely focus on a look around there.As for accommodations, both properties I used (overnighting in Wollongong, I switched hotels in Sydney mid visit) were outstanding. The Sir Stamford at Circular Quay is a brief walk from the Opera House and is a boutique property. Very well run and outstanding rooms. The other was the Sydney Harbour Marriott, a high rise with very nice views and everything one might want in a hotel including spacious rooms.The only thing to possibly complain about is the lack of service in restaurants (the Lagoon being the notable exception.) In all the places I visited in Australia, the servers put the absolute minimum into their duties as compared with what one might get in the U.S. I'm told that this is due to the compensation plan that they have where the minimum wage is considerably higher, hence no incentive for tips. In fact, in more than one restaurant, there wasn't even a place on the receipt to include one. Overall, a minor issue (and speaking of food, don't leave without trying the meat pies - tasty.)If you ever get the opportunity, a trip to this amazing land is certainly worth the long plane ride. The people, scenery and atmosphere will leave you gobsmacked!"
40,“Sydney”,"Sydney was beautiful! Our family went during their winter time, but it was still warm enough to put our feet in the water! The beaches were gorgeous and the people were so willing to help in anyway they could. I am so thankful my young sons were able to experience this amazing place. The only downside is that it was a little on the expensive side, but it was worth the costs when going to beaches and attractions such as zoos."
40,“Great city for 2-3 days”,"I arrived early Monday morning and went to Chinatown, Darling Harbour, the Rocks and Circular Quay. Then walked around the opera house and the botanical gardens. Nice overview of the city but the best treat was saved for the next day.Tuesday I took a ferry from Circular Quay to Manly (40 minutes). I took the Manly Scenic Walk, first taking a bus to the trailhead on the other side of town (bus fare included in my day transit pass). It took right about 4 hours to hike this trail, with many scenic and photographic stops. Brought lunch with me as food and drinks were scarce along the trail (only at one of the beaches toward the beginning of the hike). It was a highlight.The next day I drove to the Blue Mountains, which I honestly enjoyed even more than Sydney. But I would love to return to Australia again sometime soon."
50,“Everyone must go here!”,"What a wonderful place, very diverse, both aspects of life are found in the city, the fast busy buzz and the laid back Australian ways. And the main attractions are just beautiul, the opera house is mind blowing, highly recommend taking a water taxi to the far side of the opera house and getting some snaps of the opera house with the harbour bridge in the background. An amazing city, with lots to do, plenty of places to stay for all price ranges."
40,“Great city with lots to do and plenty of great people”,"We were very happy with our visit to Sydney. We visited the caves, a few wineries, the beaches, olympic park, zoo and more. Lots of great places to eat and shop. The people seemed to all be very friendly and welcoming of tourists. Only downfall was that we happened to come in during one of the rainiest seasons they have had in years so it was not quite the warm summer weather we were expecting and some views of local attractions were covered by fog, clouds or heavy rain. Would definitely go back and recommend to friends."
50,"“Amazing sights, great food, fantastic people”","Sydney is truly an urban, sophisticated city with wonderful sights, a plethora of activities and a warm, friendly people. We can't wait to return. The long flight from the US is the biggest drawback!"
50,“Sydney”,"What a beautiful city! I was impressed with how clean not only the streets are but even the water. I say that considering how much traffic there is between the water taxis, ferries ect.I am looking forward to returning someday, perhaps to check out Melbourne.If like to walk you will enjoy going through the Botanical Gardens, meandoriing down near the Opera House. Loved It!"
50,“Our first taste of Australia”,"Sydney was fantastic! If we could chose another city in the world to move to it would be Sydney. The people were friendly, there was so much to do and we loved Darling Harbour. We stayed at the Radisson Suites on Liverpool Road and the location was perfect. It was a short walk to the harbour, near Paddy's market, a train ride to the airport (although if you can arrange an airport mini bus pick up it's the same price. Normal taxi was much more expensive). The rooms were very basic but clean and comfy. They also had handy kitchens. Ring before hand if you check in early as we didn't and had to wait from 5am until 9am!!We walked the Sydney bridge and it was an amazing experience. It was quite expensive but worth it. Make sure you go to the toilet before you go into the fitting room as you are walking for about 4hours!! You can't take cameras on the bridge but there are lockers if you have yours with you. They give you a free picture at the end of the walk. Have no alcohol before the walk as they do breath tests!! Wear comfy shoes but don't worry about hats / gloves / fleece / raincoat as these are all supplied. Definately worth a trip and you find out loads of information as the instructors are very knowledgable. The office is just behind the 'Rocks' market and we got the boat over from Darling Harbour.Ugg boots - buy them out there! Although there are lots of different makes not just the one you see in the UK. So cheap.Thai Foon Restaurant - Darling Harbour. You can sit outside upstairs and they have heaters for the winter. The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced."
50,“Wonderful city to visit”,"Beautiful city with a diverse mixture of people makes anybody who comes from anywhere feel comfortable. Sushi bars are in abundance everywhere. Turkish kebabs at Liverpool St was extremely delicious. Sydney Convention Centre at Circular Quay was amazing, Harbour bridge & Opera house - the view of the city was great. Would love to visit again, one day."
40,"“Long, Detailed Trip Review of Sydney, Part 1”","About us: 45 year old mom and 16 year old son, traveled to Europe 3 times. All prices listed in AUD.Arrived at SYD on Thursday, August 20th at 7:30 am, out of airport by 8:30 am. Went through Customs first and then Quarantine. We didn't have any food so we went right through. (We did have gum, but was told that was OK) People with food had their bags x-rayed and searched.Roped off areas for taxi lines. Very well marked with signs. Took a taxi to Travelodge Wynard, 7-9 York Street. Took 1 hour.$ 44.50, plus $ 5 toll and $ 3 airport charge.Travelodge Wynard- $ 124 a night, booked on hotel's site. Excellent location, 75 feet from Wynard train station and 10 to 20 minute walks to Circular Quay, Sydney Aquarium, Chinatown, etc.. Room was not ready but we were able to leave all of our bags in locked, secure room right next to check in desk. I asked for a map at front desk and they gave us a very good map for seeing the sights, much better than the maps that I had brought from Frommers and Sydney books.Walked to Syndey Aquarium. Had read mixed reviews but my son wanted to see it. $31.95 a person. Very small, we were done in a hour. Outdated and musty smelling. Basically I would say that if you have kids younger than 8 or 9, then it is worth it. Othewise, not worth the money. We have a better aquarium in CT, Mystic Aquarium. Also, I grabbed an Official Sydney Tourism book at the airport, which had a coupon for 10% off the Aquarium, which I did not realize until later that night. Had other good coupons though.Stopped at 7-11 for a soda. $3.70 for a 500 ml coke (just over 16 ounces). Water same price. Ouch!!Went back to hotel, room ready at noon. After reading the reviews of the Travelodge Wynard, I was expecting a clean room with an excellent location for a very good price. That was true. The rest of the things did not bother me, like only 5 channels on the tv, only 2 towels in the bathroom, 1 of the 3 elevators broken for our entire 5 day stay, bed rolled away from wall alot, etcc. If you are planning to stay in your room alot, don't stay here. However, if you are looking for a clean place to sleep and shower, then stay here. The location alone saved us money on traveling on the train. One night my son was tired and wanted to ride back from Cicular Quay, which was 1 train stop away from the Wynard train stop. $ 3.40 one way, each. I told him that we would walk.We walked to Wynard Station to eat lunch. Ate at Hungry Jacks, which is what they call Burger King. Same prices as America, pretty much. $5.95 for double cheeseburger meal and $ 6.70 for chicken sandwich meal.Wynard Station also had McDonalds and many, many other places to eat. Wynard Station is huge, it has exits on 3 parellel streets, George Street, York Street and Clarence Street. There was a nice bakery in there in which we brought sticky buns for$ 1.50 each to save for breakfast the next day.If you follow the exit signs to York Street, you will find a NAB ATM, which does not charge to use the ATM. I used this machine every morning, as my bank only allows $ 400 withdrawals a day.More importantly, there is a Coles Supermarket. I brought our reusable bags from home to use here. We loaded up on soda (1 liter for $ 1.07) (Travelodge has good sized refrig in room) and other snacks.Tried to keep us awake as long as possible, so we walked to Chinatown. Didn't really see much as my son was beyond tired and grumpy. Had dinner at McDonald's at Wynard Station and then went to bed at 6:30 pm.2nd day, Friday, August 21st: Had previously booked a Blue Mts. Tour with Activity Tours, $ 82 a person. Tour bus had 20 seats, full bus. Had to walk down the street for 3 minutes to wait at corner for Tour Bus. We were told to arrive 10 minutes before our pick-up time of 7:45 am. Tour Bus arrived at 8:00 am. First stop Fetherdale Wildlife Park. This was one of the main reasons that I booked with Activity Tours, because of the stop at Fetherdale. Not all of the Blue Mt. tours stop here and I had read excellent reviews of this place. Also, it would have been difficult to reach by public transportation (1 hour train ride and then local bus ride). Hit unusual traffic(so tour drived said) and arrived at Fetherdale at 9:30, instead of 9:00. We had 1 hour there. We took our own pictures with a koala sitting in a tree stand. This was free, they do not take pictures or charge for pictures to be taken. $ 1 donation to buy ice cream cone filled with food to feed kangeroos in fenced in area. About 40 kangeroos. Very small park but had wombats, dingos, reptiles, birds. Saw all of it in an hour. The admission (which was included in the tour) would have been $ 22. The park was very nice and my son enjoyed it a lot. As I am a very, very experienced shopper, I can tell you that they had a very good gift shop with some pretty good prices. So, if you see something you really want, buy it here. I bought a very nice tie for $30 and some Australia lanyards for $5.95, lanyards which I saw for sale for $ 8 or $9 in Sydney. Left Fetherdale at 10:30, as several bit tour buses pulled in.Drove to do scenic walk in Blue Mts. One group went with tour driver to so 1 hour brisk walk down to water falls and the other group did a 15 minutes walk down to see the water falls and another 15 minutes to walk back again. We did the easier walk, which was not so easy. The tour drived said it was a leisurely stroll, but it was steep stairs almost the entire way. Not too bad, but I did stop to breathe on the way up twice.Went to lookout for 3 Sisters and ate lunch there. We had fish and chips, which were $ 11.95 each. I had brought a refillable water bottle from home, which we filled up at the hotel, so that we would have water to drink. I'm sorry, but I just can't pay $ 4 for a soda.Went to Scenic World. This cost us extra if we wanted to ride. We paid the tour driver who got us the tickets. $ 25 each for 3 rides. (They must have some deal with Scenic World, as the sign said it was $ 28 for the 3 rides) We went over on the Skyway, but you don't need the tickets until you exit. The tour driver was waiting there with the tickets when we exited the ride. We then went down on the Cableway and up in the Rail Car. I think it would have been more fun to ride the Rail Car down, but the Tour Driver said the lines are better this way. No real lines, only about 10 minute wait at each, at the most. Tour Driver said in the summer, people wait 2 or 3 hours for each ride.We had 2 more scenic lookouts and then drove by Olympic Stadium. Dropped off at Homebush Bay to ride ferry to Circular Quay. Ferry at 5:30, arrived at Circular Quay at 6:20. This is the same ferry that you would take to visit the Olympic Stadium if you wanted to. Just be advised that the signs all say Olympic Stadium, yet the stop is called Homebush.Very good tour, great value for money. Was able to leave bags on the bus during stops and it was locked. Also, chose to go the Blue Mts. during the week, as I have read many times that it is more crowded on the weekends. A lot of the time, we were driving on a single lane road.3rd day, Saturday, August 22nd: My son wanted to go to the Koala Park Sanctuary in West Pennant Hills. Took train to Pennant Hill Station, 45 minutes. Right outside of station, cross over the tracks and you will see the bus stop. Take bus 632 to Koala Park, $ 3.40 each one way. The company is Sunbus. I had printed out the bus times before we left home, in case we went here. 10 minute bus ride.$ 19 a person. You can take your picture with the koala standing on the railing during the koala feeding times. Free, but you take the pictures.There was a feeding area with about 30 kangeroos. $ 1.70 for a small bag of cheerios, about 1 cup, to feed kangeroos. Sheep shearing demonstration also, which we did not see. We saw 5 koalas at the picture area and 6 other koalas in the nursery. That is it. Wouldn't exactly call it a Koala Park. Also had wombats, dingos, penguins. Very small park, smaller than Fetherdale. My son really enjoyed it though, so it was worth it.After we came back, we went to the Australian Museum. There was a 20% off coupon in the official tourism book, which we used. $ 20 for 2 adults. Very nice museum. Had areas such as Dinosaurs, Indigenous People, Surviving Australia, Minerals, etcc. We only stayed for about an hour, only because my son did not want to get an education on his vacation. We did see all of the Surviving Australia secion, which was excellent.This is a very good museum and well worth the money. I guess it just depends on what you want to do on your vacation...Next, we went to Hyde Park Barracks, which is only about 10 blocks from the Australian Museum. There was a 2 for 1 coupon in the tourism book, so only cost us $ 10 to get in, instead of $ 20.Very interesting, the history of the prison ships, excellent displays, took about 1 1/2 hours. My son enjoyed this, was educational but not overload like Australian Museum.That is it for today, tired and going to bed. Part 2 tomorrow."
40,“Take the Bus - and follow the rules!”,"I'm having a great time in Sydney, Australia, and I wanted to share some advice with fellow travelers so you will be warned. The bus service is great but you should follow the rules!If you are going to ride the bus often, you should buy a bus pass that is good for 10 rides. (You get a 20% discount this way.) Each time you get on, you are supposed to stamp the ticket to pay for the ride.My advice: Stamp the ticket! Do not try to get away without stamping! Twice in the last two days inspectors came on the bus - jumped on/showed badges/checked tickets and TOOK PEOPLE OFF THE BUS WHO DID NOT SCAN THEIR TICKET!I don't know if the people were fined or just paid and then had to wait for the next bus but it caused quite a scene and is something you should try to avoid! Now, go and try to save some money elsewhere!"
40,"“Fave cafe in Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia”","I have to recommend this cafe, Le Petit Creme, at Darlinghurst, Sydney, near King's Cross. Each time i'm in Sydney over the weekend, I pay my pilgrimage here. On Friday, Saturday or Sunday only, they serve their egg benedict - either with ham, or smoked salmon. owner said he made his own hollandaise sauce by hand so this is not available for the rest of the week. & the bowl coffee is richly aromatic. Setting is very french-style, the rest of the menu (on chalk board) also very French. Please, if you are in Sydney, must try!!!"
50,“Sydney- What a view”,"Well, it is quite hard for a queenslander to wrote this. But on my way back home from thailand i stopped in sydney for thee nights- and had a blast!I must say that it was a bit pricey- but worth it.Make sure you shop in the CBD, and have yum cha in China town. For Brs and clubs make sure you head to circular quay and have a drink at the passenger terminal! What a view.Oh, and take a walk through hyde parkx"
50,“60th B'day weekend onboard Captain Cook Cruises”,"I organised 27 adults for a friends 60th birthday celebration. Heeinrick and all the staff especially the food waitresses where 1st class, friendly and obliging. Food and presentation 1st class, the entertainment was great. I would highly recommend to anyone with a group wanting to celebrate a special event.Thanks again to the Captain, Heeinrick and the girls who looked after our drink and food orders all weekend.Once again we wish the girls goodluck and many thanks for a great weekend.www.captaincook.com.au"
50,“One of my best vacations!”,"I was in Sydney for a week and the area has quickly become one of my favorite destinations! The people are friendly, the sites are spectacular, public transportation is a breeze, and you'll always find the type of food you crave. I didn't stay in a hotel, but chose to rent a flat in the Ruschcutter Bay/Kings Cross area from a native Sydneysider. I would highly recommend this as an option as it gives you get a better local feel for the city, and it gives you the option to cook and relax in the comfort of a home. The rate was extremely reasonable, although keep in mind I traveled in June, and this is their cold/off-season. The weather was chilly and windy on some days, but overall quite nice. As far a sites, be sure to catch the standard postcard locations such as the Opera House, Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, The Rocks, and Bondi Beach. I would also highly recommend the Manly/Manly Beach area, the coastal walk from Bronte Beach to Bondi Beach, Watson's bay for a stop at Doyle's (famous seafood and fish 'n' chips), and the Taronga Zoo. Walks through the Botanical Gardens, Hyde Park, Chinatown, Kings Cross and Darlinghurst are also quite good. Recommended eateries would be Cafe Sydney (Circular Quay - New Australian - $$$$), Pony (The Rocks - New Australian - $$$), Rockpool (The Rocks - New Australian - $$$$$), Doyle's (Watson's Bay - Seafood - $$$), Billy Kwong (Surry Hill - modern asian - $$$), Harry's Pies (Woolloomooloo - Midnight munchies - $). Recommended attractions would be a bike tour with Bonza Bike Tours (The Rocks - a great start to a trip), a tour at the Opera House, a day trip to the Blue Mountains near Katoomba and Leura (incredible views, canyons, hikes, and home to the steepest railway in the world), as well as self guided walking tours everywhere else within Sydney. As mentioned earlier, the public transportation in Sydney is quite good with busses, trains, and ferries departing any time you need one. I would recommend the Green pass, as this gets you one week access to every bus, train, and ferry (including the Manly ferry) for only $45. Public transport runs late, and the train from the airport will take you directly into Central or Circular Quay (ferries, Opera House, etc). If you mingle with the locals and maintain that famous ""No worries"" mentality, you'll have a fantastic trip to Sydney."
50,“Real city”,"If should select one city in the world, it could be Sydney. Beautiful, nice relaxed people, good food..."
40,“A lot like San Francisco”,"We live near San Francisco, so when we visited Sydney, we saw a lot of similarities. Both have very busy, noisy downtown areas, with lots of skyscrapers. Each has a Chinatown, a famous bridge, and lots of similar tourist attractions.Sydney is a little more expensive than San Francisco, even with a 1.20 exchange rate. Meals, attractions, and convenience items were about 40% more in many cases. We did find places that had more reasonable pricies, such as Paddy's market, and Woolworth's. But we paid A$3.80 (US$3.00) for a 600ml bottled water almost everywhere we went!We saved a lot of money getting the DayTripper pass, which is good for all buses, trains, and ferries in the greater Sydney area for that day. We used it to take the ferry to Taronga Zoo and Watson's Bay on the same day, as well as taking the train to our hotel and back."
50,“Sydney. LOVED IT!!!!!”,"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED SYDNEY. First time in Australia. We didn't know what to expect but I did lots of research online. Do book the ferry and do the 1 1/2 hour trip around the harbour. Opera House. Do walk over the Harbour Bridge, we just walked didn't do the climb above, the views are still great. Did the rocks, Darling Harbour, Circular Cay, Zoo (great views), Manning Beach, Bondi Beach. Stayed in Potts Point. Bought the transit day passes which included ferries, busses and train. Booked our accomodation for our month long trip all up and down the east coast on lastminute.com.auDid sail in Whitsundays, Great Barrier Reef as well."
50,“The best tourist city in Australia”,"Sydney would have to be the best city in Australia from a tourists perspective. From the stunning views of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge to the shopping in the Queen Victoria Building.There is sooo much to do it's hard to leave the place. My favourites would have to include but are not limited to: walking under/over/around the Harbour Bridge, walking around the Opera House, Taronga Zoo, Sydney Aquarium, Monorail, Double-decker trains, Botanical Gardens, Watsons Bay, Sydney Tower, Queen Victoria Building, Darling Harbour, Hard Rock Cafe, Powerhouse museum, etc, etc, etc.Definately recommend visiting this city to anyone."
50,“An amazing destination!! We loved Sydney!!”,"We spent a week in Sydney before traveling to Airlie Beach and the Whitsunday Islands. Sydney is just one of the most amazing cities anywhere and one of our favorites!We stayed at the Stamford Plaze Double Bay (very sad to hear that it is being torn down at the end of March 2009 to make way for a high-rise!!!) Double Bay is a nice, quiet community with great restaurants and cafes. Although referred to as 'Double Pay' we didn't do a lot of shopping, so no worries for us there.We traveled in and around the city by bus - it's very easy to do, convenient and cheaper than taxi. Finding a bus schedule was tricky as bus drivers don't carry copies, but we were able to find out info via internet. I would recommend getting a pass that includes bus and ferry for as many days as you need it.Our week included walking around Circular Quay and The Rocks, the downtown area, Royal Botanical Gardens, Woolamooloo, and the Hyde Park area. Sydney is a great walking town (make sure you have comfortable shoes). Very easy to get around! We recommend The Loney Planet guide book and took several of the walks suggested there - our favorite was the walk between Bondi Beach and Coogee Beach! Beautiful!!Another unpublished beautiful walk is the Foreshore Heritage walk (from Rose Bay to Watson's Bay). It is right along the shoreline and has the most amazing views of the Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Opera House. Seek out directions - it's well worth it.We love the friendliness and cleanliness of Sydney! It is apparent that residents love their city! We will definately be back!!"
50,“Sydney for New Years”,"New Years 2009I will try to best give my advice for those of you wanting information on Sydney for New Years from my trip.If you are traveling from the states, leave from L.A. around midnight. This makes the time change a breeze.Take a taxi from the airport instead of the train.During my trip I stayed at Marriott Circular Quay(key). It was a great location and I highly recommend it. You can walk a few feet to the Quay, buses, ferries, Opera House, EVERYTHING! We did not eat there, because it was very overpriced. There are some great eatery's at the key. Get out and explore. Most places were pretty cheap. They charge for Internet, but you can get it free at McDonalds around the corner as well as the Customs House Bar.Purchase a See Sydney Card. For @ $200us we had all of the Major attractions for 7 days with transportation. Note: There is nothing you get with the bridge climb and this card even though they say you get a free gift, you get a free pic anyways. Still it was a great deal.Lenin Bar - Great Pub and Food in the quay behind opera house. Be sure and check out the Ice Bar Upstairs. quite an experience.The Rocks tour. - A great tour of the historic district. Find a small pub or hotel to eat. The Australian has great pizza.Opera House-Get the first tour of the day around 9am. Then walk through the botanical Gardens. The Goverment house is only open one day a week for tours, Sat. Worth it.Subways- You can get one anywhere from the key. Clean and Modern.Toronga Zoo - You really need a whole day here. Take the ferry across. Don't miss it.Manly Beach- A little more subdued than Bondi. Reminded me of Key West. Take the Ferry.Bondi Beach- Big, Young, Happening. The weather is great for sunning, but the water is ice cold. No Alcohol Allowed :(There is a Express Bus from the Quay, Much quicker than the train.Bridge Climb-Its $150, but worth it. If you don't want to spend that much, the pylon climb id about $5 and educational. Still a great view. reserve ahead for a sunset tour.Maritime Museum- You can spend several hours here. They also have a Submarine and destroyer you can explore.Aquarium and Wildlife Center - I would advise getting there later in the day. The Kids are all gone and not as much of a crowd. Your card gets you in the fast lane for this and most events.Jenolan Caves and Blue Mountains - This came with our cards. Get up early and take the train. You will have to buy a transffer at Central Station. We took the bus up to the caves and barely had time to do our tour. You need to rush on this one. There is a free tour of one of the caves, It may suit you just as well. One cave is about the same as the rest.Once you get back into town it's a short walk to the Three Sisters lookout. Everything Closes down at 6, so I would grab a bite to eat first. If you want to really see the mountains, I would advise 2 days.Sydney Tower - Nice Lookout. I would skip the movies.City Tour Bus Half Day- This was a great first tour. You can get a feel for what you would like to see. Don't missNew Years Eve on the Harbor !!!- We booked a cruise with Sydney Glass Island. I would recommend them. Great Food. Great Music. Great Drinks. All Included. Book Before Oct 31 for a discount. The only downside, is they were late getting to their slip. We stood for some time. Get a bus or cab out early to Darling Harbor. They will be packed. You will also find few bars to get into for food or drinks. They are pre-booked. The Cruise was great! You will be in the Parade of Lights. Plenty of room to dance or sit. The top roof was more crowded, but not bad.Plan a way home! You get back at 1am. If you can find a water taxi, take it, but I would do some pre-planning. We walked back to the Quay, not too bad.There are also some spots by the bridge and in the Quay to watch that had a closer view. If you get to the Opera House early, they let 600 people in for free in a certain section. Defiinately the best land view. There will be fireworks 360 degrees around you, so don't worry about missing out from any spot. Most areas are alcohol free, so check ahead if that is your thing."
50,“Sydney... love to visit again”,"This is my little attempt at a series - though the subject is a bit tenuous; just my way around Sydney.Sydney trip is the most memorable trip of my life. How much I enjoyed is not possible to explain in words. The first time in my life I actually considered moving out of country and settling there. It was spring season there, the days were warm but nights were cold. We tried all the means of transportation; ferry, monorail, road by car, taxi, local bus, tourist bus(which is 30AUD for 24 hrs), walking; there which was great fun and also the experience of strolling at Kings Cross St. (the drugs and red light capital of Australia.. The strip clubs, topless waitresses, adult bookshops and tacky nightclubs. It was 10 mins away from our hotel and we absolute unaware of the place went wandering there on first day of our arrival) and Paddington St. (It is a metaphor for Sydney’s gay community. They’re home to gay clubs, shops and services. I went shopping there. It was 5 mins from our hotel) was startling.We also enjoyed dinner at a revolving restaurant located at level 47, the best 360 degree view. The interesting part was when I went to washroom, on my return I couldn’t find my table for 5 mins as I was somewhere else.I also cherished watching India vs Australia, and cheering for India over Aussies for a change as I was in their country after playing the bare foot bowling which is actually meant for old age people.I also went and saw Manly beach, Blue hotel, St. cathedral church, art gallery of NSW, Wooloomooloo bay (difficult to spell), sydney hospital and clubbing(where I was originally denied entry as I was not carrying any age proof where I witnessed a small fight also) . I would love to visit again and visit Blue Mt, Wineries, Torongo Zoo and see Kuala and GiraffeOpera House!Sydney's iconic opera house has five theatres capable of hosting a range of performance styles. We took a backstage and walking tour of the opera house for which we had to get up at 5am Sydney time which was 1130 pm IST (our sleeping time) but it was gorgeous weather. It was good 30 mins walk from our hotel.. On our way back some of us tried taking short cut via garden and there was one native guiding us but we were the last one to reach back as we were lost in the garden.The famous harbour bridge. Yograj and I with many others enjoyed the ultimate experience of this bridge climb.The Bridge Climb is the most striking Sydney attraction. When you reach the top you will have a sense of achievement, it was wonderful feeling. The view of Harbor spread before you was breathtaking.I was supposed to do the bridge climb in the early morning but I was too tempted to do surfing so decided to postpone it for the evening. It was chilly on top and then it also started drizzling. I was wearing safety gears, windcheatersDarling Harbour, We took the ferry from Circular Quay and enjoyed the nice sunny weather and great lunch in an open restaurant. The place was hustling and bustling with tourist. There are many restaurants and drinking places around. We again went to darling harbor at to enjoy dinner and a sneak peak at the darling harbor.I stepped without actually thinking too much what am I intending to do, where am I intending to go. I had taken some details from the hotel and stepped. I was utilizing my bus pass roaming around and finally decided to go to bondi. I realized that I was not carrying any beach cloth.I stopped at a shop and bought swimming costume, sun screen lotion and slippers.Bondi Beach is one of Australia's most famous beaches and among the world's most well-known beaches. The topless beach, full of bag packers especially from Germany.I would love to go again. This place has so much to offer..."
50,“Sydney Rocks”,"Great city, awesome Ocean and beaches. Friendly people great history spend at least 7 days"
50,“Sydney - a once in a lifetime experience”,"We came to Sydney for a purpose - my daughter getting married - not to an Australian but an American. Sydney has something special - yep, it's a big city but it's got the impressive Opera House, The Bridge and the fantastic harbour with it's efficient ferry system - what a way to get around. It's got the beautiful Botanical Gardens and the intriguing Rocks area with it's great pubs, colourful market at weekends. It's got the Victoria Building, very well preserved shopping centre and you can hop on the Manly ferry and visit all the places you've heard of such as Watson's Bay, Darling Harbour with it's attractions and the Taranga Zoo.All in all you can spend 10 days in Sydney and not be bored, especially as you can visit the wonderful Blue Mountains and Hunter Valley in a day although I would recommend longer for the Blue Mountains if time allows.Overall we found Australians very friendly and helpful and not reserved like many europeans although Sydney is a melting pot of all nationalities and I guess you have to follow the big city rules for personal safety, we never felt uncomfortable or threatened - perhaps only if in the rush hour for the ferry service - joke. At the present time prices in Sydney and Australia are very reasonable for europeans, although hotels world wide are never cheap and the airfare is a major consideration, I recommend Sydney and Australia, especially, to see all the animals and birds that we've seen on TV - especially eastern Australia - a great drive is from Sydney to Melbourne but allow a minimum of 10 days - there's so much to see."
50,“Wow!”,"I'm a proud Aussie and want to let all you dedicated travellers know what a fantastic place Australia is. But it's also VERY big. So, please don't think you can come here and spend a week and see everything. You can't. You could easily spend a week in Sydney seeing the amazing harbour and wonderful scenery. Not far from Sydney (about 2 hours drive) is the Hunter Valley which is famour for its vineyards and beautiful countryside. That would be great for a long day trip. The beaches are fantastic and the people .... the people are amazing. We are friendly and happy and very down to earth. So, please think wisely when planning an Aussie adventure. You'll love it but as Aussies have discovered, it takes a long, long time to do it justice. Come and enjoy. You won't be disappointed."
50,“Beautiful City Sydney”,"We were in Sydney Sept. 22, 2008 to Sept. 29th. We found the city to be beautiful. The Aussies were very friendly and helpful. By far the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen. The U.S. Dollar was about 15-30% stronger than the Australian Dollar so this was good for the budget. The long flight here was really worth the trip. While in Sydney we did ""The Rocks"" walking tour, walked across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, went to Featherdale zoo, the Olympics site and the Blue Mountains. A great time."
50,“Sydney Australia Great Place”,"Sydney was great!! The City it self is amazing! Just taking the ferry and looking at the Opera House and Harbour bidge was fun!The Rocks is a great place to meet other travellers as there is a pub on every corner and the history of them seems to attract everbody!Did a bike tour with Sydney Bike Tours and I know , I know it sounds a bit strange to do a tour on bikes but it was really Fun! Our guide Andrew was one of the funniest Australians we met. The bike ride was easy to my surprise, but be careful Australians put the front brakes on the right side of the handle bars! It was a great way to see the City! Riding over the Harbour Bridge was Fantastic! Its definitely a Must Do while in Sydney!Did a Ghost tour and that was good for some corny laughs! Get to learn alot about the twisted history of Sydney!Skip Lunar park as there is really nothing there, and the rides are crap for a lack of a better word.The night life is good but hard to find some clubs!Other then that the food is great in Australia! Put Sydney on you to do list but a 5 day trip is enough time then move on to a new city!"
50,“Sydney best things to do”,"Sydney needs at least 3 days to see.One day is for the City sights - go to Darling Harbour ,climb the harbour bridge,take the ferry to manly ,Do a city sights bus tour.Another day - get out of Sydney - a MUST SEE - is the BLUE MOUNTAINS . It is a highlight of Australian Attractions ,as is the Great barrier Reef. You can drive a car to the mountains ,but it's not easy to find your way to the sights , so we did a bus tour - a full day.There are big buses and small buses tours. If you want to be with 50 other people ,do a big bus , But we liked the smaller ones and chose Tours R Us . It was a wonderful day with just 14 others , We saw all the sights - 3 sisters, echo point, visited a wildlife park to pat koalas and kangaroos ,all for only $83. This tour company was recommended in many placesAnother day we had shopping - the Paddys markets - open Thurs to sunday were great for bargains. Also we got a city train to a suburban shopping centre - Chatswood - a greatexperience too !I climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge one evening - truly fantastic ,but costs $180 - it's quite strenuous ! ."
50,“Possibly the greatest city in the world”,"Sydney is a great city to visit or live in. It has 9 to 10 months of warm weather a year and even when it cools off, it's still possible to do outdoor activities.It's a city with a multitude of beaches, a vibrant city life and close to bushland access. When I first came here I was struck by the amount of water there is in the city, whether ocean, harbour or lakes. It makes the whole feel of the city very clean and uncongested. It also means its very possible to stay in accommodation with water views.It's a 5 star city in so many ways and I recommend it to everyone. Get there before you die, you wont regret it.Willwww.sydneytravel.com.au"
50,“21 Days in Sydney and New South Wales”,"My husband and I went for a 3 weeks trip of a lifetime to Sydney and New South Wales. I searched on Tripadvisor and even went into forums on the area and had great experiences from that and a few of our own.Upon arriving at 5 a.m. we were picked up an brought to the Shangri-La hotel. We had a panoramic view of the harbour with the Opera House on one side and the beautiful bridge on the other side. The view was magnificant and being in the Rocks was great.I would suggest when staying in area for any great length of time you purchase a metro and ferry pass. It saved us a tremendous amount of time and expense. It was also quite relaxing just to spend an afternoon going from one end of the harbour to the other. The metro was clean, easy to get around and took us to Chinatown, wharf, uptown and downtown.After three days in Sydney, we drove to Canberra and toured the Old and New Parliament buildings. What beautiful architecture.Upon leaving Canberra were going further South and decided we wanted to spend more time in Sydney because there is so much to do and it is so easy to get around.We spent 2 days and went to the Coast and stayed at Bateman's Bay and at Woolagong. Beautiful ocean views.Upon returning to Sydney we stayed at the Hilton on George St. That provided another flavor for the business district and high end shopping. Wonderful time there for 5 days. Did not have the scenic view that the Shangri-La provides.We went back to the Shangi-La to finish our time. We took helicopter flights to the Blue Mountain and Hunter Valley. That was a fantastic experience and something everyone should do, if money is not an object.Come prepared because everything is expensive but well worth the price. We dined at some of the finest restaurants, toured Manly, cruised the harbour, enjoyed wine tastings and even ate ""Kangaroo Pie"" at Jackson's on George St.Everyone we met was friendly and helpful. I felt as if it was almost a small town feeling.An experience of a Lifetime. A trip we will never forget. Rich in history, culture, and friendliness."
50,“Syndey has a lot to ffer”,"We spend time in Sydney from Feb 4-8 and it was great. Syndey is a great city and has lots to offer for everyone. There is so much to see and do that we did not get to see everything we wanted it would take at least 2 weeks. We stayed at the Star City Hotel and Casino which was a great place to stay. Clean and great staff. We loved the Maritime Museum were we got go on Cpt.Cooks Ship, and got to enjoy the Harbour. I would recommend taking the Tours that they offer, it helped us getting around in Sydney since it is a busy place and that way we got to enjoy the scenery and got to see things without having to look for them. The only thing that we can complain about would be the prices. Sydney is very expensive and it was unbelievable what a simple luch or dinner cost."
50,“Down Under Was The Best Time Ever”,"If you ever have the chance to go “Down Under” to Australia, you have to go!! It’s a place where you can go to another country yet still feel like you are still in the USA. The country is gorgeous, the food is yummy and the people friendly.There is so much to do that you need to plan on spending a week or more in Sydney. You have to take the Captain Cook cruise tour so you can get a great view of the infamous Opera House, the Sydney Bridge and the wonderful countryside. Then take the tour to the Featherdale Wildlife Reserve where you can actually feed and pet kangaroos, pet koalas, pet Dingo’s and see so many other Australian animals. This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip!Darling Harbour is a great place to visit where you can shop and stop in for a great bite to eat. Also plan on visiting the Australian Zoo where you will be able to see a variety of great animals. It’s a great zoo and we loved the monkey area where there was a baby chimpanzee that stole our hearts.I would definitely come back to this country where I could spend more time and enjoy more of the countryside and all that it has to offer.MMoore"
50,“People Friendly City”,"We have just spent a month traveling the main cities in southern Australia and have to say that Sydney was the highlight! Even though it is home to more than 4 million people, we had no sense of the big city while there. People went out of their way to be friendly, helpful and courteous. The city itself has easily available restrooms, walking paths, shade areas, information booths and food! It was clean, calm and beautiful! The botanical garden was amazing! We would love to go back!"
50,“The Friendliness of Australians: A Short Story”,"First off, I'd like to say that Australia is the farthest I have ever been from the States and also that it was by far the Friendliest country I had ever been to.I thought this was incredibly funny and shows some light into the Australian personality.We are driving into my cousins' apartment (they are both in their mid 80s) and as we are pulling in an Aussie (Australian citizen) makes to walk in front of the car, but then he sees us pulling in.He steps back and waves us in.My cousin, the driver, stops by the man and says jokingly ""I insist!"".The man then playfully says ""No, no, you go ahead. You look like a dodgy driver anyway!""We all got a few chuckles out of that one.Excellent people.. The majority (9.9 out of 10) of people I've met in Australia have been SUPER friendly.I'm buying some meat in the deli and the butcher notices my accent and he says ""How's your trip so far mate? Enjoying Australia?""I'm taken aback of course. In the US I take a jog every morning, I wave to people, say ""Hi"" to them, but the majority of Americans just aren't friendly. Maybe its just where I live, but its quite bothersome. I feel my social interactiveness is limited here. BUT.. Whatever.Australia is the friendliest country I have been to, hopefully on my upcoming Europe trip the people will be just as nice!I would also like to add that Australia has very beautiful cities.. Brisbane and Sydney were my main attractionsCheck out the pics =]The captions don't seem to be working. =["
50,“Sydney Such a huge city but brilliant .....”,"I visited SYD around november time 2006. It was such a huge city , evey destination was a train or bus dride away. I was travelling alone , so i decided to stay at backpackers hostels . I enjoyed the experience of staying at these low budget accomodation , i also met some interesting people along the way. One of my favourite memories of SYD would have to be either the ' Blue mountains' Or just generally strolling around the busy streets of Sydney by the Opera House .Some really good beaches in Sydney i did the coastal walk which takes you from Bondi to Coogee beach . Do it on a cool day because it took me an hour halfor maybe bit more to walk .Any questions on hostels , bars etc let me know .Mike"
40,“Sydney”,A nice city though it reminds me of London as people seem to be racing around.The sites are great to see.Ive never seen so many Mc Donalds in a square mile like Sydney.
50,“First Stop Duwn Under”,"For first time travellers to 'The Land Down Under' Sydney is a must see destination. The city has so much to offer tourists with plenty of sight seeing - The Harbour Bridge and Opera House, shopping- The Rocks, plenty of museums and attractions- The Aquarium and lots lots more! The city is teeming with bars, resturants, clubs and nightlife.Chinatown and The Darling harbour are a must and no trip to Sydney is complete without a guided tour of the Opera House!For a once in a lifetime experience head to Sydney for New Years Eve and I can bet you've never see a fireworks display like this one!"
40,“Great Hotel in Sydney”,"The Establishment Hotel in The Rocks in Sydney was teriffic. Hard to find and minimalistic the rooms are comfortable and spacious, the baths are sensational with enormous showers with multiple shower heads and a seperate soaking tub. Lots of luxurious linen, great bedding, extremely accommodating staff. Very trendy and ideally located (once you find it). Avoid the fine dining restaurant upstairs, its over rated and VERY expensive. If you want a small luxury hotel in the middle of most everything this is it!"
50,“Stunning Sydney”,"Sydney is a dynamic and energetic city. Whether your time there is long or short there are many things to do - city walks, galleries and museums or just while away your time on one of the many beaches.The restaurant options are many and generally of a very high standard. Avoid the heavily touristed Darling Harbour and look in the more happening, Darlinghurst, Paddington and Surrey Hills. Lots of small restaurants with great atmosphere. These places are great for just a morning/ afternoon wander through the city.Watching the sunset from the Opera Bar at the Opera House is probably one of the most thrilling early evening drinks on the planet - you might just fall in love with this wonderful place."
50,“A must see place in the world!”,"There are no words to descirbe how absolutly breath taking Sydney is. When you go & see the Opera house and the bridge, it is so sureal you have to pinch yourself to believe you are there.Food & shopping is very cheap compared to England, we took about £1000 each for 2 weeks & came home with change.Bondi is a must visit, try out the ice bar with it's see level pool.Also to get fantastic views of Sydney, visit the rotating resteraunt in Australia Square. Best at dusk when the sun is setting....absoluetly breath taking."
50,"“Sydney, what a place!”","Sydney rates as one of the best places I have visited in my years of business and pleasure trips. I had five days to spend in Sydney and made the best of it taking in many attractions, sampling the local food etc. Sydney is a very cosmopolitan city, and very cultural. I chose to stay in Downtown Sydney. There is a strong Asian influence around the downtown core with many Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Japanese and Indonesian restaurants. You'll find other restaurants as well, Italian, Lebanese...Regarding attractions...Restaurants- For great seafood, try the eateries around Circular Quay. For Thai, Chinese or any other oriental fare, there are many to chose from all over Sydney. Try the sandwiches and pastries as well, they were the greatest.Sydney Opera House- An absolute stunning piece of building architecture. Take the tour and be even more amazed at the inner works of the Opera House where the symphonies play as well as the dance troups perform.Harbour Bridge Climb- Pricey but worth every penny, a well coordinated 3 hr climb to the top of the bridge, a stunning view of Sydney harbour, Circular Quay and the Sydney skyline. The climb is about 3 hours including about an hour of prepping for the climb. Safety is paramount on the climb with a variety of gear and equipment provided for the climb with climb orientations. The tour is guided by an experienced guide as one navigates up various catwalks to the summit of the bridge and down. It is at a reasonable pace, so those challenged healthwise should not have a problem. At the end of the climb, they give you a group picture and certificate to confirm you did the climb. Highly RecommendSydney Aquarium- A condensed version of aquatic exhibits, indigenous fish, snakes to Australia. Much like the aquariums at Seaworld. I suspect kids would enjoy it more than adults. Takes about an hour to navigate.Blue Mountain Day Tour- Wentworth Falls, Three Sisters and Bushwalk. Followed Frommers guide and used Oz Trek Tours, a no frills tour company. The guide was knowledgeable and knows alot about the area. The tour takes a full day and alot of time is spent in a bus getting to and from the various attractions. Once there, the bushwalk through the Blue Mountains was invigorating and provided spectacular views of the Mountains and Forest as we approached Wentworth Falls. This is a pretty good hike through the woods and steep climbing, so wear a good pair of hiking shoes, and make sure they are waterproof. If you are challenged healthwise you might have some issues with the bushwalk. The stop at Three Sisters provided a stunning view of naturally carved mountains. For $55, you couldn't do this tour much cheaper on your own. Highly recommend.National Maritime Museum- If you have never been inside a military submarine or Naval Destroyer, then take this tour. The tour is given by retired navy seaman and officers and very interesting.Australia Zoo- This zoo is in Beerwah, North of Brisbane and not near Sydney. Try Taroonga Zoo in Sydney, very positive reviews from people I talked to.The Australia Zoo was owned by the late Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, still owned and managed by his wife. It is a great zoo, with a variety of animals in a backdrop of natural habitat. Steve's influence and love of animals is all over this zoo. Lots of Koalas and Kangaroos, not to mention some pretty big crocodiles. Definitely worth a look if you are in the Brisbane area.Brisbane Whale Watching- An absolutely first class whale watching expedition. Kerri Lopes is the captain at the helm of her $3M Catamaran. It is obvious she's been in this business for many years and found us several groups of humpback whales to see around Fraser Island. The crew and Kerri make sure you have a good whale watching experience including a tastefully done lunch. They even offer sea sickness pills which were well worth the $1, the seas did get a little rough. Overall this is a great tour off the Sunshine Coast in Redcliffe, 30 minutes from Brisbane. They do offer hotel transfers if required.Travellers on a budget- Food and drink are not cheap in Australia. Sydney is no exception especially around attractions, Darling Harbour, Circular Quay. Accomodations are expensive around the Harbour, move a mile or so out of the harbours and the prices start to drop.Sydney has a great transit system and you can get day passes providing unlimited travel on buses, ferries and trains. Stock up on supplies at Woolworths, or IGAs, simple things like ready made sandwiches, bottled water will be half the price otherwise you will pay alot around the Harbour. Beware of convenience stores, I found it very odd that many of them had no prices marked on any of the goods which means they can charge you whatever they want.Internet Services- Bottomline, Internet use at hotels is outrageous. There are plenty of internet cafes, grocery stores offering walkup internet service at a fraction of what the hotels charge."
40,“Sydney Rocks!”,"My 2nd time in Sydney but it was different from my 1st time. Weather-wise, pretty hot (where was autumn?!) but it was gd cos swimming at Manly was greattt! water's soooo cold... brrrrh! but the waves were fantastic... big huge ones... caught some and did some body surfing, so fun!!Visited friends there too - everyone's just sooo nice! and warm and bright and so full of life!Sydney - I'll see you again - and that's a guarantee!! :D"
40,“Things to do in Sydney”,"If you are in Sydney may I reccomend the following low cost things to do;Get your orientation by taking the Sydney Explorer is soooo mainstream but it gives you a good luck around and helps you to get a feel for the city.Take 2 Ferry Rides.The Parramatta ferry which goes down the river to the city of Parramatta. It is a great ride and you get to see all the riverside suburbs from the ferry, great views and you see abit of where Sydney siders live. Great way to pass a few hours in the sun shine, take something to eat and drink.Take the ferry from circular key to Manley which has a great beach good waves and there is some cheap eats and ice cream if you want to do the whole day. Great views of the Harbour, the Bridge, Opera house etc from the boat and reminded me of getting on the Staten Island ferry in New York.Walk along the cliff top from Coodgee to Bondi or further if you are up to it. Amazing views we saw a whale less a 100 meters off shore and lots people with hot bodies struting and puffing their stuff which is allways amusing.In Coodgee there is great fish shop as you go up the hill to wards the Media Hotel and the city bus stop to get home, it is not your deep fried fish rubbish, take it to the beach or hang out and watch the people.If you are at the Bondi end Walk up Hall St a few hunderd meters and there is an internet cafe which has a fold up front window, have a coffee check out the people and use the intenet (with Hebrew key board if required).Walk up to the Art Gallery of NSW in the park and check out the great instalation by Lynn Onis an aborginal guy from Victoria.Cruise down King St in New Town in the evening, lots of cheap eats and funky cafes, get a bus from Central or ask a taxi driver to take you to where the cafes and resturants start. It is a pretty down beat looking area but the main road is safe it has that Venice LA or East village vibe.Eat what Aussies call iceypoles and hangout on the steps or walk way around the Opera House. Great views, if it is afternoon or evening you can get a beer in the open air bar under the walk way (the beer isnt over priced tourist trap stuff) looking over the harbour and circular key while writing post card, reading your book.Get a bottle of Australian Sparkling Wine and carton of fresh orange juice and a couple of glasses a few snacks (especially Australian cheese from Tasmania or king Island) and hit a park or beach and watch the sun come up or go down.The main thing is Sydney is to walk, walk every where ,you can it is pretty safe by international standards, down town has great maps. Common sence applies, espeically at night and of course Friday & Saturday evenings it can be tough to get a taxi if you are young and have a hair cut.Like I said, get take out food and sit around in some great parks like Elizbeth bay and watch the people and take it all in.China town is a dud, the Observatory Resturant yawn!! Blue Mountains in big coach AHHHH. Harbour cuises forget it get the public ferry and read the guide book, Darling Harbour fine bit or toursit trap, The Rocks ok a bit tourist good way to kick off, Opel shops think I would rather poke my eyes out ! Casino whoops washing my hair that night. Power House Musem, Ok for Australians but doesnt let you in on anything Australian. Jetboat ride my advice save it till you get to New Zealand.Other stuff, Fish Market and Paddies Market where good half day. Middle Eastern and Vietnamese Food was top stuff espeically if you can get out to right suburb . Canyoning in the Blue Mountians (if you do a tour of the mountians take a small company). If you have a car Royal National Park for the scenery, Palm Beach good national Park walk sensational beach ritzy looking houses and to see the Blue Mountians the drive along Bells Line of Road is worth it (cut across to Katoomba and and come back via the Western HWY). Allways use the orbital toll road for every thing around Sydney even though it doesnt look logical on the map. If you need a shopping fix go to the Queen Vic in the city or Bondi Junction if you want the Mall experience.Have a great time and guys Aussies swim between the flags on surf patrol beaches cause lots of people who dont drown every year and beware of the Sydney driver and anything that says authentic or real Aussie."
50,“Sydney!”,"Those who never see Australia miss a ton of excitement and one of the best vacation spots on the planet. And one of the jewels of Australia has to be Sydney.Although Sydney, much like any other large city that also functions as more than a tourist destination, is larger than a lot of places you might visit, it has to be one of the most laid back places I've ever seen - not laid back as in sloppy - just a place that recognizes people come there for a good time.Hats off to Qantas! From the moment you step on the plane, the flight attendants seem to anticipate your needs and are there before you can push the call button. The only down side to flying is it takes so damned long to get to Australia from LAX. However, Qantas feeds you well all through the flight. The GPS flight map is a wonderful creation - it keeps kids glued to the screen for hours watching the screens change and the plane move across the Pacific Ocean.One thing no one tells you is that unless you've done a lot of homework about the destination, you arrive with an information vacuum. If you check out what to do and what to see online, you'll find a dizzying array of things, all saying about the same thing. Although it costs AU$15, the Luxe City Guide - Sydney, available as a duty-free item on the plane, is a handy thing to have if you're not quite sure about things such as restaurants, shopping places, etc. The Luxe Guide lays it all out for you, with irreverance and humor, so you'll be ready to hit the town when you arrive, armed with the best information available. We used it constantly throughout the trip. It was worth the money.Upon arrival at Kingsford Smith Airport, the customs and imigration process isn't the pain you might expect it to be after 13 and a half hours on the plane. Once again, the Aussies seem to know that no one is feeling their best after the long flight and make the process as painless as possible - in and out quickly.The currency exchange is located just outside the customs area, before you leave the terminal. One of your first surprises is getting a handful of the Aussie plastic money - the only curency that can legally be laundered. One thing that was a surprise is that after 11 pm, there are no taxis waiting outside the terminal. There's a number posted on a sign to tell you where to call to get a taxi. That's a little silly, in my opinion, although I assumed it was because the late flight we arrived on from LAX was probably the last international flight of the day and the taxis simply shifted over to the domestic side. It's a little strange to see a city of 4 million+ sort of take a nap like that and have the transportation dry up. It also would've been very annoying if we got outside after the deadline and had to call someone after all that time spent to get there. Also, for those not used to a lot of huimidity, stepping outside the terminal will wilt your socks until you get used to it.Taxis have a bad rep and probably deservedly so. In the Luxe Guide, it warns that you have probably been in the country longer than your taxi driver. English did seem to be a challenge for the guy who drove us to the Marriott Sydney Harbour. First, it seems they offier you the chance to tell them which route you'd like to take. Those unfamiliar with the place may end up taking the long way to their destination if you answer incorrectly. Telling the driver to get you there using the quickest route seems to work best. It seems like common sense but why some folks arrive near midnight then end up going on a sightseeing tour in a taxi at night is beyond me. When we arrived at the Marriott, English was still a problem as I couldn't get the driver to take the tip I was offering. It may have something to do with the general lack of tipping prevalent in some areas. Although a lot of people don't expect tips, they'll gladly take them when offered. Many deserve the tip - but the jury's out on the taxi drivers falling into that category.The Marriott Sydney Harbour (as opposed to another Marriott several miles away) is a great place. It's right in the middle of the Central Business DIstrict and a couple of blocks away from Circular Quay and all the other great places to visit within very easy walking distance. Marriott Sydney Harbour has views of the harbour and famous Opera House from floors 18 and above. Those views are breathtaking and worth the extra money any day of the week. Better still, if you can afford to upgrade to the very top executive suites, the views are even better.Service generally in the Marriott Sydney Harbour is excellent. Housekeeping was particularly noteworthy. On the first night, we filled out a customer card that specified when we wanted the room to be done each day, as well as requests for things such as extra towels. Although we could've done this online ahead of time, it was good to see the housekeepers were interested in their guests and went way overboard to make sure we felt comfortable. They were quite pleasant conversationalists.The Opera-House-view room was large enough for the two of us, although I wasn't crazy about the idea of a water pot to heat water for instant coffee or tea. And, the use of the small containers of UHT milk could be scrapped and I doubt if anyone would complain. We chose to go to a convenience store for milk for the coffee. The in-room safe is a good idea as well.Brewed coffee, as it's known in the US, is a little hard to find. The emphasis seemed to be on what's called a ""flat white"" - a shot of espresso with steamed milk on top and a frothy milk head on top of that. Very good taste but expensive. Most places had the small cup for AU$6.50, or approximately US$5.10. They're very tasty but your tab at the end of a couple of hours can be huge if you drink a lot of them or have a large group. We met five other members of our extended family at the Marriott, so evenings downing flat whites got expensive - not to mention the caffeine jolt could result in sleep deprivation.Room service is good but pricey. For those who love hot showers - this is your place. You have to be careful when setting the water mix as the hot water meets or exceeds its description very easily.One annoying disappointment was the elevators. Marriott Sydney Harbour has five. Waiting for one seemed a national past time. In one case, while visiting part of the family on the 9th floor, a local power surge knocked out the elevators for so long, a hike from the 9th to the 24th floor was necessary but not pleasant. The Marriott stationed employees in the main lobby at the base of the elevators to welcome you on and off - which was a good touch - but the frustration of waiting to get an elevator sometimes made the touch useless.As you'd expect in a tourist city, there are many places that cater to you. We spent two weeks digging around to find those places mentioned in the Luxe Guide, but also those not well known. It was worth the effort, as prices dropped, service improved and we got a chance to spend time with locals.If you come on a longer trip & don't bring a lot of clothes, cleaning could be a problem. You may find places that do dry cleaning but not many that do laundry as well. It was a little disconcerting to hand over a few days worth of dirty underwear to complete strrangers but without it, we would've run out of clean clothes after the first week. And, believe me when I tell you, that no matter how careful you are while eating, something will always end up on your clothes. Just next door to Marriott Sydney Harbour is a large food and shopping court. At the base of the down escalator is a chemists shop (drug store). We never expected a chemists shop to process laundry and dry cleaning but they did and did it well. The name of the chemists shop escapes me now but it had a folding sign out in front, ""Maurice"", as the only advertising about the service. They charged by the bag. Large bags were AU$25 (US$19 and change); small bags around AU$10-15. You get them back by the next day laundered and folded & still warm. For families with small kids, this is a life saver. You can find laundromats out on the streets somewhere, and cheaper, but who wants to travel thousands of miles just to wash clothes? And carrying an extra 30 pounds of clothing isn't practical.The concierge, particularly Scott, was the best part of the service experience. They have many discounted coupons for the things you want to see or do so always check with them before you make a move outside the hotel. They saved us a ton of money.The Marriott Sydney Harbour restaurant, Icons, was expensive. One night the service was less than ideal. A quick word in the manager's ear resulted in very much reduced prices as a comp for less-than-perfect service. In our case, one of the waitresses took a large dessert order, then disappeared for 30 minutes. We had to get someone else to get the order for us.Eating outside is a large part of the vacation experience in Sydney. Pay close attention to the seagulls, pigeons and ravens. They're expert food thieves, especially if you let your guard down. So bold are they that if you leave the table for a second, they'll land on the table and help themselves to whatever you may've left unattended. The birds have everything timed so well and they're so smart, that while we were out on the harbour cruising, we saw none of them until the food was served. It's almost as if someone rang a dinner bell - the second it was served, the birds started circling. Being victimized by the wildlife takes a little getting used to.Flies were a bigger nuisance than the birds. These aren't common houseflies. They are more agressive than the birds - and they bite. Rumor had it we saw more of them because the time we were there was during a two-week bout of wildfires in the local bush, driving the flies out towards the coast. I don't know if that rumor was true but it seemed to make sense.Local tours were great! The best one we found that didn't take you a long way away was the Captain Cook Morning Coffee tour. It costs AU$44 (US$34.50) for a three-plus hour tour of the harbor areas out to the lands end just before you hit the Pacific Ocean. Compared to similar tours around Sydney, this was the best. With the Marriott Sydney Harbour being next to Circular Quay, getting on and off ferries and cruise ships was a breeze and the kids will love it.Along the wharf, from the Opera House all the way around the quay to The Rocks, you'll find street merchants and performers trying to make a living. On The Rocks side of the quay, a performer has a soap bubble display that just keeps the kids riveted. He has a large, flat tub of soap with at least two large circular rods he dips in the mixture. Once he lifts the rods, the wind does the rest and produces huge soap bubbles that last forever. One of the treats for kids is standing inside one of his bubbles for a few seconds. He works for tips and deserves them - a good entertainer. In Sydney, many what I would call ""homeless"" people actually work or perform along the quay, doing anything to make a dollar. Some, such as the street artists, are very talented people and worthy of a decent tip. One of the fascinations is the display of native Aborigine music and folk art. Every time they set up to play the didgeridoos, large crowds followed. Not to miss the chance at a sale, about half way through the performance, the natives bring out the stock of CDs produced with their music.Even with the wildfires, we took a day tour to the Blue Mountains. Considering we couldn't enter some of the areas because of the danger, it was a great tour. There are several available but the tour with a company called Dal Myles was the best. The concierge can book it for you. If you get a chance, ask to have the tour guide David or Lindsey guide your tour. They have the banter you expect for tour guides but these are genuinely nice guys, who made the trip a lot more personal - and worthwhile - than any other tour we took. The tour costs AU$165 (US$130) per adult and around AU$80 for kids, with really young kids taken free, if I recall, and had a stop in a park area where the tour guide served champagne, orange juice, or water.There are ample currency exchanges and ATMS around Sydney if you need them, with one exchange right across the street from Marriott Sydney Harbor, in a convenience store. Shop around because some exchanges give you more for your money than others.Shopping is close and plentiful. The Pitt Street Market, about 3/4 of a mile straight south down Pitt Street from the hotel has plenty from which to choose. Also, on weekends at The Rocks (a historical area next to Circular Quay), a few of the streets are closed down so they can set up tent booths to sell all kinds of goods. One of the booths you absolutely have to visit is The Chilli Factory. The gentleman running the booth has sauces of all different kinds from the mild chilli honey mustard sauce, to the stuff so hot people had to sit down after tasting it. We tasted and bought the mild honey mustard sauce. You won't believe the flavor of this stuff, regardless of how hot or mild you like it. Don't miss the chance to taste the variety of sauces he has - you'll buy a bunch to take home or end up using his web site to order. But that doesn't allow you to taste it for yourself - they're that good.The Sydney Aquarium and Taronga Zoo tours were great for kids. The Blue Mountains tour with Dal Myles also takes you to an exclusive breakfast at the Featherdale Wildlife Park as part of the tour. Here's where the kids have a field day up close and personal with koalas, kangaroos and a multitude of other wildlife. The breakfast is on the order of a continental breakfast with extras of ham, cheese, strawberries, etc. What made it so great was that this is an exclusive breakfast to Dal Myles and Featherdale and is was good to be able to eat and check out the wildlife as a private party rather than have to do so with a gaggle of others. We had nine in our party and it was outstanding.The Sydney Harbour Bridge climb is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It costs AU$139 (US$109) but was worth it - as long as you don't have a fear of heights. At nearly 500 feet, it's a thrill. A lot of people climb it precisely because they wish to get over their fear of heights, and people of all ages made the climb. They make sure it's safe for all. They give you a breath test first to make sure you're sober. Then, after a briefing, you put on a thin rubber suit over your clothes and tether yourself to a static line that's your lifeline all the way up and down the bridge. On a hot, windless day, you'll sweat buckets but it's still a thrill - don't miss it!The famous Bondi Beach is close by. Although the Aussies spend much time and money putting up shark netting to keep swimmers safe, you'll probably see some buckethead outside the nets, advertising him/herself as a menu item. Some areas have a fair few jellyfish as well, so swim with caution.For those who like Starbucks, one is available near the hotel, across from the wharf. But, save your money on this one - the service and quality are both poor.In summary, we spent the best two weeks of our lives in Sydney and probably never scratched the surface of what's available. Would we go back? In a heartbeat and plan to do so at the earliest opportunity!"
50,“Sydney –Once is not enough”,"We just returned after a five day vacation from Sydney and here is my little feedback for TA forum members and visitors, if it can help.First thanks a million to the TA forum, without which we wouldn't have been able to draw up my day-to-day plan and followed it without a flaw.Day1: Paddington Market- Circular Quay- Opera House- Town Hall- QVB.We arrived on a Friday night (Taxi from airport to George street , near Capitol theatre- AUS$33) so after a night's rest we headed first to Paddington Saturday market (Bus no 378 -$1.70 each). The weather was just cool so we enjoyed walking almost the length of Oxford Street taking in the boulevard's fashion scenario.The market at the Church grounds was a visual treat. Leaving aside the usual cloth and nick-nack stalls, the place is an art lover's favourite. Fabric paintings, water colours, stone paintings, hand made jewellery, metal sculptures, curios - a veritable feast!Circular Quay- spend time watching aborigines play their traditional music from long wooden pipe, a cycle acrobat, etc. and then walked up to Sydney's icon- The Opera House. Took several pictures and then enjoyed a nice mocha coffee while watching another icon- the Harbour Bridge against the back drop of pregnant clouds. The weather became cooler (we didn't take our woollens that evening) and started drizzling so took the train at the Circular Quay train station to reach Town Hall. Went inside Queen Victoria Building – an amazing architecture. The DarryllLea chocolate shop is a must –try the marshmallow chocos – delicious! My wife and daughter found Equip- a little women's accessory shop - great and bought quite a few! Woolworth supermarket at Town Hall - you get everything you want - snacks, ready-to-eat, noodles, bread, groceries, fresh fruits, etc. We found even some Arabic bread!Day 2: Bridge walk- The Rocks- George street- Paddy's market (Market City)- China town.One of the best days in our trip. The morning was slightly cloudy. Took a day tripper pass from the Central station ($15.40 each) – just two blocks away from our apt.- and went Town Hall- to Milson's point. Got down and took the steps outside the station to walk back on the bridge. A must–do for any Sydney visitor. No cost and superb views and a chance to appreciate the gargantuan size of the bridge in close proximity. As we walked closer to the other end of the bridge the clouds cleared and the sun was shining magnificently on the white roofs of Opera House.. what a photo opportunity! The walk led us to The Rocks and we were twice lucky as the Rocks market is open only on Sats and Sundays. Colourful, bubbly and a bit of touristy yet very interesting.(We bought an authentic Boomerang –made by an aborigine family(so they claim)Took the bus to Market City just a block away from our apt. The famous Paddy's market is at the ground level - an interesting mix of hundreds of souvenir shops- selling Australian souvenirs made in China!Do visit the factory outlets at the 2nd level, you might get some lucky sizes and designs! Wide variety and good price and quality too. It is a pity they all close early 6.30-7pm. max. and is crowded in the evenings.Dinner from a china town restaurant.Day3: Darling Harbour- Aquarium- IMAX- Harbourside Mall- Sydney Tower-Oztrek- Pitt Street Mall- Myers.Another good day. We bought a combination ticket for Aquarium plus Sydney Tower that saved us 30%. Aquarium was great, especially the sharks bay, and we were at a right time when they were feeding the sharks! IMAX is another experience by itself though we have seen one in Singapore some years back.Reached the tower at around 5.30 pm and lucky we were as we could see Sydney in daylight, catch some fantastic shots of sunset little later and see Sydney coming alive with evening lights. I would recommend visitors to choose this time. Be there little early to join the queue to the lift so that you get to the top at the right time. (The Tower glass panels need cleaning sooner than later.)Pitt Street Mall is very classic and Myers have already put up a giant, beautiful Xmas tree!Day 4: Day trip to Blue Mountains: From Central Station to Katoomba – took the off peak 8.24 train (three tickets return just $48.50). Went up to the Trolley Bus shop and the girl at the shop was very helpful who suggested that we take a $38 ticket that included all three trips in Scenic World plus the trolleybus tour. The five minute cableway, skyway and sky train are a bit disappointing when compared to Switzerland's more dramatic rides over the Alps, but then this is no Swiss. The rainforest walk is quite refreshing and not challenging at all. The shops at the cable car stations had surprisingly impressive range of souvenirs – Opals, iron ore jewellery, etc. we bought some and the price is OK given the place it is sold. We stopped at Leura and at the Echo point, not in other waterfall view stops as the Trolley Bus driver said there was just a trickle in the waterfalls. The Echo Point is dramatic and way back surprisingly, we saw quite a few lodging houses nearby, with vacancies as low as AUS$60PP!Day5: Private visit to Univ. Wollongong and afternoon to Manly BeachTook an early train to Univ. of Wollongong - a very scenic ride on the pacific coast -particularly near Scarborough station from where we could see a viewing platform on the coastal road - offering awesome views of the Pacific Ocean. The road is even closer to the shore than the rail track and I am sure the views will be even more fantastic. I don't remember to have seen anything on this in TA forum- may be I missed it)If any one missed Spit-bridge Manly Walk, the Corso- Shelley beach walk via Manly life saving club is a good option- we did it as guided by the forum. If you are at dusk it is even better – I had some beer on way back while enjoying the nice views – evening walkers, cyclists, beach sports, etc. The return journey was worth a million- as the ferry approaches Sydney- the flood lit Opera House, the Bridge and the harbour side Sydney skyscrapers - all glittering in glory with millions of lights against dark clouds. A sight not to be missed at all.Day6: Toranga Zoo, last minute shopping and departure. Our final day. The Zoo is great with a nice map and a complimentary Sydney Herald given to you on arrival. After a bit of tour we were in time to see the Seal show around 1pm, I think. Did some last minute shopping at Paddy's market - souvenirs for people back home and then… to airport (AUS$28 from Pacific Apt ).We knew we missed out several things but promised ourselves to come back because Sydney-Once is not enough."
50,“Getting around with a broken foot”,"Yes it can be done,but with difficulty.We were lucky to be staying with friends so saw more of the places than we would have done on our own.Drive to Watson Bay for fantastic views and a goanna walking over your feet.Use the local transport.We stayed about 45 mins out of town so got a daily travel pass for $15 which was good for trains buses and ferries.The ferries are a great way to get around,it's a massive harbour with lots of places/beaches to visit.Take the Harbour Tour with Captain Cook,excellent value.Sit on the Quay to people watch and be entertained by buskers.We saw the Queen !!!Visit the Aquarium,not usually my scene but set out and managed beautifully.Have a ""lift"" Tour at the Opera House.If you have any walking probs,just ask at the desk,same price.There were 4 in our group and we just popped in and out of lifts to get to next level..easy on the legs and we got to see a lot more backstage areas.The normal tour consisted of about 25 people,rushing to keep up with the guide as she climbed the 200 steps inside and straining to hear what she was saying...no contest.See Sydney at night,especially around the Harbour.Have coffee and cake at the Intercontinental. We arrived to a barrage of FBI /police/helicopter/activity, How were we to know Ms Rice was staying upstairs??Spend the day in the Blue Mountains,you need a sunny day though to see the ""blue"".Scare yourself to death with a ride on the Mountain Devil at Katoomba.Lots more to do and see but enough for my poor foot.I did see a podiatrist re foot,(worth every cent) it puts our Health service to shame."
40,“Sydney Underground”,"Don't forget to check out Sydney's UndergroundFor Shopping, the lower level of Queen Victoria Building (QVB) houses Victoria's Basement, a great bargain hunter's heaven.From the lower levels of Sydney's train stations you can find a maze of corridors that house shopping, wonderful eateries, food shops, flower stands and services like laundry and dry cleaning, wine shops etc. Go explore!"
50,“Fun Down Under”,"My family and I recently returned from a trip to Sydney, Australia. When I mention Australia to friends the first thing they say is what a long flight. This is the truth, coming from New York we were flying for about 24 hours. Once we landed in Sydney, I quickly discovered it was well worth the long flight. With only a few days to enjoy the city before embarking on a cruise to Auckland, New Zealand my family of six were extremely busy.We stayed in a division of the Southern Cross Hotel Chain. It was perfect for a six-person family as we had an apartment with a gorgeous view of Chinatown and Darling Harbor (Two of the many must see destinations in Sydney).The best way to determine where to visit in Sydney is to examine the entire city at once. Impossible you say, not when you can climb the infamous Sydney Harbor Bridge. Through the catwalks and stairs my whole family climbed up and back pausing for gorgeous views of the entire city of Sydney along the way. This is a great family activity for families where all members are above the minimum age of 13. My mom was incredibly scared, but the safety is unlike anything I have ever seen. We were harnessed in and it would have been impossible to fall. They even had a practice run on a catwalk 5 feet above the ground and a Breathalyzer test was mandatory. The view of Sydney Harbor, the Sydney skyline and the Sydney Opera is unparallel, especially at dusk with the sun setting in the background. Dusk or dawn is the optimal time to climb the bridge, the tours are offered 24 hours a day with lights attached to your helmet for night tours. It is by far the most amazing and number one attraction in all of Australia.I mention the Opera House, another must see, mainly from the outside, the inside is well decorated, but nothing amazing. The Sydney Opera House is known for its parabola or sail design as it rises over the very busy Sydney Harbor. The outside is covered with two different shades of white tiles in order to appear glamorous at all times of the day with sunlight from all directions. Besides up close, the best place to take pictures of the Opera House is from the ferries that run through Sydney Harbor (see pictures). Ferries run from Circular Quay to the popular destinations of Bondi and Manly beach, and the Taronga Zoo.Speaking of beaches, Manly and Bondi Beaches are the two most gorgeous beaches in the South Pacific. The water is crystal clear with beautiful waves. And although no one in my family is a surfer, it was clearly the activity of choice when we were there. Certainly worth the ferry ride and scenic trip.While you are at Circular Quay going to the beaches, the other destination accessible by ferry is the Taronga Zoo. I highly recommend the private tour where they show you behind the scenes of all the native Australian animals. We were able to pet wombats, koalas and kangaroos as well as soak up information from the knowledgeable tour guides. A tour is really the only way to properly experience the Taronga Zoo.Another important stop is the Sydney Aquarium in Darling Harbor where you can go under the tanks of water to see all the marine life. You can even find Nemo and all his friend’s as they are all Australian fish. (There is a special Finding Nemo exhibit at the aquarium that was thoroughly enjoyed by all members of the family).So now that the touring is over, it is time to shop and eat. We found great shopping at the Queen Victoria Building, essentially a mall. They also had great food, but by far the best food can be found around Darling Harbor. All the restaurants have outdoor seating, which is optimal for the summer weather they were experiencing. For a quick bite to eat during the day, a stop at Harry’s Carte de Wheels is essential for the best potpies in the world. All in all, the food was great, be adventurous, I tried kangaroo and alligator for the first time and they were delicious. Go for it, your down under.Other famous attractions include the Botanical Gardens, Chinatown, the Sydney Olympic Park and local nightclubs. With so much to see and do in Sydney much more time was needed than the few days we allotted. Plan to spend at least a week or two in Sydney to truly enjoy the city for all she is worth.The best way to quantify our trip to Sydney, Australia is that when I look back there is nothing that anyone in my family would change. It is the perfect city for people of all ages. And above all, the people are some of the nicest in the world. I can’t think of a better place to vacation than Sydney, Australia."
50,“Enjoyed your hospitality”,"We, my youngest son and myself visited Sydney last year and found Sydney a very clean, thriving city (and Australia). We were impressed by the punctual public train, bus and ferry service (so was Qantas). We moved about not like a tourist, more like a Sydneysider. The places we stayed in were reasonable priced, very clean with a friendly service.We have not found anything to criticise in Australia (we weren't looking for either), but can recommend it only in the highest terms. In three weeks I took some 3525 photos!!! If you go there as a guest, behave like a guest and you will find it to be one of the finest countries in this world with the nicest people. I found some ""mates""."
40,"“Woolloomooloo, I miss you...”","While travelling in Australia, Me and my companion decided to stay a while on Cathedral Street in Woolloomooloo. Although it's sandwiched between the bustling city centre and crazy King's Cross, Woolloomooloo maintains a laid-back, community feel. There's some great walking to be had, especially near the wharf. A stop at Harry's Cafe de Wheels for a pie is a must. And for entertainment, the Fitzroy (at the top of Cathedral Street) hosts regular table quizes, serves great food, and has an atmosphere that both welcomes and warms. There may be homeless people nestled beneath the bridge, but even these guys are amiable and always have a smile and a wave. Finally, we could not last a day without a trip to our local store - Nick's til Midnight. These guys will entertain you with jokes, crawl into the freezer to get you the cold beer, and just generally make you feel at home. Woolloomooloo is small town friendliness in a big city and a great base for a stay in Sydney."
50,“Viagem a Sydney”,"Cidade fabulosa, para um Português fica no outro lado do mundo, e + 24 horas de voo para lá chegar....No entanto recomendo vivamente uma visita a essa cidade, limpa, paisagens fabulosas, pessoas felizes, grande nivel de vida, crise nem vela.... população local, muito simpatica, bonita, um verdadeiro espectaculo.."
50,“conjunción de culturas en una bellísima y moderna ciudad”,"Si me preguntan cuál es la comida típica de Sydney , tengo que decirles la comida que se come en todo el mundo , cómo es la cultura y sus costumbres ? , la de todo el mundo . Pocas ciudades deben tener esta particularidad . Por haber sido formada por inmigrantes de todo el mundo , cada uno preservó su cultura y se la respeta por sobre todas las cosas . Eso se vislumbra en los restaurantes , la ropa , las construcciones , la decoración . Es una ciudad digna de visitar , moderna , pujante , de gente tranquila y despreocupada , que trabajan con la certeza de que tienen resuelto el problerma económico , educativo , sanitario y social . Como diría Joan Manuel Serrat "" un país civilizado es aquel que cuida de sus locos , de sus niños y de sus viejos"" , así es Sydney y Australia en general . Vale la pena visitar ( dan ganas de quedarse a vivir ahí)"
40,“Sydney una ciudad Sensacional”,"Una ciudad tan Sensacional como lo es Sydney, la casa de la Opera de Sydney es un icono de la humanidad, al lado del Puente de Puerto o Puente del Perchero (Sydney Harbour Bridge), sobre una de las bahías más hermosas del mundo rigurosamente cuidada por siglos por los urbanistas que han mantenido la armonía de su conjunto, tiene tantos atractivos como son: muchos museos; los Jardines Botánicos Reales; el centro financiero (nuestro hotel el Marriott Sydney Harbour at Circular Quay queda aquí, sobre Pitt Street, una de las siete calles más costosas del mundo); el parque nacional de la Bahia; el observatorio de Sydney con un telescolpio del siglo XVII; el mercado de Paddys Market (turistas comprando souvenirs); la torre de Sydney de 304 mts; el edificio del Parlamento; la Biblioteca del estado de nueva Gales del Sur; la Catedral de Saint Mary (la mayor de Australia y sede del arzobispado); el edificio del Ayuntamiento; el Edificio Reina Victoria, construido como mercado de productos frescos (hagan de cuenta Barranquillita) en 1.893, es hoy uno del los centros comerciales más exclusivos y caros del mundo; el Monoriel; El Acuario, y tantos atractivos mas como Manly (a siete millas de Sydney y a miles de millas de las preocupaciones, un viejo slogan que aplicaba cuando no había Internet)."
50,“Zwischen George Street und Chinatown”,"Zuletzt waren wir Anfang 2011 in Sydney. Wie beim letzten Aufenthalt 2010 haben wir erneut im Hilton Sydney gewohnt. Das Hotel ist direkt an der George Street.Die George Street ist eine Einkaufsmeile im CBD von Sydney. Sie nimmt ihren Ausgang an den Rocks und reicht bis zum Hauptbahnhof.Die Straße besitzt Sehenswürdigkeiten wie beispielsweise Chinatown, der Cinema District, das Rathaus, Sankt Andreas oder das Queen Victoria Building Einkaufszentrum.Letzteres konnten wir noch Ende 2010 mit einem großen, silber geschmückten Weihnachtsbaum erleben. Dieser Baum ist so voluminös, dass er bis fast an die Decke reichte. Es war schon dunkel. Wie waren unsicher, ob wir Fotos machen durften. Deshalb fragten wir die Security. Der Mann gab sein OK:Untertags ist im Queen Victoria Building einiges los. Der Durchgang ist vollgepfropft mit Leuten, die sich alle möglichen Geschäfte geben wollen.An der Seite findet sich ein königlicher Brunnen mit Hund.Was man sich eher abends, denn tags geben sollte ist die Town Hall. Ich weiß zwar nicht, ob sie das ganze Jahr angestrahlt wird, aber um den Jahreswechsel herum ist das ein Erlebnis. Das Gebäude wechselt mehrmals die Farbe.Die Andreas Kathedrale daneben besticht in ihrem Gemeinderaum durch mannigfaltige Buntglasfenster. Bei günstigem Lichteinfall wirkt es ganz toll. Da sieht man die Farben am Steinboden.Gegenüber der Kirche ist der einzig große Supermarkt. Der ist dreistöckige und bietet alles von Lebensmitteln bis Bekleidung. Der hat Sonntags nicht geschlossen.Schräg gegenüber ist der einzige KFC der George Street. Der ist etwas eng angelegt und schlängelt sich über Wendeltreppen nach oben. Das Essen ist gut. Es gibt aber bessere Filialen. Wem das nicht schmeckt, der kann zum Mc Donalds. Der ist etwas abwärts die Straße und hat nachts offen. Der Laden ist meiner Meinung nach attraktiver und sauberer.In diesem Abschnitt sind dann Bars, Kneipen und Malls. Einkaufen kann man dort nichts schlecht. Ebenso wird man auf die Kreuzung der Sydney Monrail stoßen.Was mich stark irritiert hat war folgendes. Viele Lokale bezeichnen sich als Hotel. In wenigen davon kann man dann übernachten. Partiell waren sie früher Hotels und haben den Beherbergungsbetrieb eingestellt. Also aufgepasst, Hotel ist NICHT gleich Hotel in Australien.Die 1889 eröffnete Straßenbahn wurde leider 1959 durch ein Busnetz ersetzt. Heute sieht man da öfters den doppelstöckigen Sightseeingbus. Leute, was ganz wichtig ist. Auf der George Street fährt ein grüner Gratisbus. So ab 9 bis ca. 20 Uhr gelangt man vom Bahnhof bis zum Circular Quay. Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass die Fahrscheine für den öffentlichen Verkehr nicht billig sind, ist das eine gute Alternative.Am unteren Ende liegt Chinatown. Die ist ziemlich kommerzialisiert. Der Großteil hat dann aber mit der George Street weniger zu tun. Am oberen Ende geht die George Street in das Viertel the Rocks über. Das ist fürs Ausgehen und die Architektur berühmt. Von dort ist es zur Sydney Harbor Bridge nicht mehr weit."
50,“la più bella città al mondo”,"consiglio a tutti di visitare almeno una volta nella vita l australia e ovviamente Sydney, bellissima con i suoi parchi verdissimi, la sua luce fantastica e naturalmente una delle baie piu belle al mondo.se vi trovate ad Hide park la sera dopo le 11 buttate un occhio sugli alberi per vedere gli opossum che vagano tra i rami in cerca di cibo"

50,“Hier würd ich bleiben”,"Ich habe schon eine Menge Städte auf der Welt gesehen. Einige fand ich schön, einige fand ich weniger schön.Sydney ist bisher die einzige Stadt, bei der ich mir ernsthaft vorstellen könnte dort zu leben. Die Atmosphäre ist einzigartig. Die Lebensart der Sydneysider auch. Hier fühlt man sich gleich zuhause. Die Lage am Meer, der Hafen die Oper.Sydney ist wirklich etwas ganz besonderes."
50,“Superschön”,"Wir kamen am 31. Dezember an, direkt vor dem Silvesterfeuerwerk. Die Stadt ist mit der Oper einfach traumhaft. Unbedingt sollte man in den Zoo gehen, welcher mega schön gelegen ist. Von dort aus hat man eine super Sicht auf die Stadt. Ebenso ist Bondi Beach super!"
50,“Sydneyでのんびり”,AustraliaのSydneyは青空が似合う港町です。Sydney湾は世界3大美港の一つでまるで絵葉書のようです！オペラハウスとハーバーブリッジを眺めながら公園の芝生でのんびり過ごす時間は最高です。日本とは時間の流れ方が違います。芝生でTake awayしたランチを食べながら海を見てのんびりしていると、本当にリフレッシュできます。1年に1度は1ヶ月ぐらい滞在しますが、その時間は私にとって貴重な時です。
50,“Faszinierendste Stadt Australiens”,"In Sydney kann und sollte man sich gut und gerne eine Woche Zeit nehmen, um zumindest die wichtigsten Punkte besuchen zu können, dazu gehören der Hafen mit dem Opera House (unbedingt auch ´mal eine Fähre nehmen z.B. für eine Hafenrundfahrt, nach Manly, zum Olympiapark oder zum Zoo), denn vom Wasser aus sieht man Sydney am besten. Der Zoo ist toll, typische austalische Tiere (Känguru und Koala) kann man anfassen und streicheln. Manly und Bondi haben tolle Strände, zudem kann man Bondi auch super und ünstig per Bus (ab Hafen) erreichen, von dort aus kann man auf Wanderwegen auch an der Küste entlang laufen oder baden. Bei einem Sydneyaufenthalt unbedingt ein Hotel nahe der Oper im alten teil Sydneys reservieren, das ist der beste Ausgangspunkt."
40,“La città Australiana per eccellenza”,"Ma che bella città!! Ho avuto la fortuna di trascorrere 2 settimane ""down under"" Il centro si sviluppa su una baia universalmente conosciuta per la sagoma dell'Opera House e del ponte di ferro alle sue spalle. La città alterna grattacieli a palazzi dell' 800 risalenti all'epoca coloniale. Bellissime le sue spiagge Bondi o Coogee che distano 20 minuti di autobus dal centro. E poi l'oceano.....un esperienza da fare ma avendo almeno 3 settimane di tempo per ammortizzare il costo del biglietto aereo."

50,“großartige Stadt!”,"Sydney ist eine wunderschöne Stadt, die auch einfach und stressfrei zu bereisen ist. Ausflugsziele gibt es in und um Sydney zahlreiche. Neben den bekannten Zielen, wie z.B. der Harbour Bridge und dem Opernhaus, sollte man auch den Sydney Tower besuchen. Zwar ist der Eintritt nicht ganz billig, dafür bekommt man aber einen atemberaubendem Blick über Sydney und das Umland geboten. Außerdem lohnt eine Hafenrundfahrt, bei der alle bekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten vom Wasser aus einer anderen Perspektive betrachtet werden können. Und das Beste an Sydney ist das Wetter, so hat man fast schon eine Schönwettergarantie!"
40,“La spiaggia di Sydney”,"Se dopo aver visitato tutti i monumenti che la città di Sydney offre volete una vera pausa, farvi un tuffo non è così difficile ed è più vicino di quanto si possa pensare. Vi consiglio Bondi beach; potete raggiungerla in autobus, partendo da una delle principali fermate del centro; trovare il bus giusto è facile: in testa al mezzo sul display compare proprio la scritta Bondi! Il costo del biglietto è minimo ed in mezz'ora vi troverete in spiaggia. Attenzione però: le spiagge australiane non sono attrezzate ed il sole è davvero cocente. Non appena arrivate mettetevi in fila al chiosco del noleggio e fatevi dare un ombrellone (non ce ne sono mai abbastanza!), l'ombra è necessaria quanto una buona crema solare (almeno protezione 30). La spiaggia è pulita e l'acqua è cristallina: non vi resta che farvi un bel bagno!"
50,“Da sogno”,"Bellissima citta' su una altrettanto invidiabile baia. Obbligatorie la visita all' Opera House, ai giardini adiacenti e a The rocks. Per i piu' spericolati, la salita sul Harbor Bridge. Da stare almeno un giorno completo a Bondi beach cavalcando le onde."
50,“THE シドニー”,様々な人種が生活をしている大都会シドニー。古い街並みも残っており、ぜひ、住んでみたいと思わせる街だった。そしてなんといっても、オペラハウスは圧巻。テレビで良く見る景色を生で見たときは感動すると思います。オペラハウスの奥にハーバーブリッジという風景。豆知識としてですが、オーストラリアではお金持ちの家系はずっとお金持ちらしい。それは、相続税がないかららしいです。資産運用をして、毎日遊んで暮らしている人たちがいるってガイドさんが言ってました。

Ma non mi sono dimenticata, già che c'ero, di andare anche a gustarmi il sole a Bondi (e per arrivarci basta prendere il bus. 38) , E l'Opera house con tutte le sue ""vele"" spiegate, preda del vento. il centro di sidney è un groviglio di strade (comunque ampie) e di accenti diversi...ho sentito anche il siciliano ed il veneto...nel mercato cinese ho comprato di tutto comprese tre parrucche: una viola, una blu, una rossa...un giorno quando diventerò calva le metterò ricordando il mio splendido viaggio in australia"
50,“ロックス”,１２月初めのシドニーは、とても過ごしやすい季節だった。自然と都市が、うまく融合していて綺麗な都市である。人々は、とてもフレンドリーで、少し英語が話せるだけで、十分過ごしていける気がする。郊外に出るには車が必要だが、日本と同じ左側通行で、戸惑うこともない。街中なら、降りる場所を注意する必要はあるがバスが便利。最低限の海外だという注意は必要だが、治安には問題がない。ここは、団体旅行より、ゆっくり個人旅行で来て、周辺の都市を回るのが向いている。
50,“eine der schönsten Städte der Welt”,"Sydney ist für mich eine der schönsten Städte der Welt. Ich hatte mir die Stadt irgendwie anders vorgestellt. Vom Stadtbild gleicht Sydney weder einer europäischen, noch einer amerikanischen Stadt. Die Lage der Sadt ist ein Traum. Es gibt viele Parks und Grünflächen zum relaxen. Auch zwei Stadtstrände sorgen für Entspannung. Obwohl der Bondi beach an einem Sonntag ein wenig an einen Adriastrand a la Bibione erinnert. Sehenswürdigkeit sind vor allem die Harbour bridge, das Opera house und der Hafen. Es gibt viele Restaurants die durch die Bank günstig sind. Einzig vom Nachtleben war ich ein wenig enttäuscht. Im King´s cross reihen sich Nachtclubs, Bordelle und Striplokale aneinander. Das Publikum ist entsprechend. Es gibt viel Krawall. Auf der Oxford street kommen Leute vom anderen Ufer auf ihre Rechnung. Es empfiehlt sich, Sydneys Umland mit dem Auto zu erkunden. Nur so hat man den besten Ausblick auf die Stadt. Eine Schiffsrundfahrt tuts allerdings auch."

50,“Tolle Stadt”,"Diese Stadt hat für mich wirklich alle Erwartungen erfüllt und sogar noch übertroffen.Alleine das Hafen-Panorama - einzigartig. Aber auch einfach nur durch diese Stadt zu schlendern und die einzigartige Atmosphäre aufzusaugen, ist den langen Flug dorthin wert."

I panorami mozzafiato e le onde dell'Australia ti ricordano davvero di essere dall'altra parte del mondo, lontano dalla solita quotidianità.

50,“シドニー市内観光”,シドニー市内はバスでの観光がお勧めです。地下鉄もありますが、あまり便利とは言えません。バスの中でも、無料循環バスは最も効率よく観光地を回れます。緑色のシャトルバスで、No＝５５５です。主なバス停は空港などでもらえる観光ガイドに乗っていますが、サーキュラーキー（始発、終点）とチャイナタウンを結ぶ、右回りと左回りの２路線です。運転間隔は５～１０分程度、運行時間は曜日で異なるので、５５５用のバス停で確認下さい。
50,“Sydney -my favourite in Australia!”,"Welch eine aufgerende Stadt!! Zum ersten Mal am anderen Ende der Welt, `down under` , und ich bin überwältigt! Mit der Fähre von Neutral Bay aus nähere ich mich downtown und er- blicke gleich hinter der nächsten Bucht bei der Einfahrt in den Hafen das Opera House, wie es wie ein Segelschiff mit geblähten Segeln auf dem Wasser zu liegen scheint. Am Circular Quay steigen wir aus und es empfiehlt sich, gleich als erstes zum Opera House zu spazieren, sich die Geschäfte auf der rechten Seite anzusehen- immer `sale`- und die Oper aufzusuchen. Möglichst auch gleich Karten für eine Aufführung zu kaufen. Einen Blick auf die Harbour Bridge zu werfen und zu entscheiden, ob man den `Bridge Climb`wagen will. Wenn nicht, ein Spaziergang im Royal Botanical Garden, u. a. mit einem Baum, den hunderte von Fledermäusen als Tagesschlafquartier gewählt haben, oder bis mittags einen kostenlosen Besuch im Government House unternehmen.Auf jeden Fall müssen auch einige Stunden für das shopping, z.B. im Victoria Building, reserviert werden. Speisen kann man dann auf dem Rückweg wunderbar am Overseas Passenger Terminal mit Blick auf das Opera House."
40,"“Klasse Location, aber es reichen zwei Tage”","Klasse Location, aber es reichen zwei Tagebei unserem Australientrip haben wir zwei Tage in Sydey verbracht. Für eine Abstecher in die Blue Mountains hat es nicht gereicht.Ein unbedingtes muss ist Opera, Bondi Beach, Harbour Bridge, The Rocks und der hafen.Zu emfhelen ist die red line und die blue line . mit diesem bus kann man eigentlich ganz sysdey sehr schnell in einem tag besuchen.uns haben zwei tage gereicht."
50,“Sydney - Relaxing Pur”,"Obwohl Sydney die größte Stadt Australiens ist, hat man nie den Eindruck, dass zu viele Menschen in der Stadt leben, wie bspw in New York oder Moskau. Mit einem entspannten Spaziergang im Darlling Harbour-Viertel kann man jeden Abend ausklingen lassen und ist immer wieder fasziniert von dieser Stadt auch ohne Harbour Bridge und Oper. Aber letztgenannte gehören natürlich auch zum kompletten Programm und auch hier wirkt es nie übervoll, trotz Hauptreisezeit Anfang Januar. Alles in allem eine rundum gelungene Stadt, sie man sehr gut mit dem iVenture Sydney Pass für 7 Tage erkunden kann in Kombination mit einem Wochenpass für alle öffentlichen Transportmittel inkl Fähren (manly ist ein Muss)"
50,"“""Venezia DOWN UNDER""”","Wo der Parramatta River sich in Ausläufern und Buchten verzweigt, bevor er sich mit der Tasmanischen See ergiesst, wurde Sydney errichtet, eine herrlich angelegte Stadt am Wasser, das von Booten beherrscht wird: Es blitzen weiße Segel, es schäumen krause Bugwellen und große Schiffe fahren gemächlich dazwischen. Darüber spannt sich die einfach klassische Harbour Bridge.Ursprünglich war Australien ein Exil für gefährliche Verbrecher - auf Tasmanien herrschten verschärfte Bedingungen. Heute ist der 5. Kontinent ein beliebtes Reiseziel, und Sydney ist eine der Perlen.Von meinem Hotel in Double Bay nehme ich morgens das Linienboot zum Circular Quay mitten in Sydney, von wo aus ich zufuss oder mit dem Bus die Stadt erkunden kann. Das Boot kreuzt vorher vor dem Opernhaus - der weltbekannten Konstruktion, die an Segelschiffe, offene Perlaustern oder einen Fächer erinnert und von Musik träumen lässt.Auf den Kunstmärkten finden wir Didgeridoos, Kunst der Aboriginees, Korallen, Perlen und Opale.Und auf den Speisekarten natürlich Känguru..."
50,“Meine Lieblingsstadt”,"Ich habe mich sofort in die Stadt verliebt. Das erste Mal war ich vor zwei Jahren dort und war auf anhieb begeistert. Das Wetter ist einfach traumhaft, schön warm und kaum Regen. Es gibt so viel zu sehen. Von der Innenstadt über die einzelnen Vororte bis hin zu den Blue Mountains. Manly und Mosman sind sehr schön, die Strände sind ein Traum. Besonders Manly ist zum surfen sehr beliebt, neben dem wohl bekanntesten von allen Stränden, dem Bondi Beach."
50,“ぜひ長期で”,シドニーには留学していましたので、第二の故郷とも思える場所です。できれば、長期滞在をしてもらいたい都市の一つです。短期なら、なんどかリピートをおすすめします。見る所も満載ですが、とても生活のしやすい街です。ロックス、サーキュラキー、ダーリングハーバー、センターポイント周辺にはお店も多く、食べ物屋さんにも困りません。北へ少し足を延ばして見てもおすすめですし、マンダイビーチやパディントン辺りまででもそう遠くはありません。ウィークリーフラットなどを借りて、実際に長期で滞在...そんな旅行をぜひおすすめしたいです。
50,“An der Tasmanischen See”,"Sydney ist eine kosmoplitische, unaufdringliche Stadt mit sehr angenehmer Atmosphäre, sehr freundlichen Leuten, viel Sonne und Meer. Wirklich ein wunderschönes Plätzchen, an dem man sich sehr wohlfühlen kann! Das Sydney Opera House löst bei jedem Besucher ein Aha-Erlebnis aus, ähnlich wie die Harbour Bridge."
50,“Weltstadt mit einzigartigem Charme”,"Jeder kennt die berühmten Bilder von der Oper in Sydney und der Harbout Bridge. Ich war mehrere Monate in Sydney und empfehle auch einmal hinter die Kulissen zu schauen und in die belebten Stadtviertel zu fahren, wie zum Beispiel Newtown oder Kings Cross. Toll sind auch Spaziergänge von Coogee nach Bondi oder der berühmte Spit-Many Walk. Da sollte man aber schon gute 4 Stunden einplanen als Durchschnitts-Sportler. Ist die Mühe aber 1000 Mal wert."
40,“适合旅游的绝佳城市”,住惯了上海的潮湿空气，去澳大利亚的悉尼走一走，会发现空气是那么新鲜，带着些些的海腥味，湿度是与从小长大的上海完全不一样，干：夏天不是湿热的热，冬天不是阴冷的冷。太阳总是在当头，一年下雨的日子1/12都不到吧。当然这样的城市里，防晒保湿的工作是要经常做好的。
30,“喧闹繁华的“乡村”都市-悉尼”,在这个澳大利亚人口第一大城市里，很多景点我们已经熟悉得不能再熟悉了，悉尼歌剧院、大铁桥、渔人码头、悉尼观光塔...City Tour Bus会带你游览到这个城市的每一个角落...当然，我比较建议在行车外也给自己留一段行走的时间，让自己充分感受异国风光。虽然相对澳大利亚其他城市来讲，悉尼已经算是城市节奏比较快的了，但是，依然建议如果你有时间，脚踏实地的走在这个城市的大街小巷去体味这里的气氛。
50,"“Ich verstehe, dass meine Freundin dorthin ausgewandert ist”","Lange Zeit habe ich meine Freundin nicht verstanden, auswandern und alles hinter sich lassen, wo doch in Sydney das Leben so teuer ist, dass man es kaum schafft, wirklich zu leben...Jetzt, wo ich dort war, denke ich, ich weiß, was sie so fasziniert. Durch die unendlich vielen Buchten in und um Sydney liegt unglaublich viel am Meer. Das Klima ist so mild, dass sich fast das ganze Leben im Freien abspielt. Und diese Stadt bietet einfach alles, was ein Großstadtmensch oder ein Naturliebhaber sich wünschen könnte, alles in einer Stadt. Als Tourist sollte man sich gut vorbereiten, um Tickets günstig zu kombinieren. Wir hatten einen ""Unlimited Adventure Pass"" und ein Wochenticket für öffentliche Verkehrsmittel inkl. Fähren, beides absolut lohnend!"
50,“Sydney eine der schönsten Städte der Welt”,"Sydney ist meiner Meinung einer der schönsten Städte der Welt. Zu den Highlights zählt natürlich die Oper und die Harbourbridge. Im botanischen Garten kann man super relaxen und man hat einen tollen Blick auf die Skyline. Ausserdem befinden sich zahlreiche Flying Foxes und Vögel im Park. Auch einen Spaziergang durch die Schluchten der Hochhäuser sollte gemacht werden, den es befinden sich auch einige historische Gebäude im Schatten der Wolkenkratzer.Ein absolutes muss ist ein Besuch beim Harry's Cafe de Wheels, wo es die besten Hot Dogs in der ganzen Stadt gibt und schon einige Stars dinierten. Steht leider nicht in vielen Reiseführern.Internethttp://www.harryscafedewheels.com.au/Home.aspx?element=1&category=1"
40,“よい観光地です”,オペラハウス、ハーバーブリッジ周辺はよい意味で観光地らしい雰囲気。周辺のレストランはどこも美味しく、大変良い印象でした。適度に便利な都会なのですが、落ち着いており、とても過ごしやすかったと思います。英語もオーストラリア訛はありますが、聞きやすかった。
50,“die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Diese Stadt muss man unbedingt erlebt haben. Am besten erkundet man sie per Buss und Fähre. Es gibt in Schreibwarenläden Wochentickets zu kaufen, die sehr günstig sind und unbegrenzte Benutzung von Bussen und Fähren ermöglichen. Am besten haben mir die verschiedenen Parks gefallen. In den royal botanic gardens kann man sogar freilebende Kakadus bestaunen."
40,“Tolle Stadt mit Schattenseiten”,"Sydney ist schon eine tolle Stadt. Sehr sauber, gepflegt und sehr vielseitig. Wir haben keinen einzigen Australier getroffen, der nicht sehr freundlich zu uns war. Aber ich finde sie hat auch seine Schattenseiten: man fühlt sich wirklich wie am Ende der Welt. Die Geschäfte schließen schon ab 17 Uhr und dann leeren sich die Strassen, so dass die Stadt richtig ausgestorben wirkt. Action hat man hier leider gar nicht. Die letzte Kinovorstellung war um 19 Uhr. Außer am Wochenende war am Abend auch kaum was los."
50,"“Wenn ich noch einmal auf dieser Welt komme, muss es in Sydney sein”","Sydney ist eine wunderbare Stadt, leider so weit von Europa, aber die Reise lohnt sich!Man kann sagen , jeder Ortteil ist anders aber alle zusammen haben was gemeinsames - siesind WUNDERBAR! Womit soll ich beginnen, mit der Oper und der Harbourg Bridge? Natuerlich sind sie wunder schoen aber die sieht man auf jeder Ansichtskarte und dortwerden alle Turisten gebracht. Nein das ist nicht alles! In Sydney gibt es eine bunte Bevoelkerung, von den Aborigeni die im Feeren-Hafen bemalt ihre Musik auf den Digeridu spielen um die Turisten zu amuesieren , die dann Fotos fuer den Erinnerungsalbum mit ihnenzusammen zu machen, die frueheren Englaender zu dehnen noch viele Europaener gekommen sind bis zu den Asiaten die ihren traditionellen China Town haben. Was alle diese Menschen gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Lockerheit, ihre Toleranz - alle sind ""gleich"" sie sind Australier..Mein allerliebster Ort in Sydney ist der Ufer von Watsonbay zu Bondai Beach - die Felsen die einem an den Fuessen stehen und in denen sich die maechtigen Waellen schlagen um die tuerkiesfarbene Farbe des Wassers im Vordergrung zu bringen- den Ort kann man nicht vergessen. Aber das ist nur ein ganz kleines Stuckchen aus Sydney. Mehr vielleicht ein anderes Mal......"
40,“Sydney - wirklich sehenswert”,"Sydney ist eine wirklich sehenswerte Satdt. Vor allem das Opera Houese und die die Harbour Bridge sind beinfruckend. Schön ist auch der Darling Harbour. Wenn man genug Zeit hat, sollte man auch mit einer Fähre zum Sydney Zoo fahren. Ein tolles Erlebnis."
50,“蜜月-澳大利亚自驾游”,蜜月跟老婆去了澳大利亚，共计16天，租了个传说中的大房车延着海岸线一路南下。悉尼-墨尔本-大洋路-堪培拉-悉尼。悉尼的给我的印象很好，风景无敌，歌剧院，动物园，情人港，岩石区都非常好玩。
50,“カウントダウン花火”,シドニーの大晦日の花火は見る価値あり。大晦日にシドニーに滞在するなら見るべし。お買いものは夕方は混雑します。レストランも予約なしではほとんどが不可。まともなものが食べたい人は予約してください。
40,“Aus meiner Sicht reichen zwei Tage”,"Wir haben natürlich hohe Erwartungen gehabt.Aus unserer Sicht reichen aber zwei tage völlig.Was haben wir gemacht und könnenes auch epfehlen :Einhalber Tag jeweils mit der red Line und der blue Line mit der Hopp und Stopp Bus alles kennenlernen - Inkl Bondi Beach.Besuch der Opera, der Bridge und der Rocks sind zu empfehlen.Chinatown ist eher billig,StadthotelSwissotel ist sehrepfehlenswert siehe Bewertungen"
50,“属于自己的悉尼”,旅行的意思，或许不在于我们在多少的景点拍了多少照片，而是在这个地方，我们经历了什么，拥有多少属于自己的，独一无二的回忆。用自己的双眼看悉尼，在夏日跨越赤道，在悉尼享受南半球的温暖。人，物，景，安静的，动感的，温情的，一切的一切，悉尼都会带给你！
40,“eine Stadt für Opernfans”,"Australien, und so auch Sydney, sind sehr teuer. Es empfiehlt sich die Miete eines Appartments [...], wenn man längere Zeit in der Stadt sein will. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, gute Anbindung der öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel (Ferries, Straßenbahn, Monorail, Busse, Züge, ausreichend Taxis). Bei den Taxis sollte man sich vor Antritt der Fahrt vergewissern, ob der Fahrer die Adresse kennt, sonst wird sich die Fahrtdauer möglicherweise verdoppeln. Menschen sind freundlich und hilfsbereit. Preisunterschiede sind groß, also empfiehlt sich ein Vergleich. Ein Opernbesuch lohnt sich sehr, auch eine back stage-Führung (sehr teuer) und eine Führung durch die Werkstätten der Oper (viel Ausdauer notwendig bis eine zuständige Person erreicht wird). Inanspruchnahme medizinischer Leistungen auch in öffentlichen Spitälern ist kein Problem (Rechnung ist sofort zu begleichen). Fantastische Buchhandlungen mit einer Auswahl von der man in anderen Großstädten (bspw Wien) nur träumen kann (vgl Kinokuniya, für Sprachen besser Abbeys). Reichhaltige Auswahl für jeden Geschmack und jede Geldbörse (gilt für alle Dienstleistungen). Studierende finden hier sofort einen Job, das gilt nicht nur für Sydney. Insgesamt eine Stadt, die man gesehen und erlebt haben sollte."
40,“程良く都会です。”,街は程良く都会です。路面店やレストラン、ホテルなどもそこそこ充実していますし、町並みも比較的美しいという印象です。街の中央辺りに運河が流れており、リゾート地としての側面も味わえます。湿度が低いので、オープンテラスなどでゆったりくつろげる雰囲気があり、まあまあお気に入りの都市です。
50,“Die schönste Stadt der Welt...”,"...heißt Sydney.Der Name allein klingt, finde ich, schon nach Sonne, Urlaub, Freundlichkeit und Schönheit.Das faszinierende an diesem Ort ist die Vernetzung des Wassers mit der Innenstadt, welches sich wie Adern durch einen Körper zieht. Strände in den verschiedensten Stadtteilen laden zum Entspannen ein und sind Garant für Erholung und Zufriedenheit.Die Innenstadt ist voll von tollen Restaurants und Sehenswürdigkeiten, so dass es einem wohl nie langweilig werden wird. Als Bonus gibt es noch die Freundlichkeit der Menschen obendrauf. Sydney ich liebe Dich :-)"
40,“Wow”,"Sydney ist eine Reise wert! Eine Riesenstadt, trotzdem gemütliche Ecken zu finden. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten lassen nichts zu wünschen übrig: Die Oper, die Harbour Bridge, das Hafengebiet muss man gesehen haben. Gleich um die Ecke ist der Botanische Garten, Eintritt frei, auch die Führungen. Der Fernsehturm wächst sozusagen aus einem Gebäude heraus, die Skyline ist überwältigend (wahrscheinlich nicht für jemanden, der gerade aus New York kommt, aber für uns schon). Schöne Läden, coole Pubs. Alles gut öffentlich erreichbar. Würde sofort wieder hinfahren!"
50,“meravigliosa”,"e' una citta cosmopolita, all'avanguardia, dove convivono in modo straordinario truppe di giovani "" svampiti e rumorosi"" con anziani ""arzilli ma tranquilli"", offre luoghi incantevoli dove ritirarsi da solo per attimi di relax ma anche zone ricche di locali notturni.Ho la presunzione di dire che ho girato un po' il mondo, ma come Sidney non ho trovato nullaRagazzi, l'Australia è un continente da visitare e da girare tutto.....Vi consiglio in particolare il deserto rosso con i monti Uluru, la spendida cittadina di Alice Spring, la giovanissima Melbourne, le gite naturalistiche a Darwin e ovviamente la meravigliosa Sydney.Non dimenticate di fare anche un giro Philip Island, meglio conosciuta come l'isola dei pinguini, dove in serata si fanno incontri ravvicinati con queste splendide creature."
40,“調和してます”,新しい建物と古い建物が調和していますね。移動もモノレール（高いけど）などがありどこでもいけます。船での移動も安く気持ちいいです。お気に入りはフィッシャーマンズエリア。豊富な海鮮料理が食べられますよ。団体さんがいると大変混み合いますが。タロンガ動物園も是非ともいってください
50,“Eine Stadt zum Verlieben”,"Wer Australien schon mal bereist hat, der weiß von was ich spreche. Zu Australien kann man sowieso viel sagen, aber Sydney ist einfach Top. Nicht nur die Leute, von denen man so viel Nettigkeiten bekommt und alle immer gut drauf sind. In dieser Stadt gibt es so viel zu sehen und zu erleben, dass man eigentlich gar nicht mehr zurück möchte. Man kann sehr viel einkaufen, erleben, ausgehen und und und. Wer eine Rundreise plant, der sollte auf jeden Fall mindestens drei Tage in Sydney einplanen, wenn nicht sogar eine ganze Woche. Wenn man alleine ist, dann sind die Backpacker Unterkünfte auch sehr gut. Ich habe keine schlechten Erfahrung gemacht. Wer auch einen schönen Badeurlaub machen will, kann sehr viele schöne Strände finden. Man muss auch keine Angst vor Haien haben, wie viele immer sagen. Vom Preislichen war es dort auch vollkommen in Ordnung, teilweise war es sogar durch den guten Kurs um einiges billiger als in Deutschland. Wer hin fliegt, ich komme gerne mit. :-)"
50,“Eine herrliche Stadt mit Flair”,"Sydney ist eine rundum herrliche Stadt, man kann viel unternehmen, es gibt klasse Restaurants. Unbedingt sollte man mit einem Stadtrundfahrtbus zur Oper fahren. Die Harbour Bridge ist ein gigantisches Ding, man sollte unbedingt auch auf die Bruecke gehen. Ist zwar nicht gerade billig, aber unbedingt ratsam. Das Aquarium ist super klasse, das Maritime Museum unbedingt anschauen und der Fischmarkt ist super klasse, dort koennt ihr wunderbar frischen Fisch essen, lecker!"
50,“My Favorite!”,"was eine stadt, alles was man sich wünschen kann!am besten ein hotel down town, dann kann man fast alles per fuss erkunden, ansonsten muss man natürlich die fähren nutzen, mit dem bus nach bondi fahren, ...und was für restaurants - frühstück ist pflicht in einem der kleinen cafes in der nähe des business distrikts, abends hat man die volle auswahl: fisch, auch super sushi, meeresfrüchte, natürlich austern, aber auch toll italienisch, eigentlich alles, was man sich wünschen kann.und das beste sind die leute: wirklich relaxed & nett, man fühlt sich immer mehr als willkommen."
50,“Mein Favorit in Australien”,Eine Traumhafte Stadt die zum verweilen einläd. Die Stadt pulisiert durch ihre multikulturellen Einwohner und trägt zurecht den Titel Weltmetropole. Die Parkanlagen laden zum entspannen ein. Die Sehnenswürdigkeiten sind jedes Foto wert und die Stadtstrände sind einzigartig. Diese Stadt kann ich jeden nur als Herz legen.
50,“很英式的一个城市”,09年的夏天放了自己半个月的假期，去了一趟澳洲，悉尼是一个很英式的城市，也许是因为他被英国统治了那么多年，很多的建筑与人文气息都透露着英式的味道。悉尼歌剧院是一定要去的，有幸看了一场歌剧，为之感动。悉尼动物园也是要去的，考啦真的如传说中那样的懒散。如果自己也能像考啦一样，24小时的大部分时间在睡觉中度过该多好啊
40,“Urlaub am anderen Ende der Welt”,Sehr hoher Freizeitfaktor und auch kulturel einiges zu bieten.Die beste Zeit ist um den Jahreswechsel - Happy New Year andsurf the city beach.
40,"“Sydney, immer wieder”","Auf unserer Rundreise durch den Süden Australien kamen wir natürlich auch nach Sydney. Die Stadt ist ein Traum. Unser Hotel war direkt im Zentrum, so dass man alles zu Fuss oder mit der Monorail erkunden konnte. Ein Abendessen im Fernsehtur ist sehr zu empfehlen. Man kann dort Buffet essen, und die Auswahl und Qualität der Speisen ist sehr gut. Eine weitere gute Adresse zum Essen sind die Rocks in unmittelbarer Nähe zur Harbour Bridge. Allerdings muss man rechntzeitig einen Tisch reservieren und wissen, dass es nicht ganz billig ist. Belohnt wird man allerdings mit dem Blick auf Oper und Bridge.Von Sydney aus kann man mit dem Bus zu den Blue Montains fahren. Die Fahrtzeit liegt allerdings bei fast 2,5 Std. , aber man sollte es gesehen haben. Weiter muss man unbedingt Bondi Beach gesehen haben. Die Strände kann man mit normalen Linienbusen erreichen, Ticketpreis ca. 15 Euro, dafür kann man unterwegs überall aus- und einsteigen."
50,“Sydney”,"Diese Stadt kann man nur lieben!!! Es ist sehr vielfältig und mangelt nicht an Veranstaltungen. Sei es Konzerte, Feste, Festivals oder einfach nur Essen und trinken gehen. Ebenso wenig mangelt es an Sehenswürdigkeiten. Die weltbekannte Oper, die vielen Kirchen, Museen und auch der Fischmarkt. Durch die Bikulturelle Bevölkerung bekommt die Stadt einen tollen Flair. Es ist einfach traumhaft!!"
40,“Millionenstadt mit Lebensfreude”,"Sydney vereinigt für mich Großstadt- und Freizeit-(Urlaubs-)feeling wie keine zweite Stadt, die ich kenne. Businesskleidung auf den After-work-parties zwischen Wolkenkratzern und Strandklamotten am Bondi-Beach sind Programm. Die Australier - stolz darauf, wenn sie im Stammbaum einen Knacki haben (Sydney war eine Gefängniskolonie von England) und im größten Stress noch ein Lachen parat sind anscheinend die Erfinder von Lebensfreude. Vor dem Büro noch eine Joggingrunde und nach dem Büro raus zum Surfen. März 2010"
50,“Sydney die Traumstadt”,"Sydney ist die Traumstadt schlechthin. Es ist wahrscheinlich der Traum vieler Menschen.Wir waren schon 5mal in dieser schönen Weltstadt.Der Hafen ist gigantisch und man kann den ganzen Tag mit dem Schiff unterwegs sein, man war trotzdem nochnicht überall.Die Restaurants, Bars und Kneipen sind toll.Die Menschen dort sind sehr nett und helfen sofort."
50,“Geilste stadt der Welt”,"Sydney ist einfach nur Traumhaft. Super zum Einkaufen, Sightseeing, Relaxan am Bondi und Coogee Beach. Der Botanische Garten ist einfach nur super schön angelegt und dort gibt es Flughunde in den Bäumen. Ein Sparziergang über die Harbour Brige ist ein muss und der Ausblick auf Sydney ist unbeschreiblich. Wer noch einen Supper Blick auf Sydney haben will soll auf den Sydney Tower gehen ist zwar nicht ganz günstig aber der Blick ist es auf alle mal wert."
40,“Die Metropole von Australien”,"Sydney ist eine sehr schöne Stadt! Besonders im Sommer macht es spass dort einige Zeit zu verbringen!Meistens ist das Wetter super und man kann die vielen verschiedenen Strände die Sydney zu bieten hat besuchen!Die Bekanntesten Strände sind der Bondi Beach (einer der berühmtesten Strände) , der Bronte mit dem wahrnsinnig hohen Wellen und der Manly Beach, den man mit der Fähre vom cirqular quay erreicht! Alle Strände haben mich seh beeindruckt.Aber nicht nur dir Strände begeistern mich so an Sydney sondern auch die Stadt an sich. Beisielsweise die bekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten wie das Opera House und die Habour Bridge. Dann kommen noch die vielen Parks in der Stadt und der Botanische Garten die zum verweilen einladen.Sydney ist zwar eine super schöne Stadt die mir auch echt gefallen hat, man sollte allerdings ein dickes Portmonai mitnehmen wenn man dort viel sehen und spass haben will!"
40,“Mit die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Sydney ist wunderbar! Es liegt am Wasser, hat mehrere sehr unterschiedliche Hafengebiete, die Tags wie Nachts viele Möglichkeiten zur Erkundung lassen:Cockle Bay, Kings Wharf sind mit kulinarischen Highlights gespickt; von dort startet man aber zum Taronga Zoo oder geht ins Sydney Aquarium. Aber auch die Innenstadt mit Ihreren verschiedenen Stadtteilen lädt zu immer wieder neuen Ausflügen ein: ob es der CBD ist mit seinen Wolkenkratzern, the Rocks mit seinem historischen Charme oder das chinesische Viertel ist.Aßerdem sind die Sydneysider sehr freundliche Menschen, die Ihre Stadt sehr sauber halten."
50,“Die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Sydney ist ein Traum! Umgeben von viel Wasser strahlt die Stadt einen unvergleichlichen Charme aus. Viele Fussgängerzonen laden zum Flanieren ein und die Oper besticht durch ihre architektonische Einzigartigkeit! Geniessen Sie eine Fahrt auf den unzähligen Fähren und betrachten Sie die Stadt vom Wasser aus. Die beiden Strände Bondi und Manly laden zum Verweilen ein und stundenlang kann man den Surfern zuschauen, wie sie geschickt über die Wellen reiten."
40,“Australien immer wieder!”,"Sydney tolle Stadt,freundliche Menschen. Kulinarischer Tip(Jordens)im Hafen ca.200m vom Marine Museum,Austern Hummer,Fischmoderate Preise,(Vorher Monorail Tagespass =15,00AUS$ Gutschein)Chinatown,Sydney Tower,Marine Museum,Aqurium etc.Monorail immer Tagespass zahlt sich aus.Oper nicht vergessen!Hotel immer in der City."
40,“Sydney erleben”,Am besten man nimmt ein Taxi vom Flughafen und fragt den Taxi Fahrer welcher Stadtteil am besten zu einem passt. Ein Tipp ist Newtown . Man hat genug Möglichkeiten Abends weg zu gehen. Ausserdem liegt Newtown nahe der Innenstadt und Zu verschiedenen Stränden Süd Sydneys ist es nicht weit.
50,“Wunderbar schöne Stadt”,"Einen Besuch wert Sydney. Die Stadt der Vielfalt und der vielen Kulturen. Worth einen Spaziergang der Innenstadt, sondern auch zum Besuch der Stadtteil Kings Cross."
50,“Vielleicht die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Traumhafte Lage an der Sydney Bay.Nicht verpassen: Besteigung der Harbour Bridge, Segeltörn durch die Sydney Bay, Besuch der Oper, Essen und Barbesuch in The Rocks.In einem Pylon der Harbour Bridge gibt es eine tolle Ausstellung über den Bau der Brücke.Genial, aber nicht ganz preiswert: Silvester in Sydney!Wenn man das Silvester Event im Sydney Opera House besucht, hat man die beste Aussicht auf die Feuerwerke (Familienfeuerwerk um 21h und das um Mitternacht) ohne sich sich einen günstigen Platz am Nachmittag suchen zu müssen. Das Feuerwerk um Mitternacht ist ein Traum! Besser kann ein neues Jahr nicht beginnen."
50,“Schöner geht es kaum”,"Eine Stadt, fast tropisch, Wasserlandschaften von Fluss bis Ozean, Inseln noch und noch, und trotzdem Großstadt mit 4 Mio Einwohnern. Sydney hieß natürlich nicht immer so. Früher hieß sie vermutlich nichts, weil die Menschen, die hier lebten, laut Captain Cook keine waren. Der ist 1770 in Botany Bay gelandet und sah sich viele Speeren ausgesetzt. Die Briten kamen 1778 zurück und rotteten sie aus, die Träger der Speere. So kam die Zivilisation nach Australien. Danach die Häftlinge! Ein Kontinent als Zuchthaus …Heute ist Sydney eine der schönsten Städte der Welt. Bewundern gelernt habe ich sie nicht wegen der Landschaft und der Bauwerke, sondern zuerst wegen der Austern. Sydney rock oysters suchen weltweit ihresgleichen.Die City unterscheidet sich von anderen amerikanischen Städten nicht viel, aber doch erheblich: Hier fehlt die Kriminalität weitgehend. Und die Beziehung zu Alkohol ist weniger hysterisch. Freitag nachmittag trinkt man sein Bier vor der Kneipe, am Abend wieder drin - und bis Sonnabend morgen. In den USA werden um Mitternacht sogar die Bierautomaten an der Tankstelle abgeschaltet. Dafür kennt Sydney eine andere Kuriosität: BYO - Bring Your Own. Viele Restaurants dürfen kein Alkohol zum Essen servieren. Aber gleich daneben gibt es einen Laden, der das Zeug verkauft. Der Wirt stellt dann den Korkenzieher und die Gläser.Der botanische Garten unterscheidet sich von unseren stark - die Wärme liebenden Pflanzen leben hier im Freien, für die anderen wird ein Häuschen gekühlt.Obwohl das Neue Jahr etwas östlich von Fiji anfängt, wird das große Feuerwerk von Sydney weltweit an dessen Beginn ausgestrahlt.Für Wassersportler gibt es wohl keinen besseren Ort. Man kann hier toll tauchen (Manly, Port Jackson etc.), segeln (überall, wo kein Land), surfen (auch Manly, Royal national Park), windsurfen und kiten. Sydneys Segler gehören zu den waghalsigsten der Welt. Einst fuhren sie Eighteenfooter, Schiffe, die bis zum Umfallen übertakelt sind. Des gleichen Geistes Kind ist die 49er, die ultimative Rennmaschine, mittlerweile olympisch.In Sydney fand die einzige Militärcoup von Australien statt, und die zweite, die ein gewisser Bligh erlebte. Die Rum Rebellion richtete sich gegen den Herrn, der bereits einmal Menschen gegen sich aufgebracht hatte, Captain Bligh, bekannt aus dem Film „Mutiny on the Bounty“, auf deutsch Meuterei auf … Diesmal war er nicht Captain, sondern Gouverneur der Kolonie. Er hatte versucht, diese etwa so erfolgreich wie einst die Bounty seinen Regeln zu unterwerfen. Am Ende wurde er abgelöst - und mit ihm die Garde der Navy-Offiziere, die das Land regieren sollten. Mit Sydneysidern ist nicht zu spaßen, selbst wenn man einer ist, der 5.000 Meilen in einem lecken Boot segeln kann!Wenn man gefragt wird, was wohl am beeindruckendsten ist in Sydney, werden die meisten Menschen die Sydney Opera House nennen. Wahrlich beeindruckend. Erstens der Architekt, ein Däne (Jørn Utzon), der sich zum ersten Mal international versucht. Und zweitens, die Überziehung der Baukosten. Anstelle der veranschlagten 3,5 Mio £ wurden es sage und schreibe 50 Mio £. Der Architekt war bei Bauende 1973 (anstelle von 1965) nicht mehr da. Trotzdem wurde das Haus nicht nur UNESCO Kulturerbe, sondern auch Kulturerbe von Dänemark."
30,“Überbewertet”,"Wahrscheinlich werde ich jetzt von vielen Usern gesteinigt, aber meine Meinung zu Sydney ist nun einmal die, dass die Überbewertung einiger weniger sehenswerter Flecken dieser Stadt verschwände, läge sie nicht so exponiert am anderen Ende der Welt. Es gehört zum Programm eines Fernreisenden dazu, in Australien gewesen zu sein, die meisten von ihnen landen in Sydney und bleiben dort ein paar Tage. Das kann man auch tun, aber mehr als vier Übernachtungen sind übertrieben. Die Harbourfront ist wirklich schön, die Blue Mountains eine Fahrt mit dem Zug wert, auch der eine oder andere nahe gelegene Tierpark. Aber Downtown ist eine Enttäuschung, eigentlich der gesamte kulturelle Aspekt dieser Großstadt eher zu vernachlässigen. Bondi Beach ist ein Mythos, aber nichts Besonderes. Ich empfehle Canberra. Da ist zwar nicht viel los, aber eine Planstadt dieser Bedeutung gibt es in Europa in dieser Form nicht, das Parlament steht jedem offen, ein skurriles Städtchen, das einen Besuch lohnt."
50,“once in a lifetime expeience - eine Traumstadt am anderen Ende der Welt”,"Geschlafen haben wir im The Observatory - Hotel. Ein Traumhotel ohne wenn und aber. Mitten in The Rocks (Stadtteil) und in einer tollen fußläufigen Entfernung zu allem (Oper, Bridge, Fähren, Restaurants, Bars, Museen, Musical, etc.).Die Stadt ist einfach nur genial! Wir waren 5 Nächte und haben noch längst nicht alles gesehen. Unser Tipp: einen Bridgeclimb machen (auch wenn es teuer ist) und die Bar / Restaurant ""Lord Nelson"". Lecker, tolle Leute, gutes Bier... Dort haben wir auch Jeremy, einen local kennengelernt, der uns am nächsten Tag mit seinem Boot die wunderschönen Buchten von Sydney gezeigt hat. Was soll man sagen - eine Reise nach down under und Sydney ist wirklich eine lifetime-experience."
40,“das Australien Highlight”,"es sind schon viele Bewertungen über Sydney geschrieben und veröffentlicht worden...und ich kann mich den guten Seiten Sydneys nur anschließen! einen kleinen Minuspunkt gibt es: das Hardrockcafe ist nicht mehr da:-(aber diese Stadt ist ein MUSS für jeden Australien Reisenden! schon am Flughafen hat man das Gefühl, angekommen zu sein! also raus aus dem Gebäude und ab in die Stadt....nette Taxifahrer, und ein anderes Gefühl von Leben!rein ins pulsierende Leben der Stadt; man hört alle Sprachen dieser Welt, und dann, ist es vor einem: das Sydney Opera House und der Kleiderbügel, die Harbour Bridge!die Augen, noch müde nach dem langen Flug, fangen das Strahlen an und es kommt, ganz schnell: das perfekte Feeling ....soooo , endlich am anderen Welt, Happy Down Under!!ich empfehle: einen Latte Macchiato in der Opera Bar, am Abend, mit Blick zur Brücke!!!!und am nächsten Tag: Manly!!! am Abend zurück mit der Fähre, bei gutem Wetter den tollsten Sonnenuntergang zu erleben, und die Hafeneinfahrt zu genießen! ich war vor 2 Jahren in Sydney, aber diesen Sonnenuntergang werde ich nie vergessen!!! mein Bild sagt alles!Alles in allem, Sydney ist die tollste Stadt, die ich bisher gesehen habe, und ich hoffe, bald wieder dort zu sein (nicht nur zum Latte Macchiato trinken!)!!!Ab nach Manly Beach, ein Spaziergang und zur Shelly Beach...traumhaft schön!!! G day Down Under:-)"
50,“大都市でありながら街全体が観光スポット”,オペラハウス、ハーバーブリッジが有名ですが両者はもちろん、普通に街を歩いているだけで、おしゃれな花屋があったりして、気分が高揚する場所です。年末から新年にかけて行きましたが、ニューイヤー記念の花火はすごいの一言に尽きます。大晦日の深夜は歩いていても、まったく怖いようなところはなく、治安の良さを感じました。また、海外観光定番のハーバークルーズディナーに参加しましたが、ハワイ、グアムに比べて格段にディナー、ショートとも素晴らしかったです。
50,“Super-Stadt in Australien”,Sehenswert sauber und viele Grünanlagen.
50,“mein favorit in australien”,"ich bin jetzt schon 2x in sydey gewesen und liebe diese stadt mit ihrem unheimlichen flair, großstadt doch gemütlich zugleich. die ausgeglichene temperatur und die idyllischen plätze und strassen. in dieser stadt fügt sich alter und neuer baustil interessant zusammen. schöne strassencafes und interessante museen und parks runden den eindruck ab und machen den besuch zu einem unvergesslichen erlebnis. mehr fotos unter ---"
40,“一個舒適的地方”,慢生活森呼吸不會太紊亂 不會太緊湊錢夠用 美食夠吃我們的生活自給自足得很愜意很少可以看到一個國家每個人的臉上都寫著這些感覺天氣不會太冷也不會太熱人民不會太緊張也沒有過於散漫在晚風徐徐的夜晚總是會見著大批的席尼人們做在各式各樣的咖啡店前小酌也好 聊天也好雙頰微紅的她們 很隨性很任真 很幸福喜歡他們的生活步調喜歡那裡每一口都乾淨的空氣喜歡席尼
20,“悉尼，= 上海”,来澳洲一个月左右，得机会去悉尼小玩。走在悉尼的街上，天，全是中国人。不是中国人，就是韩国人，日本人，。。。反正大多是亚洲人。估计也引文市中心就是china town的缘故很喜欢水族馆。。和manly
40,“シドニーは大都市”,ケアンズからシドニーへ移動して一番に感じたのは、大都市だということです。高層ビルが立ち並び、車や人が多いです。ビジネス街といった感じでしょうか。オペラハウス、ナイトクルージングと色々楽しめます。物価は高めなので、お土産はケアンズなどで購入することをお勧めします。同じ品物でも値段が違います。あと、お勧めはバーに行くこと。昼からあいているので、ランチがてら行ってみました。ビールの種類が多く、料理もなかなかおいしかったです。
50,“Amazing City生活的天堂”,我是去年6月到的悉尼，主要任务是工作考察。一下飞机就深切的感受到了那里的环境非常宜人。刚到悉尼还有一点点陌生感，接机的是公司的司机和秘书，悉尼机场有专门为领导候车等人的停车带，有各个通信公司的电话卡出售，服务等都非常人性化。坐在车里，发现悉尼的路上没有多少人，而且车都开得很快，道路十分畅通，听了老司机的讲解，十分佩服澳洲交通系统，车子就算过路口，只要是绿灯，都可以以本道路最高时速的速度通过，人们都很遵守交通规则。好了，闲话不多说，我住在悉尼中心CBD（也就是这里人说的city）的一家还算不错的酒店，叫citygate，设施服务都够水准，房间很宽敞。工作一天回到酒店有回到家的感觉。悉尼的夜生活也很丰富，很多人说悉尼到了晚上商店都关门了，一个人都没有了，其实在city，晚上9点以后，夜生活才刚刚开始，这个时候在city的街道上会看到形形色色的男男女女出现。 酒吧，舞厅等娱乐场所才才刚刚开门。我虽然工作考察时间不长，但我觉得还是不能错过去体验悉尼的“人文景观”。老板推荐我一家十分有名的脱衣舞酒吧，我忘了在哪条街了，就在靠近city townhall的地方。第一次那种地方，体会到了资本主义国家的糜烂和腐朽，喝醉的酒鬼眼睛直盯盯的看着，我不是很习惯那种场所，但是老板既然请客来我不能不给面子。晚上还叫了特别服务，直接送到酒店房间里，我还记得那个邮件地址是mick.king.first@gmail.com ，老板叫Mick，听说在那一带挺有名的，泰国和中国混血的那个真的不错，就是贵了点，还有一个是香港的，很棒。这些在悉尼是合法的，所以不用担心像做贼一样。悉尼还有很多其他的地方值得一去，不过我的时间短，只去了一些地方。Manly一定要去看看，海边沿线有时间可以走走，或者租一辆自行车，几个人一起边聊天边享受阳光海水沙滩。还有就是Star city悉尼最大赌场，体验一把，不要太认真的哦。还有就是必去的情人港和歌剧院，有时间一定去悉尼塔上看看，来一次sky walk，体验飞一般的感觉。好了，先写到这里吧。
40,“世界三大美港の夜景は素晴らしい”,シドニー湾の夜景はとても美しいです。数多くのホテルのネオンが夜景を際立たせています。クルージングにて世界遺産のオペラハウスも見ることができます。昼間のシドニーの街はとても活気にあふれているのでショッピングも楽しいです。
20,“美しい街！”,オーストラリアの首都？と間違えるほど、活気が溢れる美しい街です。ただし、物価は高く、食事も余り期待しない方が良いかも知れません。
50,“見どころたくさん、美しい街です”,美しいハーバー、世界各地の美味しいレストラン、フレンドリーな人たち、緑と青のハーモニー、オペラハウスやハーバーブリッジ、目の覚めるようなビーチ、それ以外にもたくさん見どころがあり、たった3日の旅行では見切れません。住むように旅したい街のひとつです。
30,"“Australia,Sydney：こだわりを持ったその美しさは必見”",世界三代湾景の一つと言われるだけあってその街づくり、景観には特に定評のあるオーストラリア最大の都市、シドニー。点滅する看板を使用してはいけない、そしてその看板の色も指定されたもののみ等と厳しい誓約と制約を課して輝くその湾景の美しさはこだわりという覚悟の証だ。街の規模は大きいのだが買い物と景色を楽しむ以外にこれといったアトラクションはなく数日居るとする事もなくなってしまう。それでも世界最大のスクリーンがあるi-maxシアター、シドニータワー、ブリッジ、そしてオペラハウスはぜひ訪れてほしい。そしてこの街の美しさは何時までも心に残る。シドニーを訪れずしてオーストラリアは語れないだろう。
40,“un modelo a imitar”,"Encontramos una ciudad ordenada, limpia y segura, con muchos atractivos propios y en su entorno. Lo de segura surge de que durante nuestra estadía no pudimos ver cómo visten los policías (parece que no tienen necesidad de actuar)"
40,“海と山、自然を満喫できショッピングもエンジョイ！”,日本から7時間程度で、時差も1時間！　気軽に行けます。シドニーの街中は、歴史的な建物も多く、クィーンズビクトリアビルディング（ショッピングセンター）は、ステンドグラスをはじめあらゆるところがアートですばらしいです。ショッピングは、オーストラリアのみの化粧品やクリームなどもオーガニックのものが多くおすすめです。また、海もすぐで、あらゆるところにビーチがあります。ビーチは庶民的なところから高級ビーチまでいろいろ。それぞれ楽しめますし、もちろん、シーフードは最高です。車で数時間で世界文化遺産のスリーシスターズがある山のほうにもいけます。ケーブルカーは底がガラス張りでおすすめです。日差しが本当にきついので（あちこちに皮膚ガンクリニックがありました）、サングラスと帽子は必需品です。
50,“Il fascino australiano”,"Ciao a tutti,penso che l'australia sia per tutti una meta da sogno ed in special modo Sydney...beh è così.A Sydney voi trovate tutto, dalle spiaggie di sabbia bianca di Bonday beach con localini sul mare al centro economico-finaziario-industriale, da splendidi giardini botanici agli eventi mondani (pensate alle rappresentazioni che cengono eseguite all'Opera House).Per non parlare di Darling Harbour piena di locali alla moda, e tanta gente in giro che ha voglia di divertirsi, ma sempre in maniera molto tranquilla e rilassata in quanto sembra qui lo streess non esista.Insomma trascorrendo una settimana a Sydney si possono fare tutti giorni cose diverse, senza mai annoiarsi ed al tempo stesso capire il loro stile di vita ed anche perchè tanta gente non vorrebbe più tornare a casa....Insomma...Sydney ti regala ciò che ti aspetti...anzi forse anche qualcosa in più."
40,“食べ物が美味しい”,シドニーは街も清潔でお店やレストランの対応もフレンドリーで居心地がよかったです。市内観光と郊外を回る観光バスが出ていて、青いバス、赤いバスの表示で、一日乗り放題でしたが、郊外を回るバスはビーチにも行けるので、お勧めですよ。チャイナタウンのレストランの対応はテーブルにお皿を投げ捨てるように置いていくなど対応が酷かったので、チップを置きませんでした。ホテルのコンシェルジェの紹介だったのですが、残念なことでした。
40,“シドニー、キングスクロスの夜”,７月に行きました！（オフシーズンで安いので）現地は冬ですが日本の11月くらいの服装で行くといいかと思います。シドニー市内は想像以上に都会で（とはいえ東京ほどではありませんが）人も多くて賑やかな街でした。キングスクロスという日本でいう歌舞伎町のようなところに滞在しましたが繁華街とはいえそこまで規模は大きくなく身の危険も特に感じませんでした。ただ金曜・土曜の夜は繁華街なだけにうるさいので神経質な人はこのエリアのホテルに滞在するのはやめたほうがいいかと。
40,“意外と見所アリ”,たいしたものが無いと思われがちなシドニー。確かに、コレといって有名なものはオペラハウスくらいしかありませんね。。。ただ、よくよく見てみるとシドニーの街にも結構見るところはあります。オペラハウスのあるサーキュラーキー、そしてすぐ近くの港、ダーリングハーバーは港沿いにオシャレな雰囲気のカフェやレストラン、バーが立ち並んでいて昼夜ともにシドニーの人々ののんびりした生活が見られます。また、シティ（シドニーの中心地）にあるハイドパークは、天気のいい休日ともなれば沢山の人が散歩や日向ぼっこ、路面チェスを楽しんでいます。サーキュラーキーのフェリー乗り場からフェリーで出かけるのもオススメ。パラマッタ行きは川を通るコースで、両側に「海外らしい」家々や停泊するヨット、静かで美しい景色が眺められます。旅行だから・・・と特別なすごいものを期待して来ると空振りに終わってしまうかもしれませんが、“海外の雰囲気を味わう”という面では、シドニーの街中をのんびり歩くことで感じられると思います。ヨーロッパの歴史ある厳かな雰囲気ともアジアの活気ある雰囲気とも違った、独特の雰囲気がある街です。
30,“特記事項なし”,世界でもメジャーな町のひとつだと思うが、私は全然印象に残らなかった・・・残念だ。オペラハウスなんかもちゃんと行ってはみたけど。オーストラリアは都会より田舎（のワイルドさ）を楽しむ国なのかもね。
40,“なぜかたこ焼き”,おそらく有名なんだと思いますが、ダーリンハーバーでやっていた在住日本人主催の夏祭りでたこ焼きを売っていました。当日は大雨でしたがなんとしても食べるんだと、列にならんで食べました。いやーーーおいしかった！雨で海を見ながら外で食べれなかったのが残念ですがフードコート内でも同じように食べている人を見かけました。チャツウッドと中華街でも売っているそうです
50,“Sea”,シドニーはすばらしいところです。海は綺麗し、海岸を歩いても気持ちいいです。早朝なんかはみんな挨拶して気持ちいいです。昼間は『グットダイ！』とよく言われます。どういう意味の英語かわかりますか?
40,“面白い町”,シティからバスで10分。美味しいタイ料理店が並ぶ。有名なコーヒーショップがあるのもこの町。
40,“シドニーの食事”,町並みがとても綺麗で、ヨーロッパ風。他民族国家だけに本格的な食事が楽しめるのが一番のポイント。ファッションを楽しむには他の都市に比べるとかなり劣っているが、食事の面ではダントツでおいしいレストランがたくさんある。パブがたくさんあるため気軽に一杯飲めるし、夏は外で飲むのが主流。
40,“一般的なショッピングセンター”,"Broadway Shopping Centre はシドニー市内でも大きい方のショッピングセンターのようです。場所はセントラル駅からBroadway沿いにビクトリア公園方向に歩いて10分ほど。ビクトリア公園の向かいにあります。中にはほとんどの業種の専門店が２店以上あり、フードコートも充実しておりQVBに比較して多くのオージー達が買い物をしてました。レジで！”No fly buy?""とか、聞かれますが、どうも「フライバイ」というのはお買物のポイント制度のようで、Noと答えていました。おもなテナントスーパー、生鮮品：Coles, Bilo雑貨：Target 衣料：K-mart"
50,“シドニー周遊券（入場料＋交通費）”,See Sydney & Beyond passは、シドニーおよび周辺地域の施設（40以上）のほとんどの入場料をカバーしており、鉄道＋フェリー＋バスの乗り放題券付きもあり。多くの人は「元」がとれます。例：2日券交通費付き＝大人175＄、子供（15歳以下）99＄
40,“鉄道とバス、フェリー”,シドニーはとても公共交通が充実している。CITY CIRCLEをはじめとする、街中を巡回し、かつ郊外と結ぶ鉄道、バス、フェリーがある。一部を除いて乗り放題の1週間パスがあり、旅行者にぴったり。　ＭＯＶＥという無料で配布されている日本語情報誌を入手すれば、鉄道、フェリー、バスのルートが載っているので一目瞭然。また、このＭＯＶＥにはレストラン、観光地情報もあり、必須の情報誌です。
