40,Nice,Simply amazing place must visit with your young ones one must try this place personally I gave Thumbs up to this place,Kesha
40,You will get WET,Jurassic Park themed boat ride. Leisurely pace initially with lots of animated dinosaurs to see. The thrill is the giant drop at the end. We got soaked. Great on a hot day. Probably avoid in winter or wear something to help keep you dry. Great fun.,GlenFC
50,Brilliant!,Loved it - even the getting soaked at the very beginning! The velociraptor meet and greet was amazing - definitely recommend this one.,Brigitte H
40,The ride was upgraded in 2019 and is a definite must visit.,"I've been riding Jurassic Park for years but they just leveled up in 2019 and they did good...The theme is still the same as you're on a boat tour through Jurassic Park and things go sideways with dinosaurs getting loose. The dinosaurs movement is much more realistic and less robotic throughout the ride. When your boat starts going vertical to the big drop section, instead of a 'water treatment area' you're heading into 'T-Rex Kingdom'. They added a predator cove in this area as well.Right before the big drop you come across a FULL Bodied T-Rex fighting it out with another dinosaur. Before the upgrade, it was just a T-Rex head terrorizing you before you dropped down. This is much more scary and awesomely realistic. Well done.***SPOILER ALERT: I'm about to review the new aquarium section. If you want to be surprised, stop reading here. =)At the beginning of the tour, you enter the aquarium observatory. You come across these massive screens that show case the aquarium and they are awesomely realistic. You find yourself staring into them as your tour boat peacefully coasts through. When the massive Mosasaurus appears, it chomps down a shark and aggressively swims around the 'tank' Then it charges the observation glass at full speed cracking the window and which point water blasts down on the boat. Choreographed perfectly and it definitely took me by surprise.It was super popular before the upgrade and even more so. We waited 20 minutes with the express pass and it was a 3 hour wait via the general admission line. However you get there, this new Jurassic Tour ride is a definite must see. Enjoy!",Steff A
50,Updated Dino Ride,"We did get a little wet... not soaking wet or anything.We’re a fan of this ride from back in 1997. The line upgrades and the ride changes were fun.Also, it did not cause motion sickness like a lot of the new rides do.",sporterrn
50,Mega!,"It’s been refurbished and is brilliant. High risk of getting wet and potentially soaked, but we dried off very quickly. Can be very long queues but worth it.",Duerds5
50,Wonderful ride but be prepared to get wet.,"We had a great time we waited probably around 40 minutes to go on the ride the first time, we were in the middle of the ride so we didn't get that wet. But when we went on it a second time we were at the front & we got absolutely drowned but we had fun it was a warm day. Just one tip if you don,t mind going on this ride as a single rider you only have to wait at least 10 min or less.",Brian J
50,Raptor Encounter is Great,We visited the Raptor Encounter while at Universal Studios Hollywood and it was worth it. Fun for all ages. A trainer in Jurassic Park uniform plays an animal trainer to a huge velociraptor (actually a guy in a costume.) The costume is extremely realistic so it takes little imagination to enjoy this.,0221Serendipity
40,Wet ride,"The lines were not that bad in the afternoon. Maybe 50 minutes. Got totally soaked, on the first drop sitting in the front of the boat. The king drop was not that bad.",wook323
50,"Great experience, with an amazing end","The lines are long, but worth it. Would advise to go to the lower lot as soon as it opens. The ride is awesome, and the story runs well. You actually feel like entering the movie. The end is great, and the T Rex is awesome. You do get really really wet though, so be mindful of that.",Rohan C
50,WELCOME to JURASSIC PARK!!!!,Another favorite movie growing up led to my excitement for this ride. It takes you through a quality storyline with action and surprises. You also dont really care about getting wet because you are so excited to be riding!,Andrew B
50,Still A Great Ride,"Still a must do attraction, it’s been around now for years but it’s still brilliant. I would certainly recommend to all.",SixtyOne
40,You will get wet,"We went on this ride after dark, and it adds a whole new level to the already cool ride. It is a quick log flume ride, but it is a lot of fun and you will get wet!I will say that it would be nice to see the ride get a facelift. There are some parts where it is starting to show its age (The T-Rex at the end is a great example) and with the new Jurassic World movies out, it presents a great way to update the ride.",Dave D
50,Favourite Ride in Universal,I'm not saying its the best. Just my favourite as jurassic park is my favourite film. Just wish it was a bit longer. Plus prepare to get wet. I would happily go on this several times a day :),Steve_In_Ulster
50,Dinosaurs,This is an amazing ride for fans of all ages. It's a short boat ride that ends with a big splash in the river. Be ready to get wet though. Worth the wait.,Sachin_Zarekar
50,Brings the Movie to YOU!,"Jurassic Park the Ride is a quick but eyeful of eye candy, especially for Jurassic Park enthusiasts!!! It's not a cheesy water ride with a few dinosaurs, it's a well thought out, detailed ride taking a few cues from the movie. That Drop...WOW!!!! You will definitely get wet!!! Worth the wait, especially on a hot day.",gcfam79
50,Amazing experience,Jurassic Park The Ride provides an amazing experience. You ride with a boat across the studio where the Jurassic park movie was filmed and at the end of the ride you get splashed with the river's water.,AntoNic7
50,You will get wet!!!,Somewhat short ride in comparison to the 45 minutes we waited in line but it was well worth it! They aren't kidding when they tell you that you will get wet!,KA L
50,Good fun!,"If you love the movie, you will love the ride. They did a great job of recreating the whole environment. One odd thing, the truck that slides down and lands in the water was not working and from what I gather it rarely is. (not a positive)Go and have a great time! Just get into the fun! it is so great!",Andy B
