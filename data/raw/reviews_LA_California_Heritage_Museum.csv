30,Pleasant surprise.,"Family-owned vintage home had morphed into a (small) museum. There was only one exhibition but the guides were very friendly, talking to you like invited guests.The “R&R Legends” on the 2nd floor displayed some 50 concert snapshots from the ‘lost negatives of Michael Friedman’.They sure were lost. I’ve never seen these pictures before, with 60s icons like Mick, Janis, Kristofferson, Rita Coolidge & the band. Exhibit will last until July 15 when it will move to Cleveland.Also liked the antiques in the dining room, plates shaped out of spare aluminum, ceramic tile-covered cocktail tables and Southwestern style furniture.Very much appreciated the Meyers pottery. The handcrafted kitchenware had a warm, organic look and looked very colorful for unglazed items. This stuff could fly off the shelves if it were up for sale!Short visit revealed pleasant surprises. Not bad for a $5 donation!",Lapster2011
40,A must-see hidden gem of Santa Monica,"If you're headed to the the beach, take time to visit this hidden art gem before sand gets in your shoes. Current exhibits featuring artist Lou D'Elia are outstanding. D'Elia'a ""Project Warhol"" and the main level ""Some Assemblage Required"" work are one of a kind and thought-provoking. A must-see.",Alberta A
50,Hidden gem run by great people,"I passed by this house and didn't know what it was but decided to take a look and I'm glad I did! The house is really striking and picturesque, as is the one opposite. I paid $5 admission and it was totally worth it. The guides could not have been nicer, and they had such a thorough knowledge of the history of the house, which feels like a time capsule and the origins of everything inside it, with some really cool and interesting anecdotes about Santa Monica.I went during the lost Rock n Roll images exhibition which was great too with fun stories behind the images from the photographer, which gave a real insight into that era of music. It's pretty small but the people giving the tour really made it worth the while!",samtaylorme
30,Nice stop in Santa Monica,The California heritage Museum is a good place to spend some time while you are in Santa Monica. The museum is in a converted home dating from the Victorian era and is in a quaint area of the city and offers some additional history to the visitor.,buffalojim67
40,History Buffs wil love this gem in a Victorian mansion,"Located on Main St about a mile South of the 3rd St Promenade, this small museum is in one of the first Victorian houses built in Santa Monica. It is furnished with period-correct furnishings and decor on the ground floor, while upstairs you'll find an art gallery with special exhibitions. Docents guide you through the house and it's a great way to spend an hour getting a brief overview of the founding and early history of Santa Monica and surrounding areas.",Steve D
50,A Blast from the Past!,"The history covered in the museum from the first Native Americans, Spanish occupation hence ""Santa"" or ""San"" heading most of the bigger areas in LA. Shirley Temple lived here. History of Flight in this area.",Sue B
50,Haunted House,"One of the first houses to be built in Santa Monica (for a local dignitary) this isn't your typical museum. The house is decorated and furnished in the 1900-1930 era (...or eerie?). Nothing is behind glass and you feel you have stepped back in time and standing in the original owners home. Run by volunteers, we were shown around by Mike, who pointed-out old photos, drinks cabinets disguised as sideboards (from Prohibition) and the dining table set ready for dinner (in fashionable local tableware of the time). Free entry (but run entirely on donations) we gave the same as entry to a more formal and state funded museum. NB Great for Nosey Parkers!",Shirley S
50,Many Things Santa Monica,local exhibits vary and offer a fun view of Santa Monica and local artists. It's a fun place - check it out!,SMOgal
40,What a gem!,"This place is beautiful. We saw a band play here in the basement, where they have a bar and lounge, which was a very cool experience. I also noticed they have gourmet food trucks in the parking lot on Tuesday's. Totally worth checking out!",Michelle G
40,Interesting place,"I recently visited this little museum. The volunteer guides were very well informed. The tour of the house was very interesting and even had a piece of furniture Bela Legosi (Dracula) once owned. They had a current exhibition also of native american indian photographs and navaho rugs. However, I am not sure if this exhibition is permanent.",bilby2009
40,Great Museum on Main Street Santa Monica,"The California Heritage Museum offers wonderful exhibits that take you back in time to eras in California history. The collections are exhibited in a late 19th century home, which is a delight to walk through. If you are old enough, you will recognize items that bring back memories from your past. Docents are available to explain, talk, share. When in Santa Monica, you can combine the museum visit with a stroll along the street, visiting quaint shops and taking time to get a meal or nosh. You can also walk to the Venice beach, which is close by.",tapbelle
50,"Fascinating piece of ""relatively"" old California","There was a wonderful exhibit of Hawaiian style furnishings, including wonderful kitschy Hawaiian lamps, and lovely rattan furniture. It was California meets Hawaii in the living room and the dining room.",KLMChicago_IL
30,Small museum well worth a visit,"One of oldest houses in neighborhood, with fascinating movie poster collection upstairs from 1930s to 1950s, and downstairs two rooms showing Hawaii style furniture. What really makes it is the enthusiasm and knowledge of the guides who recount the history.",hardenedtraveler
