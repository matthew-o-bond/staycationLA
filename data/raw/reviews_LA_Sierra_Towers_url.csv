50,Best Geostrategic Place in LA,"I used to live next door in Doheny in a high rise and amongst three high rises in Doheny, Siera is the best. I cant afford this place becasue its bloody pricey, an studio rent is $6K a month and for buy its north $1.5M. I think even if you buy you still have to pay at least $1K HOA for a one bedroom. But it is fancy, clean, best location, with a phenomenal view. You get to have the hill view and Playboy mansion view without get stuck up in the hill.An elevator ride take you to roof of the LA. Southern exposure, view from sea to downtown. But again you really have to be loaded to live there, and if things turn bad financially and you have to move out get ready for big depression and separation anxiety. The view and the location is addictive.I always fancy to have top floor facing south and threw killers parties on the terrace.",French H
