50,Electric bike tour,"Last weekend 4 of us rented electric bikes and went on a guided tour of the areas of Westlake Village and Agoura. It was really fun. The bikes were in excellent condition and looked pretty new. We had a shirt tutorial at the beginning and then took off! We rode single file along streets and really enjoyed it. We got to see some areas where we had never been, and it’s fun to see things from a bike! Electric bikes are easy to ride. You can pedal if you want, but you don’t have to! If you have the chance to try it, you should! We will definitely go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A8258EWkims
50,Amazing way to have a lot of fun,"My uncle and I wanted to do something together while doing something outdoors. This turned out to be the perfect thing to do. The owners of Pedego 101, Linda and John, are very knowledgeable about the bikes and the area. They spent the time to fit the bikes and helmets to make sure we were very comfortable before we left. We went on a two hour ride around the local lakes and through parts of Hidden Valley. The scenery is beautiful and the eBikes were great to ride. We highly recommend this activity for seeing the beauty of the area while getting some exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249genes
50,Out for a ride,We had the best time renting the e-bikes. Pedeco in Westlake Village was great in giving us a map and letting us make our own tour of the area. We only had an hour which was fun but I would have loved to spend more time riding if I had the time. The owners were extremely knowledgeable and nice and made us feel comfortable.Can't wait to ride the e-bikes again. They let you peddle but give you a boost if you need it for the hills. Very fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spoole361
50,Purchasing a Pedego bike has been an excellent decision!,We purchased Pedego ebikes from John and Linda and it has been a fantastic experience. It is great exercise and the bikes are extremely comfortable. John and Linda run regular rides that helped us get to know the area. The experience can’t be beat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJJtravel
50,"Went on a ride with Owners, John and Linda","I went on a bike ride with Owners John and Linda. Linda organizes amazing rides. Linda leads the ride in the front and her husband, John rides in the back to make sure we are all safe. We went on a ride on Easter Sunday morning in Simi Valley which was beautiful! We all had breakfast at the Flying Yolk Restaurant afterwards, so much fun! I’m so glad I met John and Linda, I just wish I lived closer! To many more rides together!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate601799
50,So much Fun!,We have been interested in E-Bikes for some time. We rented bikes today with the thought that we would be out for maybe an hour. Linda & John at Pedego 101 couldn’t be nicer. We were out for 3 hours. We are newly retired and it was like riding a bike when you were a kid. Hope to be able to buy Bikes soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amf77
50,Electric Bicyles - what a great fun invention!,"We went on a tour of the Paramount Ranch (movie set that is still actively used for movie and TV shoots and weddings!), Malibu Creek State Park (formerly 20th Century Fox studio lot) and King Gillette Ranch. The tour was electric bike (25 miles round trip) and pleasant walks around the movie sets with Brian Rooney who is a very knowledgeable guide. Over 3 1/2 hours and every minute was enjoyable!Owners Linda and John handled the tour personally. They trained us well before we started and watched over us the entire time. Neither of us are athletes and I was a bit concerned about whether we could handle it. No problem! Electric bikes are fantastic!!!!! They do all the work, our job was to sit and steer.Will do it again. Too much fun not to repeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brbiam
