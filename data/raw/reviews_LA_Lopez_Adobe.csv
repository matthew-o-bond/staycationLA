50,Childhood memories,"I usually only rate restaurants, but when I saw the Lopez Adobe pop up in suggested places to review, I could not believe it and childhood memories came streaming back into my mind. In the early 1960's, when I was still a young boy, my immediate family moved to San Fernando because my Grandfather immigrated there in the 1950's.Our maid/nanny worked there cleaning, what was at that time a private residence, once a week for a few hours. I would go with her while she cleaned and I would play in the garden as she did her work. We lived about 5 blocks away down Pico Street, but ours was nothing as grand as the Lopez Adobe is.The 1971 earthquake did little damage to it, but I understand that the 1994 earthquake hit it pretty hard. It was restored to the tune of $200,00.I am glad to see that it remains a museum and was happy to see it after all these years.",Ibizan_Yankee
