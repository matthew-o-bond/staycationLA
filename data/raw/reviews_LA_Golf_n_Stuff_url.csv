50,Amazing,My son enjoyed this Visit a lot!! It was a wonderful day and he met some friends over there and spent the time paying and had a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/583blancaa
10,Honesty disapproved,"My friend and I were playing Crossy road and had gotten the jackpot it was 202 to beat and I scored 204 and I should have gotten 1,204 but I had only gotten 286 tickes extremely dissatisfied never going back and not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Llmolk
50,Amazed How Clean Place Was,"Our family enjoyed the mini golf course and was surprised how well the course was kept up. Everything on the 18 holes was in working condition. The staff was friendly. A must stop if you are a Karate Kid movie fan. Didn't make it inside the Party Center, but there is a poster on the wall where you pay for mini golf of the movie. Also had bumper water boats to ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichfam
50,"You've still got it, Golf N' Stuff","My son’s only Spring Break request was to play miniature golf, so we hit the road and visited three different mini golf courses. The best, by far, was Golf N’ Stuff. I remember going there for church outings way back in the 80s, and to see it in such good condition 30 + years later is great (and a relief to know that somethings don’t change). Each course and its holes are well maintained, and look fresh as it did in the 80s. The arcade has an overwhelming smell of Lysol mixed in with sweat, but at least you know they’re trying. And if you didn’t know that the date scene from the original Karate Kid was filmed there, you’ll definitely know by the end of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodFam3
50,My sons bday party,So awesome. The go karts are pretty cool.Staff is kool as well. Good place too take your kids. Its $23.00 for a 2-hrs wristband.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dnunez81
50,Amazing crazy golf!!,"My son loves crazy golf at home, so we decided to take a trip to golf n stuff.. ventured out on a week day, which was brilliant as it was quiet and we could take our time and enjoy the surroundings of this amazing place, choice of 4 different courses.. all 18 holes, which took us a good 2 hours to complete,just really taking our time.. well worth a visit, we came during the day and only the crazy golf was open,but as I understand at night the rest is open which includes go karts etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgk1412
50,Great Family Fun,"Spent a good amount of time and money there, but it was all worth it. Have been here while I was a little kid and now back there again with our kids. The water slide was a blast. But now it's gone. Mini golf and the go carts are a must while there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkie2003
40,Lots of fun!,"Great fun here. 4 golf course options give a lot of variety. Not too crowded and lots of activities, including the arcade where you can spend a lot of $$$. Staff always very friendly and courteous. I would go later in the afternoon because the heat is just too much before 3-4pm.Will come back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onep39
40,Good family fun,"Always a great place to go with the kids. I went here as a child, loved it. And now I take my kids, they love it. Just waiting for the two grand kids to be old enough and they are going to go too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lmjimenez72
50,Love this place!,I first found this place due to being a nerd and looking for 80's movie locations to visit (Karate Kid in this instance). I now make it a must visit any time i'm in LA as the mini golf is the best i've ever played.The go-karts are good fun too and there is a good selection of games in the arcade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2749RAjimh
50,Best Putt Putt I've Ever Seen!,"We had to come here because of the Karate Kid scenes in the movie. The miniature golf courses are amazing and the grounds are second to none. It's very well kept and incredible. We were here on spring break during the day so none of the water features were turned on and none of the rides were available until 4pm. The arcade has all of the newest arcades which is a bummer for us older kids who love the old 80's games. They did have a couple of retro style games that were a reboot of Ms Pacman, Galaga, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario Bros. but the joystick wasn't working. Most games are at least 4 tokens which is $1 each. The redemption games and prizes are decent. Overall a pretty good experience. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/studio523
40,Birthday Fun,"My husband, our two teens, my youngest son, and I had a wonderful day at Golf N' Stuff. It was my youngest son's first time going, and he really enjoyed it. We decided to take him for his birthday. It really is great fun for the whole family! We spent about two hours there. We each played a round of miniature golf, which is 18 holes. There are 3 courses to choose from. When we were done playing miniature golf, my youngest son and I raced on the Go Cart race track. They have single driver cars and those that seat 2. We chose the one with the passenger seat. I drove and my son was the passenger. He really enjoyed the ride. They also have bumper boats. We didn't play at the arcade, but we will do that next time. Maybe we'll also try the bumper boats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123sylviar
40,Week day fun for the family,"Took my grandsons to Golf N Stuff when they had an early release day from school. New skipped the expansive video game area and went straight to the mini-golf. boys aged 7, 5, and 3 had a great time. Not many hole in one shots, and no one kept score...just crazy fun running from hole to hole and working through the wide variety of golf scenarios. I would skip going on the weekend nights, as this place gets crazy busy. There are also some amusement park rides and go cart races for those so inclined. Great outing for youth groups and fairly inexpensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
40,Great Mini Golf time,"This is one of the only remaining mini golf in the area. It is situated between 105/5/605 freeway.Check in via Yelp to get a 2 dollar discount for up to 4 people. With discount $7.50 per game.They have an arcade and a bump car ride. The arcade games seem very dated.Course 3 has been remodel, so you get new carpet and fitted holes. Nice!!Course 4 is a bit more difficult then the other 3.Weekday during the day hardly any people even during summer. Weekends are busy.Food is overprice and does not look good. Many fast food restaurants near by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,Great place for birthday party for young children.,"Lots of arcade games and mini golf to keep kids engaged. Friendly staff. Reasonable pricing for groups. Takes reservations. Can provide own cake, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlums
30,Nice place to go and have fun,"Have not been to that place in many years. Seen and been by there and I've been waiting to get back there and have Some fun again. Tia time I'm taking the wife and kid. Sad to see that they removed the water slide, but I'm glad they did cuz I've heard that there's have been some major accidents. But still can't wait to get back and race the wife in the go-carts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkie2003
30,Fun place! But.....,Employees need better training! I took my son for his bday we had his 2nd party here. We traveled all the way from Las Vegas to have his party here. Well we get there we are told where to go.( I arrived 30 mins early) when the party started and all of my guests were there they tell me that the gir who greeted me never checked me in! Okay.... Wasted 15 mins of my life. Then as the party is going I made sure to tell the girls that those 20 mins I wasted I was going to use them in party room. So 2 days before your party they call to confirm and to do the adult meals. Well I ordered 4 pizzas (I believe) and some pitchers. Well when I get there I see LITTLE CAESARS pizza ( I paid 11$ a pizza by the way pepperoni and cheese) so I asked them how come? They said they ran out!!! Okay so u run out and u get me little Caesars when we all know that pizza is 5$? U are charging me more than double!!! Well the girls were speechless had no idea what to tell me. Everyone just seemed clueless. If I ever have a party here I would request to only deal with manager because 1 employees are not well trained and 2 I feel ripped off. Any way the plus side is that it's really fun and every child enjoyed themselves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalief42
50,Granddaughter's Favorite Place!,"She loves this place even more than Chuck E Cheese or the McDonald's Play Place. That's saying something. She is 3 1/2 and knows what's good around here already. Just because she cannot get on half the rides is no reason for YOU to not try it though. They have bumper cars, a go-cart track, and a couple of thrilling rides to boot. You can buy an all day pass here for under $20 so the value is great as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
30,Good for family,"I have gone to GNS since I was a teen, lots of games for kids & golf, rides and food. Would recommend for a family day out or a kids birthday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee2465
40,Family Fun,"Yes, the original Karate Kid was filmed here. At one time the world record for tree house sitting was broken here. But Golf 'n Stuff is really a flashback type place. Great miniature golf with the traps and fun structures. Extensive arcade. A few carnival type rides. This is really a family outing place reminiscent of the 70s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimoClark
40,*The Karate Kid was filmed here!*,"Bumper Boats, Mini Golf, Arcade, Pizza, Go Carts, etc. Also, the 1984 movie The Karate Kid was filmed here. There is a picture collage of some of the scenes hanging up in the arcade. The slide from the movie has been torn down. Check this place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayhawkgrant
40,Fun for the entire family,"If you have kids and/or you just like family entertainment this is a very good place to visit. They have bumper cars, bumper boats, car racing, arcade and of course miniature golf - two courses. Great place to spend several hours just having fun.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3678JOHN
40,A Must for Fans of The Karate Kid!,"Yup, as the title suggests, I went to Golf n' Stuff just because it's featured in The Karate Kid! My boyfriend and I are great fans of the movie so wanted to recreate Daniel and Ali's date! Yes, it's a bit tired and doesn't have the waterslide anymore, but it was the perfect kitsch date. We bought an unlimited ticket which includes a round of mini golf. The arcade had lots of great games and you collect tickets as you play which entitles you to a prize that you select at the front desk. We also went on the Go-Karts, the bumper boats and bumper cars. The mini golf course was excellent. Would love to go again, if only I didn't live on the other side of the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreamingisfree
40,Golf n' Stuff,"Golf n' stuff has a very extensive arcade. Their miniature golf course is pretty good, with far more than 18 holes, they give you an option to run the course several ways. My biggest problem is that late at night it does become a teen hangout. It can get fairly rowdy. Afternoons are a blast though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dereckc725
40,Fun for the kids,"We went to Golf and Stuff as a way to keep my daughter happy. 18 hole miniature golf course, The facilities were fairly clean, the extra amusements they had there were reasonably fun, but if you go with kids, be warned that it does turn into a hang out for older teenagers later at night. great day fun, not so much at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DereckS_13
40,Best 44th Birthday Celebration Ever !,"Three of us fully-grown adults spent the day here to celebrate a birthday, and I can't remember the last time I've laughed so hard. We had our choice of four mini-golf courses so we weren't held up waiting for players in front of us. The landscaping looks healthy, and the hole figurines are in great shape with fresh paint. We had lots of hilarious photos with the pirate and the gorilla and the big shoes.We guessed that the go-carts would go faster for little people who weigh less, but it was fun to speed around the track. The bumper boats are a bit challenging to manuever, but that's what makes it so funny. We loved smashing into each other with the bumper cars. The DiskO ride was too much for us so we didn't check that out, but we did make a video with our heads dancing to ""Whoomp There It Is"" that will be a family classic. Sure, it was silliness but we all had a great time.(PS, if you don't eat fast food, do some research first about where you want to eat while you're in the area - we didn't plan that part and had some trouble finding somewhere that appealed to us.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyloans

They have nice 18 mini golf course to spend your time and on top of it arcade games & also go-cart, bumper boats (which was the most fun loving thing. bumper cars, & other rides too. Fun place to spend a day with family or friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RUBY_110
