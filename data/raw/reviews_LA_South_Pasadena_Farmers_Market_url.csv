40,Like the rest,Fish Farmers Market is like most all the other ones anywhere you go. Quaint attractive and fun but it just seems like they're selling things that they bought it the local grocery store and then marked up. Maybe that's not really the case but that's the feeling I get. It's certainly pricier than a local supermarket. But I guess you're paying for the fun and the experience. Give it a try and see if you agree. It'll seem like deja vu,Old Pro
50,Always good!,Many vendors ready to serve! Always an eclectic venue of vendors and love the flower selection! Highly recommended!,Peppy H
50,A fun market with great produce,"Always busy with stalls selling produce, honey, desserts, ethnic food (Indian, Mediterranean, Asian) plants etc. Thursdays 4-6 pm. Go early and find a parking spot nearby as the nearby streets are closed when the market is on.",Ann S
50,"Great source for vegetables, fruits etc and most important a KNIFE sharpening service",Jeff's Knife Sharpening Service is at So Pasadena Farmers Market every other Thursday. He services all kinds of knives and scissors.,Lynda S

50,My favorite,"For food variety and atmosphere and friendly people this is the best Farmers market! Plenty of places to eat. The only drawback is that there are no crafts. But they make it up make up for it with the lovely grass areas, the musicians and the museum! There's something wonderful about that train stopping next to the farmers market also that makes it very quaint! The whole area around the Farmers market is so reminiscent of an untouched part of the Midwest. It really is a lovely experience shopping here.",Erudite_journey

20,very small,"Very few venders, mostly manufactured items, very few true homemade crafts, only one food vender, off the road a bit so no obvious to passers by either.",travelmom252017
40,A very pleasant Farmer's Market,"It is still a small Farmer's Market, yet it seems to grow. The quality of the produce and fruit are just outstanding and the vendors are all very sweet and friendly. It is something to look forward to every Thursday afternoon/evening. Very conveniently located at the South Pasadena Metro Gold Line Station (Mission at Meridian). Also some tasty food available, too.",geotech522
40,Fresh produce and cooked delights,"This is a nice farmers market in South Pasadena, every Thursday night, located right at the South Pasadena train station. Lots of fresh produce. Many cook food vendors. Even oysters on the half shell.",PilotMichael
50,I love this market more every week!,"Seriously, can't get enough of this place! I love the amazingly fresh produce, the yummy prepared foods, the hometown community feel with so much diversity and multi-generational attendance, and the people who make this place happen! I leave every week with more that I can carry and a smile on my face. The food is out of this world.",Buckeyetoyou
50,Really Good Market,"The Metro Line has a stop right by the market. There is a good variety of products presented. The fruit, vegetables, meats and condiments offered for sale appear to be a high quality. They might be expensive but there are things like squash blossoms that are impossible to find this time of year. This is one of the best street marked we have seen in California.",lynndds
40,Excellent farmers market every Thursday,I accidentally came across this farmers market on my way to meet a friend for a glass of wine. Lots of good fruits and vegetables as you might expect. The biggest surprise for me was fresh shucked oysters on the half shell. Yummy yummy yummy.,PilotMichael
40,Fun market to visit -don't forget your bag of Kettle corn!,"As a local, I enjoy coming down here sometimes and enjoying the atmosphere of the market. The kettle corn is the best though! You can buy a bag and munch on it as you walk around the market and you'll still have some when you go home!",MrBalan
40,Friendly small-town farmer's market,"Conveniently located by the South Pasadena Gold Line station, this is a great place to buy fruits and vegetables. Most of the produce is organic and produced by small independent farmers, which explains why the prices are a little high. You can buy a variety of other items as well, including baked goods, olive oil, goat's cheese, fish, meat, and eggs. Many stalls offer tasty prepared food as well. After shopping, it's very pleasant to stop for a glass of wine and a snack at Nicole's, a French caf√© that stays open until 7:30 pm on market day (Thursdays).",Lisa K
30,Surprisingly expensive fruit. Great family atmosphere.,I love markets and had to visit this one. But I found that while there were great samples out for folks (a big plus in my book) the prices of the fruit and vegetables were quite steep compared to prices in places like Trader Joe's. The guy selling flowers on one of the ends of the market streets however had wonderful blooms and great prices. Good variety of mushrooms in several stands. Lots of fruit and vegetable stands to choose from. Nice family atmosphere.,Ann S
