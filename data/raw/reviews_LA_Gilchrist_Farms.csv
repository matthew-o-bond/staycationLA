50,Great time at Gilchrist Farms,"We took our two year old nephew 2 weeks ago.He rode on a wagon, train and a pony. He really loved it. We saw all the animals and then went into the petting zoo. He was able to interact with goats, chickens and sheep. We watched the staff milka goat. It was great. All this was fun but the highlight was the staff. Just wonderful people and so willing to please us. If you have the opportunity, don’t miss this place. Just terrific. I understand they decorate the farm for Halloween and have a pumpkin patch. Sound like fun.",Bethlinda
50,You should go there,"Kid's love the place. You can easily spend 2-3 hours. Friendly people. I think, it's family owned. We will definitely revisit",Andy S
30,Tell Me...Are You? Or are You?,"I just dislike people that cannot make up their minds...Don't You? Well that's what I am suffering from when I started this review. Do I call this the Lombardi Ranch, as it's been called since I came up here in 1968 on visits. Or is it NOW...The Gilchrist Farm? Well what's in a name. The central theme here is Halloween time (September to November). This is the fall time here such as it is in SoCal. Sometimes it does Rain, but I can't even remember when was the last time. It is is usually warm to warmer. And this is a KID attraction so leave the Teens Home! Petting Goats and going on rides to look at Sunflowers and Pumpkins is not their ""Thing."" Sometimes there are vegetables-fruits for sale and some are even grown locally. Plan on spending 1-2 hours here if you can hold your child's excitement! This is an OK place to go. It desperately NEEDS an Identity and some $$ for improvements and marketing. Go and have Fun with your younger aged child (4-11)",Steve
40,Great place for young chldren,"We took our 2 grandchildren, ages 6 & 8, on a weekday. We paid for the all in one ticket for each child. The children enjoyed riding the horses and were allowed to stay on for an extended period of time since there was no one waiting.in line. They also enjoyed the petting area. We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating.",Frank P
30,Pumpkin Patch,"This was our first time to Gilchrist Farms pumpkin patch. In the past, we’ve always gone to Lombardi Ranch but due to the drought, Lombardi’s is closed until further notice. We were quite disappointed as we were expecting a venue much like the one Lombardi Ranch put on during the fall harvest time. This place was very dusty; at times it was so bad that my kids (2yrs. and 3yrs old) complained that they couldn’t see. And there was a terrible stench coming from the animal pens that finally made us decide it was time to go home after spending only about an hour there. We usually spend a couple hours at Lombardi Ranch enjoying the harvest festivities. Gilchrist Farm did have food stands and offered live entertainment that presumably was performed by local kids, which Lombardi Ranch hadn’t offered in the years past. Until Lombardi Ranch opens up again, Gilchrist Farm is currently the only place in the Santa Clarita area that offers a harvest pumpkin patch of this magnitude.",RktDogg
