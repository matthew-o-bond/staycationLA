50,Pristine Classic Catholic,We attended two masses here and found a very traditional and welcoming church-within walking distance of all hotels and early and late mass schedules were quite helpful.,BrooklynTom2014
40,Cactus garden,So this is a nice church opposite another church. It has a cactus garden donated outside which was lovely to sit. Simple stained glass window inside,youke_worldwide
40,A lovely experience,"Although I am not Catholic, this is a peaceful and spiritual place. The design of the stained glass windows makes the modern church light and airy. Also this is a community church, which helps its people. Very impressed.",Debbie Q
50,Sunday Mass,"Beautiful Church , Priest gave a great sermon and Sister Virginia greeted everyone prior to start of Mass. Wonderful ...",kevinquinlivan58
50,Love this church!,This is the only church in LA that I've been to that feels homey. All the other ones have been super cold. The people here are great!,luisam1996
40,Lovely atmosphere,We stopped by on our walk. Always interested to see the inside of local communities where we are visiting. This was a simple but charming place. Nobody about but a real feel of being welcome.,Lavarcham
50,A Most Welcoming Sanctuary,"It is a modern church and does not replicate the ornate and majestic cathedrals in the US. Irrespective, it is so welcoming to have a church to worship in your travels. I attended weekday masses at 06:30 in the morning and it felt so good. On other times of the day when there is no service, one can spend the time in reflection inside the church.",TravelBug
50,Nice Service,Whilst visiting Beverly Hills from Australia we had the opportunity to attend Sunday mass at the Good Shepherd.Gorgeous little church!,DaisyO2014
50,Wonderful Service,This is a wonderful church and it isn't pretentious or Hollywood. The Priest always has very wise and important messages.,Catherine B
40,Not glamourous just a simple church.,"Although it's called the church of the stars, you probably won't see celebrities there. It's a simple mission styled church located in a beautiful neighborhood. It's very low keyed and it's center is on God . I noticed several parishoners bringing food for some of the homeless people outside and the sermon was on giving gifts to christ by being a neighbor to others.",joeyb348
50,Great church while travelling,"Very friendly church, great for mass if travelling. The church itself is not impressive inside but I enjoyed the grounds surrounding it. I initially choose this church because I read it was the home parish of Danny Thomas. It is very close to several places to eat and Rodeo Drive, we were able to attend mass, do some sightseeing, and eat all without moving the vehicle.",iroamaround67801
50,Welcoming Catholic Church,"We visited this beautiful Mission Revival Style Catholic church at the end of the day. Very inviting with the doors on Santa Monica opened, we felt welcomed. As the evening sun illuminated the stained-glass windows, a colorful prism of light was created. We weren't attending mass and still we decided to stay, take a break and slow down. Small in structure, a personal spiritual experience naturally results from a visit to Good Shepherd Catholic Church. We will return on our next visit to once again allow ourselves the luxury to relax, rejuvenate and focus.",RikiUSA
50,Sunday Mass,Attend mass when I take the early flight from the east coast and it is a very nice mass with a friendly congregation.,Alan G
30,A quick visit,Almost always try to go to churches or catherdrals when we travel. We stopped by to look around just to say we did.,JDTravelhome
30,Church of the Stars,"Many celebrities have been baptized, married, and memorialized here. If you're Catholic living in Bev Hills, this is your church.",JohnRyan724
40,Note the Stained Glass and Carved Wood Doors and Pediments,We were downtown and drawn to this beautiful church so close to the shopping district. We particularly enjoyed the carvings in the doors and pediments and the stained glass windows with interspersed pieces of colorful glass that give them a kaleidoscope feel.,Robert C
40,beautiful church,"Beautiful church in a beautiful neighborhood. If you're driving around sight seeing, this is a place you might want to see.",Jaqtwo
50,This Historic Church Welcomes You!,"A beautiful church that dates back to the 1920s.It has been in movies and many regular church goers over the years have been celebrities.Famous funerals including those of Frank Sinatra and Rudolph Valentino were held here.A large church with many masses during the week, Good Shepherd makes sure your religious needs are met.You will feel comfortable and in awe of the stained glass windows that line both sides of the church and elsewhere.Christmas and Easter are the most popular times and the church is breathtakingly decorated for those holidays.Everyone is welcome and no matter what your beliefs are, you will have a lasting memory of this church.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
50,Best place of workship for Catholics and fans of Hollywood history,"Good Shepherd is a place for the Catholics at heart, with traditional masses on Sundays and inspiring sermons from the wonderful priests assigned to this church. Everyone at this church makes you feel as part of a large family without being overly serious. There is the 50+ club that organizes great outings and parties, where you can enjoy yourself with people who have the same values as your own - it is lively, fun and a great place to meet people as a group. There are activities for the whole family - from teens to adults in a great atmosphere. And if you are just here for a visit, you can read about all the movie starts who attend mass here, and those ones who did in the past (including Marilyn Monroe's wedding at this church). A beautiful church to go and pray when you want a moment of solitude. Been attending this church for 30+ years.",Myriam C
40,Beautiful Catholic Church,"Very nice....highly recommend to any Catholic. Comfortable, holy and a blessed Communion.Parking a little tricky with only a small parking lot.",Charis2009
50,One of the shortest (Friday) Masses ever!,"I was not able to go on Sunday so I went on Friday. Very short Mass! It has air conditioning too, as most Churches do.",Me W
50,A wonderful Good Friday mass,The service was so beautiful and the music just angelic. Celebrating Good Friday with this parish will forever be a special memory for me and my family. My youngest son was asked to help hold up the cross during the veneration and I thought that was very special for him. The people are warm and friendly and it did not feel like we were visitors. Thank you Good Shepherd Catholic Church for your warmth and kindness to travellers as well as praying for our safety as we go home:),Amanda G
40,"Nice visit, very quaint","If you stay at the Beverly Hilton, you can walk to the church. It is not open all the time, we made two trips to see it. It is not a big church, but quaint inside.",flutterbyelady
50,An oxymoron...,Sweet and nice place to stop and meditate regardless your denomination. Particularly fresh in hot summer days.Frozen in time when Hollywood was more diverse.,VBCJJ
50,Movie Stars,Beautiful and holy feeling...can almost feel the ghosts of movie stars that attended this church and later had their funeral there. One well known was Frank Sinatra.,nefertari007
40,A presence that contrasts with the most common image of Beverly Hills,"Midway between the luxurious southern section of Rodeo Drive and quiet drives that climb towards the Beverly Hills Hotel you don't expect to find a church. But there is. Although the church is Catholic, the benches have the characteristic ""closed"" shape of the Reformed churches. If you come in the priest or other religious, the reception will be friendly.Quiet, bright (though obviously with nothing really historical): stop in it can be a nice break for both the believer and for the non-believer.",Brun066
50,Beautiful and Traditional,I love this church. From the beautiful traditional appearance to the gorgeous location to the inspirational yet traditional Catholic Mass.,Marc B
50,"Sweet, lovely parishoners","We belong to a different parish, but were visiting, and stopped in for Mass. The church is simple, sweet, and everyone very lovely, even in the heart of Beverly Hills. Don't feel intimidated if you are visiting Los Angeles - even the celebrities were low key and friendly. Stop in.",Dorothy S

40,Part of Beverly Hills fine old religious community,"A lovely old Spanish building---and a good place for ""star gazing""---but only if you really care about attending services.",meralee1122
50,Beautiful and historic,"My parents were married here in the mid-1950s, and my cousin in the late 1980s and I was a bridesmaid. My grandparents lived in the neighborhood and worshipped there, so wanted to revisit and show my teenage daughter.",Kathleen R
40,Very nice Catholic church,If you are looking for a Catholic church to visit when in Beverly Hills- this one is unpretentious and was the church home to Frank Sinatra too! They have many services throughout the day. Staff is warm and friendly too. I like the early 8 30 service on Sundays.,NICKIE D
40,Lovely & friendly church,Good Shepherd is a lovely church and very welcoming. The priest seemed very nice - memorable & relatable homily.,lmh123ca
50,Original church to the stars!,"Built in downtown Beverly Hills this was ""the church old Beverly Hills movie stars and their families used to attend. Nowadays you still may spot some old time acting royalty during high mass.",Prrss_Media_Assoc
50,The upscale crowd one prays for.,"I'm a traditionalist when it comes to churchgoing so, skip the guitars and humming and give me something with incense, a choir, a real presentation, and I'm in. Irish Father O'Brian is a wonderful confessor too so plan ahead if you need confession before communion. He's popular.",carlitogetsaround
40,Very nice Service,"Took my daughter there for Easter Service, beautiful church!",travelling234
40,The #1 Church in BH,A beautiful old and historic(by Hollywood standards) church located at the foot of the BH flats and across Santa Monica Blvd. from the shopping and dining part of BH.Lovely to visit and see someof the famous people who have gotten married there or had there funerals there.,mitchell k
