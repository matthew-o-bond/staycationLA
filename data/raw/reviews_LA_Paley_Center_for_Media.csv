30,Closing 1/5/20,"We got to the museum and it turned out they had no exhibits going right now, as everything was geared to kids craft projects and visits with Santa. They told us that they will be closing January 5th as the building will be changed to something else - perhaps a hotel.",napavalleydiner
30,Fairly interesting,"Great to have free admission (you can donate if you like) and free underground parking. Would have been better if there had been an exhibit that we were interested in, but what was there was good - costumes from the Masked Singer and from Suits. There were some great cartoons on the walls and a room where you could go in for up to 90 minutes and have access to lots of TV and film clips.",Savcat
50,Great museum in the heart of BH!,"Admission is free to most of the exhibits. Check out the website for the current schedule. Free parking in the underground structure, entrance from S. Santa Monica Blvd.",dina857
40,Wonderful,"Saw the Marilyn Monroe exhibit there. Everything was displayed beautifully and there was a film about Marilyn's life playing. The view from the top of the building is beautiful. However, there is no gift shop and the workers at the front desk were condescending and a bit rude.",Jedimommy
50,Essentially Paley - Essentially Marilyn,"We visited our local Paley Center for Media initially to support a local Beverly Hills #BoldBH initiative with a local artist Alexa Meade but upon arrival we realized that there was a beautiful and historical exhibit called: ""Essentially Marilyn"" and many of her original dresses from a selection of her movies were on display. What I love about the Paley center is that they have items on display that are icons of the entertainment industry and were actually used in film and television. They are local historians covering many genres and eras keeping history and entertainment alive. What I also love is that there is always something new from entertainment history to see.",Mei J
40,From George Vreeland Hill,"I was just there and loved the new Marilyn Monroe exhibit.They have a few cool exhibits that give you a look into TV, the movies and other forms of media.It's free.It's worth an hour or two.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
30,I expected more,We went to the Paley Center because they were promoting an exhibition of costumes from the Crown. Upon arrival we were disappointed that the big exhibit was all of about 10 costumes that took 5 minutes to see. They were also promoting a Shark Week exhibit that was equally as dismal.,michaell1232014
30,the crown & Lucille ball exhibition,"There are only a few exhibits here. I read a brief history of the ABC founder, some costumes from the Crown and a Lucille Ball TV exhibit. The building itself is quite nice with very simple designs",youke_worldwide
50,The Crown,The Paley Center is free to the public with suggested donations. I enjoyed the “Crown” wardrobe exhibition. The second floor offers an extensive exhibit of Lucille Ball memorabilia. You can watch and listen (headphones) different clips from some of her best episodes. It’s a must stop while shopping on Rodeo Drive!,Homecoming80
50,I am that age where TV and I went from black and white to color,"A fabulous destination for anyone with care or passion for historical TV, viewing styles, hair, cars, topics of the day....User friendly for all ages.",384deano
50,Easy visit and very entertaining,How great to offer visitors free underground parking! Found easily and took the elevator up to the main entrance. Loved the American Horror Story Costume exhibit -- also free! And even went to the screening library to watch the AHS cast talk about the Roanoke season filming from this year's Paley Fest. Kind staff and took lots of photos. Stop at Sprinkles Cupcakes a few minutes away for a treat to round out your visit!,Donna D
50,Excellent Stop for the Culture Lover,"I stopped in here one morning to take in the AHS exhibit that had just gone up. You can't beat the free admission and the Beverly Hills location makes for some great city strolling and people watching.The AHS exhibit was sublime and beautifully curated. The selection of costumes was amazing and very well put together. The space was used quite well and allowed one to slowly take in every detail.Impressive audio and video catalogue available and a really cool theater that was showing old Dean Martin films at the time. You could kill twenty minutes or two hours there, it's all about how much you love being immersed in it.I highly recommend it and be on the lookout for special exhibits!",Caitlin K
50,Worth the trip!,"Our main reason for visiting was to see the AHS exhibit on display. Having a child who is a mega fan of the show, the expectations were high, but well met. The staff are very friendly and helpful .",LB91068
30,Wasted tremendous potential to have a very entertaining display of historical TV.,"This is a great facility for someone who wants to do research by viewing specific TV shows in one of 18 or 20 individual cubicles. Having been to Seattle's rock/music exhibit center or the News & Media Center in Washington DC, we expected to see informative, well organized displays about TV history (in the USA).... let's say snippets or extracts of the top ten or dozen TV shows in each year since ... or the best of Johnny Carson or the best of you name it. No. It does not work that way. You have to ask for what show you want to see and wait for the research attendant to finish with another visitor/researcher. The Paley Center has recently started showing exhibits of specific themes or topics. Unfortunately, when we visited they were unavailable since they were being replaced by newer ones. Dealing with traffic on and near Santa Monica Blvd was a major hassle. Surprised to discover free parking available in the building next to the Paley Center. Is that mentioned in their website ?",mongoose1950
40,Historical TV Library is Very Large and Convenient (just don't expect many displays),"My wife & I returned here, having visited the facility some twelve years ago. We had recalled how we could watch oldie TV shows in the library-like facility.On this visit we saw some exhibits dedicated to Black Women winning Awards in Hollywood, and another one focussing on Black Americans in the media. As I understand, these exhibits - on the first and second floors of the center - change periodically (and evidently these exhibits had been installed in February for Black History Month.)Oh... and there was a large collection of Al Hirschfeld drawings on display.But, in regard to what we had come to the Paley Center to use - access to their library of TV recordings - we discovered was much improved since our previous visit. Back in our first visit we needed to submit a title-slip of some kind and have the videotape provided to us. The center now has online access to digitized copies of old TV shows which the visitor pulls up at a computer console and controls the flow of the display (similar to a YouTube process.)I was very happy to view the very first episode of Superman. I was disappointed that some of my queries came up empty. For example, I wanted to see the pilot episode of Movin' On (truckers in the early 70's.) The staff assistant quickly researched my request and informed me that the main Paley Center (in NYC) had a video copy that had not been digitized and that they could digitize it and have it installed in the Beverly Hills system. Alas, as I was only visiting town for a couple days, I opted to not followup my concern on this. The bottom line is this: there are MANY old TV shows (and ads) in the Paley Center's system, but don't go there expecting to find everything.",EwanderingMan
50,A TV viewer's delight,"The displays covered 50 years of daytime viewing on CBS and were very interesting and informative. Even saw a ""celebrity"" who happened to be there at the same time.",flyboy1946
50,Great!,Having seen all my favourite TV casts do PaleyFest I just had to go in and have a look around.There was a big South Park exhibit which looked amazing but as I've never seen the show it didn't really mean anything to me.,Amy C
50,Outlander Exhibit Deluxe,"Outlander has grown since last June 2015 when a few costumes were on display at The Grove. This was a detailed exhibit of the favorite costumes. They could be examined closely to see the detailed work. Simply amazing that this much detail when into a TV series. It shows how much Ron D. Moore, Terry Dresbach, and Maril Davis AND their cast and crew has invested their blood, sweat and tears into this outstanding production.",Brunkerj
40,Great TV archive,"If you hate shopping and you're visiting Rodeo Drive someone who loves it, you could do worse than begging off to visit the Paley. It's small, room for one major exhibit. It was costumes and set design from the Outlander TV show when I visited. But the real treasure here is the searchable Broadcast archive. You could spend hours in there. Don't miss it if you're a TV or pop culture fan.",proscribe
50,OUTLANDER COSTUMES!,"The special exhibit of costumes from the TV show Outlander is spectacular. Seeing the detail on the clothes was a rare treat. You thought they were pretty on TV! Just wait till you see them up close! They also have a lot of footage of various scenes, plus filmed footage of the cast members being interviewed. This event is a must see for Outlander fans, and it's free, plus there's free parking across the street for two hours, Donations accepted in a box - no pressure. Elevator.",Linda C
40,Came to see the Outlander Exhibit,"We were visiting LA for 1 day and when I found out there was an Outlander Exhibit here, I had to see it. Admission is free but they suggest a donation. There was also a Shark VR exhibit happening at the same time. You look through the Samsung Gear at videos of sharks so while I was enjoying the Outlander costumes, my kids looked at the sharks. Loved to see all the hard work that went into the making of the costumes. Most of them were used in Season 2 when Claire and Jamie were in Paris. We parked on Rodeo Drive and walked here.",Tofurry
50,A Great Museum for Entertainment Buffs!,There's a Paley Center for Media in New York City too. This is a great place to get immersed in the world of media. You will need a few hours to really enjoy all the services available here.Sometimes they host events here too.,Adrianna A
40,"Special Events: Doritos Super Bowl Commercials exhibit, early David Bowie video interview","This modern building houses an amazing collection of television and radio programs (160,000+) going back to the 1940's and current popular shows. Historical moments reported on television such as Walter Cronkite's announcement of Kennedy's assassination can be viewed in your own module.In the month of February 2016 there is an exhibit of winning Doritos commercials from videos submitted by people for judging by the company. No ad agencies were used in the past 10 years. There are earphones to listen to the commercials that are shown on tvs, one commercial per tv.A video of an early interview in England with David Bowie was shown the day I visited. A good part of the interview was about long hair (1960's)!One of the permanent exhibits is the well known Al Hirshfield (New York) black and white drawings of famous people/performers where he frequently sketches his daughter Nina's name within the drawings.This is a venue that not even many Los Angelenos have discovered.",Jeanne S
30,Interesting space,"Headed to Paley Center not knowing what to expect, and it was a very well-kept interesting space. There were no special exhibits at the time, one had just concluded in the main hall, and there was a Doritos exhibit in conjunction with Super Bowl (commercials.) Large collection of caricatures, and sat for a time at the media archive, which was neat. Would recommend going for special programming.Staff was extremely friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable.",Lauren M
40,nice exhibit space,"We came to the Paley Center at the end of our vacation due to the amazing experience we had two years ago with the Warner Brothers exhibit. This exhibit was exiting had a lot of different costumes, sets, and artifacts. It also was very involved and expansive, and it was one of the best things we did all vacation. However, we came back this year to see the Olympics exhibit, and it was nice and has some interesting artifacts, but it was very underwhelming compared to the WB exhibit. Also, the lobby was very nice, and architecturally stunning. Overall, the Paley Center is a very nice place to visit, and it can be coupled with a visit to Rodeo Drive right near by.",Yaacov D
40,Special exhibit on typewriters is a surprise,"The museum is the largest archive of television in the world. The draw is that you can search the catalogue and find and listen to your favorites from years past. You can hear or watch the Jack Benny shows, and all the other greats of TVWe went this time for one of their new exhibits which was about typewriters. It was unique to hear that the media museum would be highlighting technology but the focus is not on the machine but on the writer. There were all types of typewriters, mostly manual but some electric. Each typewriter was list by make and model but more importantly by the person who used it. We saw models used by Jack London, Joe Dimaggio/Marilyn Monroe, G.B. Shaw, Orson Wells, Harold Robbins, Andy Rooney, et al. In each case, there was a description of what works were actually composed on these machines.A tie in was done to the archive as well where you could see footage of the person working on the machine itself. The exhibit is free but it is worth giving a donation to keep up this fine effort.The special exhibit is free but there is a $10 admission to access the archives.",NJTravellingfool
40,A Fun night.,I attend the CSI Final event at Paley. The staff was very nice to answer questions if needed that night. I did have to come back to take pictures of the displays the had for the event which the staff was nice enough to let me do. Venue is small so get there early.,CSIfan3167
20,not worth the time,"We saw the typewriter exhibition !!!, some interesting information , but not worth $10 USD. the media room was very busy and as you have to wait for someone to assist you we weren't able to see any opt the old footage",Margaret B
50,A MUST for media fans,"Great place for TV and radio buffs.....enormous collection of vintage shows, special screenings and events, Q and A's, and the annual PaleyFest. The site is modern, comfortable, and quite beautiful, and the neighborhood has lots of great eateries.",JohnRyan724
30,Interesting Venue,"We were not certain if this was a museum or research facility, and it turns out that it is a bit of both. There is a research area closed to the general public, but there are rotating exhibitions and a cinema showing films about the movie and television industries.The building itself is wort a mention; it is quite beautiful and designed by the same designer as the brilliant Getty Center (itself a must visit place).When we were there we saw an exhibit of beautiful typewriters used by a range of creatives, including Hemmingway, Orson Welles, Jack London, Tom Hanks and Tennessee Wiiliams. The cinema was showing a documentary on Billy Wilder and we walked in on a clip from Sunset Boulevard, which was fab. The reception desk was really friendly and the Center is free,and although donations are requested they don't push it.If you are in the area it is worth popping in, although I wouldn't trek across town for it. Diverting, but not special.",Chris A
20,Not much to see,"Only had a typewriter exhibit and a display of photographs from the television show Survivor. Everything else is just watching old television shows. No old sets, props,costumes, etc... on display. It is ""free"", but they do a hard sell of the $10 per person donation.",Shazamsue
40,Special Exhibits,I stopped in to see the special Survivor Exhibit. Lots of hands on things to do- like some of the Immunity Challenges from the show. The staff was very pleasant!,JenRyder
40,Great place to go see an exhibit,"There are several exhibits offered each year here, you should have a great experience. Plan on a few hours to look around.",Jason F
20,Small and staff is somewhat rude.,"We came here hoping to see a history of TV and Radio. Instead there was ONLY an exhibit on typewriters and of Rocky and Bullwinkle.The Rocky and Bullwinkle exhibit was sparse could have been put in a small room. They could have used the vast space for a more interesting exhibit.The museum is free except for the pressure to make the suggested donation. When we said we would make the donation after seeing the museum, the attendant said she could not give us tickets to enter. How is that a ""suggested donation?"" After being in the museum for 10 minutes, I would not donate more than five dollars per person.The attendant then spent the next 10 minutes trying to print the tickets and made a scene. It was very uncomfortable.Unlike the photos posted on travel advisor, there was no Friends couch or anything else of interest.We went to the library for a docent to tell at us that we are only entitled to an hour and a half of time despite the fact that the library is empty.By far and away, this is the most poorly run and designed Museum I have ever been to. The majority of the space is for stairs and walkways. Space could be used much better by exhibiting different art.This museum is so bad, it is the first museum I've ever been to where the gift shop is permanently closed but they still have the sign up for the shop. Moreover, the space, which is rather large, is completely empty.The only positive of the museum are the half dozen Hirschfeld on display.look for his daughters name, Nina, in each sketch.you will have more fun doing that and the rest of the museum.",Norjeff2
50,Don't Miss,"I would highly recommend a visit to the Paley Center. The wonderful archive resources available for viewing have largely been digitised since our last visit in 2010 and the ""Television Out of the Box"" exhibit was very impressive when we visited in summer 2013 - the Center partnered with Warner Brothers Television to put on display original costumes, props, authentic sets, vintage animation art and collectibles covering 60 years. The staff are wonderful and very helpful, this is the ONLY location we ALWAYS visit in Beverley Hills.",RichS67
40,Wonderful Museum that host great events,I always wanted to visit the Paley and was glad I finally got to go. This is not a huge museum and you need to check on the show in residence and your intended time to visit. They do what they do very well and I hope to return soon to attend a talk given by one of my favoirite writers or cast of a popular TV show.Very Cool!,David S
50,Good fun!,"Whether you are a fan of television or not, this place will have many things that will be up your alley. They have the set of the television show FRIENDS, HAPPY DAYS and other television replicas and props from the studios.I would recommend coming here and spending an hour, especially if you are here attending an event. Just come in a little early and look at their extra stuff and smile!",traveler4k
40,Good place to visit one time,"The staff was very friendly & helpful. Limited number of exhibits, wide ranging. The viewing library was interesting. Their website states ""Free admission. Suggested contribution: $10.00 for adults."" No, it is $10.00 to see everything. Unless, you just want to see the lobby and gift shop. Parking in the garage was not a problem.There is a lot of traffic from 12-5. If the hours were 9-2 or 10-3 that would seem better.",OutOnTheRange

20,Big let down,"We visited the Paley Center in LA while visiting, due to the mostly high reviews. This place would get 5 stars from me if it were free, but it's not, hence my disappointment. If I'm paying $10 pp to see an exhibit, I except more than 1 room of props. This place should definitely be free because it's not worth the $10 fee. We took our time looking through the props in the one room and we were done in 30 minutes! Granted, I enjoyed seeing the props from Friends, Pretty Little Liars, Seinfeld and Big Bang Theory, but I expected a lot more. We figured we'd check out the viewing room that is included to try and get a bit more of our money's worth, but it wasn't working. The audio was broken and when we told the front desk, we were informed that they ""aren't fixing it any more today since we close in an hour."" What?! I told the clerk I paid full price to see everything and was told that the room we'd already seen is the ""main attraction,"" basically dismissing everything else that's supposed to be included as worthless. I definitely would NOT pay to see this place, but if it's free for whatever reason, give it a shot.",Rebecca A
50,A must-see stop for television fans of all ages,"We are former employees of CBS, but if you're merely a fan of classic and current television, this museum has exhibits and guest lectures that will entertain and educate you. It's a wonderful place to visit.",JonK42
40,Wasn't sure what to expect,"This is a cross between a museum and a library. It appears the building is used for functions and lectures.The exhibit hall upstairs is where temporary exhibits are housed. Currently, it's a Warner Bros. TV exhibit. There are displays (props, costumes) from West Wing, Seinfeld, Friends and ER. The original Wonder Woman costume is also on display.With children with us, we did not take time to view shows from the archives. I imagine, one could go there and spend hours looking at old TV show clips.",formeryogi
40,Interesting and fun,"We spent a couple of hours here. The Warner Brothers exhibit is great. We got to sit on props that replicated Monks Diner from Seinfeld (you know- The Big Salad episode), a replica of the couch from Friends' Central Perk. There were lots of other props from a variety of movies and tv shows. The entrance fee was $10 which I felt was reasonable.",Mickeym0use

50,Great fun for all ages,"We took our two children here thinking it would be fun for them, and it turned out to be great fun for us too! There are displays from TV shows of old and new. Take a camera so you can get your picture at Central Perk from Friends and Monk's from Seinfeld.",Kelly M

The security staff there encouraged us to experience everything fully and even offered to take our pictures. The historical background to the industry was amazing, and the documentation they had there was incredible. We were also the only two people in the theater (on a weekend!) that was showing the greatest interviews in television history. Absolutely fascinating, very reasonably priced (especially compared with so many other tourist attractions) and right next to Rodeo Drive, this is well worth the trip. Plus they have a fabulous gift shop for tv memorabilia.",Anne K

50,Television Out of the Box is a Must See Exhibit for Fans of WB Shows,"My Fiancé and I heard about this exhibition from the local siteseeing bus in LA which stops a short walk away from the Paley Center in Beverly Hills. It sounded intriguing so we decided to give it a try and we were blown away. I'm a big fan of Big Bang Theory, ER, Friends, Smallville and True Blood and this exhibit has costumes and props from all of these shows and more. Some older shows such as Knots Landing and Band of Brothers are also represented as is The West Wing. For the child in you there are sketches and cartoons from WB kids shows such as Bugs Bunny an Animaniacs. The best thing of all for me was that you were allowed to take pictures (without a flash, but not a problem as the lighting is great) and sit on any furniture such as the sofa from Central Perk and the sofa from Bill's house in True Blood. I was in true TV geek heaven and even sang along to a few of the show themes that were being played on a loop.",KrazyAngelKat81
50,TV Out Of The Box was wonderful!,"This is a must see for sure! Loved the fact that they offered a military discount. Being able to sit on Bill's couch from True Blood, the couch from Friends' Central Perk, the booth from Seinfeld, and especially the costumes from Vampire Diaries was phenominal!

Finally you got a 2 for 1 cup cake at crumbs with the ticket purchase, go there and enjoy a must for all",wallyreidjr
50,Awesome,"being a big fan of Friends, Smallville and Supernatural it was cool to see some of the props they used in the shows, especially getting up close to Clark Kents awesome red leather jacket, would have stolen it, but it looked a bit to big for me (thanks Tom Welling for being a beast otherwise that jacket would have been mine loool)the staff there were very knowledgeable about what was on display and where they got certain props from coz alot are borrowed from private dealers.other then the shows i mentioned theres props from chuck (AWESOME SHOW), Two and a half men, Big bang theory and many more shows that im not a big fan of but was still cool to see their props.took loads of pictures but certain things had lights beaming right on to them so was hard to get a clear picture.the bugs bunny display they have there is pretty awesome coz loads of big name designers made outfits for him and there one of the first things u get to see b4 u get into the main exhibitall in all a great place to go visit if your a big fan of major TV shows",Kris_O_Brien88
