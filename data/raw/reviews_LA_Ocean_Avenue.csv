Wanting to book or visit something during your stay, just ask the very helpful Jen or Mika for their ideas. Nothing was too much trouble for Reuben, these helpful, friendly staff made the stay personal and enjoyable. I stayed in a king room with beach view and it was a bit pricey but good.

40,Simply Beautiful,"This Street that runs along the Beach, almost along the entire width of Santa Monica, was deeded to the City many years ago by a wealthy land owner. It was wonderful for our evening walks when we visited in August 2016, and stayed at the JW Marriott. The only time we encountered an overcrowding problem at that time, was on a Thursday when there was a free concert at the Pier, and hundreds and hundreds of people spilled over from the Pier onto the Street. We had to take the back roads to reach our Restaurant near the 3rd Street Promenade.In October 2016, when we came here for a second time, we traversed the entire length, all the way to Venice Pier, via the Star Line Bus Tour. The unobstructed views from the top deck of the bus were lovely.The Ocean views are amazing from this street, and we were glad that we got to extensively explore this street. We were also happy to be able to visit the several Restaurants that line the street on the other side.",TheExplorerFamily

You can walk along the Palisades and look out at the ocean, stop for coffee at Joan's on Third (expensive!), or have Mexican food later at Blue Plate Taco. I am not a person who loves walking down the sidewalk with a zillion tourists, especially since I am a local but Santa Monica has become extremely popular and seems to be the #1 tourist destination for not only tourists but for people from all over Los Angeles. That being said, it is still beautiful, you just have to figure out when to go. Also, go to Case Del Mar Hotel, just off Ocean Avenue and have a drink in the afternoon. They have huge picture windows that look out to the ocean and it is really nice.

Little vendors selling everything from jewelry to snacks or you name it. You gotta go just before sun down because it is the most beautiful site you will ever see.We found a cute little Suvichie Restaurant right across from the beach with a great view to watch the wind surfers, and surf board surfers. Plus this cute little black bird entertained us at the window because it was interested in the Morcels of Suvichie we would put out for him.

40,Lovely Place to Stroll,A lovely place to stroll in the late afternoon on a hot summers day. During our short stay in Santa Monica it became our routine each day to stroll along the beach side of Ocean Avenue admiring the beautifully kept gardens & enjoying the cooling ocean breeze. We would then cross the road & call into one of the many bars for happy hour.,Fernsie

50,Beautiful place to watch the world go by.,"I really fell in love with this place, surrounded by the beach on one side and shops and resturants on the other with such a laid back atmosphere. We loved the pier and the views from the Ferris wheel were simply stunning.

40,watch the world go by,"lovely to walk down at sunset and enjoy the energy of the place. We are sure we spotted a few celebs if not- they will be in a few years' time! Loved the pier, took a few rides and felt young again!",langfam

50,I love walking Ocean Avenue!,"A scenic street with restaurants, hotels and shopping on one side and the green grass of palisades park which is on a cliff overlooking the beach...not a bad view at all. Ocean Avenue is designed to be a artery to all beach destinations...the nice thing is everything is within walking distance of Ocean Avenue including over 50 restaurants, tons of gorgeous hotels, and the famous Third Street Promenade is two blocks away. Santa Monica Place, Santa Monica Pier are all with a couple blocks of Ocean Avenue. It is not only by the beach and park but as you go south it leads to Venice and other Santa Monica destinations like Main Street. You don't need a car to experience a good deal of the beach area in Santa Monica as Ocean Avenue will get your there within walking or biking distance. You get an amazing view of everything while on Ocean Avenue. If you are driving...the PCH is easy to get to from Ocean Avenue that lead to places like Topanga, Pacific Palisades, and Mailbu. This is a beautiful area...and Santa Monica has a huge park under construction on Ocean Avenue that will give you views of the beach right from the park. If you ever visit...you should definitely take the walk along Ocean. It will not disappoint.",Akiko A
40,Very pretty area in Santa Monica,"Very nice drive through Santa Monica. You drive along the beaches, ocean, and the shopping mecca in Santa Monica.",Dave C
40,Good place to walk,"With buildings on one side and Palisades Park, ocean and beach on the other this is an exhilarating stretch of Ocean Ave. Hotels, restaurants and shopping on the 3rd Street Promenade make this very interesting.",Dhanan
40,palm trees and ocean views,"built on the cliffs above Santas Monica beaches, palisades park offers a welcoming place for runners, walkers and sitting on a bench to admire the ocean view and a view of the Santas Monica Pier with its glorious multicoloredferris wheel. Across Ocean Avenue sit a string of beach view hotels and restaurants...Blue Plate Oyster Bar, Sushi Roku, Ocean Avenue Seafood Il Fornaio just to name a few. It's a great walk through Northern Santa Monica up to the Pier where you can also lunch at THE LOBSTER, hanging right over the Pier. A slice of Southern California life, so popular with tourists and locals celebrating occasions or just another gorgeous LA day.",janieB1123
50,Its a street.,Cross over to Palisades Park for a great view. There are lots of crosswalks and signals if you need help avoiding traffic.,Stephen D
40,A nice area to stroll,"It's in the heart of Santa Monica (overlooking PCH and the beach). Pleasant to walk around if the weather is nice (therefore 320 days a year). Near to 3rd St. Promenade, Santa Monica Place, the beach, S.M. Pier, bikepath and many stores and restaurants.",Flankster
30,A great place to walk and observe people plus the Ocean,"I really enjoyed watching the people on the beach and the nice buildings erected near the beach. Unfortunately, too many homeless people on drugs can be seen all over.",DonaldRob
40,"Fun, Fun","A great place to people watch. Go up and down as far as you want, lots of restaurants, some neat buildings.",C B
40,A great place to cool off and relax,"Ocean Avenue has gorgeous views and lovely breezes. Most of the way along, there is a greenbelt where you can picnic, read, or just sit and gaze out at the ocean. One caveat: the city of Santa Monica has a deal with the homeless people. They don't bother the tourists during the day, but at dusk, they get to start setting up camp on the greenbelt for the night. If you want to watch the sunset, move down to the pier.",LDavis1968
40,"Another fun place for people watching, art and outdoors",Also there can be some fun car and motorcycle watching alone this Ave that overlooks the beach. There are many art galleries and very nice hotels that are along this scenic area.,Veni-vidi-vicidotcom

50,Views forever.,"We had the good fortune to jogging along Ocean Avenue during a race last week. It was beautiful, very ""Jogger Friendly"" and the vistas were incredible to see. Next time we are in town, we will definitely return and spend some added time exploring this picturesque street.",CanadaMelanie
40,Sunset over the Pacific,Great view from the bluffs over the ocean especially at sundown. A wonderful stroll from the corner of San Vicente Blvd to the Santa Monica Pier. Don't miss the pier carousel.,Roaver
40,Lovely views,Ocean Ave is a great place to get both views of the ocean and do a spot of people watching. If you want to sit and watch the sunset with a drink in hand then this is the place. There are some lovely parks along the way and the first Friday of each month lots of food trucks around for a great meal.,lindadownunder
50,Great views and great walks,"Ocean blv has nice hotels and condo buildings but he real pleasure on Ocean blv is to walk the path of Palissade park, on the ocean side of the street. Best spot to catch the sunset. Ocean blv is up the cliff from the ocean and beach. (See reviews of Palissade Parks for more details).Stay away from Ocean blv with you car... park down the cliff, at the beach's parking lots (huge) and walk the steps up to Ocean blv and Palissade park.",Ben0844
50,Ocean Avenue has great views and greater people-watching,"One of the best strolls in the country. Watch out for the homeless, though. They are harmless, but might scare grandma or the kids.",SkyKingBoston
10,Lots of traffic. Very crowded. Not much to see. Not worth it.,There is a lot of traffic. Very crowded. Really there is not much to see. Not worth going to see because you can go to Manhattan Beach or Hermosa Beach for a much better view and more restaurants and excitement.,Mike D
50,Good for people watching,"Great past time. Grab a happy hour drink and sit outside and watch the colorful,array of passerbys. Plenty of happy hours bars to choose from. A must in Santa Monica",Anna M

30,Noisy street,"I was disappointed in Ocean Avenue. I thought it was unbelievably noisy, and the construction on the east side of the street was just ugly. My favorite streets were the east/west streets that ran perpendicular to Ocean Avenue.",madameK
50,Sunset walks with fresh ocean breeze,"I truly feel blessed to live so close to one of the most spectacular walking paths and parks in Los Angeles. Pacific Ocean to one side, lovely streets of Santa Monica to the other, whether you're jogging alone, or having a family or romantic time at the park, Ocean Avenue is a great place to let your hair down and get some truly fresh air. It's safe and generally clean. WCs are provided and there are several over passes connecting the avenue to the beach.",Bitil
50,"Running, jogging & biking with a whitewater view.","This a scenic avenue that runs 15 blocks. It's a lovely stroll on a sunny day. You will see lots of folks exercising in the park-like setting. I'm partial to this place because I live on a street that is adjacent to Ocean Avenue and frequently park my car there. Yes, a parking space with a million dollar view! Be sure you feed the parking meter. The meter readers are vigilant & ruthless. Enough said.",cuppajoe2
50,Consistant great food and service!,Ocean avenue is a local favorite. It is consistently putting out great seafood and it's always nice for a special dinner with friends or family.,Deniseka
50,Relaxing,Just breath the fresh ocean air while you walk along. You will see many people jogging and biking or just simply walking with a friend. Very good atmosphere with plenty of hotels and restaurants on one side and the beautiful beach on the other side.,Miguel M
50,Beautiful walking path,"Walking, jogging, or biking along the beach is second to none.",David J
50,Take a stroll,"It fills your eyes. You can see ocean front hotels, tall palm trees, cool restaurants, Palisades park, the Santa Monica Pier and the Pacific ocean all at once. Besides, the ocean air and breeze invigorates me every time. Of course, We're only there in June or July so the weather may not be so nie at other times.",JaneandAl
50,A must see sunset...,"Great place to start a drive up the coast with your final destination unknown, the wind in your hair, and the waves crashing in the background.",MarketingDiva
40,Cliff side walk,Did not travel much along the hotel side (except near The Georgian) but did take several walks along the cliff side park walk. Generally nice and pleasant; good views; benches; access to PCH overpasses and beach.. Will Rodgers plaque at end of Route 66.,cj02139

40,Ocean Ave nice...,"but, 3rd Street Promenade better... Ocean Ave has a few places without restaurants or stores, so it seems a bit desolate. Ocean ave is building a new condo with store fronts right across from JW Marriott, so, it will only get better. If you are going to walk, it might be better, for now, to walk on beach, or walk on 2nd or 3rd streets...",mfarrickerusa
50,Great seafood...just great,I have had the pleasure of several visits here and the food is beautifully cooked and fresh. I dislike restaurants that mess around with fish unnecessarily (usually to disguise quality or quantity) and Ocean Avenue doesn't do this.restaurants are about good food first and foremost and this restaurant scores on this. very highly recommended.,Andy X
50,Beautiful Street Overlooking the Ocean,Ocean Avenue runs north and south along Palisades Park in Santa Monica. It goes from Venice Beach in the south to a little north of Montana Avenue in the north. It is lined with palm trees and is a gorgeous stretch of roadway overlooking Santa Monica Beach and the Santa Monica Pier. Wonderful place for a picnic on a clear day. From here you can see the entire Santa Monica Bay. There is metered parking along Ocean Avenue.,alanmhersh
50,Great Seafood... excellent atmosphere and service,"Have eaten with some regularity for almost two decades.The exhaustive menu focuses on fresh fish and is printed daily.My favorite is the black cod... not always available. If you are in a hurry try the oyster bar. The oysters are great. If you are not a fan of oysters try the manilla clam steamed in heavy black pan in which the dish is served. Combine the clams with the excellent freshly baked sourdough bread, some wine and you have a very delicious inexpensive meal with plenty of time to make your movie.",Stephen P
