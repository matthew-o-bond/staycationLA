40,Very exciting time,since new owners took over they stumbled at the start they have greatly improved their previous missteps very exciting time very good experience for the money very reasonable and very well done,krisblanton
50,Great Local Asphalt Track,"Irwindale speedway is the cleanest, most comfortable, top of the line racing venue I have ever been to - and I have been a race fan for over 50 years - from Florida to California!The stands are very comfortable with backs and hold about 5000 (+/-?). Food (all varieties) is excellent. Bathrooms are abundant and spotless.Racing action is exciting and FUN on both the 1/2 mile and the 1/3 mile paved tracks. They also have Night of Destruction racing which includes Figure 8, Demolition Derby, Skid Plate Racing, Trailer Racing (ya gotta see that!!) and many other types of craziness.Lots of lighted parking. Best $15.00 money can buy for 6 hours on a Saturday night... and kids get in FREE.",LindaLosAngelesCA
50,Best Value on Night Of Destruction Dec 2 2017,"We attended the Night Of Destruction on Dec 2 2017 with friends and family and it was a blast!Bought tickets before event date for just $10 each for adult. Arrive before 6 pm for 7 pm race since all good seats get taken fast, with some blocking large spaces on the benches with blankets and tape! Bring a mat to sit on. Get your hot dogs and Polish dogs and just enjoy the show.",Dude_IN_LosAngeles
50,Night of destruction,Great family time! Would definitely go more often when I have free time. Go early to get seats since the crowd does seem to fill the bleachers. Make sure if it’s cold to take a blanket to sit on the bleachers are aluminum and the track gets pretty chilly on fall nights.,_hotjam3
40,Went to see car & motorcycle races,"We had a blast ! It was great fun and really exciting at times. At the end of the races they had what they call a trailer race, which is cars pulling trailers with boats, ski-dos, and other various things, and then we found out it was a demolition type trailer pull What a hoot !!!",Grandmaboxes
40,Loved watching drifting!,"Formula D and L.A. Racing just to name a few occasions that have brought me here. Fun track, and great viewing. It looks like it doesn't really matter where you sit, you'll have a great view. We also had room and help from staff when pulling in the trailer. Staff was very nice.",Expertpacker87
40,Fun for the whole family,"I have been going to the races here for about eight years. It's a great family activity. I prefer to have dinner on the way as I think the food there is not great. (But I don't like food at fairs or from food trucks. If you do you will be happy.)Sadly they are moving more toward Nights of Destruction, which is about as boring as action movies; no plot, no story, no racing. But I do like the real races and go those nights. Never fear, regardless of the evening's event it always ends with a destruction race: figure 9's, chain racing, skid plate racing, trailer racing, etc.Make sure your kids are there if Bandolero racing is scheduled. Image 10-15 8-17 year-olds driving 40 hp cars around the 1/3 mile track. Last weekend girls finished first and second. (I love when they thank their ""sponsors"". ""I want to thank my grandfather and grandmother, and my aunt and uncle."")Get there early. I think they still allow fans on the track to view the race cars, talk to the drivers, sign posters, hand out candy, etc. Kids can meet the kids driving the Bandoleros.Evening will end about 10:30-11PM.Buy tickets on-line, save $5 each.Please patronize this. There is pressure to put an Outlet Mall on the site.",Ray S
50,"Night of Destruction, fabulous family entertainment!","What a fun family outing, this is something totally different than our regular routine. We went with a bunch of friends and kids of all ages, everyone enjoyed it. The ticket price is a real bargain. Bring a blanket to sit on, since the metal bleaches can be cold. We brought some snacks, plus purchased hot dogs and drinks. We will certainly be attending again next time!",Gadmom
50,Night of Destruction ROCKS!,"I took my family to ""Irwindale's Night of Destruction"" last weekend and it was AMAZING!!! We took our kids (ages 6 & 10) and my parents (ages mid 70's) and we ALL had a wonderful time. Everyone LOVED it. This is something that you really need to see at least once. From the smell of the burnt rubber to the sounds of crushed metal, we were all sitting on the edge of our seats. We all tried to anticipate just what would happen next . I would suggest that you bring ear plugs and plan to get there early to claim your seat. Most of these ""destruction nights"" are sold out. The food is pretty good too. They offer the typical hot dogs, etc., but there is also corn on the cob, barbecue beef, tacos, and shaved ice and funnel cakes. Our family will be back for sure...it was something unique to watch and we all really had a great time.",Debra P
40,"Enjoyable even for the ""Non-Racing Fan""","Bought a discount ticket on Groupon. Had a really great time. We went for the ""NASCAR: Night of Champions presented by 805."" I've never followed NASCAR or any kind of Speedway sport, however we had a lot of fun at this event! The Groupon gave us a great deal that included the gokart track, a hot dog meal and entrance to the event itself. The gokarts were really fun, my face hurt afterwards from smiling the entire time! GoKart tips: Girls-take out your earrings, the helmets are a tight squeeze. We got there when they opened around 430PM so there wasn't a crowd. Not sure if a bigger crowd came later. Worth the discount price, not really for $20 full price.Getting to see the cars up close and meet the drivers on the track before the race was also a fun treat. Some of those kids are even too young for a Driver's License! Cool to get to stand on the track. The crowd was just right for us as it wasn't jam packed and we weren't squooshed up against people. Beer was reasonably priced, cheaper than the Fair. Parking is $5. Best to have cash for purchases, but there was a portable ATM on site. Bathrooms were large and acceptable, never had to wait. We were there from about 430P-11P, racing was 7p-11p. Only needed earplugs for the main event race. It was a warm night, but i'm sure it gets cold there. Best race was the ""slide cars"" where the back wheels had been replaced by flat steel plates. hilarious to watch! All in all a great night out and definitely something different!",jenandallthethings
50,"Demolition Derby night, full of fun and suprises","We have not been out to the track in several years, but some friends were interested in going. My husband discovered that they were holding ""A night of Destruction"" so we gathered some friends. You can go to their website and buy your tickets and print them out, this saves money and time, no need to wait in line to buy your tickets. They ran a couple of regular races, had a ""Soccer match"" with three cars on each team trying to push a 300 lb. steel soccer ball in goals. Later they had a race for front wheel drive cars with skidplates on the rear instead of tires, an endure, a figure 8, and topping the night of was a race where cars and a couple of motorhomes all pulling trailers tried to force each other out and smash their trailers. Most all the trailers and boats got smashed up on the track, very entertaining. This is not for people of delicate sensibilities as it sort of low-brow fun. Expensive fun junk food and beers can be purchased. Nice seats and restrooms. Good family activity.",Cynthia A
50,Great Place to Enjoy Racing & An Evening,"I was invited to attend the Saturday evening races a couple years back, and honestly the idea of watching cars go around in circles for a couple hours didn't excite me. I've been several times since and I have to admit that I've always enjoyed every time I've gone, and so have the friends and family I've invited to attend with me. The entrance fee is not too high (about $15) and the food is good but typical attraction priced. It's very easy to get to, just off I-210 and I-605. One recommendation: If you go, arrive early. They bring all of the cars and the drivers out onto the track and spectators are allowed to go onto the track and meet the drivers and ask questions about their cars. It adds to the experience a great deal.",mrliterature
50,Excellent Short Track in Los Angeles Area,"This is a great short track to watch races in Los Angeles area. The Nascar races are always fun to watch. There is also a drag strip here. In an area where Car is King, this is a fun experience which is a local draw.",mini
40,Top Notch Short Track Racing,"I'm a huge racing fan, and so whenever I need my local short track fix, I visit Irwindale Speedway. The racing is fun and the track is pretty easily accessible via the freeway. Getting into and out of the parking lot is also usually pretty painless, thanks to a very organized speedway staff. My one complaint is that the food on-site is a bit expensive, but I suppose that's to be expected. In all, an affordable and fun night out!",Michael L
50,Best NASCAR short track in SoCal!,"I have been a fan of racing since 2006 and I love coming out to this race track every year when the K&N Pro Series, Late Model and the Toyota All-Star Showdown came to town! I'm sad their not here this year but hopefully we have the K&N series out here next year because they would put on a show for the fans! Parking is great, concession stands have great food and there is no bad seat to watch a race at Irwindale!",Taylor B
50,Great Family Place,"We took our mother-in-law out to the Nascar races for early Mothers Day, she had a great time. Parking was very good with a very attentive guy name Glenn. Our daughter and grand daughter also had a good time. A lot of exciting things were going on that night, 1/3 mile track, trucks, cars, figure 8 and to end the night trailer races. The night started with the American Idol season 10 contestant which sang the National Anthem and he did a great job. The gave away lots of T shirts to the crowd, food drinks all reasonable priced. Over all a great value. If you ever wanted to see a Nascar race but did not want to pay $50.00 to $150.00 per ticket come here for a night. The internet price of $10.00 can't be beat. This is a very safe place for the family and great entertainment. The whole experience was amazing!Bathroom facilities was very clean as well as the grounds and parking lot. This is a first class facility any way you look at it.",RetiredIBEW
50,NASCAR Racing Is Back in Irwindale!!,"On April 6th, I, along with family and friends, attended the grand re-opening celebration of the return of NASCAR racing to Irwindale Speedway (now Irwindale Event Center). After a year of being dark, and a year and a half of no NASCAR races at Irwindale, there is new owners/management with a commitment to NASCAR racing. This awesome 1/2-mile oval is up and running again and we couldn't be happier!If you haven't been here before, it is a very family friendly, rockin' and racin' good time. The new managment has kept low ticket prices we used to pay -- $15.00 adults / $5.00 kids / $5.00 parking. You will certainly get your money's worth of entertainment here. Several races are scheduled each Saturday they run (about 2x's a month). You'll get to see late models, mini-stocks, trucks, even demolition and trailer racing!! Check their schedule for more info. Also, every ticket is a ""pit pass"". Guests get to go down on the track and meet and talk with the drivers!There is also a decent selection of food at the concession stands, as well as the vendors that set up inside the park. I had the best pulled pork sandwich from ""All Things BBQ"". Eating/drinking inside the venue can get a little expensive if you are trying to pinch pennies, but it is not over the top, like say, movie theaters.You also have the option of tail-gating before the fesitivities. The gates open about three hours before racing begins so guests have plenty of time to bbq and hang out with friends. I highly recommend this place to anyone -- this is a great way to spend a Saturday night.Also, I would like to deeply and sincerely thank the new owners for giving us back our NASCAR -- this is going to be a great season and opening night was just the beginning!!",Carole K
50,Best racing in the USA,If you are looking for a special night in the LA area please concider to go to Toyota Speedway. A top notch facilty - ½ mile with a program each saturday night that outrank any other track I have ever seen. Each class they are running will be filled with at least 14 - 22 competitors - hard racing for every points to get.Don't miss it. Nice clean facilities - and a variaty of food is availible.,Hans S
