50,ATV & Dirt Bike Rentals,"This is our second time to rent Dirt Bikes and ATVs from Gorman MotorSports. We showed up at their office to get fitted for gear, show our ATV safety certificates and sign the rental agreements. Laurie was patient and helpful getting our gear fitted correctly. Then we drove to the Edison Campground in the Hungry Valley OHV where John had our bikes and ATVs waiting for us. John was also patient and got us familiar with the operation of the vehicles before we started out as our group were beginners. They have a huge practice area and miles and miles of trails to explore.They offer a professional, no hassle and friendly experience. We will be back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401allenl
