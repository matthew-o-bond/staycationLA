50,Fantasy combination of resort and golf course,"It's so easy to get out of the resort for first golf tee time.It is even better to go to the resort and relax right after the last tee time.Located on a high hill, the resort a panoramic view of the city.The air is also fresh and clear",eellyy
30,Good Experience,"Hotel was nice. Didn't have time to enjoy all of the amenities but the main things I always look for are a clean room, comfortable bed and pillows, parking, view and nice staff. It certainly didn't lack in those areas. I will be back.",G. Good
30,Friday Morning - Holiday Week,"All In all a good day on the course, minus the GPS keeping you on the cart path making you walk more then riding your cart.The course has received some much needed life support. The fairway and greens on the IKE course were over seeded about a month ago allowing the course to grow in excellently. While the course has improved the greens and the fairway the course has totally forgotten about their sand traps.In closing, I would play the course again, but I would be double checking on their Sand Traps and Cart Rules before I book.",Jay Raine
40,Driving range,"I‚Äôve been here to test out my 7 iron,and 1,2,3 drivers.This place is cool if you love the game of golf.You can also stay at the luxurious resorts here.They have better munchies than Uber delivers.This sport is better nothing.A good place to practice your swing.-Anthony",Anthony B
20,"Golf course is in rough shape, it needs life support!",I have been coming here for several years. Our company even has our annual golf tournament. This is the absolute worst shape I‚Äôve ever seen this golf course. The fairways are dead. The perimeter of the golf greens have patches of new dead sod that are trying to be revived with so much water it‚Äôs like a sponge. Dead grass and dirt is everywhere. What has happened? What changed? I‚Äôm very disappointed and it did play both courses.,JQBarker
50,Great Golf Courses,"I have played both courses many times. They are among the best in Southern California . I prefer the ""Ike"" which us a little longer than the ""Babe"" (which is narrower). Both courses were renovated a few years and are more friendly...but both are still very challenging. Both courses are beautiful and some holes have great views. There are holes with water and all have sand traps.The staff is great and very helpful. I have list many balls on these courses...but it has always been fun. I recommend Industry Hills Golf Club very highly.",Ronald W
30,Bad Communication,"On my most recent outing here to play the Ike Course our group was confronted by a burned out, shaved down course that was going to be over-seeded the next day. No one bothered to tell us about the horrible conditions, but they were happy to take our money. If I had known we would have gone elsewhere. I feel a bit ripped off.",mauiwolf
50,Lookin' so outrageous,"you should know, how the pros play the game but you do not need to play like a pro to enjoyoutrageous are the stunning views, air quality depending - when it seems so clear, fairly priced, very nice rentals, does not seem to get a lot of play and interesting layout,so break away and get over hereIke or BabeThere you go",steelydad2014
50,One of best public courses in LA County,"Although pricey, they offer a great golfing experience. I've played both courses here at least 10 times combined, Babe, being the more narrow of the two. The course is well kept and challenging.",OrangeCountyJay
50,"Stunning facility, and amazing track.","I was in town for business, had weekend off. Just drove bye and it looked interesting. Parked car, and followed the signs. Wow ! Spa, restaurant, and world class holf course. All I can say is stunningüòÅ.Worth every penny. Tough, amazing facility. My #1 course ever. And I am from golf meca Florida, this place is for real!",John B
30,Less than expected,"We played here last weekend. It‚Äôs disappointing that only the Babe Course was opened. The course was quite challenging with narrow fairways going up and down hills and water hazards, definitely not for beginners. The view from the high vantage point was surprisingly not spectacular as expected. For the $80 plus green fee we found the whole experience a bit underwhelming and over-rated. The course was not well maintained overall. Many necessary directional signage and markers were either missing or hard to find. Fortunately we found Hole 1 even though there was nothing to indicate so. The layout was perplexing. For example, it took a long drive back to the club house after the last hole. The GPS on our carts worked only intermittently. We only saw the beverage cart once and it was last call.",LnS2004
50,An oasis in the city,"Industry Hills Golf Club has been my traditional July 4th golf outing and every year my friends and I just can't wait to return. There are two courses and we switch up every year, we all like the Ike better than the Babe, but both courses are fantastic and some of the best public courses in LA. Both courses are challenging, unique with fast & undulating greens. Not for the beginner. The course this year was a bit wet and soggy in the morning but didn't detract at all from a great day on the course. Expect to pay $85-120 weekday vs weekend and depending on the course, but they have a great discount on Mondays. Too bad today is July 5th and I have to wait 364 days.",ABSquared2
50,Great golf experience,"In my opinion this is the best public place to golf in the San Gabriel Valley. 1st rate clubhouse, proshop, greens and fairways. Starters space out groups just enough. Babe is easier to get on and is the shorter but trickier of the 2. The Ike is more expensive and more in demand. Either way, if you can play here. Do it.The club hosts a lot of pro-qualifiers, Asian Tour and some other pretty big events.",Jose R

40,If you find yourself in Industry,"This is a decent place to play. It's part of a large hotel complex. n times gone by, they used to do regional US Open qualifying here. The layout is one of the more difficult courses in So Cal. But its not quite up to private or semi-private standards.",am08540
30,Second time- played both,"I've played both Ike & Babe now & overall the courses are average.The course is in ok shape.The holes are long but nothing special.Not great, not bad. Worth playing for the right price but I wouldn't go out of my way to play again.",VicandFawn
30,"Great golf, horrible customer service","This review is in two stages and I'll start with the good part - the golf. There are two courses here, the Babe and the Ike. They are both solid four-star courses that deserve to be played. They are tough, diverse and fun. If this was just about golf I might have even gone all the way to five-star as a rating. But it's not.This course has the worst customer service I've ever seen. First off, there are no signs telling you where the golf is, you have to drive around the Pacific Palms Resort and just guess where to park. Then you wander around with your clubs hoping you run into the pro shop. Finally, after finding the pro shop on the back side of the resort you discover that if you want to use the range you must walk to it. They will not let you drive a cart, nor will they shuttle you there. And guess what? It's not anywhere near the pro shop. You have to haul your clubs back where you came from on a long walk to a large, double-tiered range where you hit off mats that are very hard. It was like hitting off concrete.After making the long walk back to the pro shop the cart attendants won't lift a finger to help you. And when I checked in no one bothered to give me a key to the cart, so I had to make another trip back to the pro shop. I asked the cart attendants for help and they just barked at me and walked away. Needless to say, when the round was over they were no where to be seen. Even if they weren't going to clean my clubs it would have been nice to have been given a wet towel to wipe off the green range mat junk from the soles my clubs.One other note: there is a restaurant next to the pro shop. It is a beautiful place with some serene outside seating. The prices are a little high. I had a relatively small chicken Caesar salad that was $16. But it was good.The first time here can be bad. After that you know what to expect and can plan for it. The golf is good enough to get you back, but they really need to up their game. It was pitiful and not worthy of such a beautiful place. If the golf had been average I wouldn't even think of returning!",mauiwolf
