50,An Inventive Modernist Design!,"I dropped by last Saturday to check out this house for the first time and it is a brilliant work of modernist design! I forgot my tour guide’s name (tours are run by students from Cal Poly Pomona who own the building) but he was very passionate about the home and was full of details to share about the place and its history associated with legendary architect Richard Neutra.What I love about this home is just how much it takes advantage of the little space it has and maximizes efficiency throughout, including a foldable corner that connects the kitchen with the living room! There is a great sense of balance between manmade and natural elements and offers a comfortable lifestyle if ever I were to call this home (which is highly unlikely).What’s interesting is that this is the second home on the same property, the first version was built in the 30s and burned down in the 60s so this house is the current version built from 1964-1965. According to a few models the old house was a bit more strict and linear, while the current house is a bit more playful and experimental by comparison.Visiting this house has given me a new appreciation for Neutra’s work and I highly recommend this to everyone interested in architecture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,A must-do for architecture & design lovers,"OK, so it's a bit expensive to tour such a small house.That's the negative.Otherwise, this place is amazing. If you've ever been interested in design or architecture, be sure to swing by. Grad students give tours every 10-15 minutes of the property, taking you room by room to explain the history of the house and the ingenuity that went into every little detail of construction.You're allowed to take pictures inside, which is rare for historic houses around LA, no doubt you'll be left with tons of great photos, great inspiration, and great respect for Neutra.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greglie
50,"If you are into architecture, this home tour is a ""must see""","Whether you are visiting LA or a resident, this is a great way to see and learn more about how Neutra influenced our architecture. And it's a great way to fund continued restoration of the house. The tours are led by Cal Poly Pomona architecture students - so they may not be the most polished of tours, but they are passionate about the history of the house. You can tour the house on your own, but you will learn more by joining one of the tours which begin at 11 AM. You are also free to take all the photos you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareThere
40,"A specialized house museum, very engaging!","We visited with a group of people interested in architecture, so of course we loved the Neutra House. But I don't think it will appeal to the casual tourist. Open only on Saturdays, tours are offered throughout the day. Admission is $15. The house is in reasonably good repair, but some spaces are very worn so it is good to note that all admission fees go to upkeep of the property. So many mid-century design elements are incorporated into this house, it is almost overwhelming for those who appreciate these matters. There are some exquisite spaces and design details that just make you stare and thank your chosen deity that you are there to commune with them! The house is sparsely furnished. The site, overlooking the Silver Lake reservoir, is tight but very efficiently utilized. By the way, the Silver Lake reservoir has its own fascinating history that you should read up on! The neighbourhood around the Neutra House has some interesting homes, so if you have the time, I suggest walking around a bit, as we did. Overall: this place will not appeal to everyone, but for those attuned to architecture and design, you will appreciate the contributions of Richard Neutra and visiting this historic home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
50,Architectural Gem,This wonder is only open on Saturdays but it is definitely worth your time. Located near Silver Lake reservoir it is a house of great quality and creativity. Some parts of the house are little worn but every dollar spent from visits goes into the upkeep of this great Los Angeles house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509waynem
40,A House for Architectural Fans,"An interesting house for the architecture fans. An early modern house with many elements of houses to come. An interesting history. Can be hard to visit and takes some planning due to limited open times. Good guided tour, if a bit crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358ea
50,Must See for MidCentury Fans!,"Tours are limited to a few hours on Saturdays and special events, so check carefully the schedule before heading out.Architecture students from Cal Poly conduct most of the tours, and some know less than others but there is usually staff around if you have specific questions.They let you sit on some of the furniture!! Really interesting and beautiful home, and fascinating to hear how/why Neutra made his designs.We were very lucky to have visited on a day when the water features were filled (normally they remain dry due to the drought) because a special event was happening that evening - what a treat.No one with an interest in mid Century modern should miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldhousegirl
40,Home base for one of LA's leading architects,"LA is rich with modern design and interesting homes and this is one of the highlights for a traveler interested in either. Squeezed into a small lot overlooking the Silver Lake reservoir, the house is ingenious in the ways it accentuates the good (like the view and the warm LA climate) while making you almost forget that the neighbor houses are only a few feet away. Things are a little worn overall, so don't expect the high degree of polish you find in some historic home renovations.It's only open on Saturdays, and not every Saturday at that, so check ahead on their website. No reservations needed -- just show up and pay the small admission fee. Afterwards, walk around the neighborhood -- there are several other Neutra-designed houses within a few minutes' walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotthZ5465JO
10,check before you visit,"The House is an important one, being the former residence of a world famous architect.However it is only open for a brief period on Saturdays and even that is not guaranteed.Having made a great effort to visit during a rare trip from England to LA, it was very disappointing to find it closed.After contacting the College that own it, I discovered that it is the responsibility of the Professor of Architecture who lives on site. She has not organised a Deputy so when she is away it is shut!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiness802944
