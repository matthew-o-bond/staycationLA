50,Brave Theatre Bravos!,"Extraordinary addressing of contemporary issues in excellent comfy small theatre. Even cozier cafe upstairs, outdoor rooftop view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieStoneybrook
40,Good show in an intimate setting. Upstairs cafe a delightful treat.,"We were lucky enough to snare tix to see a show of particular interest during our brief visit to the Los Angeles area; Fountain staff was helpful in letting us know long-distance when seats became available for an otherwise sold-out weekend.We had sufficient time before the play to enjoy a coffee and home-made baked treat in the upstairs cafe, with an outdoor patio seating area. Our baker/server Balthazar is a delight!The one-act play we saw is new, and, I hope, will undergo further workshopping to tighten up some weaknesses, but we appreciated Fountain offering this fledgling, thought-provoking script with excellent acting, making effective use of the postage-stamp sized stage. The pre-paid postcard to send to Dear Leader (the subject of the play) was a nice touch.Fountain has an adjacent pay parking lot next door (be advised that cars are slotted in to fill the entire lot, so if you think you may need to leave early, park elsewhere). We also advise that there is a very bad patch of sidewalk that has erupted from tree roots, which could be hazardous to some patrons. In addition, we would recommend that Fountain staff assist with traffic direction after a play when needed. After our show, a very large van parked in front of the theater obstructed the view of patrons exiting the parking lot onto a narrow, busy road (see our photo), and theater-goers were trying to provide some traffic direction (to almost disastrous effect in one case).Other than these observations, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and this neighborhood should be proud of its artistic treasure of a space!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leebot
40,Wonderful community theatre,"We attended a play last night at the Fountain Theatre. The performance was first rate. We live in Los Angeles and are season ticket holders for The Pantages, The Ahmanson and the Geffen. But sometimes it is fun and engaging to experience live theatre in a small setting. The Fountain is perfect. Not a bad seat in the house. In fact after the performance there was a discussion session. Really enjoyable evening",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyAN
