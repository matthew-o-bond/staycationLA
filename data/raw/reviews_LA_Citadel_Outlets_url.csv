30,Not the best experience,"I went today for first time and they were saying its closed by 9.00 pm but when i went around 5.30 pm they were about to close and most of shops closed by 6.00 pm and almost 30% were not reopened yet and they have announcement peppers on doors they will open after 21 June, i was really disappointed not worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hajjarmi
40,Excellent Shopping Outlet Village,We were visitors from the UK and we were looking for designer shop outlets. This village had a really good range of outlet shops and food places for a pit stop. It was nice to walk around too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
30,Good for some bargains,Good outlet centre although in a weird not so nice location. Not as good or high end as Desert Hills (a lot out of the City of LA though) but still picked up some good bargains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,Love to Shop,If you love to shop this is the place. The Citadel is and outdoor outlet with tons of shops. They have a great food court with a variety of restaurants to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4919FOcarolb
40,Good day shopping,"The outlet centre for a full of good quality goods, clean and enjoyable. The only issue is getting public to get there, just get an Uber as we find out the hard way that LA public transport is definitely not good....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashac913
30,Not what they used to be,The outlets used to have good sales and each store had their own deals.now they are all the same and the sales are only ok for the holidays.the parking is a real challenge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ampereyra5
50,Great Place to Shop,I highly recommend this place for shopping. I have seen it grow from a two-block shopping place to what it is now. You can find great deals hear and even better deal during the holidays. But beware during the holidays it gets super busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabianusn_11
40,Citadel Outlets,"Went to Citadel Outlets in LA for some good buys. Walked around and found good discounts, ended buying a leather jacket and two jumpers. The place was crowded, lively and interesting. Ok",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
50,Excellent mall with great range of shops,Really nice mall with a really good range of premium shops including some more unusual ones such as Quiksilver and TUMI. Parking was no problem (on a weekday evening) and the food options were decent also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_Blancmange
50,Designer brands at discounted prices,"Husband, three teenagers and myself totally enjoyed ourselves at Citadel Outlets. Great discounts. Would e like to return another day but time didn’t permit. Not a big food court though but lovely restrooms and lounge area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macpac5
50,Shopping Island,"All known and unrecognized designers, brands & hi street fashion stuff available with lot of variety and discounts . For good shopping experience need to spend atleast 3 to 4 hours . Number one choice for brands shopping experience in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fasieh
40,End of holiday shopping,"We came here and spent a good 5-6 hours walking around all the shops, and having a bite to eat. For Australians it is similar to the outlets we have at home. You need to shop around and see if it really is a good deal you are getting.A couple things for Aussie who go there to remember, currently the exchange rate is not in our favour so you virtually have to add almost half the list price onto what you are buying to get the equivalent aussie dollar value. Then also add sales tax which is about 10%.There are some good deals to be had, just need to really shop around and know how much things cost in Australia to compare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theone2200
50,Great day shopping.,"Visited Citadel after short easy Uber from Hollywood walk area. Even though Aussie dollar is poor value in US there were plenty of bargains for us. We shopped til we dropped. Something for everyone. Bought extra bags to transport all our purchases home. Best bargains at Coach,Tommy Hilfiger,Ralph Lauren,Calvinand list goes on. Will definitely make extra day for shopping here on my trips to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hockrow
50,Excellent,"We visited this Centre and it was fantastic, designer brands at very reasonable prices. We shopped for hours and it had it all. Some great eateries within the outdoor Centre as well. I thoroughly recommend you visit the Centre and shop, shop, shop, great place and great prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jkalss
40,All the majors - good one stop option,Went with adult children as a day to finish our US trip. All the main brands are there but like all these places you may have to search for the bargains amongst the normal pricing. Beware of Exchange rates and know your local pricing to make the most of the trip. Having said that range is the main benefit coming from Australia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanOBrien7
10,Customer beware,I can’t believe that Citadel is allowed to remove customer posts especially if they are negative. I commented that I witnessed a woman being dragged out of the 5 level elevator by two guys because she wouldn’t let go of her purse in the middle of the day and there was no security around and my post is no longer there. How is that possible?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2007d
50,Shop till you drop,I called an Uber for about 30 USD each way from my hotel on Sunset Strip... What an incredible day of shopping... Showed my Australian passport at the info desk to receive my coupons... I saved over 300 USD on already heavily discounted products...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraheH8557YE
20,Bring earplugs,Typical outlet shopping. Nothing cheaper or better than elsewhere. The place is equipped with a PA system that blares out rubbish moronic American gangsta rap and hip hop at a million decibels. If that doesn’t worry you then it is a standard outlet. The blare drove me away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juddernaut68
40,Madness on Black Friday,"This place was oozing with crowd on Black Friday. We were ofcos part of the crowd trying our best to shop as much as possible. The queues were crazy but the deals were way too good.Prior to my visit, many told me to shop at The Grove instead of Citadel; I went to both and I would say Citadel certainly at much more better deals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoinahJaeb
50,great deals!,this was my second visit and for the second time i found great deals there. The only problem was the long queues but it is understandable as it was Christmas time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cew00
10,Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store Women's,"Here's my experience with the POLO RALPH LAUREN FACTORY STORE WOMEN'S, at Citadel:(This review is solely about the store manager, Mike. All the other employees were very helpful and friendly.)I shopped at this Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store on Saturday, Jan. 4, 2020. It was my first time at this store, and I had the most unpleasant and stressful shopping experience I have ever had in my life.I got in around 8 pm and started browsing. About 20 minutes into it, I already had tons of clothes hanging over my arm that I wanted to try on, and one of the employees approached me with a shopping bag to help with my load. I thanked her and continued on with my browsing. At the end of about forty-five minutes of browsing and carefully picking pieces of clothing to try on, I asked one of the sales people to please unlock a fitting room for me. As he opened it up, the manager, Mike, appeared out of nowhere, pointing at my full shopping bag, telling me, ""There's no way I can let you try on all of that. Maybe one item. We're closing in a second"". It was ten minutes to 9. I protested, explaining to him that I've been picking clothes for the past forty-five minutes, I was given a shopping bag along the way, and nobody gave any warning about the closing time. He said, ""I don't know what's going on in the front there, but we're closing."" So, let me get this straight: The manager's duty is to, bluntly and with a rude attitude, tell people when to leave, but he is not responsible for anything else happening inside the store? As a manager, you are supposed to lock the doors when it's closing time, not let any more customers in, and let the currently shopping customers finish their shopping in peace. Mike just wanted to close up shop and go home. I was left with no choice but to frantically try on some sweaters and leave out the dresses, which I'm not going to be able to ever try on, as I'm never going back to this nightmare of a store. One of the employees who witnessed my interaction with Mike and saw how flustered and upset I got, told me to ""not mind him"".Apart from the absurdity of the situation and how badly Mike handled it, his attitude was rude and unprofessional. I was treated like cattle being herded out of the store, in a rush.I am appalled at the fact that someone like Mike, who has zero people skills and no clue what it takes to manage a store (or anything else) and provide a pleasant customer service, could become a manager and stay a manager at a Polo Ralph Lauren store, even when his own employees, obviously, don't take him seriously. Ralph Lauren corporate should be concerned that one of their store managers seems more concerned about going home than increasing total sales. Citadel Outlets should be concerned that one bad apple can ruin the whole shopping experience. This left a terrible taste in my mouth and I don't think I will be returning to Citadel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denizo66
30,Parking and Facilities are very hard to find,"Citadel outlets are the closest to the place I live and have been going here for many years to get deeper discounts on high end clothes. Come early and use back street of outlets to enter to beat the long line of traffic to enter. Also another tip is to valet park, it's saves you time and energy. The information center has coupons for free with your AAA membership. There are not many free facilities for the customers. Seating is very little so if you need a break with your kids, head to food court instead. Overall the sales are good and nice selection of stores (mostly clothing stores).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roopaliv
40,We came to shoot the box for our YouTube Video.,It was fantastic and amazing. On this day we shot a Christmas Special Video which you can see on YouTube. Video # nHl0Yj539yo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louinator59
30,Sunday outlet visit,We visited on a Sunday after Christmas. Sales were on. Parking was absolutely crazy but the security officers helped us to find parking far in the outskirts of the area. Sales were a disappointment since most of it buy one and get second 50%. Long ques to many of the places and no clear communication why we had to wait. Not too many people in the shops. Food was good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360sofiam
40,Lots of variety and discount,Lots of shops with different brands and discounts. Bought lots of shirts for me and my son and some socks. We also had lunch at the food court. Bought some shoes from Clarke's but a little disappointed with the chaos inside the store and could not find new pair of shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewie112

50,Good shopping experience,"Great place to shop. Large outlet with ~200 stores. All brands, good prices, free parking. Food court needs improvement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MottiS15
20,Not Very Respectful,It was awful to see that the American Flags at Citadel were not lowered for Pearl Harbor Day in remembrance of the lives lost on this historic day. More respect and attention needed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gicobann
50,Best cheap shopping place,Why want to drive so far..for outlet...This place is near Los Angeles..only 30min from Downtown....many Brands cheap factory outlet price...big place...if you dont look for high end Brands this place it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samlS8387KP
30,Plenty of Shops and lots of Walking,"This is a good place to shop if you also want to get some exercise. The shops are all very spacious and the center itself allows for lots of walking, so wear comfortable shoes (or buy some there, it has lots of good shoe stores). The parking can be a bit challenging, so try to get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aandmrun
50,Excellent shopping,Very enormous shopping outlet with all the brand I needed. Competitive price and fashionable. The only drawback is Los Angeles doesn’t do tax refund for tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer620521
40,Worth a visit but didn’t spend a fortune,We caught the bus from Union station which was easy to navigate and free ! Best buys were sneakers and sports gear . Heaps of cheap handbags which I might have purchased if husband not waiting outside . Was disappointed with Ralph Lauren and Hilfiger . Still glad I made it .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bencat123
50,Lots of good deals to be had.,Went 3 times in a 2 week trip and a lot of the main stores had a real turnover in stock so lots of new bits. Some stores offer greater savings than others but compared to UK prices they were all good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxtrot90
50,Good bargain,"Spent about 3hours there and bought a few things at bargain price. Shops like Nutica( bought a short for $10)Calvin Klein(jacket for $55), Adidas, Tommy H, Ralph Lauren Polo... ect. Nice food court with very reasonably price for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/no1_rabbit
50,Nice prices and great service,"In our 2nd day of the LA trip we went to the Citadel Outlets mall to fill our bags with cheap goodies.As in Europe some brands are more expensive then their actual value, we have really enjoyed shopping in here since the prices were as they should for those products.Pretty nice and big MK store, Tommy H. as well, DKNY, Furla.Guess seemed really poor and the quality is actually better in my country than in the US.Adidas and Nike, was very low on stock, and regarding sneakers it was really hard to find something our size or actually, at least looking pretty.Overall, a nice place to spend some money but be careful in which stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dekadenza
40,Good variety of brands,The design of this outlet mall is pretty good to find the brands. The range of brands also cover high end down to the usual brands. I do find the store size not as big as the other outlet malls so you may find everything you are looking for in them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erico2709
50,Best place to shop in LA,"If you're looking for great brands with great discounts, this is the place to be! Best to avoid this place during weekends where there are tons of people, but overall the experience is always pleasurable! My favourite stores are Kate Spade and Michael Kors, but there are a lot to choose from. This place is also a favourite of tourists so expect them to come in herds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bianxdr
30,Good Shopping,"Went there for Labor Day weekend expecting a lot of good deals but found none, except in one or two stores. Prices were similar or sometimes the same that I found in Colombia or shopping online and there weren’t much of choices, mostly past season stuff but that’s usual with outlets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieavilar
40,Not a lot of brands but still OK,It’s not a good as Ontario Mills or Camarillo Outlets but still a decent outlet center. Check its website for your popular brands. If you are a visitor with a passport pop into customer service for free discount coupons. Prices are OK. I personally dont like outdoor outlet malla because it’s too hot outside. If you visit citadel in the summer bear in mind that it will be too hot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukeizm
50,Best Outlet Mall near L.A!,Went to LA for vacation in July 2019... We dissed Beverly Hills and Sunset Blvd and got our bang for our buck shopping at Citadel Outlets. My girls had a blast! There were many options for both myself and the girls. We found so many name brand options that suited our needs! Parking was also convenient! Thank you Citadel!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandylovesLA
40,Great shopping,"Spent a few hours shopping at outlets. Lots shops and good bargains. Clean, good parking but you pay! Food court but basic takeaway type food. Great toilet amenities. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imme4
40,SHOPPING FOR MY SISTER WEDDING,"I went to the Citadel Outlets for my sisters up coming wedding and my Brother-N-Law and I got are suits, shoes and a few other items we need to the wedding. The ONLY bad part of the Citadel Outlets is that they don't have a LOT of ADA Parking stalls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Casper562
50,Must Go in L.A.,The stores are good and the Outlet Mall is large and very good.Free wifi is available.Deals are very good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuniorBakshi
40,Conveniently located,"There is a Doubletree by Hilton hotel essentially on the premises, which makes for easy shopping for those spending a night at the hotel. Even though we got started when the stores opened, the crowds built up within 30 minutes. Some of the higher end outlet shops are missing from this mall, but between the five of us, we still manged to filled about nine shopping bags of goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
40,Nice 4.5 hours of shopping,"About three of my favourite outlet stores are missing, but I still managed to leave with three shopping bugs of clothing and other apparel. Most of my monay was spent at Coach, Polo, Guess, and Cole Haan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnaYYZ
50,Top,Went here for first time even it was a little bit diffecult to find. A lot of shop and a lot of good offers. We use 4 h and could have use more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmittag
30,Nope!,This reminds me of outlets in Las Vegas. Too crowded and stuffy with no visible discount. Lots of riffraffs and some pretentious people. I did not enjoy the experience at all. Tip on parking is to do Valet. Its only 5$ flat better then free parking. Get a glass of jumba juice and begin shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazirpri
50,Pleasant shopping experience,"While shopping is not always the most pleasant experience on our familiy holidays, the tour to Citadel our last day in LA, was a definite highlight. We liked the way the shops were gathered around some pedestrian zones instead of a shopping center, and felt it was quite nice and cozy to move around between the different shops and cafes.They offered a great variety of different shops, and almost all the important brands were represented. Only thing we missed was an Abercrombie & Fitch + Hollister shop, which we found on all the other shopping centers we visited during our holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nemi_42

We picked up some Vans that we haven't seen at any other outlets or even in the stores. Great outlets looking forward to getting back some time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arkraider35
40,Avoid on weekends,Lot of shops with pretty good deals...though on Sundays looking for parking can be like how it is on Christmas Eve...lot of time standing in line to pay and try on clothes...visit on a weekday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelonious22
30,Many Shopping Choices!,"Parking to this facility was adequate, although a section was reserved for a nearby building. The mall has a great number of stores and a few dining facilities as well. Many stores offered their products at good sale prices. The Citadel also offers the opportunity for having a pleasant walk throughout the facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cobcop
30,Pretty good but hectic.,"The stores are pretty good but the traffic and the parking are a bit much. We got there early, stayed for a couple hours.

50,Citadel Outlets is awesom,"Citadel Outlets in Commerce, California, is by far the supreme premium outlet center. So many stores, so little time. The place is clean, and the parking wasn't a problem with a nine-level parking structure, and the parking is FREE! Super clean restrooms and lobby area and gorgeous flowers all around. Aside from the center looking a little run down, needs to be painted, Citadel is the bomb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisaBobisa
30,Great Shopping Place!,"Citadel Outlets has the best stores around. Michael Kors, Coach, Kate Spade to name a few. The ladies restrooms and lounge are beautiful and kept amazingly clean. The grounds are spotless and there is an amazing vibe as people walk around and shop. The only negative aspect of the center is that it needs a paint job. Spend some money on a fresh look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743alexandriab
30,Needs Some Love!,I love shopping at the Citadel! It has been sometime to go on a girls day shopping but finally went over the weekend… Really disappointed with how poor the place is looking these days. Parking is great! Shopping is great!

50,Citadel VIP before the flight home - worth every cent,"Will be doing this again and recommend to others. Caught Karmel Shuttle from the hotel to here, then pickup 6pm to go to the airport. Worth every cent. VIP room was perfect, place to store our bags and go shopping. Wish I had more time. Kids and husband loved a place to relax with snacks and both non-alcoholic and beer. I had a glass of bubbly and was able to unwind between shops. Best shop DKNY, very helpful and found some nice dresses. Disney shop, gap and under armour were some good buys and souvenirs for family members. Nike shop and OC outlet was better but VIP and DKNY makes this my fav outlet shopping experience. Staff were lovely and helpful. Discount book adds to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajplus3

40,Afternoon Shop Stop,A great outlet shopping center just outside of downtown Los Angeles. I make sure I come in the middle of the day during the week as weekends can be crazy and parking even with two multi-level parking structures can test my patience. Has all the right name brand stores along with some multi-level outlets like Coach that seem to have everything. The holidays are absolutely crazy here but I still manage to make it when they open and get out before it becomes out of control.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarinTravels

50,Great place,If you are ready to shop and find some good bargains this is the place to be. I recomend the you park in the valet parking because it can get full quick and if your lucky you might have park all the way down. Be careful cause there is permit parking only and if you park there there's the possibility that you might get towed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545alexj

Check out there website to have an overview of all the stores before visiting. Lovely open clean, well looked after location - shops, restaurants (inclusive of a huge open food hall) and places to hang out. Everyone within the stores are so welcome and friendly, nothing is too much trouble to help you. So many stores offering discounts on top of discounts so very well worth it!Plenty of easy access facilities and I note, extremely accessible for mothers with their children (within the ladies facilities there is a whole other section with sofas and baby changing facilities).

Here you could easily spend a half to full day exploring the sales and finding the perfect gifts for your family or friends. If you are visiting California, you may be unaware that LA traffic can be very slow; I recommend organising a 'Lyft' back to your hotel as an affordable alternative to a taxi service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620

40,"Lovely clean shopping area, some super bargains at some shops","First, I would like to say the open mall area was very pleasing, week-maintained, has an upscale appearance and a pleasure to walk around in. The parking was free and it was quiet on a week day just before noon in late March. The ladies rooms were wonderfully designed, spacious at the sinks and extremely clean. There were many shops to chose from with the most popular names in retail. My favorite was the Columbia store which had the best, hands- down, true bargains. The two salesmen/ managers I dealt with with very polite and helpful. The changing room was spacious. I found two UV blocking long sleeve light weight ladies shirts at about 20% of their regular price. I never see the UV blocking shirts of any brand at this discounted price. A major find and made my trip well worth it.I went into the Ugg store, the Nike store,the Lucky store, etc.,and found only a very few items at true “outlet prices”. My friend found two knit shirts at Superdry that were marked down to $19.99 each- about 90% off. They made his day. I would suggest going before noon on a week day for a less crowded walking area. I am not a by nature a browsing shopper and buy many clothing items at Zappo’s which offers free delivery and returns. However, the items I purchased at the Columbia store are never offered at this price online as far as I know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693776

50,Solid outlets,"I have been to outlets in Vegas a number of times and this place is a carbon copy of those outlets. They are identical with basically the same shops.We had set aside a number of hours at these outlets. They didnt disappoint. Plenty of different types of shops so you will find everything you need.The discounts varied from shop to shop. They are ridiculous as you may think they would be, but, they were some discounts to be had none the less.I would recommend giving yourself 3+ hours here for couples or individuals. If your with a group, give yourself a day.We drove to the outlets and there was a massive parking station which was free to park in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddS917
30,LA outlet,"If you are a fan of luxury brand, this is not a place to go. The only top brand there is coach, katespade and michael kors. I have done research before going, lots of peoples recommend this outlet but i was so disappointed when i went all the way there, not much discount, or on sale going on. Its a outdoor outlet so make sure the weather is good then go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelandshop2019
40,Great shoppint,Good shopping and good stores. Just hard to find parking even during the week. I love the Disney store,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shilobeagle2017

Parking is tough just get there early. So many stores, not enough hours in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcE3222IR
40,"Limited ranges, you may find a bargain",Went out to citadel to have a look around. I got some good markdowns. I think it was because it was early feb and last of the winter season markdowns. Pays to check the citadel website for any shops running additional sales. Kate Spade shop was having -70% but didn’t seem to have much except handbags. I found the best bargains were in the athletic/travel wear. Eg nike/champion/Columbia etc. 30-50% off.To be honest Macy’s stores had excellent up to 70% off on women’s clothing in their main store in downtown which were better sales than at the outlet mall and had more variety. Macy’s downtown has a Backstage outlet type department in their basement. Also the outlet type shops right near the Beverly Center had reasonable prices too.Caught an Uber from downtown out to citadel. Cost $16 at midday. I took the free citadel shuttle bus back to downtown. Took about 50 mins at 330pm. In summary citadel was ok for some athleisure wear. I’m sure it’s all luck in the timing of your visit as to whether you score a bargain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urbanite88
50,Shopping in Heaven,"Great stores, puma, addidas, reebok, nike, disney, chocalate mountain, omg everything that you wish a shoping mall would have. This place has it.

40,Quick and Easy,"A good quick and easy place to shop and get around. The sales were really good at most places. I was a little disappointed with the range of things on offer at places like Nike and Adidas in the mens department however my wife went to town, so it must of been good! If you are too far away from Orange County then these outlets are just as good i think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosgD9089XX
50,Great Selection of Stores,"Great selection of stores at this particular outlet shopping centre including several designer brands such as Armani, Boss, Coach, Kate Spade and Michael Kors. Conveniently located with lots of free parking.

50,GREAT SELECTION OF STORES,"This outdoor outlet shopping center offers a great opportunity to get some great deals. The adjacent parking structure is nice, with plenty of parking places. I usually go for the Michael Kors Outlet - which is always very busy! There is also a a nice Coach store. There is a 2 story Guess store, which is also very popular. There are many other stores (directory online). This outlet mall is clean with a festive atmosphere. Well worth a trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynp200
40,Nice Selection of Stores,Went here after the Christmas holiday. There is plenty of parking on the surface lot. There is also a parking garage nearby. We rode an oversized golf cart that took us from the outskirts of the surface lot to the center of the mall. This was a nice amenity. The store selection is very wide. The food court is very busy with a good variety of restaurants. Getting in and out of the place was relatively quick with easy access to the freeways. The stores we went to had some good deals with verifiable outlet prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01

50,Nice Outlet Mall,Visited here on a Tuesday around noon. They have surface parking as well as a free parking garage.

I especially liked the two level Nike store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasH779
50,Good place to shop In LA,"Good place to shop, lots of stores and good discounts. We went a few days before thanksgiving so sales may have been better than normal with stores like Reebok offering 50% off everything in store.Prices on certain things are cheaper than the UK but made them crazy cheap with extra holiday savings.I would say that the items in the stores are from the current ending season or previous season but if this doesn’t matter to you then there is opportunity for good buys.Would recommend this outlet to people. It is outside and although it’s busy it doesn’t feel like a cramped shopping mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hannah915
40,Good Shopping in LA,Really good range of shops and very good deals but missing a Ralph Lauren outlet which would have topped it off. Nike was very average.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jritchie99
50,Def the shopping place if visiting LA,"We were recommended this place by concierge and few cabbies. So glad we did with limited time in LA as they had amazing deals, outlets and prices. My wife spend good of 3 hours in few shops itself and still needed time but they closed. Good spreadout and very handy with free parking and map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525atulc
40,Fun place to shop,This is a cool place to look for some good deals. Not everything is going to be discounted but for the most part it is cheaper than your typical mall. Especially the Disney store. Parking can be a hassle but they do offer valet. The best time to come here is black Friday but you have to deal with parking and alot of people. But if that's your thing go for it. Small food court if you get hungry for foods and snacks. And they also have a couple of restaurants. I would definitely come back here and shop again with my family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selvync2014

40,Shop till you drop 😁,We had an afternoon to kill while waiting for our next flight. My husband googled outlets so off we went. This place is crowded and parking is crazy.

20,Not the best outlet,"We are used to better outlets; better prices, better location of the food court and it’s basically just a stretch of stores. So you can’t walk a circle. If you need f or b you need to walk to one of the corners. But mostly the prices; not really outlet prices just a bit discount",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANkiem

30,"Nice Outlets, come for the architecture","The outlets aren't in the best part of Los Angeles, and you will hit a lot of traffic if you are trying to leave and go back north into the city when you are done. However the architecture and parking here is cool and they have all your favorite brands and stores. Its a clean place and it attracts a lot of tourism and international tourists. There are not a lot of great places to eat here. I prefer the Cabrillo Outlets near Oxnard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
40,And then there was shopping!,"You can count on spending a lot more than 4 hours here. Lots og stores, known brands and expensive ones too. But since it's an Outlet, there are sales everywhere and you might as well buy an extra suitcase while you're here.We had so many bags we had to go to the car every now and then and unload.We stayed at a hotel in Inglewood and the drive was around 30 minutes to 40.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diskolydia
40,Busy With a lot of Shopping,Very busy on the weekends. Parking can be difficult to find. Some outlets had waiting lines to get in. Many outlet stores from which to choose what you want to buy. People from all over the area and world shop here. Near Commerce Casino and Costco.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOnlyTimeLord
50,Atmospheric and welcoming,"Having lived in the area for more than 12 years, I find The Citadel is consistently the mainstay of my restaurant visits. Always welcoming, English spoken if necessary, this restaurant provides an excellent atmosphere in an historic building at an entrance to the medieval quarter of Parthenay with the bonus of stunning views after passing through the adjacent archway.The food is typical French fare, (although Fish and Chips is available on the wide choice from the menu) and one never leaves hungry. It is also a pleasure not to have dishes with dollops of balsamic, bits of this or that plonked around at rip off prices. In other words, here is very good value, tasty meals..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terry757
50,Some great bargains,"I was quite impressed with this outlet. Stores like Nike, Addidas, Levis, Michael Kors, Clavin Klein,Tommy Hilfiger,Guess, Polo and others had very good bargains.

50,VIP Experience and More,"I read reviews on Shopping here and thought if was a great way to end a 6 week Holiday.... before a late night flight. We did the VIP package. This included pick up with luggage from our hotel, and a pass to a private lounge where we could come and go at leisure. The lounge was first class, free nibbles, and drinks. TV, wifi, books magazines, and storage for our suitcases. Staff were amazing, especially Joel...what an amazing man to have on staff...Friendly, Professional and helped with any enquiries. Great Range of Designer Labels and the savings huge. Even comparing the USA exchange rate , huge savings. It was very extremely hot & humid during our visit when we were there, so was great to come and go from the Lounge as often as we wanted. At the end of the day we were then picked up and taken straight to the airport. Would highly recommend this VIP Shopping Trip and will definately come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolegI3492RM

My teenage daughter was impressed with the MK store and myself, Quicksilver and Hue where tees where 2 for 1! Bargains galore! We are staying quite close so will probably make a few trips there. Is it worth the drive if staying in Santa Monica or Hollywood? I think so. Open until late. Plenty of car parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom
30,Covered parking available,"They are the closest outlet to my in-law's place so we have shopped here several times. This outlet mall is fine. There are many stores to choose from. Really, not much to add about this place that has not already been written.The worst thing about this outlet is the parking. Seems like we're always parking faraway. On the positive side, though, I do need the exercise.Best thing about this outlet mall, they have really nice restrooms. If they were more readily accessible from the freeway, it would make a great pit stop for a restroom break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpoNationals

We were disappointed with the size/choice in the Nike and Under Armour stores as the ones we'd been at in Vegas and Orlando were much bigger.The food area was OK, plenty of choice and it was clean. Every toilet I into was also very clean.Plenty of free parking on site and I'd recommend this outlet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gloucesterboyo

30,"Review of the Disney Outlet Store Only (They Have Great Workers, But Just So-So Prices)","I was really hoping this place would be the great store many youtubers had claimed it to be, sadly I was underwhelmed by it. I do have to say that the workers here were wonderful, very kind and more than happy to help you find anything you were looking for (as long as they had it) so that's why I'm giving it a 3 out of 5. However, the prices in the store weren't much less than what can be found in the parks themselves...and the clearance section was very limited (and many of the items in that section were still rather high priced), which is why I only purchased 1 item that I found hidden in the back of the clearance section, a frame that was originally $20 that I paid $10 for. Overall, maybe worth a visit if you're already in the area and feel like digging around for a small deal, but otherwise I would say don't bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielleeu9
50,Great place for shopping,They had a large number of outlet shops all at great prices i bought 3 pairs levis at 39$ a pair was bargain. Also Disney outlet with great prices. plus many places to eat and drink on a hot sumers day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asweet_love

I especially liked the tourist vouchers that were available from guest services.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiganT

50,Amazing Tommy Hilfiger shop,"If like me, you're from Ireland where the Tommy Hilfiger shops are small and have little or no women's clothes - this is the place for you!I spent the equivalent of 150 euro on 2 bags full of tshirts and a jacket.I must be the only woman who dreads shopping but this shop is amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41beckyk
10,not safe,"We parked in citadel outlets for less than two hours, after shopping, we found that my right rear car window was broke and my friend’s MacBook Pro was stolen, she is so sad because as a teacher in China, it costs her two months’ income. We went to security office, asked them if they bought stealing insurance, the answer is no, and security office of citadel outlets is not responsible for theft at all, so all I can do is warning customers there be careful of your property, don’t get expensive staffs lost there, no one will be responsible for your loss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xufengw2018

It is set up with laneways and is generally outdoors, so pick a clear day to visit.We visited on a Sunday and the place got busier as the day went on.There are so many stores to look at including the Nike store which had a line outside to enter. Plenty of places to eat and we chose the Ruby Dinner which is next door to Starbucks.

So disappointed...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleB156
50,Great shopping !!!,"If you are buying from higher end outlets - this place is fantastic.If your have have a late night flight this is a fantastic idea. They pick you up from your hotel (make sure you get there as soon as the shops open) and take you to the airport for your departing flight. The VIP treatment is worth the cost with storage of your bags, shopping and supply of drinks and snacks - they even give you some shopping vouchers (an improvement would be to supply some fruit). There is Armani, Nike, Asic, Tommy H, Calvin Klein etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18173
40,Great Choice of Shops. Free Parking,So it maybe that we were just lucky but coach had 70% off and Kate spade had 60% off with a extra 20% on some items!!! Therefore some shops you had to queue to get it. There is a great range of low to mid range shops and a Disney store for the kid! It’s missing off saks and polo Ralph Lauren.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1908UGmichellec
40,Good range of shops,"There are quite a few shops here to choose from, but it really depends on the day as to whether you get a bargin or not. Worth checking out if in LA.

30,Average outlet mall,"Citadel outlets at Commerce in LA are easy to get to off the I5 and the parking is easy during non peak times. The food court is fairly limited, particularly when busy with limited seating and restrooms. The range of outlets is okay and not great. The boss store is excellent, particularly when they have sales. Columbia has a good range, however most of the sports stores have a limited range with Adidas being the best.Overall worth a visit during sales but expect to que outside stores during busy times at holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmygz123
40,Excellent grouping of outlet stores with great prices!,"Right off of the I - 5, between Atlantic and Washington, the Citadel is a great grouping of really nice outlet stores with great prices. Clothing stores, shoe stores, leather and purses, etc. They seem to have everything. Parking can get tight, so they have two valet lines, one directly off Citadel Drive, and one just a little further into the parking lot. For my wife's new purse, we were able to shop Brighton, Coach, Coach Factory, and Michael Kors, all within a few hundred feet of each other. Really good daily specials at each store!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgep839

What a very nice set up they have there very open and nicely decorated open air style of shopping. Many stores to choose from some of our favorite were the Nike, Under Armor, Disney and the Vans store, but there are lots of others.

I had not had a chance to go into the food court, but maybe next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcatts
50,New and worthwhile,"We had been looking for a Bass Shoes outlet because I like their stuff. The shops used to always be in Premium Outlet malls but not any more. Bass have reorganised and there are less shops. We found them in San Clemente Outlets and bought quite a lot in Bass, Nautica, Loft and others, plus we had a nice lunch at Panera. This must be a new mall, and it has picked up shops that have gone from elsewhere. Very clean place, even the restrooms must have cost a fair bit. Definitely worth the drive from LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia

30,It was okay,The free shuttle did not arrive on time (estimated arrival was shown); almost took a lyft/uber when it was still not in sight for the next 15mins as the next timing was another hr wait. No signboard/direction to free shuttle from Union Station so we had to ask at the information counter.Standard outlet that you get in the States. Similar to the ones in Vegas.

We didn’t have time to scout the different stores in Beverly Hills so visiting Citadel was convenient.The sales were not amazing nor was the exchange rate but we managed to get a few items which we wanted and needed.Public transport from the LAX area to Citadel took almost two hours and was a real eye opener. Police approached us at the first metro stop to have a chat and warn us of downtown LA on the metro and traveling with a baby. For $30 I wish I took an uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quick_little_fox

50,Shop until you cannot carry anymore,"Spent the day shopping with two ladies that love a bargain, so this was a long day. With so many stores and all the stores having some very good deals, it took a long time going store, by store. Aldo shoes for $17, steal! Calvin Klein T shirts for under $20 and hand bags at up to 70% off crazy, but in a nice way. Food court was a bit of a let down and none of the coffee shops provided an inside seating area to enjoy your Latte out of the sun. Good range of well known brand name shops for both Women and Men. Put this on your must visit list when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imkennedy
30,"Very busy, fairly average","Visited about 1:30pm on a Sunday. Car park very busy despite there being so much of it, so be prepared to drive round/wait for a space. All the top name stores were very busy, mostly with messy stock, bigs queues to check out. Didn't think the prices were that discounted most places. I'd say it was also mostly outlet designed stock too not same quality or design as main store stock. Only good thing was being able to buy 2 pairs of Levi shorts for same price I'd pay for 1 in UK. You could probably pick up more bargains if you've the energy to look but personally I'd rather pay a bit more and have a nicer shopping experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy2587
40,Great Prices But What Does One Do With the Car?,"This place is popular for good reason. The prices are great. So many shops, so little time.But the parking is terrible. I learned that the Americans can be pretty bad drivers in this situation (maybe they were tourists so perhaps I was unfair) but they wer all so polite. No parking lot rage, nothing but smiles and patient people waiting for a spot.The parking is a bit lacking it seems but then again, I was new and perhaps I did not go the right spots.Get there early, buy your bargains and then get out. You will need some time to tavel the rather congested freeway system but it may be well worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaximumVelocity

30,Not great,"This is your standard outlet. However, unless you're willing to buy in large quantities, bargains are hard to come across. There are the odd absolute bargains, but you have to hunt for them.Do your research beforehand and plan a route around the centre because it's rather large.Parking's free, which is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0908267

50,We bought shoes and sports clothing for the whole family here!,"We didn't have a lot of time there, but we managed to get shoes and sportingwear for the whole family here. We got converse, puma and vans for such good prices. I was worried that, this bring our first shopping stop, that we'd find better deals elsewhere in LA & Vegas, but it wasn't the case.They had a great range of shoes & sizes (our kids are tall & have big feet, even the 9 yr old!) and we all got what we wanted at VERY good prices, especially compared to the high prices in Australia for the same items. Of course, it did help that we were getting nearly 80c to our dollar at the time.I was actually expecting a bigger place & an indoor mall, but it's not huge and all outdoors. We weren't disappointed at all, though, and managed to get more than expected I. The short amount of time that we had to shop.If you're in the area and enjoy getting a good deal, mainly on clothing and shoes, I'd say stop by here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac

30,Parking lot issues,"Although this outlet faces the highway and main road getting to it....if you are circling around to get to Starbucks like we did, it will shoot you right out of the parking lot. So around the outlet we drove and on the back side was where we found not only a parking a garage (which I think is free, but it isn't known from just looking at it), but also multiple entrances to parking. It just seems like backwards planning. We just popped in to grab some shorts before Disney and also breakfast at Starbucks.

We visited the outlets 4 times during our trip. Got some great bargains that you just can't get in Australia. We also enjoyed the Mexican takeaway food. Toilets are so clean and fancy!Heaps of parking. It was a really nice place to shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1eloise
50,Great outlets and great prices,Why pack clothes for your trip when you can stop and stock up with minimal fuss. The outlets are easy to navigate and have most outlets and more that are common to this format.Long weekend sales are good for a bargain!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949tg
50,Lots of Great Deals,This place was similar to a place back home but I loved the Tory Burch Outlet!!! Lots of great deals to be found here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26rochelled
40,Let's shop!,"The first thing to notice is the way this outlet presents itself. It looks if you enters an old city in old Persia. High walls and stone statues of the Fire God as half a man, half lion and eagle. The best thing to do is to go the customer service to collect the discount card. Almost all brands are represented. The only shop I missed was Ralph Lauren. Despite that it still was a nice outlet to shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArieDiepen
30,Sadly Pretty Average this time around.,"When shopping away from NZ anything that is not an Australian clothes chain is a bonus so we always look forward to the shopping in California.We make an effort to go to the Citadel ever time we are in Cali but this time around it felt like there was more construction than anything else. A number of shops were closed and there were sections of boarded walls with no indication of what was coming.We did go to Outlets at Orange and Farmers Market so maybe we were spoilt by the time we made it here. These places had many seats to take a rest, lots of different places to eat dotted around the shopping complex but the Citadel feels like it doesn't offer anything specifically to the shoppers to set it apart.I think well leave it next year and see what's going on down that way in 2019.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PalmTreeKelly
50,Wow wow wow!!,"We're from Australia and this place has ruined shopping back home. hahaha! The most amazing shopping mall. It has so many brand name stores and most of them are 60% off. I bought so much Calvin Klein, DKNY, Guess ect ( I usually wouldn't even look at those brands here in Australia) I'd travel back to America just to shop here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496tiffanys
50,good buys,the place is perfect with all the shops and prices which are cheaper compared to malls. luxury brands are present. shops are for all ages. nice place with choices of restaurants and fast foods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193albertc
40,Great shopping destination.,"If staying in Los Angeles or Anaheim its a great shopping spot. There are a huge variety of stores .All the designer brands at hugely discounted prices..We shopped at Memorial weekend and it was so busy and chaotic., but bargains galore .We ordered a shuttle for our large family of 10 from Anaheim.. It cost usd 90 each way which we split cost of.It was better than the Orange Outlets even though they are good..If you are a serious shopper like me you will be guaranteed a bargain.We spent a lot at Tommy Hilfiger and Coach and Gap and Michael Kors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janine45
50,Citadel outlets,"OMG they are so cheap I went to Michael Lots and didn't buy anything what a sad person I am , I walked around with a purse worth $250 and it was 70% off and in the end I did not buy it! Handbags worth $380 going for bugger all and still did not buy. There was nothing that spoke to me. But we went to Columbia and got 2 winter jacket plus 2 boots for $230.00 what a bargin. You can now understand why everyone has the designer handbags and clothes here, because they shop at Citadel outlets! We caught the bus there that was pretty easy. Well worth the look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip709803
50,Must-go Outlet Shopping center!,"Free parking at multi-level garage for easy accessible to Citadel. A busy and lively shopping place with savvy shoppers and families with kids. There is one ice-cream kiosk with long line and quick turn-over to order for our one big scoop in a cone, and also pay an additional empty cone at $0.50 for a total less than $5. Nice ice-cream at valued price. Worth trying!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hweeleng65
40,Nice Outlets in Los Angeles.,I visited this Outlet Mall and made a couple of great purchases. You'll find great bargains and many stores. Conveniently located just 20 min ride from city center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacc_28sv
40,Lots of stores,"Unlike some of the other outlets, this outlets offers a wide of stores that are useful. I mean, seriously, do we really need to shop at Giorgio Armani or Prada?! No, we really need stores like Nike, Under Armour, Gap, Disney, etc.The parking is pretty good though very very busy on the weekend. I wish their food court is toward the middle of the outlet so that you do not have to walk all the way to the other end for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt99941
50,Multiple Choices,"There were lots of signatures stores which was in clearance. Aside from window shopping/shopping there was also a food court in the place where you can have your meals when you get tired. Aside from that, Starbucks is there. It's a very convenient place to go to. One can find everything that you're looking for in Citadel :) 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielleceline
50,A great place to grab a bargain.,Wow the savings on clothing prices at Citadel are amazing. The prices are so cheap. All the big brand names here too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonahtree
30,Average,"Don't go looking for a bargin.Not your typical outlet shopping experience.99% of items are full price, although they will have a marked down Price tag.Hmmmmm!!Lots of shops though and you should find what your looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/463brenta
50,Designer Names - Massive Savings!,"Must have been half a dozen times or so to Citadel in LA over the past two years.To be honest only tend to buy clothes now when in AmericaCitadel have the top designer names giving you great savings!Clothes, Accessories, Watches - Check out the website for full list of storesYou can easily spend 5 - 7 hours here...Also provides a selection of cafes, rest rooms and plenty of seating areas to take a break from all that retail therapy!Great shopping experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeC643
50,Great Shopping,"If you're not from the states and love a bit of retail therapy, make the trip to the Citadel Outlets! All the top brands, great sales and discounts. It can get crowded, particularly on weekends but there is plenty of free parking and places to drop and eat, recover from your shopping frenzy. I needed to buy an additional suitcase for the homeward journey. i.e. Levi's 501's for $39US, Calvin Klein discounts up to 70% off - and they give you vouchers for further discounts if you buy additional items, Polo jeans for $21.95US, just remember that there is sales tax applied to each sale at the register, so a bit more than the marked price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookinoutallover
40,Good offers!,Lots of offers in this Outlet mallOne of the best in LA!Its near downtown and airport. 930am to 930pm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Innovu
50,Great,Very clean and nice! Very nice restrooms and offcourse all the shops is also very good. Good food options and when we was here we found parking easy and for free. But we parked kinda early so I dont know how it is during the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deal882
50,Accessible without car - save good money on brand products,"We did not have a car but there is a great arrangement for accessing this outlet. Go to Union Station (metro red line), when you exit you see a large platform area. Citadel Express shuttle departs from there (platform 7). It runs maybe every 30 min or so and the trip takes 30-40 min but it's easy, simple and free - no cost! You also get the shuttle back from Citadel to Union station. The shuttle departs from the same platforms where it leaves you upon entering the outlet.You have plenty of brand stores available and the prices are really good. The prices are significantly lower than what you find i.e in Hollywood & Highland mall. The discounts often require buying two pieces so take a friend to shop with to get the most benefits.You have cafes and restaurants so you can eat and drink. You have benches so you can rest your feet. Buildings are pretty, everything is very neat and clean. You can spend all day just browsing through the stores. Just a really great place for shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatjaFI
40,Accessible and outdoor,The outlet has number of brands at good prices but I think the best part is that it is outdoor so you get to walk and enjoy the day. The second is that you can easily reach it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914tarekk
50,Perfect!,"Many shops in outside shopping centre! Everything clean, nice. If you want to shopping go there!! Dont forget buy delicious ice cream at the entrance/end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdelaBlahutova
50,Worth The Visit.,"Outstanding outlets, you must get there early we used an uber from west Hollywood 2011 Highland Ave which coast about $21.93. If you know basicly what you want go to those shops first as the day gets busy the sizes run out. Happy shopping. I picked up a Fossil watch at 70% off however this was easter Sunday, also Nike was very bust so if you like Nike like go there first. We intended to stay half the day but ended up spending a full day shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tatkins2017
10,A total waste of time and transportation costs,"As we were just staying one day for transit , we choose between this outlet or Getty museum.I was so regret about not insist going to the Getty museum.The brands here are not exciting at all and so are their products and their price. Also, the similes of the salesperson are so fake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/playeemobil
50,Amazing Shopping!,"We came here twice during our 10-day holiday & I have to say we just loved it! Prices were amazing in all stores & all the big names are here. Who would have thought you could get a Michael Kors handbag for US$100 or a Fossil watch, engraved while you wait for US$30!!! Not only that but even though the prices are already heavily discounted lots of the time when we entered a store we were given an additional discount voucher. At some shops they also add additional discount vouchers for other stores to your receipt. Loved this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
40,Great place for sports brands,We ubered from Anaheim (40mins) and was charged $42. On the return it cost $27. Learnt today it's all about peak travel times etc. great bargains in the Nike store for shoes- I got 2 pair for $113 plus a $25 off voucher when the next purchase over $50.This shopping facility is great if you love branded clothing- check the list via the web before you go though to make sure they have a preferred store or you maybe disappointed.Our returning uber driver also drove with Lyft a similar system so have downloaded this app also- when comparing the same 2 rides there was a huge difference which will determine our choice from here on in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260raewynr
50,Awesome prices for us Aussies,"Had a great day here, purchased a $460 coach bag for $140 and many other bargains that I simply would not be able to afford in Australia. Make sure you download the voucher before you go to get a discount card, most stores will give you an extra discount on top of the already discounted prices. Make sure you visit Ruby's if you want a real American 'diner' experience.Will definitely be back next trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishelli
50,A good Outlet,The Citadel Outlets are a good address to find some clothes and other things to wear. It's very nice there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linki83
40,Better go during school time,"Large varieties of stores, foods and good deals.Good for families, benches are all over the spot but in my opinion need to put more.Outlets to charge your cell or tablet are available near food court.Advice: during holidays go with family or friends so you can wait in looong line and alternate people when they tired or need to go to the restroom. Go before stores open, so you can have the nearest parking space far from the stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L8337CVjohnm
50,Excellent Shopping Mecca,Super selection of outlet style stores. Always great prices and hidden bargains! Close in town shopping for locals and freeway close access for out of town visitors! Something here for everyone including great food!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jweismiller

If you go make sure you find & go to the customer service section b4 you start yr shopping & ask for a citadel card which enables you 2get more of a discount on your designer shopping!

The discount varies differently in each shop so it's best 2ask them b4 u go to purchase! Happy shopping! 🤗",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SulS2
40,Must visit,It's very convenient that Citadel offers free shuttles at various times to and from the outlet. This is a must visit even though there are fewer shops than expected as a lot of the brands had ongoing sale/ promos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111joannes
40,Bring photo ID,"We arrived at Citadel to go shopping only to find that we needed photo ID to use our credit cards! Our passports were at our hotel. We managed to get enough cash to complete our shopping. The place was clean, well laid out, staff were attentive and great shopping. It was worth the fare getting there as prices were significantly cheaper than in Australia. We were able to get a vegan lunch at the Pho Cafe too which was delicious. A good day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellebutton
40,Lazy day in Spring,"Very nice update to the Facility- Parking Structure and still building more ! Customers' Service Mind - Bravo ! Lots of Tourists, traffics even on the week day ! Food Court has varieties to offer !All the Branding names stores ! Nice !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuwitChart
30,"Good Sized Outlet , but not much cheaper than other local shops",I luvvv bargain hunting. I stayed in LA after flying from London just to shop for a day. So I stayed at Ra'mada ($6.00) uber ride to be near the outlet.I hit the shops straight after the 10 hour flight.I was a bit disappointed as the prices were not that much different from LA shops like Macy's.I actually found cheaper prices in Macy's than the outlet shop.So I came home with not that much bargain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelH_13
50,Great Outlet,"This was our first visit to Citadel and we'll definitely go back when next in LA!!It has a great selection of shops, well-presented and all nicely arranged with spacious walkways. Good music playing everywhere, which is always a bonus for us.We were staying in Pico, so it was a quick and easy journey getting there. Parking was plentiful, easy and free!We went specifically for the Calvin Klein Underwear shop, Skechers and Vans but there are numerous others . . too many to name from memory!Whichever store we visited, the staff were friendly and attentive.Fantastic shopping in the beautiful Californian sunshine . . what more could you ask?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Westwick
40,"""Good Local Outlets with Name Brands""","I enjoy visiting this Outlet during the major holidays (ie. After Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.). Top name brands like MK, Adidas, Levis, Converse, GAP, Coach, etc. My favorite is Adidas... I have a friend who works there and they give me their employee discount which is about 30% on top of whatever discounts the store is having. You just have to know somebody who works there and they can do this per Adidas!The Converse store is another one of my favorites... I buy most of my kids shoes here before they go back to school. I always look at the ""Clearance"" section first and I get lucky with a pair of cool high or low tops for my daughters.The crowed is sometimes huge, so are the lines to pay and parking can be bad during these special deal days/holidays at this Outlet, but you wont find a better price in the local area for my two favorite stores that I reviewed here for you.Note: They have several outdoor benches, small food court with outdoor tables and chairs, restaurants, fast food, etc. valet parking for about $5, a friendly customer service office for all that have questions or concerns and they include current exchange rates, lotto (scratcher for sale), phones, large clean restrooms with changing stations for babies/little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelgI5892GX
30,Try this monster of a shopping center when you want a unique item,"Housed in the former Goodyear plant, the facade is unlike anywhere else in SoCal.

Go to their webpage to see who is having a sale before you break open your piggy bank.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseh187
40,New Outlet Mall that Offers Great Store Selections and Substantial Discounts!!!,"We were staying just down the street from this outlet mall at the Crown Plaza, as since this is kind of an industrial area, we went here a number of times to eat and to do some shopping. The mall appears to be relatively new which was very nice, the stores were all in great shape and had lots of selections at great prices, which means we spent a lot of money there.The food court offers a number of your standard food selections and was adequate. Parking was a bit of a problem when we went on a Saturday night, but that was to be expected as that is peak time. The other times that we went there was no issue with parking whatsoever.So if your in the area, be sure to stop by and enjoy good cheap shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swaggger007
40,Great outlet mall.,This is a great outlet mall but it is super busy so be sure to plan accordingly in order to avoid the traffic. Lots of stores to choose from and some decent restaurants to eat at in between. You probably won't be ably to hit every store in one day so check out the website before to make sure you find all the stores you really want to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598bibiq
40,Great shopping,I love shoes....... I found great buys here........ you can get name brand items at a discount......the weather was nice and I appreciate the sales representatives kind words and help.

30,Not really an outlet mall,"I have been to outlets in Camarillo, St Louis and New York (New Jersey) and this oulet in comparison was not that great.Prices were the same as most retail shops and selection was pretty limited. There are not that many shops either, compared to the other outlets I have visited.This was the last outlet we had to shop at and unfortunately we could not finish getting all the things we wanted.Bonus, if I could call it that, it was raining so very few people were there making looking around much easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cat33R
30,Standard Outlet outside strip mall - nothing spectacular - prices still high,"Stayed at a hotel next to this mall. Decided to walk through it - has all the basic chain stores. I walked into a few Men's clothing stores and did not see any sales worth any purchases. I am used to going to Outlet malls in the Southern states and the discounts I saw in the LA outlet were not good enough for me to buy anything. Also the food court was pitiful. just several low end fast food chains. Overall I give it a ""average"" rating based in the sheer number of chain stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jqgoode
40,Great place for shopping,"This is a massive outlet, if you like shopping just like I do then you will enjoy, make sure you have enough time, we were there 3.5 hrs on Saturday night and it was not enough, prices are ok and good brands can be found, wear comfy shoes and bring a coat in winter as it get windy this is outdoors mall so you need to walk out to go to the next shop, enjoy 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599JoeR599

50,AUSTRALIANS you must shop here!,"We're from Australia and I can easily tell you that we (Australians) get so ripped off with everything! My husband, 2 kids and I bought 4 pairs of shoes from the Nike Outlet for $130 including tax!! In Australia that total price equals 1 shoe!!!! We bought alot of things from the Disney store. A MAui toy (from the Disney movie Moana) cost only $36 but when we came back to Australia, the shops were charging $80+ for the exact same item!! All I can say is, if you're from Australia. Go crazy on the items because we get RIPPED off back home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf
40,"A lot of shops, great for bargains",Our last day in the US was well spent buying up big at the Citadel. Heaps of shops with a good range of stock. Not that close to the tourist parts of LA but worth the $30 Uber fare. We ended up being at the Citadel for over 4 hours. There are a number of cafes and a food court to help you get through the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alistairt954
50,Shopping heaven,"Coming from New Zealand where we get ripped off for everything, we found this place amazing and well worth it. Have been twice (2014 & 2016) and got great deals both times.Spent a whole day here. In 2014 it was very busy and had to queue to pay for items at most stores but in 2016 it was very quiet.We have found its cheaper to pay the airfare from NZ to LA and shop for the whole family at Citadel, than buy similar things in NZ.Will be back for sure :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyh26
50,Nice deals,"We visit this outlet couple times a year. Parking can be challenging during the weekends but during weekdays we don't wast much time in finding one. Deals vary. We compare them with the outlets at Camarillo. Sometimes you are lucky to find nice discounted products. Easy located next to the I5. The food options are there but most of them are pretty crowded, i.e. long lines in the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arno0571
40,Good value shopping trip,"Enjoyed a few hours shopping here with my teenage kids. There is a good variety of stores, and something for everyone. The only thing missing are some decent places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizF12345
40,This was an excellent place to shop.,"So everything we saw or did in California was EXPENSIVE, Groceries, parking, restaurants, and entertainment.This mall is not. We stopped in about half the shops and was surprised at the prices and sales.Most of the staff were helpful and friendly.if there had been room in the bags, we would of brought home more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318bks
10,NOTHING SPECIAL BUT WHY SO BUSY?,Worst parking setup ever. Took me 20 minutes just to figure out how to leave the lot. Stores are nothing special too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike-in-bako
30,You can easily spend a day here,A pretty nice shopping mall where you can find basically everything. Sometimes there seems to be so many people that you actually need to wait in line before you can get into specific stores. Prices are good and often you get discount coupons to other stores when purchasing something.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TittaK21
50,Great shopping,"I have been here like plenty of times, sometimes you end up getting things like 70-80% off, and sometimes they are just normal prices, overall, great brands and good shopping",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466ahmedj
50,Vibrant & Great Deals!,"Where the deals are and Super crowded! Parking was super challenging during weekends and holidays. Go to Customer Service and show your AAA for a VIP discount book. This outlet has way more variety than Barstow Outlets - no need to drive all the way out there for same quality stores (considering price of gas); and, yes, aside from a few quality stores Barstow stores alley where a bunch of stores have moved out looks depressing. Citadel is vibrant!For luxe items, they have a Luxe store (Luxe is part of the name of the store) featuring a tiny variety and selection of brands under one roof: Celine, Tod's, Versace, etc. There is also a Bally store next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lu5i44rim5
40,Good shopping experience,"Visited last in August 2015. Sometimes it's hit and miss even at the same time the following year. Depends on fashions. Sometimes I've found really nice clothes at good prices and other times left empty handed either because the styles weren't very nice or nice, but sales weren't good enough to spend the $. You probably only need 2-3 hours if even. If you're alone and you only go to the stores you like, it might be less than that. Seating for those who don't want to shop is located throughout, but the cushy chairs are near BCBG and Guess?. Decent size outlet. Go find the tourism center when you arrive and pick up the visitors discount book. Sometimes there's some good discounts that can be used in conjunction with the sales. Located about 45 minutes north of Anaheim in the city of Commerce. Don't go on any holiday as you'll be overwhelmed by the crowds on the freeways and then once you arrive here. My Mum forgot about Memorial Day in May 2015 and she said it was like a madhouse that Monday on the way to the outlets and then at them. Small food court at the rear of the center with Panda Express, sparrow, Starbucks. There is also some dining areas around the parking lot area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins

50,Best Place to Shop in Los Angeles,"I had a 7-hour layover in Los Angeles and because Citadel Outlets was the closest outlet mall to the airport; I just had to make a trip there to do some Christmas shopping. The deals there are really fabulous and they carry a lot of brands there. Even shopping 2/3 hours wasn't enough for me and I really enjoyed myself there. If I had more time, I probably would have burnt a big hole in my pocket because the prices are really a steal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awinsomelife

20,"Avoid! Prices are hardly outlet worthy, and you will save more than 30% elsewhere!","To pass the time on the drive up to Barstow, I did some retail therapy here.The Hugo Boss suit I bought was great. The only problem was that I found the same suit later at North Premium outlet at $200 less!The moral of the story? If you can make the 4 hour drive up to Vegas, do it, because $200 will more than cover the gas and food BOTH ways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrocker7
50,Fantastic shopping destination,"If you're looking for an outlet mall in the LA area, this is the place to go! A fantastic range of shops with good discounts across a well laid-out outdoor mall.

40,Shopping Trip,Lots of great shops. From Old Navy to Nike to True Religion.I didn't find the prices as comparable as other national outlets. But the ambiance and vibe were great.I loved the free shuttle from downtown LA. That made it a lot easier for us to get to and depart from. The shuttle driver was also very friendly and eager to show us around downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelm183
50,Shop til you drop!,"To have a nice little break from Los Angeles and the madness head on down to Citadel. Complimentary transport from Union Station and return!Excellent selection of shops, get there early, check website for opening times as it gets very busy!No real traditional food court but Ruby's Diner just on the grounds is fab with the usual diner food plus gorgeous and huge salads!Beautiful restrooms and spotlessly clean and most of all plenty of bargains to be had!Shop til you drop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaStorey
40,Real treat after hard work,Spending half the day here after my conference ended was a real treat after hard work at the conference. Nice mix of shops - impressed that staff at Coach could speak some Mandarin with the PRC shoppers. Sufficient food choices to catch a quick bite before getting back to the real business of shopping.Christmas came early! They were putting up a huge tree at the end of October!The shuttle service from the Convention Center hotels to the mall and back was comfortable with onboard wifi. Worthwhile paying for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneK289
50,Love shopping like me?,"I love shopping i truly do its my favorite thing to do so a visit to this outlet was a must for someone like me.When we drove in it was obvious parking was going to be a problem so for $5 let the friendly valet team take care of that for you. This outlet is fairly large it is all open-air with nice seating & shaded areas for the non shoppers to wait & relax. There are various vendors selling snacks & a decent sized food court, the ladies restroom facilities were a big surprise they are gorgeous.When we needed a respite from shopping & some sustenance Ruby`s Diner covered our needs perfectly.I like everyone have my favourite brands, i do know a bargain when i see one & i know my prices. I also come from australia & at this time our dollar is not strong against the US dollar so you really need to know weather your actually getting a good deal or paying too much. The biggest annoyance with outlets for me even ones in australia are that brands also stock their lastest lines/products with the same prices as you would pay in their flagship stores seriously I just want items that are on sale is`nt that the point! It frustrates me also when these outlet stores are ""packed to the rafters"" with stock that they need to move but offer very very average discounts.My favourite stores at Citidel were Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Coach, Max Azria & Guess.There were many other stores & brands that i shopped in but these were where i spent most of my money & got the best bargains. A lot of these brands can be expensive to purchase at home so i will always check out these stores before say H&M, Gap etc. Im not into sports so outlets for brands like Nike, Asics, Adidas etc are stores I dont even walk into. I also dont follow the ""active-wear"" trend in anyway so im unsure about the discounts on these clothing styles. The outlets selling make-up, perfumes etc i thought were not really offering discounts that they should be in an outlet setting. My advice would be check out on line what stores they offer that you would buy from im a handbag girl so i was well catered for. To sum up if your sport of choice is shopping like mine you wont be dissappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortez48
50,Shopaholics Dream,"We went to Citadel Outlets mainly for our daughter as clothing & shoes choice in New Zealand is limited outside of Auckland. Lots of great stores here, including our favourites GAP, H&M, and Sketchers. A good selection everywhere, and glad of the extra baggage allowance on the flight home.Certainly worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuarto29
40,Good shops and restaurants,Lots of good shops and several restaurants. Something for everyone.It was decorated for Christmas in October. It looked nice but kind of early for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
40,Outlet in LA,This is a pretty good outlet mall. There is ample free parking and also valet parking. It's right off the freeway. The stores are ok. Camarillo premium outlets is much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
40,take advantage of the free shuttle from downtown LA,The shuttle from Downtown LA made this easily accessible (and was free!). Shops opened at 10am and my first stop was customer service to get the free coupon book for extra savings. It is a huge complex and open air so on a hot day it does get rather warm. The stores are nicely air conditioned though. I ended up spending about 5 hours here and saw almost everything that I wanted to before returning to the city. There seemed to be good bargains in most stores - you just had to restrict yourself depending on your luggage allowance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seabird21
40,"Great outlets, NYDJ is gone!!!",Really worth the stop to this outlet center! My favorite store is leaving though. This will be the last week for the NOT Your Daughters Jeans store! This is too bad! Nice outlet mall though!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205kiml

Was able to use the 10% discount from the coupon booklet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955andreaa
50,Shop until you drop,We went to the Northern mall on the Strip in Las Vegas a week or so ago and we drove to this place during our stay in LA and it is comparable with it. Good range of shops and food area. Great wardrobe refresh opportunity and great bargains on offer which negate the £/$ current (almost) parity as 50% off pretty much everywhere. So what are you waiting for!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Insearch0fadventure
50,Shop your life away,"As you can expect for any American outlet, the deals are great specially if you go there on a Holiday. Unknowingly we went on Colombia day and found special deals for the day.I recommend you check their website to see if the stores you can find there interest you.The parking space is free and there are plenty to pick from.There is a foodcourt and sit down restaurants for when you are hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viacely
50,Citadel vip shopping,This place was terrific. Prices were comparable to other outlets we hsd been to. The big srand out is that you can turn what is normally a waste of a day waiting for your flight into a fun experience. The vip loung was fantastic. We were taken there by karmel shuttles and met by angie the customer service person. She showed us wherd to go and pointed out all the free drinks and coffee and snacks. The lounge has tv music wifi and very comfy seats. It is like a hotel lounge. We loved it and bought lots of clothes. You also get a discount card and vouchers. Soooo worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roslynnannipier

50,Great shopping destination.,We visited a few outlets in different cities and found that the Citadel Outlets in LA were by far the best. They have more shops and better bargains than the others we shopped at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ciz64
30,All the usual retailers,The best thing about this outlet is the multi-storey car park where your car can wait in the shade! Food outlets mostly at one end so a bit of a walk in the heat today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueDen27

40,Some Bargains to be found,Visited this outlet in weekday around noon. Parking was a bit of a hassle as you are driving around and around looking for a space. However when we were leaving at 1730hrs it was half empty.On the whole a good experience but I found prices have gone up considerably to my last visit. Food court was nice and clean. A few bargains in some of the shops. However do your research before you go to know your prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Niall030598
40,A good outlet not so far away,Citadel Outlets is centrally located and not so remote. Most of the name brands you look for are here.

Citadel has your usual Outlet stores but it also has a number of stores I hadn't been in before including homeware stores. I couldn't help but walk away with both arms carrying bags.The outdoor food court is great with a large range of food options and it is easy to sit and relax and loose timeThere's also a range of other eateries scattered around if you so desire something bit more special.A number of amenities areas including toilets and parent rooms are within easy walk from anywhere in the complexDefinitely a place to visit if you want quality at great prices but just make sure you can show your taxi driver where it is, as not every local knows about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayleS47
50,Centrally Located Outlet Store,Citadel Outlets is the nearest outlet stores coming from LAX (Camarillo and Ontario Mills are further away). There are lots of name brand stores with very good deals. Come in early as lots of people come here and so parking would be easy. There is a food court if you get tired and hungry shopping. It was sunny and warm when we visited so hydrate because plenty of walking outdoors. Bring a roller luggage if planning for big shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Junix19
30,a great variety of shops,"There is a wide variety of shops here for people to explore - lots of different brands covered, although the prices in some are not as competitive as you would hope. Be careful when shopping for a bargain - there may be other 'outlets' out there that offer better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieA12
40,Very good for shopping,This place is highly recommended. Good price. Near the city. Also you can go too camarillo outlets too if you are a shop-addict. Great brands and stores. The foodcourt is also good with many options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713amirb
40,Good choice for outlet shopping,"Overnight stay in LAX en route back to the UKFound it easy to drive to , about 35 minutes from Hollywood Boulevard though the freeways were very heavy with trafficAs others have said , parking spaces are hard to come by . We arrived at 1200 and had to drive around to find any sort of spaceFor the UK tourist , this outlet will cover 90% of your needs .apart from designer brands there are some high st names here as well . We only had a couple of hours but you could easily spend 4-5 hours here browsing every shopPlenty of eateries , rest rooms and a couple of customer service pointsShame for us that the rate of exchange is so lousy at the moment as it made some items as expensive as buying in the UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spachick64
30,Best Bargain - An Ice Cream!,"These outlets (UK and USA) seem to have very little in the way of bargains, albeit they herald 20%/50%/70% discounts.Often, they sell items ""Specially bought in"" not originals.We bought some Converse shoes at the same price they can be bought in England.One of our party decided they would have an ice cream from the stall near GAP. On return, I queried why they had bought such a large one.Apparently, this was the smallest available!Best bargain of the day.Very Very busy place. Manic car park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
30,Shopping!,"We picked this as we wanted an outlet shopping visit on our trip to LA. It doesn't have all the labels you'd hope for but there are some bargains to be had if you look hard enough. In hindsight, its not as cheap as you'd think and it's quite a drive from the more touristy locations (hollywood etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5

30,Good. Personally prefer Premium Outlets,"We visited here because we had heard about it but had not been in the area. We decided to stop in on our return trip from dropping someone off at LAX. It is an attractive center but rather awkwardly laid out. We had read on line there was an Eddie Bauer Outlet store which turned out to be false. That was as a major disappointment. There were a lot of people so I am sure they meet the needs of the community. I just found the normal outlet store which I can get at my local outlet.This is a nice mall and if you are in the area, give it a try. It just isn't worth the extra drive for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrGrammyLinda
30,"Okay outlet mall, mad traffic around",Mall is in a very central location of Los Angeles and does suffer from heavy traffic around. Not as big as the two premium outlet malls but easier and quicker to get to. Take a passport or a coupon off the internet to get discount coupons from the information office.Dont even try to look for a parking spot go straight to the multi storeys. Does lack food outlets and they are very busy during the day. Best place is Rubys if you have time. Make sure you have a map and know where you want to go as you can very easily miss places.The restrooms are some of the best in any mall we have ever come across.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735

Complaints to their customer service did not yield any results.Go to the mall for sure, but avoid the""Watch Station"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIRTI3723
40,"""Good outlets""",This place is nice and clean. You will find a lot of shops ... Maybe before you should have a look on their website to see what kind of stores they have and general information in order to maximise your shopping ;-) Also have a food court.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMT-76
40,Great deals on shopping and free parking,Moderate sized mall with predominantly clothes and shoes store outlets at good discounts. Some jewellers too. Hardly any electronics stores. Large food court with an open shaded dining area with seating for 200 plus. Ruby's diner inside the complex. Classic diner fare. Go to the Guest services office close to food court to show your driving license and get a coupon book to save you more money. Need about 2 hours here.Unless you are a woman....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctorcoolguy

40,Great shopping,Great shopping plenty of stores prices good if your dollar is up against USA dollar otherwise need to weigh up your options. Hard to get to if you don't have a car.

50,Great Shopping Destination!,"We initially did not know about this place until the front desk staff at our hotel recommended it to us. Citadel Outlets is a very nice shopping location and has many different stores. I really liked the discounts at several shoes stores likes Vans, Puma, Nike, etc. while my mom liked Kate Spade and Michael Kors. The food court also has a lot of option to choose from and, of course, you have your typical Starbucks and Jamba Juice! We spent around 3-4 hours shopping here and got to around most stores. Great for an afternoon activity if you like shopping and you are near downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexfoodi

Michael Kors, Coach, Kate Spade, Hanes, Under Armour, etc. They also have a VIP Savings Card you can get at the Guest Services center. You get discounts at most of the stores and food places there. There's a nice food court and they also have a Starbucks. It's very convenient to get to since it's right off Interstate 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingParent1
30,"Great choice of shops, not all that cheap as uk buyer","Great choice of shops, under armour, dkny, nike, vans, tommy hilfiger, banana republic etc etc. Nike had great choice and cheaper clothes and trainers than uk. We did notice quite a lot of iteme in some shops were actually the same price as at home. You need to register to get a 15% discount card at the reception area. You need to show photo i.d. Not all shops accepted this card, one of which is nike. Icecream, and food restaurants here too, lots of choices of placed to get takeout to eat in seated area nearby. Worth a trip. If staying in Anaheim, its quite a trek in rush hour. Dont get a train as v expensive. Get the $9 adult ticket for a shuttle from Anaheim instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunsetskys

40,Shopping,"This place made our shopping experience so easy! We were there early, so parking was nice & easy. I don't always look forward to shopping when I'm on holiday, hate rushing from place to place, but this place was a hit. Obviously helps to plan well - we went back the following day around lunch time & it took a lot linger to find a car park. Because it was school holidays the bigger stores like GAP, Old Navy & Nike were chaos - lines for checkout were very long. Great shopping experience, everything you need in one place, great prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ursh503

And when we were there there were not too many people. So the shopping experience was just great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976natew
10,avoid - better off going to the local mall.,"I hate this place and curse it every time I drive past it on the 5 fwy. First of all, their parking lot is a mess so it clogs up traffic on Washington as well as the 5. They added some more parking spaces over the years but on the weekend or during busy shopping times there will be a line of cars literally half a mile long (not being hyperbolic, it really is half a mile long) to get into the one lane entrance. It's ridiculous. They could not have picked a worse spot to place this mall. Second, this ""outlet"" is really an outdoor mall and none of the stores have any deals that are any better than the local mall to explain such crowds. It's the same stuff! Third, most of the items carried at most of these stores are like last seasons items in very limited sizes. I don't get this place at all. Horrible waste of time and space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller

50,OMG- fantastic!!!,"I was quite suprised at the lack of outlet malls in LA having been to various places in the US and there having been lots.We were staying in Hollywood so we needed a car to get here. Luckily we had other places to visit too so when we did get a car this was top of my list!Some people say the Grove is a great shopping place but I didnt really rate it too much.This on the other hand was fab!About 30-40 minute drive from Hollywood, there was lots of parking. It is all outside like an outlet village so dont forget the sunscreen as it does get quite hot and maybe take some water too.The shops are varied, CK, Guess, Ugg, Levi, Michael Kors, Skechers, Vans, and lots of other shops tooo. Quite a good variety of places to eat too.Spent an absoloute fortune there but got some great bargins like 2 pair of Uggs for £150 and Levis at £25 a pair.Love this place and I think it comes second only to Century 21 in NYC which I doubt could be beaten.Definitely worth a visit, hire a car, probably less than a taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUZIELOU
50,Little Gem in Commerce California !,"Basically, this is an outdoor outlet mall with lots of choices. The prices are very good relative to the quality and brands offered. I compared prices to those at the mall and the discounts on a lot of stuff are outstanding. The Gap Store in particular had lots of good stuff. Also, there is a small food court and plenty of free parking there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bandit004
30,OK if you mainly shop for name brand stuff,"This is not as good of a bargain as they want you to believe. Most of the time it is out of season stuff that has been marked up and then marked down. If you like name brand high end stuff then maybe you will find bargains here but otherwise it is no different then shopping at Marshalls or Burlington, just less crowds. The parking is better lately but still is very crowded on certain days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch

40,Wide Selection for Shopping & Diverse Food Court,"We were staying at the adjoining Doubletree Hotel and used the outlets for quick eats, morning coffee, and a little evening browsing of the stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460RobertS460
30,Regular Outlet Shopping,This is just a regular outlet shopping place. Nothing unusual. Just like any other place. Check it out if your in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsshellyB
40,Good shopping,"Saved all our shopping till the last couple of days of our 3 week trip. Not an easy place to get to but used Uber to get to Citadels and back. Very impressed how clean everything was and the variety of shops. Prices were good in comparison to Australia. Only annoying thing for us, is that the price on the ticket doesn't include tax. Was surprised no Ralph Lauren outlet.Good buys from Nike and luggage shops.The just need another Starbucks as queues were very long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenc967
40,Your average outlet mall,"Very nice outlet mall. The surrounding area can be a bit iffy, but the stores themselves are super nice. Bathrooms were clean, food areas were clean. Had all the great stores!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714gabbys
40,Not fancy but good deals,Michael Kors was good 50% off plus 20% if you spend 250 dollars. Nike and adidas good too. Use concierge parking rather than waiting for a space,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761inderpalr
50,"Amazing prices, amazing shops!!","My boyfriend and I visited Citadel Outlets as we were on vacation in Los Angeles from England. We really wanted to find somewhere that we could shop, however, for reasonable prices and good bargains!When we arrived at Citadel Outlets and had a look in the shops such as Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Guess etc - I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the lovely accessories and clothes and the amazing prices which went with them! I could not believe how cheap it was, however I am speaking from a British point of view, where the shopping and prices work out a lot cheaper in comparison to London prices.I ended up buying some gorgeous MK bags/purses, a few things from CK and Guess, and some gifts for family. Almost everything had a good discounted percentage off, some of the prices were unbelievably good!My partner and I ended up travelling down to citadel a few times.It does get VERY busy, especially on a Sunday, so make sure you get there when it opens at 10am to avoid long queues and waiting.There are also a few food places, we went to 'Ruby's Diner' which we absolutely loved! The milkshakes were amazing and refillable fries came with most meals too.Overall, we had a lovely shopping experience at Citadel Outlets, and I highly recommend it to everyone - especially to those who are on vacation in LA and love to shop :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyleigh22
50,Great shopping,"Great shopping place with plenty of brands considered as quality fashion in Europe, such as Guess, Ck, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani, Boss etc. American brands are lot cheaper than in Europe and there is always great discounts and possibilities to keep prices even lower. Surroundings with lovely palm trees and there is plenty of confident and fresh restrooms. Generous with parking lots and restaurants if you are hungry.I will definitely visit this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21nenadj
50,GREAT cheap shopping for designer stuff,Me and the Mrs went to this to shop a little and boy did we shop. We ended up coming here 3 times during our 10day stay. Not the easiest place to get to so need a cab. But some great prices and sales on in nearly every store. You can also get a savings card from reception which gives you even more discount on a lot of the shops. Went on a Sunday once and got very busy however from about 1 onwards so would recommend getting your shopping done early.Would definitely recommend the Calvin klein store and guess which had some great deals. Also found that Calvin klein always gave Tommy Hilfiger discounts when you bought something and vica versa so take a look.WIFI available but found it harder to connect on the 2nd and 3rd day. Some good food places too. Ruby's diner recommended for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraiva28
40,Great for those who like shopping,"I was dragged there by my partner who loves shopping while I hate shopping but even I have to admit there were bargains to be had in the designer outlets.Not the easiest place to go without a car, no metro and going by bus does not feel too safe so a taxi is the best wy but then it is pot luck finding a taxi to get away again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/futsanglung
40,Lots of Variety!,"I am not sure that there are really any bargain here but it is a nice outdoor shopping experience. I was here once before when it first opened about 25 years ago. I was underwhelmed. Friends told me that it was much improved with many high-end stores. What finally prompted a visit was the knowledge that they had a Le Crueset store. So I mounted an expedition with three friends. I was impressed with the meandering layout and the cleanliness. I hit the restrooms and they were immaculate. There is even a money exchange. Apparently, this is a bus tour stop for many foreign travelers. Who knew? I hit Le Crueset, Croc and Fragrance Outlet making purchases at each. We also stopped at Volcom, NYDJ, and Kate Spade. You have to stand in line at Kate Spade since only so many people are allowed in at a time. It was only a few minutes. There seems to be a hundred or more stores. There is dining. I saw a Ruby's Diner. There are vending stations with water and soft drinks. No bargain at $2.50 a bottle but when you need water you need water now! The parking is great and free. There is a parking structure and lot parking. The service at Le Crueset was very good. They kept my purchases and carried them out to my car which I was instructed to park right at the curb in front of the store when were leaving. Nice, cast iron is heavy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
50,VIP lounge!,We planned our last day shopping at the Citadel Outlets - The shuttle picked us from our LAX hotel in the morning along with our luggage as we were flying out at 11pm. Which they organised the timing perfectly to get to the airport for our return.We were totally blown away from the VIP lounge - (we didn't want to leave it) Our luggage was put away into rooms/lockers. There were complimentary snacks and drinks available all day. You could come and go and return with your purchases.The amenities were fit for princess!!We also had the space and privacy to pack our suitcases ready for the long flight home.Totally recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCloveaffair
30,All kinds of shops in a wierd fortress theme,The typical chains you'd find in an outlet mall with a odd fortress like setting. I guess the big wall along the freeway keeps out the sound.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
30,Not that cheap!,"Many nice shops, but no real outlet prices. I guess it's too close to LA? Visited numerous outlets throughout US and the world. This is average - both in selection of prices and variety of shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Wolf_Bek
30,Good Shopping,"After shopping at the Premium Outlets in Las Vegas, Citadel was a minor ! But then again it was not bad. Not all major brands were here. It's all open so a little hot. Food outlets are limited too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikareeta
40,Plenty to choose from - where do you start?,"The citadel is a premium factory outlet and it has all of the top brands here at rock bottom prices! Not a single shop did not have an extra sale going on. Citadel is easily accessible, lots of free parking and plenty to choose from. I would suggest that you go online first to check your map and then plan what order you want to hit the shops in. There is definitely too much here for just one day. I have been to many of the factory outlets and this one has to be the cleanest and most well laid out to shop at. Why pay full price? One hint - don't wait to get lunch at peak lunch time - it is very hard to get a seat and there is a long wait. (Could use more food outlets!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenB223
50,Where you will empty your pocket,Went there during X'mas sales and got very great deal/discount. Pity that some shops are closing down but good for clearance price. Enjoyable outlet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookiemonster19
30,"getting bigger, but loosing good stores","There was a time when I chose to window shop at this place(i.e. did not really need anything, but went anyways and found great stuff). Now I am disappointed that the CaBi store is gone, as well as Vince Camuto and French Connection. Do not care for additional stores such as Aeropostale etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingrid651
50,A great place to spend money!,"We loved shopping at the Citadel. We were staying in Hollywood without a car so took the underground to Union Station and caught the free bus to Citadel. This did take some time but as this was our first visit, it was all part of the trip. We stayed at Citadel longer than expected so took Uber back and this cost us about USD 25.The shops we loved were Michael Kors, Nike, Adidas, Converse, NYDJ, Levi's, Calvin Klein, Coach, Sketchers, Kate Spade. Compared to Macy's or our shops at home (New Zealand) the prices were amazing. When we first arrived we popped into the information centre and received a map along with a discount card for additional savings.The shops are spacious, modern and well maintained.The toilets were spotless and the nicest smelling I've ever been into. There was a wonderful lounge next to them that was lovely to take a rest in. There was free wifi everywhere.Food places were limited but we had a quick lunch at Starbucks and got on with our main aim of shopping til we dropped!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimandCliff
50,Must visit if you want to shop,"We have been to so many outlets and malls. I must say this outlet mall has a lot of shopping varieties. We found a lot of deals. Visiting LA, I thought things would be way too much expensive here. I thought we would not get a lot of deals. But I was wrong so many options and so many deals!I read a few reviews saying it's not a good place and all. No. It has free parking and lots of stores have so many specials. Really a nice outlet mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aashu5190

40,A typical Premium Outlet,"This outlet stores isnt a humoungous one but it still have some notable brands like Coach, MK, Kate Spade, Nike, Under Armour etcThe layout is pretty simple, in a straight line formation. Not many eatieries or bistros but then again I doubt you would go beyond 3 hours here unless you're a true shopaholic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Officially_Sanjay

40,Nice Mall,The Citadel Outlet Mall is pretty big and offers all brands one would look for. Enough parking spaces. Quite conveniently located rather central in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christpost
40,Great Disney outlet store,"Disney outlets are few and far between I have found, this store had the most adult selections I found all the Disney stores are full of smaller kids stuff besides Orlando",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonanMatt
40,Killing Time,We spent a few hours here while waiting for the others who went to Disney. It's a smaller outlet compared with others that we went to but shopping is also great. The food court however is very small and there was very little to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chumadle
40,Good variety of stores,"This outlet has a good selection of stores. The ""bargains"" we're ok, depending on the store. I did pretty good at Kate Spade :) This outlet is definitely worth a stop even if you are short on time like we were. It was easy to find the stores we were specifically looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne0014
50,Citadel Outlets Shopping,"This is a great shopping outlet for all the top brands at discount prices especially for travelers from Australia. If the dollar is good you can grab some real bargains.I personally love Micheal kors handbags and found that they are way cheaper at this outlet even though the Aus dollar was only around 69c it was still way cheaper.My other favourites are Nike,Guess,chocolate factory, Nine West,And many more this place has it all.If you are a traveler and love to shop my top tip is go to the information centre first thing when you get there and get one of there free discount cards.This gives you even further discounts from many of the shops and it lasts for a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahjustinwilkie
30,Not the best,Too much of a hassle to drive into & get parked then the variety of shops isn't the best. Busy place in LA so advice would be to get there early. No Ralph Lauren on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McAnnie1

Dining is limited to one restaurant and a food court. Wear comfortable shoes as you will want to shop and there are lots of shops to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/King_Bob_Rules
40,Convenient,"There are many , many name brand stores to shop from. I came here on Mother's day with a friend and at first I thought it was a bad idea, because parking was a small issue. Once we got into the shopping area the crowds were not bad at all. Holiday or not, shopping there is a breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardR195

Bargains_________,"We drove there from Eagle rock road a bit of a long drive but worthwhile, we arrived early just before 11am and it was not busy, as the day went on it got busy and ques start to form in the shop changing rooms.Every shop has a deal on from 20% 25% to 50% off the ticket price.We left just after 4pm.Free parkingPlenty of resturants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perkanater

50,Great Place to Shop,We enjoyed shopping at the Citadel. We did not get round half of the stores but we did get what we wanted. This large group of outlet stores have pleasant places to walk outside in the sunshine between them and plenty of places to park for free. Theres plenty of refreshments available and I would recommend a visit here for shoppers keen to hook a deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580janc
50,Worth the Drive,Despite the outer location this place is fantastic. We got there at 10.00am on a Monday and it was understandably quiet( I hear its bedlam on a Saturday) All the major brands and then some. Not many eating places and quite spread out but bargains galore specifically clothes and shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussiekiki

Note the courtesy bus arrival at union station is sporadic and not always at the estimated time indicated, but if you're patient it will arrive and you won't be disappointed at the outlet savings. Food court offers a good variety of food. Enjoy shopping ......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aroundabout66

40,This place just keeps growing bigger,This is now one of the busiest outlet malls in the region. They have just added a huge parking structure that dominates the skyline of Commerce. They have lots of shops and now more and better places to eat. They have all usual outlet shops and a few more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,The original outlet mall,I have been coming to the Citadel Outlets since they opened in 1990. This was the only outlet mall around before the outlet boom. They have grown over the years with several expansions and have some great shops. You can easily spend a few hours here and the new parking structures make parking easy. Get here early to avoid the crowds and tour buses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockNCreekGirl
30,shopping with good discount. Fantastic? No!,Went there on Thursday afternoon to try to score some deals on stuffs. But how many t shirts or shirts or trouser would you need !! Well we went to asics and got some deals which I don't find to be very good. And I really don't want to waste time going thru outlets to check. I just bought and go. They are no longer that good in prices and the outlets are not reducing much. Would I take a long drive to Camarillo or the others outlets or even This one. No way Jose!! If your group wants to go waste an afternoon or morning there by all means go. Don't expect real good deals. Just the slightly more discounted deals.On the way back the jams is worst than its bite in the evening !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854colint
30,Citadel Outlets,"It's Ok but not great. The drive from the valley is 35 minutes. The layout at Citadel is huge and is not so easy to navigate from store to store. There is insufficient parking for the overall size of the mall so it took some time on Monday to find parking. As for the actual shops. They're OK. I guess if you don't frequent the outlets this is fine. Don't shop for the sake of it you or can get carried away by perceived bargains. I was upset that Rockport, the mens' shoe shop has closed down but that's how it goes. To be honest I prefer Camarillo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaybea33
40,Massive,This place is huge you could easily get lost around here. You can get some great discounts from the designer shops as the majority had sales on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414jackiec
40,Huge !,"Make sure you've got your walking shoes on this place is massive !!Set over 3 car parks , you may prefer to love you car rather than walk through depending on how much you buy .It wasn't busy at all when we went although some of the shops had no difference in price , other shops had huge discounts . Just need to be a bit savy .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldlittlefishie
50,"Great Outlets, Horrible Bus Shuttle Service","The outlets were great! Really good bargains. However, took the bus shuttle service from Anaheim to Citadel Outlets, the driver was late to pick us up, tried to talk us out of going even though we had already paid for the shuttle. Told us we weren't going to have time to shop. We were the last shuttle of the day. The brochure advertised we would arrive by 5:30 didn't arrive until 6. The bus was scheduled to leave at 8 and she wouldn't give us the extra 30 minutes even though the shops didn't close until 9. We got back on the bus at exactly 8:02 and she said she was about to leave us. She never announced before we got off the bus what time we were leaving or even how to get into the outlets(it has a fence around it) just dropped us off. Great outlets, don't take the bus shuttle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkmaryp
40,Great discounts !,"If your looking for great discounts on clothes, shoes is a place to go.Brands like nike, gap, adidas, converse, under armor, victoria secret, etc...On weekday is not so crowdy, you can take your time to walk and eat something, food have fare prices, not all restaurants are open but you can eat some subway lunch an thats it, set and continue your shopping time.Its just and hour away from los angeles downtown so take you time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GDSC
50,Best place to shop at reasonable price,"I've been to several shopping outlets but this is one of the best and biggest shopping outlet in the US. It was easy to find although we had along way from West Hollywood area by public transportation. Just buy a one-day Metro pass that cost 7 USD from the Hollywood Highland metro station and stop at Pershing square and walk 500 mtr to a bus stop and get into metro bus 62 for about 30 min bus ride and there we arrive...Many of my fav outlets are available, like Tumi, Coach, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Converse.....wow!And you're tired and hungry we can stop a while at foodcourt with many delicious choices.... Such a perfect place to shop and empty your pocket.....haha",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertNoers
50,the citadel is the highest,We have been to the Citadel outlets several times. Staffing all stores and the grounds staff are very helpful. Plenty of close in handicap parking. Definitely parknin the structure...shade and easy access and even easier to find where you parked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mondoleo
50,Perfect Shopping stop,My daughter at 9 isn't always keen to shop when the other option is Disneyland (funny that..) but I find I'm able to get round to all the shops I need while on holiday without fuss. We took the Citadel bus which was great with free wifi - everything I need is there including a yummy lunch. Hands down Citadel is where we will continue to stop each time we are in LA. Total one stop shopping Centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PalmTreeKelly
50,Enough time to shop,"Well I got up early, booked my Flyaway Coach return tickets ($18) from lax Airport to Union Station which took me just under an hour. I arrived at union station at around 9.15am and waited for the free Citadel Bus (which does not always run to schedule !!)I arrived at Citadel Outlet at 9.45am and I know all the stores open at 10.00am, my aim was to avoid the crowds though it was a Monday.It was so comfortable for me to shop in each store without any crowds. I did fine a few bargains, especially the Nike Store.You could find yourself going in circles !!! a lot of walking involved, but you hardly notice til you stop. There are food courts, but I just opted for panda express.All in all I had a good and long day , did not leave til 4.30pm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zouklas
30,A large but still basic outlet mall.,"There are a lot of shops to spend lots of money in, or just window shop. Very crowded around the holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PA_Larry_Z
30,Hope you like to walk,"If you are from out of town, this place has just about everything you are looking for in an outlet center. It has a lot of different brands at affordable prices. I hope you like to walk because the parking lot is a MAD HOUSE. It might be easier to find parking at Disneyland than here. There is a Valet service during certain times if you like that, but it gets so busy that finding parking is usually quite and adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wazcrakinps
50,Now thats great Value,"Ok. Citadel is really close to LA. I got there by train to Union station, then a free bus. It is quicker to take a taxi or its an easy drive. I picked up a discount card from my hotel and that gets you 20% off the already cheap prices from most of the participating outlet stores. The polo store was awsome. I bought 4 polo tops, 3 tee shirts, a jacket and a pair of shorts for $148.00us. Now make sure you realise that the prices in USA are in US dollars and right now, the rate is 70 cents so to find out what the AU $ is you simply divide the price by the rate and in this case it's $148 divided by $0.70 which is $211.42.Another thing to look out for is the tax. In USA, they do not have to include tax in their displayed prices, so depending which county you are in, that will determine the tax you pay at register. In LA it varies between 11 and 14% depending on your purchase.So, find out the rate before you buy, add that to the price then divide by the exchange rate. Many items seem cheaper, but by the time you do the calculation you find its not the case. One example are Rayban sunnies, I actuaĺly paid less i Australia for the latest ones.Have fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankrI7580MS
50,Convenient location and fun shopping,"If you are in LA area, this is a good outlet mall. Definitely fun shopping. Parking could be difficult. I think they have free shuttles.There's a food court, coffee shops, a lot of popular American fashion brands, luggage shops, house and kitchen wares.Some people buy luggages/big bags first, then they start they start shopping.It's very touristy and crowded. Short queues outside popular shops.Some brands (mostly bags) have special products for outlet malls. These bags are not from last season or factory rejects, these are just exclusive outlet mall products. Price tags are as high but it's permanently on sale 50%-80% off, makes you feel like it's a good bargain.Personally this is my favorite outlet mall, not too big, not too far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilutravel
30,Close to DTLA,"went there with fr after christmas, price are ok, most of the toys already out of stock. not much high end brand names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adikusumo

40,Only outlet shopping option in LA,"The mall is conveniently located in LA, so if this is where you are staying and want to go outlet shopping, then the Citadel is really your only option. There's plenty of parking and we did notice a lot of shuttle vans dropping off people at the entrance.It's certainly not the best Premium Outlets mall there is, in terms of variety and stock, and the stores didn't seem to offer the same sale prices that we had seen at another Premium Outlet mall in Orlando only a few days before our visit. But, most of the main outlet mall brands are there and I think it would be very difficult to walk away from here without finding something to purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleT101
40,Busy center,"They have improved the parking, by having off site and shuttles, but this center is so busy and parking normally a problem. I drove around the last time for 15-20 minutes and left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mom4tim
40,Very nice mall,"I really enjoyed this mall. It is large, clean and the bargains were plentiful! Food court was really nice, I enjoyed the Mexican food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X7755XJjennac
40,Convenient but Crowded,"Love the location near the freeway, but it seems like it's always super crowded. Years ago parking wasn't so difficult. We now always valet. The $5 plus tip is so worth it. The Le Crueset store is our favorite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/essence1974
30,"Convenient location, few choices","Being the only outlet mall located within Los Angeles city limits (As far as I know), the location is pretty convenient for those who are on limited time to shop or do not want to do the long drive to the Premium Outlets in Camarillo or Cabazon. Parking is plentiful, lots of Chinese shoppers as well. Stores were the usual outlet fare, except the products were a little limited compared to Premium Outlets. Given this, it only took me a few hours to go through the entire mall and buy the stuff I needed. There were some empty shops which made it feel more empty than normal. If the shops can improve on their selections and product variety, then this would be a worthy contender. As it lies, if you have time to head out to the Premium Outlets, it may be a better choice for hard core outlet shoppers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReynoldGan
50,Shopping paradise,Enjoyed shopping their clearance items. Must spend the whole day at this place if you want to shop and catch good deals. Variety of outlet stores are inside. They also had restaurants where you can eat at after a long day of shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishsdg
40,Nice shoppig experience...,"Who would not love outlets. With all the bargains and value for your money, this kind of place is a shopping haven.

50,Great place for shopping,Very large open space outlet. Lots and lots of stores. We stayed near at dobletree hotel and needed 2 days to check what most of the stores has to offer. Eventually found some great bargains.Highly recommended for shopping lovers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13AviS
40,Nice improvements,Had been a long time since our last visit. Must say they did a great job revitalizing this place. Plenty of shopping and parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RENLAUBRI
30,This Again,"Pretty hum drum I am thinking. I do shop at Morongo, and also in Barstow on my way to Las Vegas. I am thinking most of the merchandise at these outlets, with a few exceptions, really manufacture this stuff FOR the outlets. Style, quality, and price can be beat all day long with a little more effort. Convenient ? Yes? Good Value ? You have to really know price points and quality to get that very occasional deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlinash3
40,Shop til you drop,"Great mix of higher end and budget shopping outlets.Loved the outdoor vibe!Myself and my two teenage sons enjoyed here. My youngest loved the Nike outlet - bought a couple of pairs of cheap shoes. My eldest got some great business shirts.I bought my ""special"" US trip souvenier - A Calvin Klein bag for a ridiculously great price.Free Shuttle buses available from Union Station and other places - although the signage is bad near LA LIVE and we waited on the wrong corner and missed the bus :( even after asking at the local hotels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmyw0rld
50,Best outlet in LA,We visited at Christmas and it was busy but was still great. Lots of shops to choose from lots of eating places and the worlds largest Christmas tree and decorations made you feel like you where somewhere else. Fantastic discounts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkey2009Cheshire
30,Ok,"Appears to be big with lots of shops but once doing the rounds, we didn't find the shops/offers/range as great as what was offered in Orlando. For example, no Victorias Secret, the range in the sports stores wasn't as great. Probably the best deal was food-wise and it was from the place in the foodcourt which offered 2 x really big pizzas for $22USD. This is cheap by tourist standards and fed the family at a reasonable cost. They also offer free soda refills - you simply have to bring your empty cup back in store and they'll refill it for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rakimia
50,Great shopping,"This is a great outlet to go to , so many shops to choose from . Converse my favourite , H&M , Disney store & American eagle . Heaps of food choices also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJDW2011
40,Good place to visit,"I had been to this outlet mall 10 years ago and it has grown much bigger now with nicer stores. I visited Michael Kors, Coach, Ugg and bought a bag at Kate Spade. Only 30 minutes with no traffic and worth the drive. I was there with New Years sales so not sure what prices are during normal times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalifSue
40,Shopping trip,"Have always been to Premium Outlets but first time to Citadel. Must say was pretty impressed by the number of branded and mid-range shops. Easy multi-storey garages or you can find parking lots just outside the shops - anyways parking was really convenient. Remember where you are parked though as there are 2 different garages at each end. If you are a shopper, not too bad to visit this place as compared to Camarillo. Everything is under the same roof while Camarillo's shops are more spread out and you will need to drive between the 3 key shop clusters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyny_tt
30,"We have exactly, I repeat, exactly the same outlet in Europe. No need to go there. It's not even cheaper","Nothing specific to LA or US there, Same brands, same layout, same crowd, same everything as in Europe, and prices are not cheap...Go if you like that kind of places...but only in that case",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLLD25
30,Some Bargains To Be Found,"Visited Citadel just after the Thanksgiving Black Friday sales. Came for a look, left with several bags of shopping. Loads of nice stores and a good way to spend a morning or afternoon. All in all, it's just a regular outlet shopping mall, you'll find the same in most cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firey3
30,A Busy Outlet,"Good sales can usually be found at the Citadel, but you have to shop around. Easy to find, right off the 5 freeway. A very popular outlet with both tourists and locals. Parking can be an issue, especially during holidays, so best to shop earlier in the day. The food court offers your typical fast food, with an ample seating area in a outdoor, covered area. Overall, Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvillag
30,Messy,Items are pile everywhere including on the floor. Very crowded and messy. Prefer the premium outlets which things are neat and easier to search for stuff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahchengmok

40,Great outlet,"Great outlet with most of the biggest brands and a fine food-court. I missed a Polo Ralph Lauren store, as this is what europeans as me want the most..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884anders_
40,Absolutely jam packed but great,"Went there the last Sunday before xmas. Not sure if we were brave or stupid! Putting aside the long qeues to get into some stores, buy lunch and go to the toilet (all to be expected to be fair), it was definitely worth it. None of us are bug shoppers but there were some brilliant bargains. Most of what we bought was discounted by 40 - 50%.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gavinh799
30,Good place for shoppoholics....,Very open place with around 500 outlets open.....Can shop all brands for anything....Did not see any electronic store...all in all is good place to shop....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939akibs
40,Good Shopping,"I usually come to the outlets to go to Van Heusen or Tommy Hilfiger store. If you come mid week, you dont deal with a huge crowd and there is adequate parking. You can shop and spend less time than you would at the mall. Weekends are slightly more crowded so you have to deal with parking. During black Friday, this place is an absolute zoo. Made the mistake of coming here on the Saturday after thanksgiving.Parking was a mess so I ponied up the $5 for valet parking. The lines outside some stores were at least a 30 minute wait and the lines at the register were another 10-15 minute wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafeek626
40,Shopping !!!,The outlet mall in Los Angeles that we went. Buy till we loaded our vehicle full of shopping. Some are really good buys for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelo4
30,I wouldn't go back,The outlets are okay but not no way near as good as others in and around LA. I wouldn't say don't go but as each of us are different but it just didn't meet my needs and there wasn't the same choice - I would recommend Camarillo outlets which are the best I have been to - last year I spent 9 hours there and still didn't go in all the stores. At the Citadel Outlets I was in and out in 3 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courts48
40,Checks Off All the Boxes,"The Citadel is everything you want and expect from an outlet mall. Parking is tough on the weekends. We went late afternoon which meant that if we staked out a lane, we could pounce on people leaving. Outlet malls are hit and miss. There are at least one shop we find things we love, and the next time, there is nothing. We got shoes and hoodies we came for. We bought some great tops at a bargain though if we had more energy, we could have found more deals. The line for the Uggs shop was ridiculously long. Okay, so was Starbucks but we beared through that. I couldn't wait again for my Hot Dog on a Stick so we left. Outlet shopping is not for the faint hearted. Charge in with a game plan.ps. They are building a parkade which wasn't open yet but while parking will be easier, the lines for the shops will be ridiculous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chakimama
40,"Shop, shop, shop","If you're looking for an outlet to shop at, look no further. Citadel has all the shops one could look for. This is not for a 1 item shop destination. If you come to Citadel, come with at least 3 hours to spare. You can easily spend the whole day shopping here. During my last visit in California, I went to two other outlet malls and neither were as good as this one. Just be careful when you use your credit/bank cards. My brother had his card info skimmed while shopping there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0ves2Trave1
40,Shop 'til you Drop ...,"The Citadel is a shopping megastore conglomeration of name brands which have factory outlets. Loads of parking, but it does fill up before noon, so go early. Lots of eateries and restaurants, so you won't go hungry. Probably the best outlet in LA, but if time isn't a concern, then the Camarillo or Cabazon outlets are easier & better, IMO. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Good bargains depending on the exchange rate,This is a large out of town discount shopping venue. As visitors from the UK there were a good number of bargains to be found especially with a reasonably favourable exchange rate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davetheaddick
50,All Day Shopping,"So many stores! Better come with comfortable shoes on. We arrived 30 minutes after they opened at 10:30 AM on a Sunday and parking was difficult to find. After that, my wife and I had a fun time shopping and I knocked out most of my Christmas shopping in a day. We spent 5 1/2 hours here and would have stayed longer if we weren't tired. Prices are what you would expect from any outlet mall. Great atmosphere and enjoyed seeing the tallest real Christmas Tree in the world!Tip: Park in the back by the Disney outlet. There is an exit out onto Smithway St that not a lot of cars were using. It seemed everyone was trying to go in and out of the main entrance on Citadel Dr and cars were backed up all the way through the parking lot. Parking fills up fast and gets worse as the day goes on. Probably takes 20+ minutes to exit unless you use this exit. Also, if you cannot find parking in the mall, we saw a lot of cars parked along Smithway St when we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffmX7811OR
20,Not Worth It - Just a bad shopping Centre,Offers no more value than any other shopping centre. Found it hard to find any Factory type pricing...not worth the trip...head to Third Street Promanade if you're time poor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deansmallman911
50,great deals found here!,"Gutted we came across these outlets towards the end of our two week road trip.We started off in vegas and spent most of our money there and found these outlets WAY better and cheaper than there.Loads of stores and great deals. Wish we found them earlier and had more money left to spend, could have spent all day here! Maybe even two!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EROSE89
40,The bargains probably depend on where you are from....,"But given I am from New Zealand there were definitely bargains to be had as many brand clothing and shoes in NZ are considerably more expensive - we bought shoes and jeans- there was a special on so it was buy one pair then the second is half price- those really makes things a bargain. There were loads of shop options: adidas, Nike, Levi, converse, under armour, Ecco, rock port and many more. There are takeaways to buy food but I recommend bringing. A bottle of water with you A it's hot and there smaller bottles you can buy there are expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jandalz3
40,Broad choice,"Many shops but some brands missing so check the shop-list. All in all these kinds of outlets have sometimes a price difference with a ""normal"" mall but not Always. Stay sharp on this",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715PaulK715
30,Not as cheap as you would think,The citadel has a pretty big range of shops around the one area but it's really not all that cheap. compared to other stores around LA you really hardly saving any money getting to citadel. there is the convenience of having many stores around the one area. that's about it. If your not American be aware that the tax isn't included in the price so pretty much whatever your looking at at on 15%,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6413NGjackb
50,Shopping Heaven,There is outdoor parking and garage parking. The outlet is laid out nicely. Everything you could possibly want is here. The Disney Outlet was great. A gal named Rose helped me complete my Christmas list. There is a Kate Spade store which was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/handelsredondo

I've never counted the stores, but I'm sure there is over 50 (Under armor, Nike, Adidas, Michael Korr, etc) it is wheelchair accessible, plenty of parking, family friendly. Shops with many different prices for all different budgets. Lots of food to select from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHernandez

30,"Growing, but still a little short.","It's nice, it's close for L.A. folks, but still not enough variety yet. It did expand a few years ago, but still could use some higher end brands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686robertn
40,Good mix of outlet shops,Pretty good location in Los Angeles area and easy to find. Lots of free parking. Outdoor. Low end to mid tier name brands. Good selection. Not too big or too small. Can find something you like. Mostly American brands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVictorT
50,BIG Variety of Shops,"My friend has been bugging me to come here. I was used to when it first began...Only a few here and there. She kept telling me over and over to go. I finally did. OMG! The parking lot was SO crowded. I couldn't believe the variety of shops. I think I spent every red cent I had? H & M, Calvin Klein, Levy's...to name a few. The only thing I hated were the crowds...and maybe the parking. But I will go again to do Christmas Shopping I'm sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomjonesCalifornia
30,Typical outlet mall,Off season and mid week but still very busy. Not a lot of bargains that we saw. Good variety of shops so best to check online before you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Tig
50,SO many shops so little time!,I come here at least every couple of months when I need new shoes cause they have so many options. Then because I got new shoes I have to have a new shirt from like H&M or some where. But wait if I have a new shirt then I think I am going to have to have some new sun glasses. By the time I'm finished it's time for lunch at Rubi's Diner. Always find great stuff here. Beware at Christmas!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringWonderland
50,Brilliant outlet shopping,"We had a rental car so it was easy to get there and park for free. This outlet shopping mall is outdoor but in hot weather it's easy to keep cool by all the shops and their air conditioning. There is a huge selection of shops and they are all cheaper than the usual shops elsewhere. I've been twice and each time have bagged some real bargains. There's plenty of coffee places and a small outdoor (shaded) area with food like Panda Express. It's all on the flat and there are toilets and plenty of benches if you prefer to wait outside. I loved it. Clothes, homewear, perfume, make up, handbags and more. It's heaven!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasagnew
40,Great place for all-day shoppers,"If you enjoy spending hours shopping for clothing, then this is the ideal place. There are numerous stores, from the cheaper options such as Levi's and Columbia, to more expensive ones like Coach. The deals are good for the luxury stores, but I didn't notice any great deals for the ""middle-class"" stores. The downsides for me are (1) the stores are outside with few areas of shade, and (2) poor selection of food and drink options. The restaraunts, for the most part, are low quality. There is a Ruby's Diner, which serves decent burgers and alcohol (the only place here that does). Overall, if you have the time and patience, then this is a good place for shoppers. However, for an unfashionable male such as myself, I'll just buy some cheap t-shirts online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregoryu874
50,other than the heat the outlets were fantastic,"okay so i went on a day that was about 100 degrees Celsius and yes it is an outdoor strip mall so granted i was going to be hot. The outlets are great, lots of great stores and the food places were basically in the shade so it was perfect. There are shuttles that you can take to get here (which I did) and well worth it. Got some great pieces at good prices and if you get the coupon book you have a number of stores with additional discounts offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573suzel
50,need a whole day,"visited end on September twice during the week days, could have gone again, some great deal if you have the time to look, and even with our week Aus dollar, still got so excellent deals, and valet parking on $5, a no brainer , drive in park in a few minutes prime localtion easy . you can get they by shuttle or public transport, but would take a while, and if you really shop how do you get the stuff back to your hotel?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StratosMoutafis

GAP store is good too. There is a restaurant plaza and parking is free, except by the valet parking service (not much expensive)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexinSUV
30,A long trip from Anaheim,We visited this shopping outlet by bus from Anaheim. It is a long way to travel and we found travelling by bus very tiring. The bus did not return to our hotel at Anaheim until 5.00pm. A hire car may have been a better option. We found the shopping OK but bargins were certainly limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shez060
20,Old stuff,Many stores but old collections and. The prices arent even that low as you are expecting for an outlet. It was disapointing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iseldah
50,Bargains to be had,"First of many outlets visited in Southern California in Sept 2015. I found them all to be very similar. Most of them appear to be fairly new, I don't know if this is down to good maintenance but bravo to the owners. Bargains to be had in comparison with London, England with prices being as much as 70% less at lots of places. If your with your other half be prepared for a long day (if they are anything like mine). Food places available on site. Good place to visit if you are looking for bargains on clothing, footwear, fashion jewellery etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610georged
40,"Worth a visit, but don't expect too much!","I was thinking twice whether or not it was worth my time to go because I had heard such mixed reviews about this place. I am happy to say that it was worth it - because the variety of brands available there is pretty impressive.That being said, I don't think it's a cheap as many may imagine it to be seeing as that it's an outlet mall. Yes, there were several great deals around at brands like Micheal Kors, Kate Spade, Sketchers, etc - but you would see many things just as expensive as buying them full retail too.In any case, it's definitely worth while spending a few hours there looking around because you definitely do catch some really great deals and end up shopping quite a bit.In case you're worried about food/lunch time etc - they do have a food court with several different cuisines around so there's nothing to worry about if you're going to spend the day there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiniTharani
40,shop till you drop,"this was my second trip to this outlet. a large variety of shops. Much larger than any outlet in Australia. Although the Australian Dollar was not very favourable I still managed to get most of my shopping done there and still came out in front. Need a full day to cover the shops. On a lighter note, I was astounded by the quality of their rest rooms. at par with any nice hotels",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478arpitad

50,Great Shopping,"A must visit for designer labels much cheaper than you can back in the UK. Took us about 25 minutes from our hotel, the outlet complex is east of LA just off Interstate 5 and has literally every designer label available at really good prices. It was clean, new with 5 star restrooms even, well certainly the nicest public toilets I have used in a long while. Food wise there is plenty to choose from with ample on site parking, a good way to lose a few hours and dollars..... Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445tonyw

50,VIP experience,"What to do on that dreaded last day, where you have a whole day to fill before the late night flight. Lucky for me our travel agent suggested the Citadel Outlet Mall. We did the VIP package. This included pick up with luggage from our hotel, and a pass to a private lounge where we could come and go at leisure. The lounge was first class, free nibbles, and drinks. TV, wifi, books magazines, and storage for our suitcases. Staff were amazing, made us coffee and helped with any inquiry we had. The shops themselves were varied, and the savings huge. Even comparing the USA exchange rate we were on a winner. It was very hot when we were there so was lovely to come and go from the Lounge as often as we wanted. At the end of the day we were then collected and taken to the airport. Would do it again, but have a bigger suitcase for shopping 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534linda
40,Variety on a multitude of levels...,"There are so many stores available, some with amazing discounts, just be sure to get in early as it took me over half an hr to find a park and it was a Monday morning at 1130. I did notice that they are building (near completion) a new multilevel parking garage so that will help ease the parking dramas. You could easily spend an entire day walking the outdoor mall trying to find the best bargain, just make sure you stay hydrated... there isn't much shade and it is hot in the sun. The parking is free which is a blessing and there is a plethora of food choices available also, which will help sustain ones energy should you be on a mission for the best bargins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPK89

Sometimes they have further 20% off the sales price.Also, if you go inside the shop a bit further to the back, they have clearance area which is really cheap!I took a whole day shopping here, hand bags, make up... you can buy cheap make up here as well I bought Naked2 and Naked3 pallet from here and they give you heaps of free stuff when you spend certain amount.Don't buy from normal shops or Duty free, outlets so much cheaper!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712jennys
40,Just for shopoholics,"Great place, very good deals, many stores but too many people. Avoid weekends so you don´t have to be on line forever before you pay. My suggestion is that you get a map beforehand and write your check list to have a clear idea of where do you plan to go and how long or you could easily spend 3 hours in just one store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viajeraenfamilia

30,Plenty of shopping but somehow feels under stocked.,"Went here looking for a cute pair of shoes. Didn't find anything to ""wow"" me. They have a lot of shops but going through all the shops I only found one maybe 2 things that interested me. You can't really call this place an outlet since prices are comparable to what you'd find at any mall when things go on sale. Where's the difference? The food court is fairly sparse also. Slim pickings for food.The real bummer is that of the things that I did find, they didn't have my size. It's the closest outlet to DTLA, eh it's okay. I will give them credit for having nice clean restrooms and concierge areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoloBird98

So we waited outside the mall for the shuttle. The ride was more like a tour with the driver Robert providing valuable sightseeing information as well as telling us where it was not safe to go. This is a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pajeh
50,Excellent,"This was a brief visit to the citadel outlets enroute to the airport. I hope we had planned to have some extrea time down there. Among all the recent outlet malls visited in California, probably i would put it at the best. it was a good collection of stores and with nice bargains. Only drawback was the food court, which was overcrowded and had long queues (probably more than the queues inside the shop!!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drplk
40,"Buy expensive brands, cheap!","This was the second time I've visited Citadel Outlets and I have only been to the states twice. You figure it out. If you are not planning to visit Woodburys outside New York (or even if your are), this is the place to do your shopping. All the famous (and some local) brands, in an easily accessible setting. The parking might be a bit of a hassle but still worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p0lyvi0sk
30,Been to better outlets in LA,"We are from the UK and we firstly went to Orange outlets near Disney. We found them relaxing, better service, better prices and choices. Good food options and more of a family atmosphere. The citadel outlets have limited parking options u less you go straights to the top level in the enclosed parking lot, more crowded eating places, smaller shops, but more choice in outlets, found it more expensive with not as much better offers. This is probably because of the fact that it attracts more people, hence the higher prices. It's worth a trip if your in the area, but not if you want to tackle the Trafic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdipzp
30,Decent Shopping Experience,"The Citadel Outlets are a decent shopping experience, and particularly enjoyable for anyone who likes a good bargain. This definitely wasn't the best outlet mall I have been to, however it wasn't the worst either. There are enough stores to keep you occupied. Be sure to get there early to snag a free parking spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodie788
50,Get there early,"There's a vast array of brands at this outlet and we had a very successful visit at the beginning of our vacation. Head to customer services for a VIP discount card (you'll need photo ID) and then hit the stores that you know you want to buy from as the place gets pretty busy very quick!We went to a premium outlet in Vegas last year and I'm convinced that the discounts/savings there were much better but that being said, I picked up three pairs of jeans for less than the price of one back in the UK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spaniel253
40,Shop Till You Drop,LA's only outlet shopping - so amazing.Plenty of shops & food outlets.Definitely worth the visit.Certain stores had amazing sales with discounts of 70% whereas other places were more by one and second 50 % off.I would recommend starting early because parking is very tight or valet for $8 all day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieyngu
50,BARGINS!,Great shopping and loads of specials on clothes etc..Wish we had something like this in NZ. Takes a bit of time to go around but worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiS233

50,BEST RESTROOMS EVER!!,"I know this should be more about the shops, but I HAVE to mention the restrooms here!! OMG! I wish all women's restrooms were like this! They are totally sealed floored to ceiling, as are the doors ( total silence and privacy). There is a large rack for your purse and bags, so you don't have to put anything on the floor.As you leave, there are little wipes by the door, so you don't have to touch it with bare clean hands!!Why can't all restrooms be this way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180cyndyg
40,A lot of shops,We enjoyed walking is in this huge mall. A well known brands are there. A nice foodcourt so you can spend some hours and dollars here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BPostema
40,Know your prices,"I got the free shuttle bus from Union Station Patsaouras Transit Plaza, its where the suburban buses and Flyaway bus leaves from http://www.citadeloutlets.com/info/transportationIt takes about 40 minutes to get to the outlets but only 8 minutes for the return journey.Go to the customer service counter near the entrance when you arrive and get a VIP discount book. Show them your overseas drivers licence and they will then give you the brochure and discount cardThere are some good prices here but I found some brand name jeans cheaper at Marshalls near the Beverly Centre in LA.Its worth a visit and I bought a suitcase here to transport all my purchasesTake an umbrella with you as the mall is an open one and not an enclosed one",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/528956John_C
40,"Acres of shops, get there early","A trully frightening place for the wage earner of the family. Acres of shops with great prices. The plce opens 10 am, and the parking lot is full by about 10:30 am. I sat in a coffee shop while the famly shopped. We had to buy two new suitcases to take it all home. I managed to get $100 off two suitcases marked down from $600 to $350, which seemed a good deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiBobCambodia

50,Great Outlet,Very good place to shop :) We loved itIts not far from the city center and they have a lot of shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieB1986
40,Very crowded but easy to get around.,The sales were great in majority of the stores. All the workers in each store had pleasant attitudes especially in the Nike store. The outlet even offers $5 valet so you don't have to park far off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fefe019
50,Bargain Shopping on a Theme Park Free Day,It was a really convenient short drive from Anaheim. We all enjoyed a lovely Japanese lunch and I found some great bargains !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250kyliet
20,Gives shopping a bad name,"Talk about overcrowded...lines of people had to stand outside some stores and slowly let inside, food court had long lines, and women's restroom had a line with 30 ladies waiting, and parking, even with valet parking available, was miserable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichinStockton
40,Shopping!!!!,"An outdoors mall. Heaps of shops. Lots of kids shops too. Great sales!!! Easy and free parking. Great choices in the food court. Free wifi in the food court. Most of the sales assistants were helpful. If you have to choose between here and the Vegas outlet, go here. Vegas is outdoors and it's crazy hot, also LA has more shops and better sales!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessagO4472TF
40,"Have transport, make this a visit.","100 quality outlets, some better than others. Lots of brand names. Definitely worth the visit. You will need your own transport but if you don't, take a look at the LA Outlet shuttle bus site for other options. Typical food outlet but for a great fresh healthy choice eat at La Majoon, in with all the other typical burger, hot dog, taco food places.It is not crowded, parking is free and clothing choices are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marmite62
40,A nice outlet mall.,"Very gooddeals everywhere.For all kind of people.Maybe a small parking area.Well located. It's an outdoors mall, completely international visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingaga
30,A whole lot of the same,"Citadel Outlets is a nicely planned and refurbished historical building with easy freeway access. The layout is great and there are lots of stores. Always very crowded. Nothing unique from any other outlet mall. Same outlet specific merchandise over that you will see at most outlet malls. Better and quality merchandise and bargains are to be found at retail malls such as Glendale Galleria or South Coast Plaza.Parking: HORRIBLE. Especially on a weekend or during the summer. There is no quick stopping here. If you want to park in the lot, plan on at least 30 to 45 min to find a spot.There a 50's themed restaurant (Ruby's) with a dedicated lot for restaurant customers. Unfortunately, parking is not reinforced. So, if your goal is to have a quick lunch, its better to find somewhere else to stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveling_gal801
50,This place is great because it is right off the freeway,"All the stores that you see at the local mall are here, except for less. Shop, eat, and relax in the nice resting areas that are located within the outlets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPasillas82
30,Normal,This outlet is normal..went a bit later but still was alot of people arouns.. Still hadNormal sizes thats the positiv thing about it.. Wouldnt go here on the weekends..gap had lots of cheap things.Missing more food choices,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmC1628KI
40,Outlet mall in the city,"This mall is outdoors which always makes it a nice little shopping experience, versus being indoor. The weather here in southern California is generally nice.A lot of outlets I've been to, only have high end stores, this place has more mid range priced stores in the mix, so everyone can enjoy shopping.Not everything is a super deal, but if you have somewhat of an idea of what you're looking for and can price compare then you will certainly find a great sale.For example, I was able to get 3 pairs of Crocs for 65 bucks. Normally I would have paid about $40 for one pair. Some stores have mailing lists, so pay attention and get on your favorite stores list and they will send you extra coupons and super sales dates.Parking..yes it's nothing nice. I just simply drive to the other end of the parking lot and park in the first spot I see available. Trying to get close parks you will waste time. This mall is always crowded. Even if you show up right when they open on a weekday.Restrooms are very clean and have places for your bags in the stalls.Christmas Holiday season is really nice here. They really go our of their way to dress it.The mall is always filled with a lot of international tourists. Normally that would not matter but at times the tourists are very pushy. I've been literally pushed out the way without anyone apologizing or saying excuse me. I understand they may not be able to communicate so I brush it off. It's not every time but it HAS happened more than once. Just bring your patience with you. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux
50,Great stores,Outlets were great and laid out nicely. Many stores to choose from! There were areas to sit and It was spread out nicely so as not to feel like you were constantly in groups of people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creinhardt
50,Everything you'd want.,"This outlet offers a wide range of shops. The prices are reasonable with some priced very cheaply.Some items however aren't cheap, just cheaper, you'd have to gauge this yourself. Those coming from the UK WILL see the cheaper prices, as the UK generally likes to rip you off. I'd recommend you allow at least half a day, maybe a full day for your visit and allow space in your luggage ! Extra offers are available on National Holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nodnoltravel
40,How heavy the discounts can vary,"I've been here 3 times, my most recent visit I was disappointed at how the sales or discounts weren't very generous. I chose very wisely and selectively and didn't buy much. It was better on previous trips 2-3 years ago. The shopping centre is huge and you could easily spend the whole day here. There is something for everyone. Kids, men's, women's, sports, luggage, accessories etc etc.It is the closest outlet shopping mall to LA.Will always return though when in LA in the hope of a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ambery836
40,Know your prices and you'll bag a bargain!,"It's easy to say that there are prices that are more than you'd expect to pay in these outlets. But what you have to look out for are the daily specials that come up in citadel.For instance I went to DKNY and there was an extra 10% off. In Kate Spade, the daily special was 50% off the marked price. Some shoe stores were offering buy one get one free or half price.It's these specials that make visiting worthwhile!!Handy hint, make sure you get here early, as there are coaches and coaches of visitors that will make the queues longer and snap up all the bargains! And the parking lot fills up quick.There's a store for everyone here, children's stores, jewellery, sports etc.Still a good place for outlet shopping, and worth a look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/309melindae
50,Great place to do your shopping,"I went there twice when during my one week stay in Los Angeles, i loved it. very good prices, i found all of my favourite stores. and they are planning to expand the perking area which is a bonus since it is hard to find a parking spot there.i will diffidently go there again the next time I'm in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46nermeena
40,Shop-a-holic's dream,"The outlets are located in in the suburb of Commerce, near LA city, these outlets have all the big Brand stores at discounted prices. Plenty of free parking is available to spend the whole day.As with all the outlets, some sizes may be hard to find, but a huge variety of merchandise is available.A small food court is on site with many delicious different types of cuisine to eat.Bring your Credit Cards, cash and bags on wheels as you can spend the day and shop until you drop....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilC2607
30,Citadel Shopping,"The outlet mall has expanded considerably in the past couple of years. A few awesome stores and a number of family-friendly places to visit. The place is considerably well attended on weekends. Some of the clothing deals are excellent. However, I often find item sizes mis-labeled at a number of stores, so try on everything: an large or extra large can actually be a ""smaller"" size. Easy mall to walk around and ample free parking is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acoach
50,Great Outlet Mall,"We visited the Citadel Outlets as a day trip from Anaheim. The drive from Anaheim was relatively painless and a straight shot all on I-5. The outlet mall had a lot to offer with all of the normal name brand shops in a large open air atmosphere. We visited such shops as Gap, H&M (make sure you visit the fitting room on the second floor if the ground floor has a long line, the nice attendant directed several of us ladies up there to the men's area when a group of teenage girls seemed to be parading around a fashion show and monopolizing the fitting room), Columbia (prices much higher than my local Columbia outlet in FL), Quicksilver (found great deals), Adidas (found great deals) and many more.We were very pleased to see the Disney Outlet. It was actually a Disney Store Outlet. We had read online before our vacation that there were no longer any Character Warehouse Outlets in the area which sold outlet theme park merchandise. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find this Disney Outlet to have 3 full racks (men, women, and children) and a small shelving section in the far right rear corner to have Disneyland theme park outlet merchandise. Also, remember that if you spend over $50 and use your Disney Visa you get a 10% discount at the outlet store as well.We had lunch at the outdoor food court at a place called Fresca's, which was very tasty and inexpensive Mexican. The food court had many alternate options from a hot dog on a stick joint to a Subway to a Sbarro and more. After lunch we grabbed some frozen yogurt from Tutti Frutti.The public restrooms were spacious and nicely decorated. I can only speak to the women's room, but there was a fun magenta decor theme and the anti-area looked like a small feminine den with decorative elements. The stalls had nice tile work and full length doors. There was also a shelf over the rear of the toilets so that you could place your bags without having to set them on the floor.Unfortunately, we didn't have too much time to spend shopping as we were on our way to Santa Monica, but I would highly recommend this outlet mall to even the most casual fan of shopping as they had store options for every style and budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FL_Sable
50,Great place to shop,Not big though but very great place to shopGood deals nice peopleSome places to eatMany benches to sit onI spent a whole day there :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kadia6
50,A must stop place to Shop,"We make a mandatory stop at citadel outlets on our annual USA Holidays. we enjoy the Quicksilver store the most as the specials are epic. we bought 23 t shirts this time because they were only $7USD (10 AUD) where back in Australia, the home of Quick Silver its $55USd (70AUD)come early in the day to find parking too!! the levis store is also pretty well priced",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaraleeandLiam
40,Closest to Los Angeles of all Outlet Stores,"Citadel outlets is not as big as outlets at Camarillo or Desert Hills in Cabazon, but it is only about 20 minutes drive from Los Angeles Airport, which makes it the closest of all outlet stores to downtown LA, abeit in a comparatively low-rent district. It claims over 130 name brand stores which would make it bigger than the Carlsbad Premium Outlets. It has improved greatly in the last 20 years with convenient benches in the mall area, a more esthetic walking environment, and plenty of billboards with maps of the shops at strategic crossroads. We arrived just before 10 am in mid-May when the shops open, and there was plenty of parking. But by 12 noon, there were lurkers waiting for leavers in the parking lot that we visited. It is difficult to compare prices between outlet stores unless you visit them all in the same season. For instance they seem to have special sales on Black Friday, after the Christmas holidays and some have Memorial Day and ad hoc sales. But we felt the prices in the shops at Citadel were competitive with the other outlets. There are a Hilton Doubletree Hotel in the outlets complex and a Crowne Plaza Hotel and Casino about a 10-15 minute walk away. The Crowne Plaza also runs a shuttle bus to the outlets.Citadel is easy to find on Highway 5, but the traffic going south from Citadel on US 5 is ghastly. The traffic congestion is worth it if you don't have time to take an extra 60-90 minutes to drive to the outlets at Camarillo or Cabazon. We felt shopping at Citdel was a very good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staidthere
40,Great shopping,"Although this place may not be as big as Camarillo premium outlets, it's still worth the trip. I still got good deals from here.There's a free shuttle bus to the outlet too. You may want to check the schedule & where it goes to. Pretty convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayjayyello
50,Fantastic day's shopping !!,"Wow - what a great place to shop. We'd been planning our US trip for a year, and had put the Citadel on our list as one of the first places to hit when we got to LA. Pack light, we told the girls (12 and 10) as we'll get stuff there. For months, we put off getting things (e.g. Skechers) in NZ as we'd shop at the Citadel. So, we made our way here on Day #3 in the US, and it was brilliant.First, if driving yourself, it's extremely easy to get to and from on the I-5 (we found our way back to our North Hollywood hotel without a map - devices having run out of battery, just by following our noses on the I-5) and there is plenty of parking.Secondly, it's an outdoor complex, with some walkways not offering shade, so remember sunblock/caps/water. And then you'll be set.We found the shopping to be absolutely what we'd hoped for - all the well-known brands, at great prices. Yes, sometimes the outlet stores don't stock their full range, but we didn't expect them too. The Skechers I'd seen in NZ for NZ$120 (USD88) were $54, and 50% of a second pair of any type. Girls and I got 6 different pairs between us. The same went for casual summer clothes - we were able to dress ourselves for our 5 week holiday at very reasonable prices, and at shops we don't have in NZ (like Banana Republic).Very, very happy shoppers - and the restroom facilities, when we needed them, were very clean and well maintained.Tips - download a map of the store layouts before you go, and bring it with you ! Actually, bring more than 1, if coming with more than 1 adult !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5769FFjuliec
50,The best in its area,It was my first time to be in outlets stores in my life. It was great and big. Alot of famous clothes stores you'll find in it. Really worth to go and have a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307ahmadt
40,Worth a visit,Spent several hours here with my 13yr old daughter and wife. This is a big place with a plethora of shopping opportunities. Spoilt for choices sums it up.Sizes were not an issue. They seemed to cater for every shape and size. Lots of sporting outlets like Nike and heaps of clothing opportunities.Eating was also not a problem with a central area with several choices including Mexican and Chinese.Allow 4-6 hours I think.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739careym

You can also drive to the nearby McDonald's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tot2Travel

50,Good stores and good deals,"First and most importantly-go to the customer service center before shopping and get the VIP coupon book. It will save you on every single purchase including food. This book saved me more than $100 and I didn't do a ton of shopping.Second-ask stores about their return policy before buying. Some are actual outlet stores and some are just regular stores. Some have return options and other don't. Ask first.Lots of food options-sit down at Rubies a food court with many international, fast food options, an aunt Annie's, a coffee shop/café and a candy store. Lots of available seating.Environment is nice and a good way to spend an evening. I am a woman travelling alone and felt very safe shopping here at night.I was pleasantly surprised at the nice outdoor shopping environment with super clean restrooms, good dining options and a good mix of stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/likethewind27

50,Free shuttle bus from Union Station,"There is a free shuttle bus from Union Station in downtown LA to the Citadel Outlets. Make sure you know the time, as the next bus could be in 90 minutes. At Union station, follow the signs to the bus plaza and wait at Bay #7, there is signage there that it is the correct place to wait for the Citadel Express. Getting there was really long, over an hour as it made lots of stops and detours. The return trip from Citadel to Union Station was about 15-20 minutes, as it was direct. The bus driver was super friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2014wtraveller

After a whole day I had three bags on each arm, not including my wife and kids, they had their own to carry. Very cheap designer label products, I'm sure there is something for everyone here.

40,Local resident and bargain shopper,"As a local resident and past employee, I have a good understanding of Citadel. Basically born and raised in my working life at Citadel heres a synopsis.For foreign customers: Prices are greatOut of state shoppers: Prices are goodBargain shoppers: Prices are no goodKeep in mind this is an outlet close to the heart of Los Angeles. To find another outlet close by you have to drive at least an hour minimum. So that is why it is a great location for any vacationers. There's not as many stores as other outlets (cmon now land is expensive in LA) but trust me its been a lot better than a couple years ago. Big brand names include Hugo Boss, Coach, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Under Armor, Kate Spade etc. check their website for listings. You can't beat its convinience of location but parking is complete hell if youre driving. Weekends you wont find parking in their parking lot from 12-3 you will have to park in the neighboring business parking lots. But I think all is fair considering there are local malls close by yet they are offering cheaper prices here at citadel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyle116
30,Have Daughter loves Outlets,"Been to several outlets over the years. Found this to been satisfactory but most of the goods I looked at were not far if at all from the retain price.

40,worth the travel down,We arrived in LA with only winter clothes so needed to shop. We researched the outlet and then used the subway train to Union station. The outlet runs a complimentary bus from union station and other locations in the city. It takes about an hour from union station due to stops but only about 20 minutes back to union station as it is the first stop back. Bus is clean and drivers excellent. The outlet has many many major outlets and prices appear to be very reasonable especially clothing when compared to what we may pay in Australia. It has a good food court that was surprisingly not over priced. One really surprising thing was the quality and cleanliness of the rest rooms. By far the best we have ever experienced at this type of venue.Overall worth the travel to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesr985
50,Bargains Galore,"Came to USA from Australia in Nov-Dec 2014 and ensured did research on shopping locations in each city. Went to the Citadel outlets a few times whilst in LA and got bargains each time. Only downside in a way was that we were there during the week of Black Friday Sales and oh my goodness was that an experience, yes was great for additional savings but made lineups crazy and we didn't really wait to go into too many places.We did return the following week but and I got some great things from Guess and Nike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28becd

We got a few bargains.Overall it's a great place as there are places to eat and drink too and bargains to be had,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckstrike13
40,Outlet deals,Large area with large shops and several variety of brands and goods..Good deals and large stores with large displayed stuffFashionSpent 4 hours and bought so many things,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720hassan
50,Need more time,"Been there in the morning with my friends. We came from SFO and we love to shopping there because the price more cheaper compare to Mall. Actually citadel really big block with a lot of kind stores and even tough we came early but we need more time for shopping. This place really had good stuff , they had Starbuck but always crowded and took long time for order , their toilet also always crowded but the good news is their toilet clean. So many thing we saw and so many thing we bought that we girl never enough for shopping and 1 day seem not enough for us to explore this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chidutbaby
10,Don't waste your time,"Waste of time, not many shops, took longer to driver there than to look around it. Very disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OZtraveller4102
30,"Average, price is not cheap","Levi's is expensive, coach men only has 20% discounts, while other outlets offer 40%.Adidas sneakers sizes are not complete. Tumi discount is small. I can hardly get anything but a Levi's hoodie priced $75 with tax.Food court has good selection but outside seating is cold in winter.Desert hill outlet has more choices and cheaper but that is too far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxlai_hk
30,Blah,"Looked cool from the outside, inside is just another outlet mall. Not a lot of sit-down dining options (1). Standard outlet mall stores, no real standout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesil41
30,Nice yet not outlet prices,We detoured because of traffic. We figured to might as we'll drop by since we always pass by.I was expecting really great deals since it was after Christmas. The prices were not quite outlet range compared to other outlets we have been. The place is very nice and chic.I must say I'll give it a 4 for Kate Spade who had additional 20% on top of the sale which made me score a great bargain OK a purse.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MharCA
50,Good shopping place,"Went here with a friend of mine and wow, we did a whole day of shopping! Most of the brands we wanted were here at bargain prices. You need to come early though as cue can be very long. We were not able to enter a few stores we wanted! But we were able to get good ones from MK, Coach, CK etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam24112013
40,"The missus found some bargains, I was disapointed.","We visited during the Christmas new year period, and it was busy. At first it was confusing working out where we were, but once we started shopping it was easier.Most of the shops were for women, and the prices- in my opinion weren't very sharp. For a clearance outlet there was quite a lot of mainstream stock.The queues for the womens toilets were 10 to 15 minutes long, and this only prolonged my misery.But my partner did declare she found some bargains- a woollen coat for $40 among them. Too bad it weighs 3 kilo and takes up half your suitcase!!Some more mainstream food would also be nice. We couldn't find anything close, and ended up getting directions to Carl jnrs up the road, around a corner and across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Epukeke
40,hotel pick up is fabulous,"You get a great discount card to use if you take the shuttle with great savings. It had all the shops we needed ... old navy, sketchers , levis - grabbed some good bargains had a nice lunch. Allow yourself at least 3 hours - we booked the 1330 bus back and changed it to the 1530 bus - and were ready to go around 1430 - but no bus - they need the in between bus going back.Had the most palatial toilets I have ever been in -",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussiechick3564
30,More of a shopping centre than a outlet,This is more of a shopping mall/ centre than an outlet. All the outlets that I have been to all have clearance and have like 50% 75% ect off the ticket price.Not this one most of the stuff is normal prices or there was a lot with buy 1 get 50% off the second. Very disappointed in it. Got a taxi from Hollywood which cost $50 then got a taxi to the airport $70 and still have a half empty suite case. Our taxi drive told us that there is one in Plam Springs which is a lot better.Just adding to this there will look after your suite cases for the day.Plus the restroom where the best I have every seen in a shopping centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323
30,Reasonable bargains disgraceful transport,"We spent the best part of the day here and purchased about $1500 worth of products at the Center. We booked the Shuttle service Lux Bus (which you pay for) and were on the 1st bus in the morning from Anaheim, with a confirmed return at 3.30pm.The 3.30pm service did not arrive and we were initially told that we and another couple would have to wait over 2 hours for the next bus at 5.40pm.We expressed our dissatisfaction with this arrangement with 2 of the Centre staff who advised as the bus was privately owned there was nothing they could/would do for the 4 of us. We reminded them that the bus has Citadel advertising all over it and it was promoted on their website. After approx an hour of this we were escorted to the VIP room and then told that they have a van that would return the 4 of us to Anaheim. If this had been offered in the 1st place our day would certainly have been remembered more fondly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregF557
10,Have these other reviews have been written by 'Citadelians'?,"I was very very disappointing by what was to be found at the Citadel outlets. Having heard that it was a location worth visiting, I was dead keen to pay for a tour bus to take myself and the 3 people who I'd sold the idea to, along with me for a day of shopping, eating and mot of all....BARGAINS!But can someone tell me exactly where the bargains here lay? They are certainly not all situated here under 'one roof'. More often than not, the prices that I found on goods were the same or more expensive than shops outside of the Citadel. I managed to find a couple of pieces in H&M which were full price but nice so i bought them anyway. Michael Kors, what a joke...the store was heaving, but I managed to find the exact same watch that I nearly bought at the Citadel, in a store along Hollywood Boulevard at almost half the price.The complex is oddly laid out with alike stores not clustered together. Nay, they are in fact spaced right apart. The restrooms are tidy and easy to find. The location of the Citadel is also a bit awkward and for tourists, good luck with fighting the LA traffic that congregates round there after a day of being on your feet.MY ADVICE? Go to the Orange County Outlets - they are cheaper, smaller, better laid out and there is plenty of parking and you can get round it in half the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stickywu
40,Good place to shop,"Got here by car (a friend's relative drove us) and I found this place to be relatively easy to shop for items. There are many directory boards, the brands signatures are clear. We arrive about 6pm on Sunday and there is no much crowd, weather is good (this is important as there is no shelter from store to store sometimes). Discounts range from 20% to 70%. Nike and Adidas are on the 20s range, while Kate Spade, CK, Coach are about 40% off.Toilets are large and clean. Big signatures to direct you to them. There are some places to eat like Ruby's and other cafe stores.Check out if the brands you are looking for are located here. If so, not a bad place to shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceSin
50,Amazing bargins,"My husband and i were amazed at this place, the toilets looked like a palace! The shops also offer a range to suit everybody! My husband and i both spent about $1000 each but managed to fill our suitcases to the point we had to post stuff home!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeno511
50,"Many stores, easy on and off freeway","Stopped here on a road trip to Orange County. It's right off the 5 freeway. There is a lot of free parking and also valet parking for $5. We went there during the day on a Tuesday, so we found parking pretty easily. They have many stores including one of the few Ugg Australia outlets in CA (or US for that matter), where you can buy regular priced items as well as sale items. I got a pair of boots for 100 bucks and felt that was a good deal. Kate Spade had a sale of 40-50% off. I bought a tote bag for $90 which I thought was pretty good. There was an area to line up outside the store if it got too crowded, but that wasn't the case on the day we went. My husband found good deals at Under Armour, and they had good deals at Aeropostale, but the lines to check out were pretty long there. The kids liked the Disney outlet. A variety of eateries are available. We went to a pho bistro which was a bit pricy, but good. Overall, a good choice for outlet shopping in the L.A. area or if you are driving through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CentralCATraveler
50,Busy but fun,It was very busy when we visited but we managed to get to most of the stores we wanted. There were some great sales and there is a good variety of stores. We used the free shuttle from downtown LA and the shuttle was clean and the drivers were very friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed our day shopping and it wasn't too hard to get to using the shuttle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869denises
30,Some good bargains,"Spent a few hours shopping but found it frustrating that you had to queue to get into some stores. The stores you didn't have to queue to get into, you had to queue to pay for your items. Some queues to pay were 20 minutes. I felt like I was queuing for a ride at Disneyland. There are some good bargains but would not recommend unless you love outlet shopping (which I don't).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddiOZ
50,Closest outlet mall to LAX,"This place served our purpose of loading up designer stuff at bargain price on our pre-departure day from LAX. Just a 30 min drive away. It is huge so you need to plan as to where you would start as it was quite a walk from one end of the mall to the other.When we arrived, it was so busy but cars were directed and parking was free. We spent some 4 hours here and had a late lunch at Ruby's Diner. The lunch was a great round up for our visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveltubbies
40,Graet shopping,Very well organized mall and the price is much cheaper than other malls by at least 30% . It was grate shoping expirance .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saifh2013
50,Husband and son outshopped me - how did that happen????,"We had a great time at Citadel and spent about 5 hours here. Thought it was going to be all about me when I started at the Steve Madden shoe store and moved on to Skechers with great buys at both. However, my husband and son then discovered Old Navy, Converse, Vans, Lids, Nike, Aeropostle, Nike, Nike and more Nike. I also liked H&M and Guess. Australian travellers - the prices here are amazing, Skechers shoes that were $110AUD at home, were $55 USD. Steve Madden shoes that are in David Jones for over $300AUD, were $49USD. The boys picked up lots of Nikes for $49-$89USD, including Jordans, AirMax. We dined at Rubys at Citadel and enjoyed our meal there also. We loved the 'worlds tallest christmas tree' and it looked beautiful both day and night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicBees
40,"Open mall, many brands","It is not as big as other open malls I visited in the USA...for instance Sawgrass Mills - Fl or Concorde Mills - NC, but is good enough to buy top brands at price off in the greater LA. I was located in Huntington Beach and the trip took around one hour by car.The mall is nice (it looks similar to Las Rozas Outlet stores in Madrid) and the access is easy. Skip the valet parking area wich is expensive and don't give you any additional benefit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gianjoan
50,Great deals during Labor Day weekend,"We had a great time shopping here. It was nice to walk around, have a snack etc. I got great deals here during the Labor Day sales.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanneboga
40,Wasn't sure between Citadel or Desert palm,"we love shopping. most of the time we spend at outlet malls during our recent trip to LA. wanted to go to a mall with high end outlet so we decided desert palm which was 2 hours away. Citidel was just 10 minutes away but because advised by many citadel was lame so we went ahead ti Desert palm.it has high end not many people but the shops are disorganised. great stuff and cheap. No great food place except Mc Donalds which was quite far from major designer outlet. very tiny starbuck and the only Wifi available was Starbuck and McD.The next day we stopped at Citadel. surprisingly not as what i was advice, it has most of the desired brands, and more low end and high end, small cute stores nice arranged so that its easy to go. lots of food parlour. the parking was great multi complex with lifts. free and also there are valet parking. its like one stop designer outlet minus most of the major european designers. thats all.You should go to their super nice toilet. especially the lounge for mommy and baby.It was our shortest outlet shopping but it was satisfactory. should have gone to Citadel instead of Desert palm. but no queue at Desert palm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saraab_123
40,Very good,Great place to shop but was expecting a bit much. Still worth a stop IF YOU HAVE TIME. I mean we were in LA for a week and our activities were packed so with traffic we couldn't shop for more than 1h30. Too big! Well it's not a problem when you live there but when you don't have much time not quite the place to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
50,All the Brand Names,"Was crazy busy, but there was lots of park attendants on hand directing traffic. Tons of name brand stores",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SK-FarmGirl
50,"Ok, I know it's new stuff.",Again I went with my wife and had a swell time. I just look around and find the 40% + 25% off plus 10% more off if you buy 5 or more deals. I am a cheapskate and even I bought things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
50,awesome Outletcenter,"This hugh Outletcenter is located directly on the I-5, which makes it very easy to stop by.The Center has more than 100 stores and for me it is always a must to go there.Adidas, Disney, Guess, H&M, Kors, Calvin Klein, Fossil Banana Republic etc. etc...with great deals.The whole area is very clean and beautiful. The foodcourt is also very excellent, try the Hawaiian BBQ.Parking could be a mess when you are there at the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chryselli
50,Great Shopping Outlets!,"Love these outlets and even though its my second time here, we still haven't managed to get around to all of the shops! We cleaned up after the Black Friday sales and bagged some great bargains. Make sure to know your prices beforehand so you know it's a genuine bargain. They have a great food court with a great array of foods on offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneandShirl
50,best shopping in LA,If you can’t find it here it simply doesn’t exist.Pack a light suit case and a heavy wallet because after one trip to this place your suit case will be full and your wallet empty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangawang
40,Same stores just a different location,I found the outlet mall convenient to the hotel I was staying at. There is personnel who directed traffic and watched out for pedestrains. Plenty of parking. I would describe the mall as quiet during the week but weekends were very busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pete84120
40,Shop till u drop,"This place is big, very big compared to similar in Australia. Great choice of shops and very good value for money. Used the shuttle bus from the Crowne Plaza Hotel, but plenty of parking if you are driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9688FAgarym
50,Incredible shopping!,"Visited with my partner and teenage son and daughter. We all LOVED the choice, service and prices! Shopped at Guess, Nike, Victoria Secret, Michael Kors, Kennith Cole and many, many more. Compared to shopping at outlets in New Zealand this is AMAZING! Crazy good prices and service! If you are staying in Anaheim there is a bus that will pick you up from your hotel and bring you back. You don't want to miss a day of shopping here!! Even my partner and teenage son loved shopping here! Brought many pairs of shoes and clothes! Happy boys and girls!! Great day out for the family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrac470
50,A regular stop for Aussie shoppers!,"We used to pass this by each time we hit the i5, but now it is the halfway point for us between Universal and Anaheim. It's a great alfresco place to snare a bargain just before Christmas. Some days, it's quiet and easy to meander around, last week it was buzzing with shoppers like us - all in search of something magic before Black Friday! We never come away empty-handed and this year was no exception. There are more than enough beautiful restrooms and eateries for convenience and shops to suit every purse and preference. There is a wonderful Christmas aura and truly the largest Christmas tree I have ever seen. It claims to be the largest in the world and I don't think they are kidding. Jaw dropping and absolutely beautiful, it is laden with lights and baubles and has to be seen to be believed. I just adore Christmas in America and wish we were as hopelessly addicted to the Festive Season in Australia. Until we are, I will continue to save all our spending money to enjoy places like the Citadel Outlets. It's just the nicest way to shop outside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussiedisney

50,"Well laid out, and great selection of stores","Definitely one of the nicer outlets I've been to. There were a huge selection of different kinds of stores, and being from Canada, I absolutely loved the collection of surf/board stores, which are always very expensive and hard to find up north.I found the prices to be average, maybe a bit higher than some other outlets. However, it's a good trade off for this beautiful, clean and large outdoor mall. The food choices are amazing, as there are a ton of options available.Parking is also plentiful, even though it shares some space with a few office buildings. It is easy to get to, as it's just off the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roombanut
40,Better than The Outlets at Orange,These outlets are genuine outlets at discounted prices. A large variety of stores to choose from and plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trav_vels
50,Loved it !!,Had great time shopping here.. Love the surf brand outlets and Gap shop. Something for everyone with some good bargains. After catching the 62 bus in with my elderly mother from downtown and at a loss as how to get back to hotel without having to catch the bus back again an angel in the form of the shuttle bus driver appeared at the customer service desk. He took us with him to the shuttle bus and gave us a guided commentary of the bus route. He told us exactly how to walk back to our hotel from the bus stop.. What a great guy !! Thank you 😄,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Panther888
30,Nice place to do some retail therapy,Ok outlet. Not too big so you will have plenty of time to shop.There are some bigger stores with more offers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFC15
40,Great Outlets,Spent about 3 hours here and they have a lot of different shops to keep everyone happy. Didn't buy heaps however friends found alot of buy. I have been to better but this is no means a bad place.The food court is a little out of the way in my opinion. it is right the end of one of the sides and is missed by alot of people i think.Taxi's were available to catch when you needed to go. Found one instantly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dipper303m
50,Calling All Shop-A-Holics!!!,"If you like shopping, then this is the place to be. Plan at least a half a day or more. There is something for everyone here.

50,Great shopping,I found having a day to do something different instead of going to Disneyland or knotts berry farm. Buses pick up In certain areas and bring back to your hotel. I found going there was great shopping and being able to do my Christmas shopping for family back home. Plenty of good places to eat as wellWill go there again next year,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pearlanne
50,Bring plenty of money,"We were advised by our concierge to go here, we thought that 3 or 4 hours would be enough but we ended up spending the entire day here. They have a free customer service bag hold area, for when you just buy more than what you expected! There is a great range of shops, something for everyone, and the same goes for eating options. We got the shuttle as we didn't have a car, so if you like shopping then book the last shuttle back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KymberleyB

40,Shop till you drop,These outlets are only a short ride from Anaheim. There's a shuttle bus pick up from a number of locations. Great value. All the major brands and more. You'll need a whole day to do it all. Loads of bargains. Give it a go if you like to shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlove70
50,Shopaholic Paradise,"Every store you could think of, you'll find. There were so many great deals, you could really shop til you drop! Their stock was great as well. Some outlets you expect to find the older stuff and not that up to par in terms of quality, but that wasn't the case at Citadel. Just make sure you have plenty of time when you visit, because one store alone can take up so much of your time. I would love to go back again next time I'm in California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrinal984

30,"Citadel Outlets, Commerce, CA - Know your prices!","A typical outlet with ""factory"" stores. No real special stores or super deals. Being a business traveler and staying adjacent to this outlet a usually walk around after work for exercise. I notice the ""discount offers"" at the stores changing from time to time. Such as a particular store offering 50% off, then another time 70% or even 80%. Sounds good, but the base price of the item changes also so what you end up paying is the same if it's 50% or a 70% discount.Can you get a good value - yes, if you know what the items should be. Also, many of the stores are the same as in any mall and no different in price. However, if it is convenient for you to shop here, it is a nice atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366geraldp
50,Excellent Shopping,"Excellent outlets here, very big, lots of stores to chose from. We spent a whole day and it still was not long enough.

Maximise your time here, there are bargains everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzaT
50,Good shopping,"I go to this shopping outlet everytime i'm in the States. I bought a lot from NIne West because the prices are super cheap, if only my check-in baggage will allow me i can bought a suitcase of shoesand this is heaven. I only fancy two other shops and that's Michael Kors, but the prices here is not really that cheap, no big difference if you buy from Macys. And the best time to come here is firstthing in the morning, because once those tourist coach buses arrived, its complete chaos, and it will spoil your day. , There's lots of coffee shops and a very nice bread from a famous eatery wherein you can have coffee freshly brewed and you can refill your cup. Its good to spend your day here..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maganda0411

We went around 7pm (2 hours before closing) and there was definitely not enough time to wander all the shops.Struggled to find stuff in smaller sizes which was a bummer but did walk away with a Kate Spade handbag with 40% off!

50,But I needed bigger suitcases !!!,"Fantastic outlets, gap is our favorite and we don't have a gap store within 5'000km of where we live, so when we got there we were so happy when we got there and they had 50% off and then 15 % off for 3 hours and we walked in just 10 minutes prior to the 3 hours starting ! Score !! We loved the Tommy store, DKNY ( wife got her bras she struggles to get anywhere in the world) and we loved the outdoor walks was hot but as evening came was so great. Food was good, star bucks so I was happy and the best bit of it all was that they have a free bag holding service within the centre management. We ended up with 13 very large bags !! :-)Only word of caution, we got a dodgy taxi ride back to aneheim and it was$70 bucks each way, they have a shuttle but you have to book on line and left about an hour and a half earlier than we did and we needed every minute. We actually worked out we saved over a thousand dollars, taxi included, highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timhartland
50,Worth the crowds! Awesome day out!,"Loved this shopping mall an the price tags that went with it!My 15yr old shopped up a storm at the DC shop buying 1xshoes, 2 shirts , 2 shorts an 1x singlet for $129 then 2x hoodies for $59 he was in dc heaven!Also our 20yr old son was ableTo pick up shoes from Adidas for $40 ( he has size 15 feet) so he was happy as!All in all a fab day shopping. Highly recommend to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisacunningham01
50,Great Outlet Shopping,"Very close to the Crowne Plaza Los Angeles-Commerce Casino, the hotel has a shuttle to and from here as well. Very good selection for all family member's shopping needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71GarryB
30,Good if you don't have the time to visit the other outlets,It has a good variety of shops and labels although the pricing in general is significantly more than the other outlet malls which are usually situated about an hour or more outside LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevie-MYS
50,Great value place to shop,"The visitors discount card at centre management is well worth the effort to pick up, it offers additional savings. The centre has been enlarged since our last visit and the variety of shops is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danz1
50,Nice shopping place,"Love it all, variety of stores and brand names. Clean place, family friendly, got food court in the middle if you hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enzomatric
40,Good selection of brands and convenient set up,We spent most of a day shopping here again (we have been 3 times before also). The selection of shops is very good and most have good priced items (compared to Australia at least). Some shops now do not have really cheap prices (eg. True Religion Jeans prices were full price on most pairs and only some t-shirts on sale) and many have only buy 2 get 1 free or buy 1 get 2nd at 50% off which are not really worthwhile when at largely full price. We found Levis and Van Huesen best value for what we were looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiger70SH
50,Whole day of shopping!,We spent the whole day here shopping and it was the best! Heaps of good bargains and the shops were all really good. Bought so much and is really worth going if you love a good bargain!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timtammy
50,Excellent bargains to be had,We went to Citadel Outlets based on other reviews I had read and we were certainly not disappointed. We were a group of 6 and planned to spend approximately 3hrs at the outlets however there were so many shops and we were all finding such good bargains that we ended up spending about 5 or 6 hours there. There is a huge range of designer brand shops with awesome prices and something for everyone. We would go back for sure if we're ever in LA again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glynnie18
40,Great City Outlet,"I had got mix reviews before going to this outlet and when I went I really liked it. Its big, they have good prices (compare to other outlets) and they do have a variety of things.The Citadel Outlet its located on the side of the Highway 5 and its quite easy to reach. The parking its a hassle if you dont arrive early cause it gets full and you dont have an alternative besides waiting.The outlet itself has an open layout so if its sunny take sunscreen and comfort shoes to walk it. Most of the stores have a great variety with a mix of on sale items and new arrivals. Staff its very friendly and helpful as well. There is no Ralph Lauren in case you wonder.Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMartinSDXB
50,Great place,Very nice mall great shops food court was nice lot's of choices. All in one floor plan no up or down of stairs or elevators. Very clean. We stayed across the lot at the Double tree and it was nice to walk to the room and shop and eat at a walking distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guzman831
40,Great Mall,"Great variety of stores. Some did not offer the deals I would expect but others did. Great hours, very clean, lots of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieB105
30,Outdoor outlet mall,"We were recommended to come here by a friend that had recently been.We looked at what was available, store wise and decided it would be worth the $40 cab ride there.We were a bit disappointed to be honest, we got a bargain in the vans store and an awesome winter coat for my husband but that's about it.If you are anything above a ladies size 16 you will not find much here.After having to line up to enter the coach store I was quite disappointed.The saving grace was the well maintained food court and facilities provided, the Hawaiian food was delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Empress110
40,outlet mall in downtown los angeles,Generally the outlet mall scene in california has them placed in far flung places forcing shoppers to spend a long drive to reach there. This one is located very close to downtown LA. The shops are the same ones you would find in other california outlet malls. I would say the merchandise represents mid-level to some high end stores. Most of the stores are clothing related here and the merchandise is marked down most likely because its past seasonal merchandise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,"Excellent outdoor mall with nice shops, ice cream the works","I visited this shopping attraction while in town, very well kept outdoor mall that is very large. Free parking, music outside, nice ice cream shop, they even had Currency Exchange for my Canadian friend, that he said had best rates in LA. Overall a wonderful excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaelan

50,Lots of stores,We come to this outlet several times a year. Best thing is the number of stores and the layout. Love the fact that this is a true pedestrian mall. No crossing of parking lots like in other outlets we've been too. Plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwilbourn65
50,So convenient and so many choices,I left a couple of pants at my prior hotel so needed to pick up a air for my next visit. These shops appear to be new. They are in a very nice setting with shops and restaurants nestled near the I-5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krandy21784
50,Great Outlets,"Great mix of stores. Arrive early to beat the crowds. Valet for $5 is definitely worth the money. Also, the restrooms were super clean and nicely decorated. Reminded me of a beautiful hotel bathroom (even with a mother's lounge for breast feeding) instead of an outlet mall bathroom. Strange that I'm reviewing the restroom, but it caught me so off guard being super nice and clean that it made an impression. Thumbs up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javillane
50,shopping haven,"we went here, just days before the christmas season, but the place was so crowded and parking was very difficult . good that there was a filipino family who called on us, and said that they are leaving and we can take the space.when i entered the place, i was at 1st hesitant to enter any store, but when i saw the long lines, i became curious , why all the gaga as if everybody has the dinero to shop. with my calculator on hand, i went to the coach shop, oh my..converting it to our money , its really a good buy..then , there are other shops with plenty of shoppers. i bought some few items, because i cannot shop on crowded places.. so we scheduled the next visit. this time, we came very early, so there were still plenty of space.. and look for shops like levis, gap, samsonite, crocs, sketchers.. juicy coutour ,etc.. prices are reasonable , my only regret is that, i still wasnt able to buy the michael korrs bag.. though am already holding it and was about to go to the cashier to pay..now am thinking about it... tsk! ..at one side there were musicians,singing hispanic music,, i cant understand it, but it makes shopping more fun when theres music around... cant say anything more, but sure to come back here again..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711rose
30,Many good stores missing,"It is a large outlet where you can find Gap, Banana R, Bass, Converse, Adidas... But still missing many of my favorite ones, as Polo Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo, Brooks Brothers, Abercrombie, Lacoste...It is located on the way from LA to Anaheim so that is why I went there, but Premium outlets are much better (they were far).It was raining so we got wet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RocioG900
40,great place for deals,good prices here at the outlet shops. real busy parking lots though. saw plenty of security so it seemed like a safe area. very clean tooview my pictures to get an idea of the location and shops,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonystewart14
50,Wear your most comfy shoes,Or you can buy there.. Very good prices for American brands. Most service staff are friendly. Has a food court there with a few selection of food. Free wifi too at the food court area or Starbucks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cherrychoco
40,"cheap designer goods, fantastic shopping experience!","This is hands down the best shopping experience I've had in my life! A huge array of designer brands with prices that are much, much less compared to the malls. I was like a kid in an ice cream shop, wanting to try everything in sight!We only spent a day here so we weren't able to visit all the shops. Between the browsing, choosing, trying on clothes, and paying, the time passed quickly. Some of the biggest discounts were in the Coach and Banana Republic stores, and the goods they offered were attractive and of good quality. The sales people in the stores we visited were all very pleasant and polite. Must be the California sunshine.The restaurants in the food court were only so-so, and we didn't get to try the other restaurants.We will definitely come back here when we return to LA, next time with a bigger suitcase!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cutie888
50,Shop Shop Shop,"The title says it all. I think they have every outlet store under the sun (except Eddie Bauer?) so there's lots to choose from. The food court is decent too, with many options and a nice outdoor seating area. And the ladies restroom is HUGE! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squidhead
50,Great Shopping,This outlet was right next to the our hotel the Double Tree Hilton. We found the outlet to be really competitive in price and also the restaurants fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdnanMir
50,Outlet Shopping without having to drive hours away,"The Citadel has grown much over the past several years. Housed ostensibly in the former Uniroyal Headquarters, the facade is impressive. Parking is horrific, although the addition of a structure off to the side is welcome. But it's not enough. One can spend precious shopping minutes trying to park. Rudeness is key, as folks are not afraid, unfortunately, to snake spots. This is not a kindler or gentler shopping mall.the store selection is vast, carrying much of what one could expect at malls located miles away from anything. This combination (right in the heart of the city and good store selection) causes the crush.In the end, if you like to shop, the stores, the bargains, and prices are worth the hassle. Just stay away from Black Friday, as the crush is unimaginable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrEricJL
50,Well laid out,"Looks overwhelming from the outside, but very well planned and everything was spotless. Some of the loveliest restrooms I've ever been in !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jude88
40,Lots of Shopping,"We visited the Citadel on MJK Day which is a holiday so the complex was crowded. However, I did find free parking very easy in the new five tiered parking structure across the street from Starbucks. There were three crossing guards directing traffic by the parking structure so the car and pedestrian traffic was well organized and we felt safe.I recommend getting your VIP Savings card at the Information center before you start shopping. There are discounts you can use at many of the stores. Just show an AAA or American Express card and they will give you the savings card. However, if there are sales, some stores will not combine discounts. It is either the sale price or the VIP Savings card discount.There are a variety of stores from children apparel, footwear, luggage, house ware, and men and women’s apparel. So there are plenty of stores of interest for the whole family. There is also a food court one can stop for lunch or a snack. For a chocolate fix, there is the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. I always purchase a delicious caramel apple here.The restrooms are nice and clean. The stalls each have an area to put your purses and packages which is very convenient. This way you don’t have to hang them in front of you nor have your friends hold them while you take care of business.This is the only shopping “outlet” in Los Angeles County. As a history note, this used to be the location of the Samson Tire Company that opened in 1930. It was the largest tire manufacturing plan on the West Coast. The only sign of it left are the walls you see in front that are designed after a 7th Century BC Assyrian palace with griffins and Babylonian princes.The other larger shopping outlets close to LA are the Camarillo Premium Outlets in Ventura County and the Desert Hills Premium Outlets in Cabazon close to Palm Springs. The Camarillo Premium Outlet is the largest and is best visited over two days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliLAgirl
30,should have given this a miss,"I guess it depends what you are looking for, but I found Citadel to be mainly label outlets, and unless you are a lollipop woman, you won't find any clothes to fit! It was an exercise in frustration trying to get there. We took the subway to union station where we had to transfer to the Citadel courtesy bus, which never came! We ended up getting a taxi, and having to direct the taxi driver who had no idea where the place was! We found it a disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pennypickle
40,GOOD PLACE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY,"Well the $60 taxi fare (one way) made me question if the trip to Citadel was going to be worth it.. It was. First of all I was expecting a crazy place with lots of people and lots of sales. We were there in early November, and I believe that this time of year is the lull before the storm, which was ok by us. There was hardly any people around and that made for comfortable shopping. We bought heaps of shoes. The big brands are so much cheaper in the U.S than Australia. A few handbags and wallets. Looking back I should have bought more to make that taxi fare even more worth it. We collected a discount card from the information office but not all shops automatically accepted it. The other thing we Aussies have to get used to is the extra tax added at the end of the purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micha1_9
20,Dissapointing,We found that the discounts here were not that good. Our favorite stores were much smaller than expected so they didn't offer the variety of merchandise that we were looking for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantoNat
40,Don't go near to Christmas,"We visited the outlets today (14 December) and there were queues to get in the shops, like night club queues. One out one in style of things. The discounts were not that good and thousands of people. It took a good 10 minutes to walk from the car to the outlets. We have visited there every year for the last three years from Australia, and this year was the most disappointing. We will go back, but maybe not this time of year. Last year was around Black Friday sales and the crowds were not as bad but the sale prices were amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trusstytraveller
50,Great shopping trip,"Had several hours there, lots of choice of shops, toilets were clean, good food court with a variety of food and drink available, heaps of parking.

50,Loved it!,There were lots of name brand stores and the deals they had were awesome! Definitely worth checking out...very clean public bathrooms which were actually the best I have ever seen in my entire life. They even have a completely seperate room for nursing mothers. They had a Ruby's Diner and the food was very good...the service was also great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindy2810
40,shopaholics dream,this place is huge. We went on a saturday and there were so many cars that they offered a shuttle service from the parking lot to the shops.There is so many great brands at amazingly cheap prices (especially if your from Australia).Unfortunitly some shops had massive lines to get through the cash register so i gave them a miss.It was so big that we couldnt get round the whole place because our kids had had enough.Cant wait to go back though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shansarnold
40,The place for Shopaholics,"This is the place to come if you want to buy fashion at great discounts. You should reach the outlet in the morning, and it can get crowded in the afternoons. One thing to bear in mind is that the discounts and deals given by a particular brand name in Citadel outlet might be different from the same brand name in another outlet mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerSen
30,"If your looking for Fashion, this is the place to go","So many clothing, shoes, bags, perfume etc shops, it seems endless. Not too many other type of shops, probably under 10. They do have lots of eatery options, so starving not a problem. Shuttle service is available, $14.00 round trip and it can be quite slow, more time making pick ups than traveling, surprised it's not a free service like many others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulab666
40,Shopping + Shopping + Shopping,"Good place for shopping.Prices are very good and plenty of good deals.In case you go during the week-end, I would suggest you go early in the morning and complete all your shopping before noon.The afternoon is so crowded that you cannot realy enjoy shopping.In case you travel to Las Vegas, then shopping is somehow cheaper in Nevada.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hasselmc

You simply can't resist your temptation to buy things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeerajVic
40,Shop! Shop! Shop,"It took us just 15 minutes drive from Monterey Park where our hotel is located. Hotel has even offered free shuttle to the outlet (advance booking required). However, as we have rented a car, we went there on our own. Parking might be a problem as most of the spaces were occupied. 1 day shopping is recommended as they have over 100 shops. When compared to Camarillo, the shops here seemed slightly on the higher end (just relatively speaking) but they still have the discount offered. Overall, we enjoyed shopping here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hongkongboy55

Free kids strollers and wheelchairs, you can even hire lockers for your baggage, free wifi in café bars.If your in Anaheim they do have free shuttles from most hotels - what a fab day shopping.Its a real shame its all outdoor shops sadly being outdoor it was not air conditioned why did the not make it into an indoor mall.

Get here early to avoid the crowds and to get a parking space. Holiday weekends can be a real zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheapasian
50,BEST SHOPPING CENTRE,"Having been to LA a few times, this is by far the best place to shop. When first driving up to it, it looks a bit funny but do not be put off, there are many great stores!

Fast forward twenty years and it's still easy to find, but much improved!Finding a place to park is always a challenge, but avoid peak days, hours, holidays and the odds are much better. What's impressive is the selection of stores all within a comfortable walking distance. No long hikes from point A to point B and the food court is the best I've seen for an outlet mall, not to mention the ultra nice restrooms!Granted, no scenic drive, but for us locals, it's close to home and convenient for tourists driving around LA. The reward...view of the famous Ben Hur movie backdrop, all for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
40,Outdoor Outlet Mall,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza - Commerce many times, drove by the outlet mall and never went there, because it didn't look like much from the highway. Did some online research and realized the mall was outdoors and looked upscale. As far as outlet malls go. So I decided to stop by.- Lots of free parking.- Good food court with Starbucks.- Stores - Nike Factory Store, H&M, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Michael Kors, Coach- Military Discount with proper IDThe mall is not to big and not to small. Just the right size to spend a couple hours shopping for bargains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lasvegasfreeway

50,Very impressive selection of outlets. Lots of free parking.,"This is a big outlet that takes a long time to cover. I ended up buying nothing, but my family was loaded to the gills with bags by the time we left. The parking lot is big, and we had no problem finding a space, albeit a long walk. We visited on a weekday, so I cannot speak for weekends. Rather than list shops and bargains, I would just say that I was impressed at how clean the place was, including the restrooms. Seemed to be plenty of sales everywhere. This visit was followed shortly by a trip to the Las Vegas Outlets (by McCarran). The Citadel easily has more to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaka_Frank

50,1 of the Best Outlets in LA & Orange Counties,"Instead of bringing a suitcase or spending a lot of money on taxis, we recommend renting a car & putting all your shopping bags in them as parking is free. The Citadel Outlets' management is also quite good as they monitor using CCTV's & security patrolling the parking lot & complex so it's quite safe.When shopping in the U.S., you'll need to pay attention to sales events at the department stores, online & at the outlets as well, which simply means do your homework. In general, the outlets' prices are less expensive than at department stores &, especially for American-made/branded products, cheaper than for the same items sold in many Asian countries (i.e. Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia) although some of those products are made in Asia. However, sometimes a product can be cheaper at a department store if there's a special sale or packaging of multiple products. It's best you know what you're looking for & have done some comparisons & not only in prices. For example, the same product can be sold at different prices at different stores in the same outlet complex, or even at another branch in a different outlet complex; we purchased a Samsonite backpack sold at a Samsonite outlet store (which was priced differently than the Luggage Factory) but this particular outlet store had a special extra 20% discount, which was even cheaper than other Samsonite factory outlet stores so we got lucky that day, thanks God. When we know exactly what we're looking for & the price bench-marks, we can simply call other outlet stores to check for availability & prices before making the long drive there.We've visited this outlet multiple times because of its location & good selection. It's not the most complete outlet but it fulfilled most of our needs; other outlets (i.e. Desert Hills Premium Outlets, Camarillo Premium Outlets) may have more complete selections while others are part of a larger destination complex with a cinema, skateboarding park, regular stores & restaurants (i.e. The Outlets at Orange) but they are generally even further away from L.A. (i.e. 1.5-3.5 hours drive depending on traffic).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agchen1
50,"Lots of options for shopping, too crowded (sunday)","It was a one day stop for shopping, lots of options for shopping and eating.One downside (to consider picking the day of the week to visit) is that probably due to the location it was too crowded, was a sunday, the parking was full so the time to find a spot it was really slow, it took me almost 30 min!!! and ended up on a really far away corner, nice thing is they have this kind of shuttle that if you can get one will save you a lot of walking.I would say it a good option if you're just visiting LA or arounds and wants to get a decent Outlet shopping, but if you can try t",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okumare
30,Bring Your AAA Card,"We come here from time to time to do some shopping. However this is not one of those outlets where you would leave with bags and bags of goodies like some of the other outlets.The stores they have here are pretty standard: Banana Republic, Coach, Old Navy, Guess, etc. Nothing that really stands out.Parking is a pain. Definitely come early or else you would not even be parking on premise if you're trying to do holiday shopping.If you have a AAA card, stop in to the customer service and pick up a discount book for free.

The drive was great, lovely driver and free Wi-Fi on the shuttle! We spent about 6 hours here during Memorial Day weekend and got some really great deals, had lunch and went to get the shuttle back. Unfortunately the shuttle driver was new and had left early without us (party of 4) and also another family of 3. The staff were amazing, they were so apologetic. They took us to the VIP lounge, offered us free drinks, food, cable TV and anything else we wanted, then they hired a private shuttle to take us all back to Anaheim. This made us all feel like Citadel Outlets really valued their customers. I would definitely recommend this place to any shopper who wants a great shopping experience. I will return in future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheekyrelle
50,Very good options,"A nice selection of stores, with incredibles prices. We went there during Memorial Day weekend and obtain very good discounts. A clue is to go the visitor center and obtain a VIP card for further discounts: we got up to 20% additional in some stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4405MGsergiod
40,Brands discounted!,"This was one of my first shopping stops in California! There are many outlets offering great low prices for branded clothing. However, my mistake was not allowing enough time to shop here. There were few staff working in many of the stores, but a lot of customers waiting for assistance or lining up to pay so it took a lot longer than I expected. You can also get a VIP savings card from the info desk for more discounts and bargains!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaL984

50,"So many shops, so little time","We always love to stop by these outlets on our way to the LAX airport and almost always spend more time than we should. Great shops, open spaces, everything is very clean and well kept and sometimes they have some really great bargains.One of our favorite places to go shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Appreci8life
50,great shopping,"Very stylish open air outlet center, friendly staff in the mall office, exceptionally friendly staff in the COACH outlet store.We came here for the COACH outlet on a busy Saturday. Parking was well organized.The mall office (very friendly staff!) had a VIP customer card and some very nice coupon offers for us.Despite the many customers staff in the COACH outlet store was very organized and helpful. In a matter of days we visited several COACH outlet stores, most had very good staff, but here at Citadel Outlets they were the best. Thank-you for a great shopping experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotel8more
40,Historical Landmark,The Outlets that they made it into are ok to shop in. The real story is in the history of the citadel. The building front is a replica of an old European castle. Then it was the Uni-royal tire company. Then abandon for many years and used for movie seines. So if you’re a history buff this is a nice place to see. It’s considered a historical Landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darthraider

50,Bags bags bags,"We spent a day shopping at the Citadel Outlets and scored some fantastic bargains. In particular, we liked the DKNY, Calvin Klein, Underarm, perfume and kids clothing shops. We took the free bus from downtown LA which was such a fantastic service. The bus drivers were really friendly and gave us a discount card. The Japanese takeaway was also great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlottec81

30,It's just OK... nothing special,"It is a big mall and most of them are outlet stores, but we didn't find anything we needed here...Food court is one of the biggest in the outlet malls, lots of selection.Washrooms are the CLEANEST in ANY public malls. You'd think you are in a fancy HOTEL...Expect to spend a couple of hours shopping here. Parking is a pain unless you go early since they are doing some major renos on the grounds and make sure you don't park in the spots allotted to business towers or you are likely to be ticketed to towed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solaris_pete
50,Great shopping,We only manage a small part of this outlet centre as it was so large and so we will return. All the favourites are there. The only down side are the parking and queues. Very large car park and so we had to walk quite a way when we found a space. The queues in some shops we very long. We will try a weekday as the parking and queues may have been due to the fact it was a Saturday. Well worth a trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dushkas

20,Probably never again.,"We went there in the middle of the week about 1 pm. And even then it was a problem to find a parking space. Don't want to even think about what it's like to go there on Sunday! You can always use the valet though... If you want to spend more money it is... There are not a lot of stores at all. No Ralph Laureen, no True Religion (on their page it was listed), no Victoria Secret. I used to live in Texas and we had much better outlets. Also i have the feeling that it was more expensive than in Texas as well. Good food court though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonibulg

50,"great for shopping, expected more stores though","i took a shuttle with my kids here and my husband met us there from LAX, it's halfway between anaheim and LAX, perfect if you have a layover or need to kill some time and want to do some shopping. for the size of this outlet i would have expected a few more of the well known brands but what made up for it was other stores i haven't seen elsewhere. i was happy enough and would recommend this as a good location for anyone wanting outlet shopping, they will pick you up from certain hotels in anaheim for $15 return and there's a shuttle from LAX that will drop you off for approx $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meegeemoments
20,Don't bother,"The concept is great but the location is difficult to get in and out of, parking is horrendous, I walked into GAP which was understaffed with a line that went clear to the back of the building. We gave up and went to H&m. She found a few outfits to try on. We stood in yet another very long line for the dressing room. She wanted me to approve the outfits.We we finally got a room, I was not permitted to go into the room with her. So I stood outside, but was again chased away. I therefore could not see the outfits. The woman running the rooms was rude and very nasty. We gave up, put the clothes back, drove to Century City Mall and found some incredible buys with nice people, plenty of parking and no lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmlvngstn

40,Lots of stores to choose from with bargains to be found!,"The Citadel outlets have to be one of my favorite outlets in Southern California. In recent years, they've added numerous stores and it's great to be able to have so many choices. Every time I've gone here, I've found more than a few bargains. Great place to spend a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli

40,"Good range of shops, good restaurant","Almost every city I visit in LA has good outlets, and this is another example of that. But prices felt not that much on the lower side. Anyway, there is an excellent burger diner there, and overall it is very worthy of a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claudio_Souza
50,Value purchases for the Asian consumer,"You will get at least 30-40 percent off premium brand labels (e.g. tommy hilfiger, banana rep, CK and DKNY) if you are coming from Asia. A pity some of the other top american premium brand labels were missing (missing polo Ralph, Kate spade etc) as that in other American outlets. Outlet location was also very out of the way and cost me 80 usd for a return trip as I did not rent a car.Nevertheless, I spent two full days shopping there and had to buy an extra suitcase just so I can lug home the many steals available. A word of advice: bring an extra large suitcase or buy an additional suitcase at one of the departmental stores. Suitcases (samsonite was expensive) are the only thing not going at factory outlet pricing (actually even more expensive than us dept stores) in citadel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanster85
50,great prices,"as always, this outlet has great prices. and it's fun just walking around. they started decorating the xmas tree while we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puentepaco
40,Good shopping,I'm not much of a shopper but managed to buy some items. I went with 2 teens who loved it. We took advantage of the shuttle from Anaheim and on the return trip was dropped off at the front of our hotel (not a pick up hotel) by the coach driver as there was no one else on the coach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueanniecamp
50,Fantastic shopping,We loved Citadel outlets. From the moment we stepped in and went to the unbelievable restrooms till the moment we left with way too many bags. We took the shuttle from Anaheim for $14 per adult and $5 per child. On the bus we were given extra discount vouchers that saved us even more. The information desk will store your shopping throughout the day at no charge and you can collect it on your way out. There is definitely nothing like this in Australia. Wish we had an extra day to go back before we flew home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandro71
50,Shopped out!,"A whole day experience.

40,Crowded every day,"The place is crowded every day, but hey, it's Los Angeles.An outdoor mall, there is decent prices and stores.

Quiksilver had such good sales such as 50% off clearance prices and I got $9.00 Roxy swim suits, $3.49 quiksilver and roxy shirts, $6.49 roxy sweatshirts & tank tops, etc!!

30,Very average,a bit disappointed even though I knew what to expect having read other reviews. Prices are slightly cheaper than normal malls. And one way to get even cheaper is to sign up at customer service to get a VIP card. You'll need to spend more than 75 bucks in some stores to get any form of discount.Get there early ie before lunch if you wish to find a parking spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quokkar
20,Worst outlet i have ever been to,This outlet is horrable cause the prices are the exact same as in canada like regular price.i was so disappointed i wasted my time with this outlet. I am comparing theis outlet from las vagas and it is night and day I would recommend going to the CARLSBAD premium outlet in san diago where the prices are really cheap and are a great deal liek the one in las vagas i wish someone would have told me so i didnt have to wast 3 hours there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryn_11
30,Wasn't that great,It didn't blow me away I thought it was going to be amazing but it's actually smaller and not as good as our big outlet here in Australia (harbour town) didn't really like the set up but anyway I went to a couple other outlets in KA and new York and in LA I loved the orange outlets was much better and had better shopping experience there. I suggest if UR closer to Disneyland to go to outlets at orange they r bigger and way closer than citadel and cheaper to get there on the bus if u don't have a car. Or u can try both like we did and see for urselves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadevaradi
40,Reasonable outlet mall with good diversity.,"Good mix of shops and some reasonable deals, but as with most such malls most of the shops are just another retail shop for the chain not a true Clarence store, but this does give some volume to the shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6
50,Stay away on Week-ends!!! Yikes!!,"I love this Outlet, The best times to go are non-weekends. During the weekends, it is a ZOO!!! I mean ZOOOOOOO! Parking is nearly impossible and crowds swarm in during the weekend. This is the only Outlet mall in the county of Los Angeles. If you do have to come on Weekends, come early and leave before 12 noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveC877
40,Great Shopping at good prices,"These outlet shops are great value for money. There is a wide variety of stores from Sports stores to shoes, homewares and kids clothing. The range for the stores is very good, but not nescessarly current range (perhaps last season?) however it is stil great value for money. There is a small food court there and lots of parking. We used a shuttlebus from Anaheim which was cheap and effective. Make sure you go to the customer service counter and get your discount book. Also, they will look after your shopping bags for free until you are ready to leave",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rc28

30,Good but no outlet!,Good variety of shops and eateries but don't expect this place to be discounted and pick up some bargains because it certainly isn't outlet shopping as we know it in the UK! Also remember about the sales tax that isn't included within the price.Make sure you visit customer service and pick up an additional discount card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkM607

10,Addidas bad customer service by store manager,"I never thought I would ever stop buying addidas products until today. I love Addidas and I have been purchasing them since I can remember, more than 25 years. I wont ever buy any more Addidas product and dont think I will ever come back to the Citadel Outlets either.This was my second time visiting the Citadal Outlets. Bad customer service at the addidas store, maybe Citadel Outlets should get involved in first dress code for managers of stores and second improving in customer service. After ask to speak with manager at the Addidas store, a young man with pants down showing his underwear comfronted us. Waisting our time keeping us there for almost one hour, he didnt apology for the incoveniece or honor the sale price advertice. It was a very rude and unprofessional over all experience. We ended up leaving our almost $200 merchandise purchase on the reigister and sadly walking out the store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriar569
50,Fabulous Shopping,"So I went here for my first time even when I've lived only about 20miles away from it all my life lol, I really like that there are great retail shops at such low prices everything has discounts. I am a big juicy couture fan and since I travel a lot I purchased a beach cooler which is originally $128 (since its designer!) for only $30!!!! That was a great find then I purchased small juicy couture items all for $10 or less, there are soo many good finds like coach keychains for $14 and coach handbags as low as $70 which make good gifts for everyone! I really had a great time good shopping outlet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinalovestravel
30,"A pleasant place, but don't expect bargains.","Citadel outlets is an easy place to find and a good place for a stroll and a coffee or an ice cream. However, the prices were no different from an average mall and because it is outdoors, if you had been shopping, there would have been a lot of walking in full sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishkamitten

50,Great deals,We took the bus out here from downtown LA. It was only a 30 minute bus ride and worth the great deals they had. We cleaned up at our favorite places! They have plenty of stores to choose from with great sale prices. It's a must go shopping trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilihurdler5
40,"Good choice, horrendous parking","I suppose we visited at a bad time, 8 days before Christmas, but the parking was absolutely chaotic. Got directed to a gravel wasteland to park by the attendants, as the main car parks were full. Went as directed then got told that I had come the wrong way by the next attendant, who was very rude to me, only for the attendant who had directed me that way to be waving his arms shouting ""sorry"" in the distance behind. I only went where I was shown to go !!!Although it was absolutely packed, there were loads of decent shops to browse around. There seemed to be far more choice in the shops than the Carlsbad premium outlets we had visited a few days before. Aeropostale here, a store I love, with huge savings (escpecially when you got a $25 off for every $100 spent card). The only disappointment was the Reebok store. Went in and couldnt see any NFL gear, so asked a sales person only to be told they didnt have anything ?! I know Nike have the new contract but surely they must have had something, this was still during the season in December, unbelievable !!! Previous shopping in Orlando Reebok outlets i have had the pick of loads of merchandise in nearly every team going, yet here nothing ? Do LA really not care about getting a team back here at all ?All the usual GAP, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Guess, Adidas, Nike, Childrens Place etc. Bit disappointed with the perfume shops as used to be able to get a great deal on after shaves & perfumes, but unless they now on the buy one get one $9.99 offer then seems to be cheaper to buy back home in UK now........odd !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokerzammo1970
30,Items are not that cheap,"In summary: Items are not that cheap. For example, the addidas store had shirts selling the same price as the grove. Then why should I be visiting this place?! If you are looking for deep discount on brands, this will not be the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tada888
50,LOT'S OF BARGAINS,"You will need good shoes and get your wallet ready~ so many bargains... we shopped over the Memorial weekend, which was amazing!!! almost everyday, this outlet is booming with tourist & locals looking for a great deal~ all name brands you can think of. Great place to spend the day and relax",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanie04
50,Great shopping for tourists.,"My wife and I shopped here last year, terrific bargains ,on brand name shoes ,and clothes especially if one is looking for golf gear as we were. Plenty of gear like Hurley, quicksilver, etc for the younger generation as well.Rubys diner is great for lunch, terrific service and staff were just fantastic .So good we came back twice,only thing I would recommend would be have a hire car, and gps. There are bus shuttles from hotels but if you want to be independent,hire a car it is easy to drive the freeways. Hope this is of some assistance to someone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misunda
50,A great outlet experience,"We had read a fair bit about this before we went but were not quite sure what to expect. A friend told us it used to be a tyre factory and it still had some features of its previous existence. It was fantastic. All the named shops plus a few old favorites like Old Navy. We did a lot of shopping, mainly for clothes that were cheaper than we could get them anywhere else. We spent a long time there but found almost everything we were looking for",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynw205

30,"Over rated, Difficult for Shoppers, Other places better!","After numerous times visiting California, this time I decided to visit Citadel to see what all the fuss was about.For those of you from Australia, think of it like an outdoors DFO with hardly any shade areas or places to sit down (apart from the small food court)We caught a taxi from the Anaheim area to Commerce, where Citadel is situated. There are also shuttles from Anaheim (ask your Hotel, only 3 pick up spots) but it didn't suit our timing. Takes around 1/2 hour if traffic is ok, but on the day we went, the freeway took around 50 mins.Almost every major outlet you can think of is here....like Nike, Adidas, Guess, Ecko, Old Navy, Skechers, Michael Kors, Juicy Couture...you get the drift.One thing Citadel needs for shoppers, apart from fixing up the horrible parking for normal customers, is trolleys. Nothing worse than purchasing from 2 stores, with your hands full and getting tired VERY quickly.DO pick up a coupon book from Management office which do offer some additional discounts from a lot of the stores.Is it cheap? If you're buying things like Vans, Converse, Hurley, Nike...then yes the prices are quite good....Guess and a lot of the female shops were on par with their normal stores.I still think the shopping in Vegas is way cheaper than here at Citadel. People think ""outlets"" and automatically think cheaper...not always the case.Food court was cheap and nasty (though clean) but food offerings were pretty bad. A couple of diner type places also.Be prepared on the weekends to line up while waiting to actually purchase...got tiresome after a while!I wouldn't go again....malls across California offer similar value and sales!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jinxyoz
50,Let me help clear some conflicting information...,"I have no affiliation with any stores or with the mall management but since I live 10 mins away I'd like to help clear up some of the posts.It's hard to get to - L.A. is HUGE. The Citadel is not even technically in LA, but rather in the City of Commence. If your vacation has you on the West side of the City without a car it will be difficult to get to since it's on the East side. If that's the case however most of the city will be difficult for you. Get used to: http://www.metro.net/Parking is difficult - It can be difficult to park on the weekends. It's the only Outlet shopping in LA and everyone in LA knows it. Doesn't this just verify the prices for you?Its outside so weather may be an issue - LA is comfortable 320 days a year. A few days it may be too hot, a few days it may rain. This should just thin out the crowds for you and dress appropriately.It's crazy crowded! - It's the only Outlet shopping in LA. Tour buses full of tourist stop by and do their shopping here. Could the stores remain open otherwise?There's better shopping in Las Vegas! - Depends on where you go. Otherwise the same stores stock the same items, what if your trip doesn't stop in Las Vegas?There's no Coach store - Actually since early this year there's now a Coach store as well as other new stores. Check their website www.citadeloutlets.comThe stores staff were too helpful - Really? If you don't want to be helped there are plenty of stores that will do their best to ignore you. Try a Walmart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davensd
50,Great range of stores but not everything is a bargain,"This is a nice clean easy to shop open air mall. There are bargains to be had but you need to know your pricing to be sure you are getting a good deal.

30,Good - not AMAZING though.,"Firstly, it's VERY far from the 'tourist' area of LA (Santa Monica etc). It costs around $70 (plus tips dont forget) in a cab or a three hour bus journey. so that's around $160 for a trip (when you factor in travel). Of course if you already have a car, you can ignore this part.In the main you can find some good deals, but you do have to shop around. The prices are not VASTLY different for a lot of products, but if you hunt around, you can find some decent prices and offers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockfarmer

Staff in some stores were very over-bearing and we just wanted to be left in peace to look!Took transport shuttle from Disney Paradise Pier Hotel, which was well priced but our particular female bus driver made us, and other passengers feel very unsafe. I will not give details here but I have sent a letter of concern to Citadel about this issue, as I would be devastated if it caused an accident for future passengers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlhonest
50,Really good outlets,"Really good outlets with a good food court. All of the brands are here nike, Michael kors, converse, h&m, lucky, nine west etc. good discounts and central in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma071

50,These were better then Vegas!,"A little dissappointed that we were told that the Vegas ones were better and to savemoney by waiting....???? NO NO NO shop here, we had a blast! Nice little mexican store in the courtyard - have the fish tacos for 6.99 YUMMY! Loved these outlets tey really made our trip better :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzpanz
50,Busy outlets with great bargains,Citedal outlets is a busy place day or night. We have found great bargains on brand name watches at the Timex store. All the brands are here. Shop around to find the best bargains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madjude
50,"Great place to shop, as compared to Vegas","As radio shows dsays, LA's only shopping outlet, it is and one of its kind. Altrhought it is outdoors,it may be unconfortasble on a hot day or rainy day. There are great shops from GAP to H&M to IZOD. The food is great especiially Sbarro. Just be warned, even on a monday, it is still Full( since theres a hotel across from it). Otherwise a great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanaearnhardt
40,Hard to get to but great bargains,"If you are going to Vegas you can skip this one, as we found better shopping to be had at the Vegas Outlets but if not this is worth it.We took bus 62 downtown now it required a stop in San Pedro which is not the safest location although no one bothered us (alot of homeless people although we felt safe as there were ques of people lining up for the food trucks) l don't recommend this on a sunday as the bus runs every hour only so this was a down fall for us.It was missing some of the big names you will find in Vegas such as Coach and Ralph although it had a H&M and a few other stores we did not see.Great bargains were had and the service counter was very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mb02
50,Great bargains,"I found out about Citadel outlet on trip advisor and I am so happy that I shopped there as I got great b argains and what I liked about citadel is that it caters for all age groups and budgets and have all types of shops, not just high end shops like the Grove. I really enjoyed my day shopping at Citadel. Getting there on public transport was really easy too just catch the Metro Bus 62 from DOwntown LA and it takes you right to the doorstep in about 40mins, and it only costs $1-50 each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88KW
50,Excellent shopping!,"We went there recently and spent 7hrs + and big $, but managed to get tones of great bargains for 4 of us and fantastic discounts (business suits, Nike gear-trainers...). We didn't even manage to see all the shops. In Calvin Klein the shop assistance told us that we can go to the information and get a free Citadels card which would entitle us to more discounts in selected shops (nearly all of them). With this card we saved 100's of $. :-) Clothing in Australia is so expensive compared to the States, so defiantly worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunrai
50,Wow.. huge bargains... well worth the visit!,"We wanted to do some outlet shopping at the end of our Anaheim stay, and as our flight to Honolulu was scheduled for 4.30pm, we caught the airport shuttle into LAX, checked our luggage and caught a taxi out the Citadel. At $70 taxi fare, this was an expensive way to go, as we found that we could have caught a shuttle direct from the Anaheim hotels and the customer service area will store your luggage for a day for a small fee (less than $1 per piece). Citadel offers many of the major brands (Polo Ralph Lauren was missing) at greatly reduced prices. My favourite bargain was a beautiful le Cruesset pot which retails in Australia at over $500.... I paid just $197 including tax! This is a beautiful shopping experience, the restrooms are 5 Star, and they even have a lounge area adjacent to the restrooms where you can just sit and chill while your credit card cools. There are a number of nice restaurants and the shopping... well just awesome!!! Highly recommended. For serious shoppers, there's even a hotel on site! Sounds extreme, but I'd have to think about it next time as we ran out of time on the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wils0ncm
