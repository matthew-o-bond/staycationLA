30,Hollywood-Eeews and Awes,"I've been to Hollywood Boulevard a few times over the years, but it seems a bit filthy and out of control now. Folks peeing and sleeping on the sidewalks, pot smokers getting high next to young kids on the sidewalk and in restaurants. I even had several folks tell me sidewalk defecation happens frequently right in the middle of the daily hustle. I'm not sorry I missed that! Anyway, I enjoyed all the action, the lights, the sounds, the general big screen feel of the boulevard. And we never encountered a rude street performer...they were all friendly and not pushy. I was a bit surprised by that. Willy Wonka was the kids' favorite. I'm sure I'll go again in the future, but not with young kids.",MoJim
50,Nice site for photo,I just stopped for a photo but I don’t want to walk 15-20 min to get into the sign. Its a nice walk 20-30 min if you are too slow. But is a safe place to be,Felix V
50,Prepare how to find the best view,You can;t get to the sign anymore but you can get close enough to take cool pictures of it. But you better prepare for it and find on line where to park and where is the best place for pictures. And than you can always see it from the Griffin Park Observatory but it is seen there from a long long distance.,Annaline

LA has so many areas from Hollywood, to the Valley, and the beaches, there is too much to see and cover here. But to focus on Hollywood, I would say that a visit to the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater and Dolby Theater shopping area is a great day trip. If you get a chance, see a movie there. The Disney El Capitan Theater is a beautiful turn of the century theater brought back to its original glory. In the cooler part of the day, take a hike up to the Hollywood sign. And if you can get tickets from a member, visit the Magic Castle for dinner and a full night of magical entertainment.",fdecker

40,From George Vreeland Hill,"Hollywood is the ultimate destination for any California tourist.This is the legendary land of the movies.Well, more movies are made outside of Hollywood than here.But this is where so much entertainment history was made.Visit Grauman's Chinese Theatre where such stars as Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe have their hand and foot prints in cement.The theatre sits in front of the Hollywood Walk of Fame where so many names are immortalized.Be sure to see the famous Hollywood Sign, the Dolby Theatre where the Academy Awards are held, Hollywood and Vine and Sunset Blvd.There are just too many places in Hollywood to list here.If you are not sure where to go, then I suggest that you take a tour.On the downside, there are a lot of homeless people in Hollywood and crime is high.So be careful.Have fun and take a lot of pictures.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill

Mann's Chinese theater where Hollywood stars have placed there hands and feet over the last 75 + years is a must and in walking distance from the corner. Parking is a bit of a problem though. Many stores and venues are all along the blvd. Characters of all kinds are walking around daily to take pics with you. Don't miss the Buses to the Stars homes and Hollywood sites,this will give you real viewing of what our town is all about.It will take you to places like World Famous Rodeo Dr. Etc.

20,Iconic but disappointing,Had heard a lot from friends that Hollywood is a very different place to how it is portrayed in films so we visited with low expectations which were met. We parked at the shopping centre and we spent less than half an hour here. We saw the Chinese theatre as well as the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's very busy and crowded which we expected and we managed to see what we came for in a short space of time.,Hannah C

It's best to avoid driving here, traffic is always congested and parking is hard. Take a cab or the metro and you will spend the time walking around instead of stuck in traffic. I think afternoons and evening are the best. You can have both lunch and/or dinner in the numerous restaurants in the area (Musso and Frank not to be missed), you can visit a museum or two, do a bit of shopping and catch a concert at the Hollywood Bowl or The Ford theatre.

We parked at the Hollywood & Highland shopping center which has a huge parking garage and is surprisingly affordable at $1 per $15 minutes. They also advertise $2 parking for up to 2 hours if you buy something within the complex. All we had time for was to stroll down Hollywood Boulevard, check out the Chinese Theatre and see the Hollywood Walk of Fame which was enough for me. There will be tons of people and it isn’t as glamorous as it’s made out to be but it’s a good thing to go do once while visiting the Los Angeles area.",GoVols79

Afterwards head up to Griffith Observatory and take a picture of the Hollywood sign. By now you have done Hollywood.",Ashley S
20,Perhaps once is enough or during celebrity awards,A little bit dull. Visit here by public transportation so it does not hurt that much. There are lots of racist beggars flocking on the street. Walk of Fame is not well maintain. The good image for Hollywood on TV is far more absurd.,Yoshio K

On the second day , we decided to walk on Hollywood Boul. to have a closer look at things and we were a bit disappointed as everything is very commercial , the sidewalks are dirty and there is always someone trying to sell something ! The bus is a better option !",belleretraite

20,It's more scary than needs to be,"So as you can see from what everyone else has said. It's all built up in your mind. The place is quite bad and scary for anyone. We arrived around 4 ish. We walked around from the Hollywood Highland metro station but when we reached the world famous Chinese theatre it was closed as a film premiere was happening at 7. We took photos of the street and Hollywood sign walked all the way to where CVS pharmacy was. We then walked the back all the way past the church of Scientology. All we saw was famous people name on the ground and people taking photos of it. We couldn't see the handprints and footprints hollywood as that whole area was shut down for the movie.The good: we saw from across the street the premiere of ""game night"" and managed to spot Jason Bateman. We saw the famous names on the street. We walked a bit and went to the Disney chocolate store which is great. The lovely people who dress up as superheros and others who offer you jokes as you wait for the lights to turn, sometimes it feels weird but they mean no harm.The bad: there are people trying to sell you all kind of things from tours to t-shirts to their cd albums and so on. We had people come up to us asking us to take a ""free personality test"" which is basically a way to introduce you to the church of Scientology. AVIOD this. The street was not clean and felt dirty even the air around it felt worse than London's ""polluted"" air. Honestly it took the image I had of Hollywood that was in my mind and destroyed it.The whole place gives you a bad vibe and you just feel scared even though you are perfectly fine and law enforcement is around so you shouldn't. I lost my sibling for a second and the whole plot of taken 1, 2 and 3 played in my head.",sauditraveller
20,"No glitz, no glamour...","I was pretty disappointed with our visit to Hollywood. The highlight of the trip was seeing the hand and footprints outside of Grauman's (now TLC) Chinese Theatre. I thought the walk of fame was pretty boring as there was no personality to it. Too many people trying to sell you something - how many Spidermen can be in one location at once??? We can say, been there, done that but didn't buy the T-shirt.",swtraveler15
30,As weird as it gets!,"We are glad we went and will not go back. The outside of the Chinese Theater was the highlight. The outdoor mall by the Lowes Hotel was a welcome surprise and ate lunch there. I did not feel safe the entire time we were there.

We only lasted 3 hours there including lunch and then we had just had enough.",welovetotravelslways

30,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,Hollywood is good fun in a gaudy over the top glitzy way but it's a bit tacky and grotty too to be fair.We loved the walk of stars and the razzmatazz of the strip.

10,Massive Disappointment,"Look at the positives - at least you can say you have been.Walk of Fame is a huge disappointment, was expecting so much more. Yes, there are loads of 'stars', however, lots of them are either broken, or, sidewalk is uneven and cracked. Rock Walk is in better condition, but is something you can visit in about 10 minutes, and, is a bit of a hike (through a quite poor neighbourhood). Loads of shops selling Hollywood tat, and, all a bit dirty and cheap. Hollywood is overall a bit grubby, loads of beggers and homeless.Would I go back - no, I am glad I've been - probably yes, but hugely disappointed.",BSlinger
30,Expecting more,I felt a bit underwhelmed with my Hollywood experience. It didn't have that magic that I thought it would have had.A positive was that there was lots of opportunities to buy souvenirs. However a sour negative note was the aggressive street vendors who constantly tried to pass CDs onto tourists & then become offended when tourists didn't take them on.,ashbobs1211
10,Cheap and dirty,"We arrived by car and drove to the walk of fame to see the stars. The street wasfull of tourists, all was really dirty and the impression was bad. We tried to park our car but for $ 16 for every 20 minutes it was not funny at all.We saw the sign of hollywood but it is simple and unimpressive.Nice restaurants or clubs were not availabel so we left extreme disappointed.",Robert N
30,Not To Be Missed But Not What You Expect,"You visit Hollywood expecting glitz and glamour but leave feeling let down. You've got to go to see the Walk Of Fame, Capitol Records Building, The Chinese Theatre, The Roosevelt Hotel and all the other attractions but, once you've done so and got your photos, you're glad to get away. The whole area just feels run down and dirty with it's tacky shops and fast food outlets and having tour flyers thrust at you every 30 seconds or so gets annoying.A must do but just the once.",newspapertaxi
30,nice to see,"the area is still a little distracting lots of homeless people harmless but still a concern, seems a little run down and dirty but you have to see it at least once in your lift, lots of fast food joints, a few pubs and a brand new shopping centre, its fun to see the name plates for actors and to watch the free show of people dressing up as movie characters",mulgrew
30,It is what it is..,"Hollywood is a bucket list item, but make sure to manage expectations. I don't want to paint a doom and gloom picture, because I think it's worth the trip to visit, just to inform so travelers are aware.The area has many historic and notable sights, but it's not very well kept.The streets are usually pretty packed with tourists, panhandlers, street vendors, and the homeless. The panhandlers and street vendors are somewhat aggressive and be sure to keep your wallet or purse snug due to the pickpockets.Driving in the traffic can be nerve racking if you aren't used to fast-paced city traffic with drivers that don't care.I still think it's worth the visit, just as long as you're aware of your surroundings.",tonyl552
30,"Glad we went, but be prepared to be hassled non-stop","I am glad we got to see the iconic sights of Hollywood, but I will not be back. It's dirty and filled with homeless, drugged out people and extremely annoying people bothering you for money or tours. If you want a tour, use Ultimate Hollywood Tours (see reviews here). I gave it 3 stars because of it's iconic sights, but it's over crowded and filled with filth.My kids did get a first hand lesson of what drugs can do to you, we got to see an addict throw up all over himself and people stumbling around whacked out of their minds.Traffic is absolutely horrible.Again, I am glad I got to see some iconic sights, just be prepared.",Mike C

40,Lots of crowds!,"Along Hollywood Blvd, you will be faced with a ton of crowds. There is a lot of chain store shopping, as well as large souvenir stores located on the boulevard. It is a nice experience for first time LA visitors but somewhere you don't really need to go twice.A few notes: The parking prices are a little outrageous the closer it is to the boulevard. There are also a lot of street vendors, performers and people in character costumes that take photos for tips. The people in character costumes can get aggressive, jumping into a photo uninvited and will refuse to leave unless a tip is given.",F S
40,Hollywood,We enjoyed our visit to Hollywood and the surrounding area. It was a lot of fun to see the places you see on TV. It is very crowded along the strip. There are a lot of people on the strip that are dressed up in costumes that want money for taking pictures with them and also a lot of people that want to give you a free cd a then want a donation. Also many street vendors and performers. I would suggest going early in the morning before the crowds get there. Go see the Chinese Theatre Courtyard early so you can see the stones you want before the crowds arrive.,WorryWartPB

50,Fun place to go for Aussies,"Best you start saving and get to this one. We stayed at the Hollywood Orchid Suites which is minutes from the Dolby Theater and main drag. The guys selling CD's can be pretty full on but not too bad in comparison to New York. Don't buy them, they don't work and are a scam.Hollywood is a platform for all sorts of tours ranging from the basic up to VIP. I would check out Universal Studios and don't go below the VIP pass it's worth the money and also do the VIP personalized tour with LA Insiders. Allow at least 4 days here if you are travelling on towards Anaheim for a feel of the place, but if you can stay longer you can really enjoy the strip for restaurants and friendly people.This is an expensive part of the trip so allow for 2 of you around $USD300/day for food and entertainment and pre pay for your tours.",Wineflow travels

50,A must visit for film and history buffs.,"Anyone that love films, TV and entertainment history needs to take a long walk down Hollywood Blvd to see the hundreds of stars. It can get really crowded during the day and doesn't feel safe at night but I still love this place. A mixture of young and old, locals and tourists, rich and poor. I like picking a good cheaper hotel within an easy walk for a great visit.",GenotheViking

50,Our family really enjoyed this neighborhood in LA,"I don't understand all the bad reviews on this area. We had only planned on spending a little bit of time here based on them, but I really wish we would have planned for more. We enjoyed the touristy fun of The Walk of Fame the most and could have spent half a day if we had the time. Our boys loved seeing all the people in and out of costume. There are lots of shops and restaurants. Some of the areas looked like they might be sketchy, but you'll have that lots of places. Just use your common sense and enjoy the craziness that is Hollywood. We also enjoyed driving up into the hills and seeing beautiful views. We only got to experience a touch of it but would definitely come back if near here.",Shawni_and_Buck
10,Not what I was expecting,"Someone says Hollywood/ Walk of Fame and you think glitter and glamour or at the very least something nice! Nope!! This place is so Dirty and Sketchy and full of people walking around high as a kite seeing things that you could never imagine. There are people hustling their CDs and DVDs on the streets and get angry when you do not purchase them for a ""generous donation"". There are so many people from all walk of life here. It was nice to see the Walk of fame and the Egyptian theatre but other than that it was a Dump! I am glad I got to see it, but I will never go back. It is sad to know that the community there is alright with the way things are ran! Some people love it but we were not comfortable being there at all.",Felicia C

The main reason why I am writing about Hollywood is so that tourists understand that Hollywood is only a very small part of L.A. and except for Paramount Pictures there are no major movie studios in Hollywood. It is worth a short drive on Hollywood Blvd. by Highland Avenue as you head to the L.A. Observatory you can pass by the Dolby Theater where the Oscars are held & the historic Chinese & Egyptian Movie Theaters adjacent to the Walk of Fame, but don't expect to spend much time within Hollywood.

Must things you should do: Walk the entire Hollywood walk of Fame, dine at Musso & Franks (skip the Pig nWhistle) see a movie at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the side streets tell a story that others miss but thats what Hollywoods all about.

Lots of costumed people ready to get their picture taken with you - and sellers of tourist rides to see stars' homes. Lots of crosswalks and cross-dressers and couples and kids - you name it.

Check out the museum of death if you're after something a little dark. Eat and drink at the Roosevelt poolside where Marilyn Monroe used to reside if you're after some classy Hollywood history. Check out a bar called ""no vacancy"" which is very close to the blvd for a completely different drinking experience. Shop at Hollywood & Highland, they have a massive Sephora and Victoria's Secret.

However, when you are in Hollywood it is mainly souvenir shops, most of them with the same things. Of course there is the Chinese Theater which everyone needs to see as well as the Dolby Theater ( we took a tour there several years ago, which was pretty neat) and the Jimmy Kimmel studio. There are people dressed up as different characters, which really get on your nerves - and there are others who are trying to get you to take some kind of tour - almost like timeshare people in Vegas. The best thing about Hollywood is the Walk of Fame - it is neat to see the stars of your favorite musicians and actors. With that being said, if you come to LA, you have to at least spend a couple of hours here checking it out.",Tonya

20,Very run down,"Hollywood has been taken over by the homeless, and they live inside piles of rubbish along the street. We had a very scary encounter with a particularly crazy guy who we only escaped from by ducking into a store with security. You can't walk along Hollywood Boulevard without being constantly harassed by aggressive rap CD and tour sellers. The CD sellers basically push a CD into your hand then demand money for it. I did end up paying about $4 for one they wanted $25 for, and when I listened to it its actually not bad. Don't put it in your laptop though. Hollywood is probably nowhere near as dangerous as it first seems, but still it would have been nice to see at least some police presence since this is supposed to be a tourist attraction. As for the town, it must have been a beautiful place once but its all been knocked down and ugly post-war commercial buildings erected, half of which now seem derelict. Its good to visit the movie stars hand prints and the Chinese Theater, but a couple of hours is plenty, best not to stay here like we did. Not at all how we imagined it.

I was walking on Highland just off of Hollywood Blvd. to one of my destinations when a rat ran on the sidewalk in front of me for several feet until it ran under a fence. Also, the area just a block or two from Hollywood Blvd is not the nicest. I was walking down one street and turned around and went back as I didn't like what I was seeing ahead of me. If you must visit this area be cautious and stay on the main traveled streets, especially at night.",OnTheRoadAgain1056
40,"It's a sight to behold, that's for sure","Hollywood is interesting in many different ways. Hollywood Blvd itself is a bit seedy, cheesy and pretty dirty. It's teeming with ""characters"" such as Elmo, Spongebob and Spiderman who are really out jockeying for cash from tourists. It's definitely a bustling tourist trap. I think you have to see it once for yourself though. It's like a car accident. You can't help but stare.",MrsW93
50,Great place to visit for culture & local people,"Third visit this year always exciting & interesting as usual with so much to visit/see. Local people pleasant/helpful & when i return each year to same food places staff remember you which is great. Shame to see so many homeless in such a rich, glitzy area, they are usually polite/not hassle, often with sad stories. Great scenery especially in H Hills/ R. Caynon. Local police helpful & friendly.",M J
30,Hard to get close!!,The residents have won their battle which now makes it hard to get close to the famous sign! There are plenty of photo ops like at the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Gower street in Hollywood.,Props555
30,Quick drive around,"We wanted to check it off the list so did a quick drive through Hollywood. It's not that impressive, kind of dirty on the streets, too many homeless about, run down buildings. Sure didn't feel like stopping for too long nor having a meal out here. If you want to check it off your list of things to see because of what it represents from tv, drive around, otherwise, you can give it a pass and visit some more interesting places around LA.",Usia2014
50,A view from afar.,"Only saw this as part of an open top bus tour , its just another tick on the list of things you do in Los Angeles. Over-rated in my view",loretta22013
50,wooden,"We went a few year ago and we found it a bit unexciting. Shopping was bad as my husband and I were not a size 0 but I did find something to wear, a scalf and I still have it. The only good thing was when I met little Richards. He lived in the hotel we stayed at.for the younger people out there he was a singer in the 60s. LA maybe for you but it depends on what you want.",Lynn C
40,Massively regenerated area - was worth a quick stop,"We were last here 16 years ago - a hell of a lot has changed. It is much more geared toward tourism proper, now - and people seemed to like it. Very busy; a lot of the expected tourist trimmings - worth a little visit, perhaps, just a drive-through, even. We didn't stay long - 30 minutes was all we needed.",Harrison F. Carter
40,Worth the drive,If you are in L.A this is must visit .It is also perfect for running in the area and of course the most iconic Hollywood sign must to check this out .Keep yourself hydrated with the hot nice weather,Eric D
30,Must See Attraction,"Once again, another attraction that you just have to say you've seen for yourself in person if you're a movie fan at all. The legendary Hollywood sign up in the hills has been in countless movies, TV shows and Documentaries. More of a vibe once you're there than anything else. If you're out in LA and want to do some sight seeing there's plenty to see in a relatively small area that you'll enjoy. The Hollywood area continues to degrade up and down the strip. Plenty of homeless, street people and beggars. Keep to yourself and just be aware of your surroundings and you'll be ok. Usually lots of tourists around so safety in numbers many times. However, worth going to see for sure.",Roy W
30,Where was all the glitz and glamour!?,"We stopped at Hollywood for a photo-walk right around the back of the area where you go to photo the Hollywood sign-much better. The stars on the pavements were interesting, as was the Chinese Theatre. A little too much for my liking, tho' a good experience. Enjoy it for what it's worth!",Christy_Luv2
40,ok,"went in when on hop on hop of bus been befor not inproved bit scruffy not as you see on T V, but if not been go and have look just to say been their",doreen R
30,Run down and grubby,"We visited here last month, we found the whole area to be run down and grubby. We weren't surprised when our tour guide drove through this area, rather than stopped. The history of some of the locations was fantastic, although the state of the buildings, rubbish and the constant presence of homeless people put us right of.I'm sure the LA council and local authorities can make more of this area, clean it up and improve things for locals and visitors alike.",ScampinIzzy
50,So much entertainment,I love Hollywood blvd from the characters to the street acts. The food stand and the attractions you can make a whole day of just being on Hollywood Blvd.,livelife h
30,A bit of a run down area - quite disappointing,"We did not devote much time to this area as it was in such a run down and poor area of the city, not really worth the detour!",G_EvansWales
50,Hollywood Sign,"I was on a Rasta Bus tour for the day and we visited the Hollywood sign which i enjoyed, very busy though. I took photos from the Observatory, lovely views.",zoukla s
50,nice entire experience,The best part of our usa tour. Because the most iconic attractions are here. We took picture of sign from lots of points. City is more peacefull when compared to New York. Hollywood is a must see city i USA.,Semih A
20,Hollywood,"Hollywood was the worst place I visited in the USA and areas of it are just seedy and dirty, Sunset Strip / Sunset Boulevard is awful. The iconic sights such as the sign, Walk of Fame, TCL Chinese Theatre are underwhelming and so overcrowded to enjoy any experience. I would not bother visiting this area again, we had a hop on hop off tour and didn't bother with one of the routes, couldn't wait to leave.",MakingMemories
50,great trip,I went to Los Angels in June. I found it one of the most amazing places. I would do the trip over again in a heart beat. I was a step away from Hollywood blvd and there were a lot of things to do down there as well. The tour place was super close. It is called Starline Tours. I went to Universal studios but i found that there was not a lot of rides to go on maybe thats just me. I would recommend to try it out for yourself if you have not been. I liked DisneyLand better in Anaheim. I also went to Santa Monica and the famous pier and it was absolutely stunning the water so warm and so nice I want to live there hahaha. I love California and would go back hope you all enjoy your own experiences there.,Matthew C
30,Fun in places,"Parts of the Hollywood Boulevard, especially away from the main areas like Chinese Theatre, are like a glitzy Blackpool. Lots of tacky souvenir shops. Chinese Theatre was great to visit, and this has the signed palm prints in the front of the building, lots of photo opportunities. Bit disappointed in parts due to tacky shops around.",Caroline O
40,THE SIGN SAYS IT ALL!!!,"You see the signs in movies all the time so get up close and personal because you are seeing it with your own eyes. My husband is in LA on a project and I am from the Mid-west, but he drove me around Hollywood in style from Rodeo Drive to the Hollywood Hall of Fame with the Stars, it was like we were in a movie. You don't even have to get out and we were driving around Hollywood on Saturday night. We even went up and saw a few nice homes.",JayWalk7
20,Awful,"We stayed in an air b& b on Hollywood boulevard. All the attractions, Chinese theatre, walk of fame were all fab and a must see. But unfortunately the actual place is full of homeless people with mental health issues. They were everywhere, really scary and intimidating. You would also see drug taking with needles! Awful. My advice - just visit for the day.",Samantha T
30,"Just another overpriced, dirty city","We were massively unimpressed with everything. The place is just a big, dirty city with overpriced shops and restaurants and is so buy, you can't see the stars on the Walk of Fame properly as other people are either standing on them or it's too crowded to stop too many times. The TCL is a lot smaller than we had imagine an is the same, too many people walking over all the pavement slabs and no order to anything so difficult to see an enjoy.We were also constantly harassed by singers/rappers trying to sell their CD's and one in particular who accused me of not liking black people when I had simply smiled and said no thank you when he shoved his CD in my face. Not pleasant and they should be moved on.If you're in LA, then you have to visit as why wouldn't you, but don't plan to spend too long here as it's very frustrating getting pushed and bumped every few seconds through the shear amount of people there at the same time.",Nicole S
30,Glad we went - but won't go back,"You build up a vision of a special place you've heard of all your life and just know it won't live up to your expectations. We did the Walk Of Fame and the icons are just stars with a name, many of which have been defaced. To see Dick Van Dyke daubed with 'Penis Van Lesbian' upset me a little. Still found Elvis and The Beatles at the very start of the Walk. The hands and signatures outside the Chinese Theatre were great and were the biggest attraction. However, this was spoiled by the far too many hawkers wanting to make $10 for having your kid's photo taken with something dressed to look like some super hero or other. I was asked to pay for the 'privilege of hitting' Trump or Clinton with a hammer. For goodness sake! The selling of pirate dvds every few feet was another hassle - but just say no!Overall glad we did it. Been there done that and that's it!",Aintree9
40,Fabulous,"Even though 'Hollywood' was not quite what I expected, it is not the cleanest city, it is still Hollywood and I enjoyed every minute of it.",Sallynutz
30,Dirty and not impressive at all,"I found it very dirty, disappointing and full of weird, paranoid people. You'd expect the stars on the sidewalk to be glamorous...but it's not. The best part was seeing the Beatles and Elvis partnered together. As a place, not great.",ChrisGower1975
40,"Not what I expected, but still enjoyable","I thought it would be mostly glitz & glamour, but was surprised at how much rubbish was around on the streets. Hollywood boulevard is pretty clean, but literally walk off the street & it's a whole different story. Despite the high number of homeless (& the stigma), they were quite passive & don't seem to bother anyone. It was amazing to see how many locals would buy food for them or take them inside for a coffee (faith in humanity restored). Easy to get around on foot or there's always the Metro (train), which is not only pretty cheap but there are attendants to help you get your tickets & Tap Card. Food is pretty ordinary & cost of everyday items too. Toilets are only accessible to paying 'guests' of a business, so no public toilets, seating & limited rubbish bins, so go prepared!",Amanda M
10,Dont Bother,"To get there the traffic is so bad pretty much all the time it is awful.There is crime everywhere, police undercover roping in Johns looking for sex, dirty everything, horrible service at most places and it is just not a good place to visit.",Peter G
40,Hollywood! Iconic area of LA!,We were staying in Hollywood for the 2nd part of our trip to Los Angeles. This was an amazing trip and we had a blast. Hollywood itself is fun and neat but it is a bit seedy. There are a lot of questionable people around. So just be careful.The Hollywood walk of fame is really neat. The handprints inside of the Chinese Theater were my favorites. Make sure you check them out!,dazyabbey
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,I love walking through The hollywood walk of fame and the wax museum. This time I went in September it was a bittersweet trip. As I was strolling through the walk of fame I wanted to stop by and pay tribute and respect to my favorite singer/composer Juan Gabriel. Gone to soon. But was blessed to have gone to see his star in Hollywood.,Maria B
50,We found it by accident by starting out to Griffith observatory and taking a wrong turn.,"You have to see it at least once, but finding it can be difficult. We found it by heading toward Griffith observatory and then saw it and took residential streets until we found a great view.",Carol D
40,Hollywood,"We spent one day of our Vacation hitting Hollywood-a must if you have never been. My teenager had not and he was fascinated and loved every second. Did the walk of fame, Hollywood Blvd, Vine St, Sunset Blvd, rode along Mullholland Drive, continued to Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, Melrose Ave and many smaller streets where the rich and famous live. Tons of people trying to sell you things you don't need or want but the area is definitely worth a few days if you have never been.",Wilburman
50,Nasty ... But Compelling,"OK, it is not the cleanest part of town, but if you are into people watching, and hordes of tourists, this is the place to be. The Walk of Fame, the cool architecture, the crazy people ... worth a visit!",mshapiro99
30,Cannot see it at night,I coudn't see the sign during nigh time because it is not illuminated at all. It should be lighted!!!,Mab0828
40,The known place for LA,Where else not to be missed when in LA. Check out Hollywood - walk of fame near the buildings nearby. The visitor center is nearby too that can provide very good information too.,joanadventure
30,Classic Sign,"Just a sign up in the Mountain/Hills that you can see from the street. Nothing too big or something to get excited about. However, a must see while there (just to say as others, that you were there) smiling",WorldWidePlayer
30,Just a city,I was so excited to get to go to Hollywood for the first time but its nothing like i expected! i was expecting a beautiful city!!! but its very dirty there! other then that its pretty cool! Hollywood Blvd was awesome!!! Seeing the stars was cool and while on my trip we saw TJ Thynes from the TV series Bones and Gabriel Iglesias Friend Machete,Isa F
30,Hollywood the Time Squre of California,"A very interesting location, lots to see. Lots of history and things to do. I enjoy Hollywood Blvd, with lots of tourist traps, that are very unique. I liked the 2nd floor of the Roosevelt Hotel, they have a dedicated area to the history of Hollywood- very interesting and free",M2He
40,nice view from mullholland drive,"go at the parking lot at the top of mullholland drive adn watch the city and the hollywood sign. many tours go there, as a-list tours. a highlite of my trip in LA",Alys D
40,The pavements of Hollywood are not paved with gold,"The pavements of Hollywood are not paved with gold but with a lot of homeless people that live on the streets, actually going to the toilet in the middle of you in the middle of the day which we found disgusting. With homeless home made tent camps perched on the main road embankments.The theatre from where the Oscars take place is in the middle of a very basic main street, and looks nothing from the front, but very nice when you actually go up the staircase into the theatre.You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance from the main strip.We made our own way to the Hollywood sign. We walked from the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Hollywood along the main street to Beachwood drive, then walked up the dirt track trail to get some pretty cool pictures, much closer than the LA tours tour that we also took offered. But it did take a hour and a half walking each way, so take plenty of water.The local history of how Hollywood , before we when to Hollywood we discovered that one of the founders of Hollywood actually came from where we live,( West Stanley, co. Durham. England).That is where the Horsley brother's came from to establish the ""Centaur film company"", which was the first film studio in Hollywood.Also on a different topic, Hillary Rodham Clinton's great grandparents also came fromOxhill Stanley, Co. Durham, which is also the same town.Hollywood was a very busy place and took ages to drive in and out of the main area it was always gridlocked.It was supposed to be a 30 minute drive from the airport to downtown Hollywood but actually took us a hour,costing us $90 at 5pm rush hour.The pubs and restaurants charge a service charge of 16%- 25%. automaticallyy put onto your bill.",SUSAN H
40,A sign that is an absolute must!,"Perhaps the strangest review I have ever written - it is about a sign and you don't need to get that close to enjoy it. We saw it three times - from Griffith Park, which we would highly recommend, from Hollywood and Highland shopping mall and driving the freeway to Universal Studios. It is a backdrop to an area, and to a culture - to see it is to see something you've seen before so many times on screen, yet to do so in the flesh is really truly much more.",Stenvoid
50,It's Hollywood,Recently some friends from out of the USA came to visit. Hollywood was one of ourplaces of interest to visit. No problem finding street parking on a side street. Walking on Hollywood Blvd. we saw many tourist spots. It was worth the visit. Hollywood has changed over the last few years. The businesses are there for tourists.,michaelsF8241KC
50,Very Unique,This place has so much diversity. You never know what you'll see and thats what makes it so great. Its definitely a place that everyone should see atleast once. Park and walk.,travelnmom31
30,you got to see it at least once,we stopped to see the sign from the mall on hollywood and highland on the 3rd floor of the mall. We could see the sign but it was further away than we thought. At least we got to see it and check that off the list.,MAJDR J
30,"Crowded, crowded, crowded!","The Walk of Fame with the stars in the sidewalk is unbelievably crowded, especially at night. Impossible to walk on the sidewalk so had to venture into the street frequently. The orientation of the stars flip flops from one to the next so it's hard to see half of the names as you're walking. People abruptly stop to take pictures and you have to dodge around. Lots of seedy characters giving coupons and CDs away",gkras
20,Holywood,"Not a fan of Hollywood or LA. Very seedy area, crowded and way to much traffic. Very surprised at how small the area around the Grauman's Theater was. Very difficult to look at the handprints etc. Would not go back to LA again.",JAT109
30,Bit of a disappointment - like Croydon High Street with stars,"We went on a day trip to Hollywood and found it a bit hit and miss. The Walk of Fame was a huge disappointment. There was no glitz and glamour and the area was generally seedy and full of homeless people.The stars were interesting but to sum it up, we found Marilyn Monroe's star outside MacDonalds. It was difficult to see a lot of the stars due to the volume of people and in the end we just gave up.The forecourt of the Chinese Theatre was better. Whilst busy, it had more of a feel to it as the famous names had provided something more personal, be it a comment, hand or footprint.We saw the sign from a distance and it was good to see it - unsure what it was like close up.To get to the Oscar Ceremony hall, we had to go through a shopping precinct - again the glamour of the occasion was reduced to everyday life and overall, Hollywood lacked the glamour and star quality we were expecting.",Joanne A
50,"Lots of shops and so many ""Stars"" on the sidewalks","You can walk along Hollywood Blvd. and see so many ""Stars"" and even Hand and feet prints in front of the Chinese Theater. Lots of shops and Jimmy Kimmel Live Studio is along there. You can spend a lot of time there.",Diana G
20,I thought I'd found glamour,"Decadent neighboord. WeHo is better.Dangerous surroundings, homeless dealing with drugs selleres...i didn't like at all, my expectations was surprinsinly bad when i finally met the place i always dreamt to go. But the sign is iconic :)",Jesus A
50,Something to tick off your bucket list,"Its something you have to do when your in the area!! you can get some good trips including this and various other things such as the walk of fame, film locations, and shopping day where you can pretend your in pretty woman.You need to get those iconic photos!",LJPAJF
30,More glamourous in the movies,It is nothing more than a narrow walkway with the pink stars on the floor. One has to see it but given the hype around it you would expect much more than waht it really is.,Tanmouss
20,All that Glitters is Not Gold...,"Disappointing and a little scary. My 13 year old LOVES movies, and was really looking forward to seeing ""Hollywood."" Unfortunately, what he saw there actually frightened him: dirty, seedy, unbelievably crowded, and lots of homeless people. Pot smoking was pretty prevalent. We took a tour and the guide said that before the Oscars each year, they close the street in front of the Chinese Theatre to clean it up and make it look nice for the cameras. We didn't even try the Walk of Fame...just wanted to leave.",BelleBHouston_Texas
20,"Unless you have tickets for the Pantages, I suggest you skip it.","If the traffic and lack of parking doesn't do you in, the dirty streets are a real bummer. Some new shopping centers and Melrose shops, for the brave, but so many other places to see in LA! I'd skip it!",grammy723
10,Famous Sign,Sadly very disappointed that the nearest and best view of this sign (except when travelling around the city) is from a shopping mall balcony!,Susan W

40,Better than expected.,We stayed in the Motel 6 which was a very good location. We walked a lot and never had any problems. Great people watching. No good way to pick a restaurant. Use the Metro to visit other spots.,CFred733
50,yes we finally found it!!!!,We went to the Griffith observatory in order to manage to make pictures of the Hollywood sign. It was a must!,grillonLausanne
20,Disappointing,"We went to the Walk of Fame and there were so many homeless people, people proclaiming their beliefs, musicians, etc.... and overpriced souvenir shops. The strip is so crowded with unnecessary people that it was too hard to see the names on the stars. Very disappointed!",mnovak
30,Nice photo from the Frank Lloyd Wright Property across the way,"Went to see the FLW house and across is the Hollywood sign. Got some great photos. Lots of people were taking photos. Have previously driven closer, but it wasn't fun. Admiring from afar is the way to go.",LAtoEverywhere
40,Have to see it,I guess me like everyone else see it on the screen and when you are in US you just have to go to Hollywood.,DWgoldengrove
40,"Been there, done that","Holywood is a must-see place if you are in the L.A. area, but it's not jaw-droping. Walk of fame is nice, but not in the most attractive area of the city. Holywood Hills and Beverly Hills has an impressive number of million dollar houses. Traffic is an issue and might get on your nervs.",Cassidy
40,Longer hike than expected,To hike and reach the Hollywood sign you have to leave your car quite far away from the path. It´d be also a good idea to arrive early as there is no parking lot and you have to park on a street which is super crowded.Unfortunately I didn´t make it up to the sign as it started to rain. The view from the hill is pretty nice though. The entrance is free of charge.,Julia W
40,"Iconic, but use your telephoto lens and skip the hike","You feel like you have to go get a picture of the sign when you visit, but it is a a long hike and private property abounds as you get near. Take a hike on the great trails in Griffith Park and you'l get plenty of good views.",AggieJoe79
30,First time you are smitten,"First time it is well worth the experience. It is one of those things you have the feeling you see only on tv. After a while reality sets in and it is ""just"" another place. Still worth a visit.",PFC15
50,More than Hollywood Blvd,"The review is as much about how you define it as anything else. There is a review for Hollywood Blvd so this review is more about the rest of Hollywood which we visited on our tour. The area gets its name from a subdivision the rest under Mt. Hollywood in Griffith park. In order to promote the subdivision the developer erected a sing on an adjacent mountain ""Hollywoodland"". Visiting this neighborhood was one of the best parts of our tour. Not only do you get a great view of the sign but the neighborhood in its cottage style homes on the side of a hill we enjoyable to drive through. The neighborhood had a gate and a house for the real estate company that can still be seen today. In addition, everything starts from the mountain that bears its name which offers great views of the city as well. In addition you have the reservoir, the theaters and the entire neighborhood around it but don't forget the mountain and neighborhood that started it all.",Grover R

Hollywood is a very cool place to have visited. Some spots are very recognizable. But remember, a lot of Hollywood spots are very touristy and don’t just go for the Walk of Fame, because in that case… you will be disappointed.",Ben_1985_02
30,Ok place,Visited with friends and wasn't too impressed. Very busy and filled with tourists but that is to be expected.,Littlelucytravels
50,fantastic place to visit,we did a tour of Hollywood and Beverly hills with a tour company called Legends of Hollywood tours and it was one of the best professional tours we have ever done. We toured the whole Hollywood area and were shown where films and music were and still are made. The stars past and present houses and the famous Hollywood sign a must for pictures fantastic once in a lifetime visit would highly recommend it,ronnie D
40,Good to get closer to once but another icon that gets too busy,"We were driving around the canyons winding our way to a closer view of the sign. Stopped in the middle of the road is a taxi with a couple who have hopped out and positioned themselves to have a photo taken where it looks like they are holding up the sign. This is what seeing this sign means to some- at any cost to disobeying laws, holding traffic up and putting themselves in danger just to get themselves in a shot with the Hollywood sign ! Because we had our own car we could drive as close as possible. The view of the sign from the Observatory was Ok, from roads closer was better and not so crowded.",AucklandWiz

I will never go there again.",Tom W
30,Not as Glamorous as on TV,"Yeah, I know. It is heartbreaking to know the fantasy of TV is not reality. It is still nice to see all the same to say you have been there and get your picture of that Hollywood sign. The neighborhoods vary wildly depending on which road you're on.",runaway2travel
50,Trip of a lifetime,"We did a Hollywood/Beverly Hill's tour which was awesome and highly recommended! It was the best way for us to see some of the must see places! we were only there for 2 days and one day was spent at the Warner Bros studios - I would have loved to have spent more time here! and when I go back I'll definitely book longer as there's so much to do/see. We loved the walk of fame - There were so many food places, shops, street entertainers. It was like Covent Garden in London but 10000 times better! We went in January and the weather was lovely - kind of Like warm a spring in England. I want to go back!! planning my next trip now!",Iamwoodlepops
40,Center of entertainment highlights,"LA is quite possibly one of the largest cities I have been to. From Santa Monica at the coast, Hollywood to the east and Beverly Hills in the middle, there is so much to do and it takes a while due to traffic. You could spend a week in Hollywood and not see everything, so plan your trip in advance and try and stay somewhere in the middle. The Walk of Fame, Chinese Theater, souvenir stores, studio tours or atmosphere, there is so much to do. It's safe to visit and a must, even if only for a stroll down the Walk of Fame.",Andrew S
50,Exciting,A must see place. You never know who you will meet here. Look out for those popular celebrities. Plenty of shops to buy those last minute gifts.,Kay S
30,City streets...,"Everyone who comes to visit me wants me to take them to Hollywood. I do, but they are always shocked that it is just regular city streets with attractions tucked in here and there. There is massive traffic getting in, out and around and there are parking problems. For instance, you can't just pull up in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater but parking to this historical landmark is located in the Hollywood & Highland mall and the first 2 hours are free. A little research will go a long way to make your trip a pleasure instead of a nightmare. Be sure to use a map, don't just rely on GPS, figure out parking for each attraction you want to see, find out costs (it is the big city and some costs can be very surprising if you are from out of town), expect crowds and in the summer ""city style"" heat that reflects off the concrete. There are often long lines during peak season, and expensive prices/waits at the area's restaurants. If you have kids in tow I would memorize where you can go to the bathroom as many businesses there only allow you to use the facilities if you are a customer. Bring your own water and nibbles, especially if you have kids with you. Many of the organized tours are well worth the money as they take care of all the details and hit all the highlights. For the best experience stay at one of the local hotels and walk (like the Hilton Garden Inn on Highland.) Last but not least...understand you will not see any stars walking around or in the restaurants in Hollywood like in the days of Hollywood Glamour...you have to go to Beverly Hills these days for that.",PJ F
40,What can you say? It's Hollywood!,"We managed to drive closer to the Hollywood sign this time by going further along Mullholland drive. There is parking on a hill, close to the dog park and then you can walk to the very top of the hill to take photo's. The area does have parking guards to stop people parking in undesignated spaces.",SheilaM70
40,Hollywood Fun,Walking up and down Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame was so much fun. The first time I went was on a Sunday evening and the streets were packed. I went again on a weeknight and it wasn't as bad. It's hard to find street parking but there are lots that charge flat rates (around $8). I found it easiest to take the metro into the area. I can't wait to go back!,ufgirl76
30,"A must-stop, worth a quick trip","Hollywood is fun for all the reasons people think. There is the Walk of Fame, the Chinese Theater and views of the Hollywood sign.There are people in costumes who pose for photos with tourists and there is plenty of shopping to couple with the fun attractions.However, it's crowded and chaotic, which can add to the fun for some, not so much for others.I always enjoy my stops in Hollywood. It's fun to make a quick trip down the Walk of Fame, but visiting once or twice was more than enough for me.",Mason7127
30,1-5: Depends what you consider Hollywood,"In reverse order:5 stars. Driving the foothills, vantage points of LA (on a clear day), Griffith Observatory, basically all of the things you can do near the ""Hollywood"" sign. These are scenic, clean, interesting, safe, and memorable.3-4 stars. Reputable tours, exploring the history of the area, studio development, current studios, and selective restaurants. There are 5 star elements to all of these, but you'll have to carefully avoid the tourist traps and unsafe/disreputable businesses.1-2 stars. (Repost of my Sunset Blvd review). I've taken family and friends here many times. This is not what you think it should/could be. It's dirty, rundown, unsafe, smelly, unpatrolled(!!!), and you won't see a single movie star unless you happen to be there during a movie kickoff event. Otherwise, it's just a tourist trap overrun by a concentration of the worst elements of society. You'll get hounded by vagrants, panhandlers, filthy superheroes, fake ""musicians"" selling blank CDs, and countless tour bus sales people...all while enjoying the environment of urine odors/stains and third rate shops and restaurants. So if you're really intent on seeing some sidewalk stars, you're at least now armed with my precautions. The city has failed to make this what it was intended to be. It's well overdue for a cleanup, some proper licensing requirements, and enforceable standards that remain enforced by a continuous police presence. If LA wanted to make it fun and clean, they'd dress the enforcers in movie attire with LAPD arm bands: cowboy sheriffs, storm troopers, ""mall cop"" on segue, etc.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"

30,Fun but very crowded,"In a recent trip to LA, we of course had to drive through Hollywood to see the tourist sites...but they were very difficult to access because the traffic was extremely bad.

40,Hollywood is NOT LA..,"Yup...There is a lot more to LA than Hollywood alone. But it is Hollywood that brings in the glamour quotient of the city. The issue is, glamour is equal to the celebrities. And when you are roaming the streets of Hollywood boulevard etc, you are not going to bump into any...hence, don't get your hopes up. It's just another neighbourhood in any other city of the world.But landmarks like the TCL Chinese theatre, Jimmy Kinmel live , Disney theatre etc make for a good viewing. So is the walk of fame...apart from that, it's an individual choice of what one likes.And yes...do get a good shot of the Hollywood sign from one of the vantage points.",BhawaniPathania
30,Good but not great,"Being that you are going to be visiting a known art area, there are areas that you don't even feel safe. Not to mention that there are parts that smell like a dirty bathroom.

30,Hollywood,Hmm very different experience than expected. We stayed on sunset boulevard and walked to Hollywood boulevard omg we took the wrong turn and came across crack heads. The actual Hollywood boulevard needs cleaning up and some money paying into the strip as it's very gloomy. We did a tour of Hollywood and beverlley hills which wasn't bad but don't expect to see the actual houses of the famous.I can say I have been but wouldn't go back.,Sara L

30,visit at least once,"Many shops selling souvenirs, clothing, tattoos shops and bars. Amoeba music as well.

And yes they all ask for money or have a sign asking for help.",Renee Conlan
30,Seeing Hollywood Blvd once is enough.,"We were surprised at how dirty and run down this area is. The Chinese theater was particularly disappointing, maybe even more so because it was fenced off for some sort of red carpet event that was going to take place on the day we were there. The best part of this stroll down Hollywood Blvd. were the interesting characters we saw. I think I saw three different Spider men, a very good portrayal of Captain Jack Black and an exceptional portrayal of the Wolverine. I truly despised the people hawking cds on every corner. They were very rude, to the point of actually hitting my body with them, trying to make me take one.",Dale J
30,Magical... in its own way,"Everybody goes to hollywood... it's a must! It's beautiful in its own Times Square-like, eclectic way.

20,You can skip Hollywood's Walk of Sleaze,"This is an iconic place, no doubt. But it is also run down, dirty, full of homeless sleeping on the streets, panhandlers, and bums. There are a few things to see on foot, like the names of all the stars, past and present on the Walk of Fame, the Chinese Theater, and a few others. But you can get the idea just as well in your car.

40,A must for film lovers,A great area with lots of people watching to do. You must see the hand and footprints of the famous at the Chinese Theatre. The Walk of Stars goes on for ages but worth seeing once. Lots of souvenir shops and cafes. Don't have your photo taken with the dressed up characters as they will expect some money. Also standing around are wanna be singers who try to put their CDs in your hand and expect you to pay for it. The famous house trips are interesting and fun in the open topped minibus but beware of getting sunburned! Beware of the taxis at the side of the road- most are ok but they don't speak English well and we had one driver throw us out the cab because he couldn't understand where we wanted to go!! A bit scaryfor me and my daughter! Overall a must for any visitor to the area.,elinorheasman

30,A lot smaller and less glamorous than you think it will be,"Walking around Hollywood was OK, the walk of fame and Chinese theater were fun enough but it doesn't take too long to have seen enough. Everything was a lot less glamorous than we've always been led to believe and everything is much smaller then you think it's going to be. The museums are kind of cheesy and if you're traveling with children be aware there are a lot of head shops and adult boutiques. Other nearby neighborhoods are very nice and the Hollywood Hills, Hollywood sign hike and other attractions in the Los Angeles area are all worthwhile.",StevefromExeter
20,A city of contrasts. Wrong priorities I didn't enjoy.,"Dirty streets with a saddening amount of homeless people in a miserable state.

30,Hollywood is Branson on steroids,"Well, at least I can cross that off the list of places to see. It was like visiting a shrine to narcissism. There were a lot of people just walking up and down the street, gawking at people who were dressed up to try and make a buck. Got hassled a lot by people trying to ""give"" you (for 6 dollars) their music CDs. It was crowded, noisy, and a lot less fun than I had hoped. My advice is to skip this and head for the beach.",Indytraveller1234

40,Very Lively Tourist Centre,We wandered around and about Hollywood Boulevard looking at all the tours and trips on offer. We found that it was like a circus watching the touts and the other tourists all angling for a bit of space and time. The sign is best viewed from the Dolby Theatre complex. There are heaps of souvenir shops at ridiculous high prices. Love visiting Graumann's Theatre and also viewing the stars in the sidewalk as we walked. Lots of small coffee shops and snack bars to watch the world go by.,AntarcticBound

Walk of stars is packed and between the homeless panhandlers and the dressed up characters want you to pay for a picture with them it is hard to really get a look at the individual stars on the walk.",fmattship
40,Fun and frustration.,"When I was a young woman, I lived and worked in Hollywood at the Paramount Pictures studios. No, not as a hopeful starlet. A more mundane office worker. But there are a lot of places to go. For me, Hollywood was a great place for young people to have fun. There are wonderful antique stores and great places to eat. Lf you were looking for a job in acting, it was starve, starve, starve...get a role...starve, starve, sta rve. For those ifew, it was worth it, but for the most part, it was heartache, for most of those who went there to become famous just got heartbreak. For the rest of us, nightlight was always a new place to go, unless you got a favorite spot. But when I became a mother, I moved a way.",Manay
50,Love it!,"The walk from the parking is about 3 miles there and 3 miles back, so around 3 hours to do the whole trip. So bring sun cream and water!As it is up hill the walk is quite hard especially for younger children. However you will get the best view of the city from up here. The sign itself is cool and you can get close-ish. There will be a sign saying do not cross at the end of the walk but cross it because you get a better picture!If you are going to walk this, do it in the morning so by the time your done the weather is just getting hot, so its cooler to walk!",Isaac H

20,Overcrowded Tourist Trap,Hollywood is okay for first time LA visitors. I personally did not like it. The boulevard area was so crowded during the day. The night life in the area was not all that either. It was okay. They have some cool bars along the boulevard and nice pizza places to grab a bite. Maybe I was not in the right area but I would say save time and hangout in West Hollywood where there are more things to do at night.,Diane H
30,So far,"Access to the best view of the sign is difficult. Parking space is limited. Those who cant park at the observatory will parks along the streets.

20,A faded prima-donna screaming for attention.,"Sadly, Hollywood seems to have lost all the golden sequins from it's dress.I'm not really into following the lifestyles of the rich and the famous but as we were in L.A. we figured we may as well take a look and we were extremely shocked by what we found.The whole area is rundown and very poorly maintained. For such a popular tourist destination and supposed playground of the stars the place hadn't seen much love. The streets looked filthy, everything was flooded with the gaudy and tacky and there were many beggars and those looking to take unsuspecting tourists for a ride. Honestly, the streets and facades are nothing like what we are made to believe on T.V.The walk of fame was very underwhelming and not very engaging to read. Unless you're certain there will be someone of note there unveiling a new paving slab I personally wouldn't bother. There are a few novelty shops and museums along with Madam Tussaud's but certainly nothing to really get your teeth into and rave about. I think the best views of the Hollywood sign were from the Griffith Observatory and aside from the views of pretty, maintained celebrity houses and the hope that you'll see someone famous I can't fathom what the attraction is.If you are giddy at the thought of seeing a movie star or even just standing where an idol of the movie screen once stood then you may love Hollywood, warts and all. It seems a lot do. If, like myself, you're not that way inclined you'll probably struggle with the degradation and ""non-content"" and would be better off taking a drive through or a one off bus tour and not lingering long.",Celtic Bansidhe

50,Love it!!,"Hollywood in genereal is an amazing place, and i love it like it is my home. I travel here from Melbourne Australia, and ave visited Hollywood twice now. I am likely to visit again and probably again and again.Hollywood is a friendly place and people are easy to talk with and get along with. There are plenty of places to eat in Hollywood, However the Coffees (throughout USA) are horrible, but thats probably cause we have been spoilt by living in Melbourne where the Cafe/coffees are some of the best in the world.If you do not hire a car in Hollywood, then getting around with Uber is perfect and cheap, i Advise against the Taxi services as they are expensive, rude and trick you for fairs. We caught a Taxi from the Airport to our accommodation in Melrose - this cost us $100 USD + tip, and the ride was about 1 hour and 15 minutes during the off peak time (about 11:30 pm). on the day we were to head back home to Australia, we caught a Unber from Melrose to the Airport (the same as the first day except in reverse) and this travel time was during peak hours (6:00 pm) - the Uber ride cost us $38 USD (no tip required with uber) and the travel time was around 45 minutes... so clearly the Taxi tricked us and took the long way - not to mention the service with Uber was much better and polite.Any way - so Hollywood is amazing and i love it. Be mindful though that Los Angeles has some beautiful weather during the day and T-Shirts and shorts might be perfect, however as soon as the sun sets it gets really cold!!! it doesn't rain, but the air is extremely cold - so i advise you always pack a jacket if you intend to be out all day.Enjoy and happy travels!",Simage82

Whilst it was interesting to see all the stars (and something which I have always wanted to do), I was not prepared for the surrounding environment; the number of boarded-up shops and homeless people, the incredible amount of people bombarding you with sight-seeing tours and shop after shop of tourist paraphernalia.We managed to see the Hollywood sign quite clearly from a bridge in the shopping mall near the Chinese Theatre, and the handprints/footprints outside the Chinese Theatre were great to see. I'm glad that I went as it is certainly one of these places everyone says you ""have to visit""; however, there is a less-glamorous side, and as mentioned in other reviews, be pragmatic in terms of how you carry your belongings and in considering the deals offered by the tour operators.",RockyHH25

We went on Saturday afternoon anyway and paid $20.00 for parking. When we walked down Hollywood Blvd two extremely thin heroine addicts walked by. We walked across the crosswalk to see the infamous Chinese theater and two girls in leather bikinis, police hats, and hooker boots walked by.

30,Hollywood not so Good,I'm always amazed at how crowded it is on the Hollywood Strip and how dirty it can be. The most disgusting thing is the endless deposits of black chewing gum patches that line the sidewalks and sometimes sit on and around the Star Studded Sidewalks. There is often trash in the streets and the trash cans spill over or have people picking through them. Hollywood and Vine has lost it's luster along with many other intersections along the route. This Avenue could and should be brought back to its potential as a major attraction.,Curt H

Enjoyed getting to visit the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, see the Hollywood sign and enjoy the shopping / dining in the plaza area by the Dolby Theatre. Just be aware that the Hollywood is pretty far away but this is probably your best view from this plaza area as the sign is a fenced off area and no one is allowed there.

30,Too touristy,"I remember a time when people would take pictures while standing in the middle of Beachwood Drive. The narrow, windy roads of Hollywood Hills kept the non-locals from venturing too far up into the neighborhood. I used to enjoy the peace and serenity of walking my dogs around the area. Sure, there were occasional tourists at the time, but not frequent enough to be a nuisance. Now I see tour buses and vans drive up in the once-quiet neighborhood of Hollywood hills on a daily and even hourly frequency. Yes, the sign is a landmark and picturesque. But now, we have to deal with daily tourist traffic, noise, and litter (beer bottles, fast-food waste, cigarette butts). There are many other places in Los Angeles that can accomodate such crowds. Just please leave this once peaceful neighborhood alone so that the residents can enjoy peace again.",Conrad A

30,Not as glamorous as you imagine in real life,"It is worth a visit but I mean a visit only - do not stay in this area, otherwise I think you'd be disappointed in LA. There are much better areas to stay in LA than here (Silver Lake, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood). Be warned that the boulevard itself is indeed full of peddlers either harassing you to get you on a tour or trying to sell you something and if they hand you a CD please do not take it and look at it because they will demand payment once you take hold of it. Other than that, it is interesting to see the Walk of the Stars. I found it slightly sad that you only really need to be a minor star or a star for a short time to get one. The Chinese Theater which has the cement foot and hand prints of the major stars is more worthwhile. You'll see the real iconic stars (or their foot/hand imprints and signatures) of Marilyn Munro, Gregory Peck, Shirley Temple, Warren Beatty and all the big stars. La La Land is a great souvenir shop and the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Center is good and has a great view of the Hollywood sign from the upper level walkway. If you can't get to San Francisco for your Ghiradelli Chocolates, there is a very large store along the Boulevard next to the El Capitan Theater (just across the road from Hollywood and Highland). Everything you need to see along here is within walking distance, including also the Kodak Theater where the Academy Awards are held (inside the Hollywood and Highland shopping mall).",Belgo96

Years ago I would have been afraid to walk the streets at night but not so this time. A good experience for sure. It was nice to be back.",Brother_Kurt
50,Hollywood Sign from different Vantage Points,"One of the best ways to see the Hollywood sign is by going to the Griffith Observatory and looking to your right as you're approaching it.

Rodeo Drive was worth the visit as was the wonder along Melrose Drive. Im pleased we dressed up that particular day as when we went into shops we definitely got a once over! We thought Madame Tussaud's was tacky and not worth the money. The kids loved walking along and seeing all their favourite movie stars names on the pavement along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The train station was easy to find on the Main Street in Hollywood Blvd and its a simple trip to Universal studios. We felt safe walking around during the day and even got off the beaten path to venture into some other areas on public transport.

And you never know who will come out of the corner and walk in front of you or perhaps eat a sandwich right next to you. Sadly, that didn’t happen, but just the fact that it could is a good feeling.

30,Very Touristy,"We live close (close if you don't hit traffic) to Hollywood. We took a group of teenage girls up today to walk along Hollywood Boulevard, see the Walk of Stars and have lunch. I have to say that it was very touristy. Although it's great for people watching; especially all the various sized men in Spider Man costumes. If you're coming for the first time, I highly recommend scheduling out your day with planned sites to see. We didn't go up with up with a plan in mind and had to experience a lot of traffic going there and back. Its a destination worth experiencing, but have a plan in place!",Fieldtravels

50,Hooray for Hollywood,"You can't visit LA and not go to Hollywood. The streets were dirtier and less gitzy than what I expected, but you have to see the Walk of Fame.

30,Try it once to say you have done it,"Cool to go to Hollywood once but not that exciting. Went on a city tour which we thought was average.

Not that it's a breathtaking thing to do, it's just one of these things you have to see in life.",DanielHenrysson
30,Old charm lost,Great place for movie buffs who are interested in walking and checking all movie stars on hall of fame and other interesting facts like Dolby theater your/Chinese theater along with Tussaud wax museum.Otherwise area looks run down and not maintainedLot of street hawkers and homeless people abound at every light area.Has many studios and TV sets there and did see new terminator movie premier going on.Overall needs lot of improvement to bring decent crowd to be back there .,Arun G
30,Hollywood Fun,"It is hard to write a review of Hollywood because most people have no idea what is here or have a completely wrong idea, but here it goes. ""Hollywood"" is really just Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd. as far as visiting and sight seeing goes. There are no movie studio tours there, really. You will not stumble upon celebrities. What you can do is walk along the walk-of-fame along Hollywood Blvd and shop through endless souvenir stores. You can have a great meal at the historic Musso & Frank's restaurant (have the tomato soup for sure). There's the wax museum and Ripley's believe it or not and a couple other attractions. The nicest is the Kodak Theater at the large complex in the heart at Highland and Hollywood Blvd. THAT tour is worth the visit. The metro stop is there as well which can be helpful. Over all I'd say take advantage of the Hop On Hop Off tour bus and get an over view and then go back o what looks interesting to you. It's an afternoon, maybe into the evening but not a whole days worth of fun. That's my two cents. :)",StaceyQM

40,Something to see,"Hollywood is interesting. You are almost guaranteed to see something you see all the time on tv or the movies. It's also dirty, dusty, expensive and kind of nasty.

50,Something for Everyone,"Lots to do in Hollywood but don't just get stuck at Hollywood & Highland. If you're from out of town make sure you see the Hollywood sign, there's a great hike if you have the time, Runyon Canyon is a cool sight too but you won't get as great of a shot of the Hollywood Sign. Also hit up some of the outskirts like Robertson, Beverly Hills, Hollywood & Vine, Cahuenga & Selma, Etc.There's something for everyone in Hollywood but also a lot to do outside of Hollywood so if you're staying in Hwood make sure you venture out Downtown, Studio City, Santa Monica, The Getty, Malibu, etc.",justinsena
40,A Must Do!,We went to Hollywood last week and totally forgot on how cool and trendy that part of Los Angels really is. There is so much to do there from the Walk of Fame to the Chinese Theaters as well as live entertainers all around.

CA for more than 35 years and on a recent visit to granddaughter we decided to go to HOLLYWOOD !!And Hollywood and Vine was just as I remembered it from years ago. There is actually no glamour associated with this intersection. Homeless, prostitutes, beggers and everything in between. My granddaughter said ""I'm happy to visit here but never again"". Later we went to the Pantages to see a movie.",Robert C
40,Underwhelming,You have to go to Hollywood of course but I was so underwhelmed! It was grotty and looked like a bad area of London.,ANC
30,Don't waste too much time here,"It is fun to walk around the area and see all the people. Don't waste too much time here but there is lots of people around, lots of people trying to sell stuff to you. I would recommend if you are here for a week then stop around the Chinese theatre and going for a stroll. It's a very big city with a lot of it quite crowded and run down. We did quite a bit of walking around the Hollywood area with kids and there was points when they were nervous and a bit intimated. If you stick to the big tourist areas you will be fine",JDTravelhome
30,Watch yourself and your kids,"Loved seeing the walk of fame but hard to as you get drivin crazy by the ones trying to peddle money off you for cd's and pics with people in umm ""costumes"". On way in, saw a man swearing, spitting at people etx and on way out guy was being cuffed and arrested. Theres a small mall type place on the blvd that had some nice shops to look in, but we basically saw the theater, took some pics of our favorite stars (google to find where your favorite stars are at), and left. Area is really bad run down and sadly homeless people are everywhere.",jweith

20,A must see but disappointing overall.,"A must see due to the nature of the place, but anywhere past the 'main' block with the chinese theatre is dirty and a bit run-down.",Dunks961
50,not easy to find how to approach it,The sign is 14 m high and 110 m long. It was build initially for an advertisement in 1923; and they left it there. It is one of the things to see while in LA because it has become an iconic sign.,sipivu
50,You can see this for miles,"We were on a tour and this was pointed out to us, it can be hard to spot at first, but once you know its there you see it all the time. The history of the sign was told to us, which was also interesting, iconic view.",petti120

50,It was great.,"Had a great time in Hollywood. Its a tourist trap, bout it was fun. Seeinf the hand prints and footprints of the stars and wondering how their hands & feet were so small. All the characters dressed up for a photo opt for a buck or two. All the shops and the Hollywood sign. It was great.",Carmen W
30,Compulsory tourist trophy,"This is a place that is famous for being famous. One of those things you just have to do or else your friends will wonder how you could have gone to L.A. and not visited. Much of the street is rather scummy and the rest overpopulated with touts selling tours. But you just have to walk along and look at the stars on the pavement, many of which you've never heard of. Of course, a stop at Grauman's is a must in order to look at the prints in the concrete. But overall, an hour is plenty.Tip: you can often find parking for free on the side streets once you get beyond the first 50 feet or so from Hollywood Blvd.",Lucky_Eddie
40,You Just Have To Visit,"Ok let's get it out if the way, Hollywood is a bit of a dump. However it has the walk of fame and the theater plus the Hollywood sign, which is really exciting to see for the first time. And even the second time. Advise going to the Griffith Observatory just prior to sunset to get the best view of LA. And it's free. You can hike to the sign but it's going to be hard work up steep slopes on a hot day. Try staying in Hollywood Hills using AirBnB to keep the price down, great homes up here. PS don't forget to look at the canals in Venice, most people don't know they're there.",Roadtripper64
40,Half day,I spent a half day in Hollywood walking around and checking out all of the sites. I didnt find it overly excited but my girl friend loved it. If you're looking to check it off your bucket list be sure to check it out as it is kind of cool. I suggest just starting at one end of the street and walking to the other end and then turning around.,Byron Dwyer
40,Worth checking out!,We did have a wonderful time walking around taking picture and people watching. If you go to L.A you must make it down to Hollywood. Why not? You are in L.A.! Recommend. Go by Chinese theater. Don't forget to have you camera ready for all the stars on the Walk of Fame!,Katie W
40,Definitely Improving,"I lived here when the Hollywood and Highland to the Hollywood and Vine area was a real dump full of hookers and itinerants. Even though I wonder if tourists can really enjoy the experience (Hollywood is still overrated imo), Hollywood has improved immensely thanks to the billions being invested in the area.There are now many more interesting restaurants, clubs, bars, great movie theatres (Chinese IMAX, Manns, Cinerama Dome etc.) and gyms keep popping up all over demonstrating how the resident demographics have skewed to the younger, hipper and wealthier crowd.That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. It probably deserves a 3.5 for now, but I see great improvements ahead.",what666
50,Heaving Hollywood,"The Hollywood area maybe a small part of LA but it attracts tourists like flies. I have visited here on and off for almost 20 years and although its always been crowded by people like me, tourists. In our recent visit it was heaving, from Hollywood Boulevard to some of the side streets.",PrestonGuild
30,Ermmm,Nit what it is cracked up to be to be honest. The sign is the best part and the Chinese Theater and the walk of fame. A lot of homeless people around and a loy of people pestering you to take tours.,Nikisha17

20,Meh.,"Hollywood pretty much sums up whats wrong with America! At one end you have Beverley Hills, and a few miles away poverty and Skid Row pretty much the complete opposite of the riches of Hollywood.Plenty of superhero characters dressed up to harass you, the Walk of Fame is cool but repetitive and lots of beggars too.Worth seeing to tick it off the bucket list but a big disappointment.",Tom L
30,Pfft,"No that goodBit of a dump really,all it is is a street through a poverty stricken polluted part of LA.It's full of people harassing you either to buy their CDs because no record company would look at them or beggers in the street too lazy to get a job or people trying to get you on their tour bus.Other than that yeah few stars on the side walk,gift shops, the Chinese theatre and clowns dressing up as superheroes.",Martyrior

50,Fabulous,Went with my daughters had a great time loved LA. and the sites we visited. Went onto Vagas for my daughters 21st had the best time out celebrating.Will go back again.,Jenny W
40,Has a bit of everything,Hollywood was great when we visited. There's so much choice of what to do from going up to see the Hollywood sign to madam tussauds and the Hollywood walk of fame. Its so worth a visit to get all the touristy things done. The town wasn't as clean as I thought it would be but I don't really know what I was expecting for such a busy place. Its a greatplace to take a drive around take it all in. Its easy to get to by car and easy to get anywhere from there. A must when in LA,RKB0022
50,Everything on your doorstep,"Hollywood is the heartbeat of LA as far as a tourist is concerned. If you have only one day to spend in LA, you have to spend it in Hollywood. The walk of fame, Dolby Theatre, Hollywood Hills, movie stars and their homes, the Chinese Theatre etc. etc.",TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
40,Wow.,"The ""World Famous"" ""HOLLYWOOD"" banner and the scenic mountain view can be seen nicely from here. For photograhic capture tou may require a better lens.",drplk
50,Best location in LA,"Your right in the middle of it all. You can also get around the whole city without a car from this point. I'm from LA and lived in Hollywood most of my time in LA and its definitely the best location. Tourism is great of course, but local life is awesome too. Lots of indoors and outdoors things to do, cruising the streets by foot, pretty safe also which is great. And lots of great places to eat. I recommend anyone coming to LA, MUST go to Hollywood. For sure. And surprisingly the red line starline tours (double Decker tour bus) was actually really cool and you get to see a lot of the big city very nicely and conveniently, I recommend it even as a local. Hollywood has always been my home, and always will be. Its one of the best places on earth <3",Everythinginit
50,Definitely worth a visit,"We based ourselves here when we stayed in LA. its easy to get to other places in LA such as santa monica, Beverly hills and downtown LA . we loved the atmosphere here. we had been told its a bit of a kip but I have to say I don't agree with that at all. It's spotless clean and loads of lovely places to eat and drink.Theres some high street shopping such as h&m sketchers guess etc which werent too badly priced.Great to do some celeb spotting. We also saw a movie scene beeing filmed very exciting.",BUSHMCLOVIN
50,Hollywood Classic,"Hollywood is the most fascinating place to people watch. Not just for celebrities, but just for those a little different the norm. Some of the best restaurants and coffee houses can be found here. All the tourist attractions you could ever want are right at your finger tips.",desertsunbunny
40,Good,"I guess this is an obligatory stop if you go to LA. This is a nice place, nice walk on the walk of fame. Actually i went two times, because on teh seond time is when Michael Jackson died (RIP), so I went and put a flower on his star. I went in June 2009.",anna
40,Best experience,Thanks god for travel insurance tripsafe.ca really helped me when i needed the help. its much recommended,Nidal_93
40,Brill!,"I have been before, years ago but it really is worth going to Hollywood just because it's Hollywood especially if you're from Wales where nothing is really exciting! ( I do love my country but come on!!?)We wandered around looking at the Walk of fame and just enjoying the atmosphere. It was glorious. There were mNy characters begging for photographs which my little grand daughter thought was hilarious. Make sure you see the sign, ask if you can't see it. If you go up to the top of the Shopping Mall next door to the Chinese Theatre you will see it. Taxi drivers will also point it out to you. There are some really nice drivers in Hollywood.There are numerous attractions on the street which is great. I loved it.",suitcase0810
30,"Fun, but definitely overrated","We found that mostly everything you think stretches for miles...actually only goes for about two blocks. Around Hollywood and Highland, in the evenings, there is never a dull moment. When you see everything in the light of day, you realize that the people pretending to be characters and stars that were pestering you last night, are worse than they were in the dark. After all, I've seen all of the Superman movies and never remember a fanny pack and a cell phone strapped to it being part of the outfit.On the flip side, when you leave the boulevard, you actully see a lot of beautiful buildings...but if walking, have comfortable shoes or hiking boots...the Hollywood Hills ARE NO JOKE. We were walking some, and the rest of the time driving, and there were several times that I thought we were in the mountains of NC.",jrpleasant
40,Don't spend to much time here.,"Ofcourse you have to see the sign and walk on the famous walk of fame. But otherwise Hollywood is not much to see, would rather recommend to spend more time at central LA or at venice beach.One day here is enough in my opinion.",Andreas F
30,Got to do it but...........,"it really is tacky and super busy! It is a little better than when I last visited over 20 years ago - they have built a shopping mall right opposite the theater where they record the Jimmy Kimmel Show but it is really not a place you would want to spend any amount of time. The place is packed with Japanese tourists taking photos, street artists dress as superman or some other character nagging you to pose with them and extremely tacky souvenir shops. Depressing really.",IGDM
30,Hollywood isn't as great as ppl make it to be,"This place isn't really all that great. There is trash everywhere, rude people everywhere, gum all over the floor. It just isn't what people make it out to be. Of course there are spots that are nicer, restaurants, shopping plazas, ect. But I don't think it's worth your time. I mean you can go just to be able to say that you were there but really it's not that great.",Angie M
50,A classic,A classic spot but I can't leave LA without a visit to the sign!! A must see for everyone. Most of the Hollywood tours have a stop at the sign.,Calisto77
10,A Dump,"I guess if you are huge into TV and Movies, you might get a bit more out of a visit to ""Hollywood"" than I did, but essentially what it looked like to me was a few blocks of kept up 'venue' otherwise plucked down in a sea of misery and despair similar to what any particular war zone would look like. The touristy area was - filled with tourists - ... in addition to dudes dressed up as Spiderman, Darth Vader, etc.; looking for a few quick bucks if you were gullible enough to get your pictures taken with them, along with the homeless folks too lazy to dress up as a character to try and get your money. Combine that with tour companies / reps seemingly located every 100 feet asking you to go on a tour with them; graffiti, barbed wire wrapped overhead freeway signs on the exits to the area, trash piled along side the roadways, all provided a grand welcome.We parked in the underground parking structure at Hollywood & Highland, and made it out safely without getting our vehicle broken in to unlike some others who've posted reviews of the area on the internet.Whenever this area is shown on TV for whatever awards ceremony is happening, it is made up to look like the second coming of heaven! They all need to be paid more than triple what they make, because they literally ""put lipstick on a pig"" over and over and over ... coat by coat by coat.The only good thing about our visit to Hollywood is that it is something else that can be checked off of my 'bucket list' as different places to visit across the USA.",Wahoo__bMedina
30,Less glamorous than I expected,"Positives: shopping, the culture, restaurants.Negatives: People hassling you to buy their CD.It was so cool being in Hollywood, it looks exactly like I have seen from pictures and movies.

50,Historic Hollywood Blvd.,"No where in Los Angeles disappoints visitors as much as Hollywood Blvd. Expecting to see the glamor of the movies, what they find are seedy souvenir shops, homeless people and crowds of other tourists. It's a pretty awful street -- nothing like the historic Hollywood Blvd. of my youth (now I'm dating myself) filled with bookstores, elegant shops and so on. It used to be a real neighborhood. Now it's a tacky destination. HOWEVER, if you're a visitor to Los Angeles, especially if you've come from far away, you really can't miss Hollywood. Here are THREE tips on what not to miss: (1) Chinese Grauman Theatre - yes, you've got to go for the handprint and footprints of the stars. But try to go INSIDe - go see a movie. The interior is just amazing. For that matter, Hollywood Blvd. is home to more than one Movie Palace of the golden ages. Check out El Capitan and the Egyptian as well. That will give you a sense of the glory of days gone by! (2) The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel -- the very first Academy Awards was held here! It's still a fabulous property. And it's haunted. Ask the concierge for the hand-out on the history of famous ghosts here. Have a drink or a meal and wander the public spaces. (3) Musso and Franks -- the oldest restaurant in Hollywood and it hasn't changed a lot, including (I think) the original waiters. A fabulous bar, a dining room that allows you to reminisce about the famous people who gathered here. (4) Yamashiro's -- just above Hollywood - nothing to write home about with regard to the food, but the restaurant has an interesting history and you can have a drink and look down on the rest of L.A.So, prepare to be horrified by the general appearance of the Blvd., but if you've had a drink at each of the destinations I've suggested, you'll be looking at it through rosy (and historic) glasses.",Debra K
30,Hmm.,"Well you can see the sign from this outdoor mall balcony that is crowded and try to get a picture from far away. I believe you can get closer but not sure on that so we only saw from here. But it is an icon and I can say I have been there, done that. I have to put a date so I put July 2013, but it was actually back in 2007. My inlaws live in LA so they took us there. I was really disappointed with the whole thing it never is the way TV makes it seem.",Catie I
30,famous name than it is,"It is Hollywood. Actually there is nothing to much to see around. You will walk in the basement of fames, take look at the Kodak and off course take a picture of red carpet which is always there under protection:)) There are Hollywood tours if you would like to join but I have no idea about what's included.",mustdent
30,Meh...,"We thought Hollywood and Beverly Hills were alright, but not great. Interesting stuff to see once in your life, but I have no desire to return. Crowded, tourists everywhere, no celebrities, etc. Good luck trying to get a view of the star's homes - all you will see is a gate and shrubbery.",Brad Beers
40,Gotta Do It,"If you are going to Hollywood, you might as well do it. This tacky iconic sign is not much, but it is what it is. Get a pic taken as you explore the area.",repoulin
50,I love it!!,"Hollywood is always fun and has so much history. Everywhere you go, you recognize something from TV and the movies. It's not uncommon to see a famous person jogging or shopping. I love that there are a lot of museums and so much to see. The only problem is that it's so insanely over crowded. Parking is a nightmare and even walking down the street can be difficult. Your best bet is to go on one of the Hollywood tour buses. They take you everywhere, show you the movie stars houses, all the sights, where movie stars were discovered and even where some died.They also show you where many movies and TV shows have been filmed. Sometimes if they aren't busy, the drivers will approach you and offer to take you on a cheap tour. One night my husband and I were there and a driver had an empty bus. He offered to take us for $10. It was a breezy night and the bus had no top so we were able to take clear pictures. We were also the only people on the bus so that was even better.",Gina K
10,Yuk! Was not impressed,"I can't believe I bothered making the drive to Hollywood. It was so trashy; I was unimpressed by Melrose, Hollywood sign which is blocked by houses and buildings, and the Hollywood walk of fame. Looked like an average sidewalk to me in a dirty part of town. Did not even care to get out and look at any of the stars, which is crazy cause this would normally be something I would really look forward too. Very sad and disappointing. Traffic is terrible too, definitely not worth the trip. I would've rather stayed in the OC. Was not impressed by anything in LA.",Kates_family11
50,Best Parking for Walk of Fame...Hollywood and Highlands Centre.,"This is a shopping centre...if you like that sort of thing...however it is also the best place for parking to see Hollywood Boulevard, the Walk of Fame and Graumans Chinese Theatre etc. Ignore the sites, including the Centre’s own site, that tell you the address is 6801 Hollywood Boulevard...that is the pedestrian entrance for the shops etc, and you do not want to be driving Hollywood Boulevard looking for parking. The entrance for the car park is in Highland Avenue next to the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Also, make sure you get your parking validated by one of the participating shops...we didn't, so $2 parking became $8!!",PeterandLesley2013
40,Fun place for anyone who loves TV and movies,"Anyone who is star struck will just love Hollywood. The homes are amazing to see, just to travel around and see all the architecture is fascinating. Walking around and imagining all the stars who started here seeing the walk of fame, Chinese Theatre, everything that makes up Hollywood. You can see all kinds of studios, Capitol Records, Hollywood sign, and just take it in. Lots of shops to walk in a paroose around and lots of very interesting people to boot!",Brendermac
50,You've got to do it...,"If you want to participate in the American experience, you must do this - even if you don't like it. (I did). Nothing more ""American"" than Hollywood.As a tourist, you should do a bus tour that stops at key places. Don't try and do it on your own - traffic is too bad and the locations are far apart. At a minimum - do Hollywood Bowl, Griffith Observatory, Walk of Fame, Gruman's Chineese, and Rodeo Drive as stops.Stars Home tours not worth the time (in my opinion) ...You just sit on the bus.",Lakedale1
50,A First Hand Look at behind the scenes at Hollywood,"It was an interesting visit to Hollywood several years ago & we were shown the making of BackDraft by Kurt Russel. In fact we didnt hear about this movie until this visit & we bought the VCD back home. It was an interesting movie & I didnt know what Backdarft meant until I saw this movie. We were also shown The Terminator, Raiders Of The Lost Ark & a live Show of Water World. I sat so near the stage that I got all wet when the boat made a sudden stop & splashed the water out. We were treated to 3D movie & when we wore the 3D spectacles, the insects came out so real that you wanted to touch them. Good fun experience.",carsam c
50,Fun,But I'm going around looking at the shops looking at the stars on the walk and watching the people parking sucks though unless you go to the church parking lot which is $12 all day,Barbara A

Is Hollywood","There is so much history in Hollywood and there are plenty of tourist spots worth seeing.The Hollywood Sign, Grauman's, the Walk of Fame, the Hollywood Museum, Hollywood Forever Cemetery and more.HOWEVER ...Hollywood history is all over Los Angeles.You have to include Beverly Hills, Culver City, Malibu, Burbank, Westwood and on and on.If you are planning a first time trip here, please plan carefully.You can't see Hollywood without seeing Beverly Hills and its own famous landmarks that all have links to the movies and TV.Culver City has most of the studios and Westwood has Pierce Brothers Westwood Villiage where Marilyn Monroe and others rest.Hollywood is all over L.A.Make the most of it.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
20,"Been there, done it, should have never bothered to go back",I had been to Hollywood many years ago and my recollection of the place was much better than it is now. Hollywood Boulevard looks very run down and dirty. Parking is terrible and there is nothing that is very tempting to look at.,RiRiAtlanta_Georgia
30,Not worth going out of your way,"Well, we were told at our hotel close to LAX that it would be about 30 minutes to get to Hollywood by metro (public transit)...it took just under 2 hours, buses, transfers, trains and some scary neighbourhoods and people. We weren't necessarily disappointed since we didn't know what to expect, but the couple of shops my teenage daughter and I went into were very expensive. I'd told her we'd get some great deals for clothes and shoes from what I'd heard about the States compared to Canada, so that was a letdown, but probably just the tourist trap overinflation. We learned a lot about how to walk around with your arms crossed or your hands in your pockets and averting your eyes so you don't get pushy guys putting their cds and video dvds in your hands and then asking for 'donations' of $1 to $10. Very annoying and it really takes a lot away from the visit. We had a group of 'protesters' picketing for Jesus, which also detracted from what could be a nice walk looking at the walk of fame in front of the theatre. They should be banned in that area for sure. We finally found a food court with something we wanted to eat: Johnny Rockets which ended up being the highlight of our day there. Good for them, kinda sad though considering... If you're driving past and want to stop to walk up and down the block to say you've been there, it would be worth it. Otherwise, look at it online.",tkpruden
20,Not glamorous in the slightest,"The walk of fame does not need to be visited unless you want to be annoyed. It is filled with people selling their own CDs and asking for money, and then get angry when you try to walk away. Does not feel like a safe place at all, and it's so crowded that you can barely take a good picture. Not glamorous at all. Media is so misleading.",Elena G
10,Disappointing,"This was top of my to do list in LA, but the biggest let down.It was full of 'performers' in cheap costumes, asking for money and some getting quite angry if you didn't give anything.It was quite intimidating and a bit dirty. A real shame!",mamacoupe
10,Don't Bother.,"The area where the Walk of Fame and Chinese theatre is, is seedy, tacky, and crowded with too many of the wrong types of people. Didn't feel safe here, keep your belongings close. Stopped by many trying to sell their c.d.s, got very angry if you walked away. We felt that time could have been far better spent elsewhere.",Cathy B
50,LOVE for a movie buff,"Stayed in Hollywood for 7 days. It was my number one place to go on my bucket list and I finally got to go for my honeymoon. If you love movies and movie history, you definitely gotta go here. We stayed at Loews Hollywood Hotel (GREAT HOTEL) . DEFINITELY go to hollywood and do all there is to do. The studio tours, the boulevards, the shops, etc etc. DOOO ITTTTTT",cksteeve
10,Hollywood in itself is an absolute dump!,"I've lived in CA before over 20 years ago. My 21 year old niece wanted to see Hollywood during our 13 hour lay over at LAX. I drove her around to different areas, Hollywood being one of them. Maybe as a 43 year old adult now I see Hollywood for what it is and that it's a dump! We stopped at a Starbucks on Sunset and there was a needle on the ground-real nice! The area is in complete decay. It's really sad! She didn't even want to get out to go walk around on Hollywood Blvd. So we went to Santa Monica instead, a much better choice. If you go to Hollywood, stay in the tourist places and even then, be very vigilant and be aware of your surroundings.",JenniferB71
50,A must visit place for movie lovers,"Leave atleast 40=50 mins early from your hotel for Hollywood visit as LA is like jam-packed mornings. Reach there by 9 and start your day with roller coaster rides as in morning you will find less rush there. Transformers and Jurraisc park ride is amazing.the best part is studio tour where in you can experience the king kong 3D virtual fight experience, some famous movie scenes (how they shoot it) and sets of movies and serials like Desperate Housewives, Jaws etc.in virtual rides, The simpsons is the best and i can bet on it that you gonna repeat it. also dont forget the timings of Fire show as its only 2 or 3 shows a day of it. Scary house is not that great but 4D movie of Shrek is good. kids gonna lik it alot. Animal show is also good. it is every day in the evening by 5 or 5.30.Keep some snacks with you to munch it up if you get hugnry during rides. restaurants at roller coaster ride's area are good.Enjoy all the rides and shows and have a wonderful Hollywood visit.",Pallavi_Raj
50,"very touristy, but fun","We have been to Hollywood several times already but always like stopping by. The place is crowded with tourists and vendors selling sight seeing tours, but it's always fun to see Hollywood's past. The walk of stars and Chinese Theatre are worth the jostling of the crowds. We also walked down to West Melrose street and if you're into shopping, this might be for you. There were many, many designer type clothing stores and some interesting people wandering around.",rduinc
50,"Don't buy anything, enjoy the sights.",I stayed on Hollywood Bvd. It was awesome. I loved going down to they walk of fame and it is central to everything with several metros.,Cassandra K
40,Hollywood,"I don't think a trip to LA would be complete without checking out the walk of fame, the Chinese Theatre etc:. easy to bump into people when your head is down walking and reading the names. Be careful of the people dressed up that invite you to take a photo with them then expect money in exchange. Some nice shops also on Hollywood Boulevard, lots of Souvenir shops though that basically all have the same thing. Nice place to visit during the day but very seedy at night, so get out before dark :)",Peter288
40,Overwhelming Place to visit!,I have family living here I visit every now and then and showed me the infamous foot printing of former famous actors. One of my favorite places I experienced!,Gamma89
40,Gotta see it at least once!,"It's iconic and it's what many think of when they think LA...you've got to tour Hollywood at least once, and see the Walk of Fame, the Hollywood sign, the Stars, and the Grauman theatre. Along with all the people who dress up and try to convince you take a picture with them :-) But it is worth walking at least for a little while! Also you get the best view of the ""Hollywood"" sign by going to the mall next to the Dolby Theatre towards the back by the Starbucks...and there it is on the hill up above!! Last time we drove all over trying to find a good spot to see it - never knowing it was right there.",csharp59
50,Iconic sign.,"Probably one of the most famous signs in the world.Big,bold and brash like such a lot of Los Angeles.This makes LA one of my favourite cities.I'm biased because my daughter lives there.LA and its environs always excite me from Hollywood Boulevard to the beautiful beaches.Wish I could afford to go again.",David W
30,Not as expected,"Looking at the Stars on the sidewalks was interesting. Overall its kind of run down with a freak show of locals. Not really my idea of a good time. However, its a famous place, and famous for good reason. Some of the shops, bars and restaurants in that area were cool........as they are in most other big cities. Been there, done that, no real reason to go back. If this review helps your planning, please leave me a helpful vote.",Slayridez06
20,Disappointing,I went to Hollywood expecting glitz and glam but was disappointed. This is a very run down area with lots of homeless in the centre. Seeing the hand and footprints of your favourite stars gives you a bit of a buzz. I would give this area a miss and keep the illusion of what you think it is in your head there are better places to visit.,Maureen H
30,Kinda tacky but as fun as you make it,"Yes a bit tacky, not unlike walking the strip in Vegas. Watch out for the characters in costume. They are not there for free. They want to take pix with you for tips. But overall, we enjoyed something different that you don't see everyday.",Tony C
30,Fun,It was fun to see all the stars along the walkway and to see the many people who dress as characters from various movies. Not sure if I would want to be there at night. Seemed a bit sketchy.,Chessie22
20,Massive let down,"Dirty, crowded and full of beggars dressed as ""stars"" trying to charge you for photos. People trying to put things in your hand and forcing you to buy their cd's, Chinese theatre with handprints is run down and filthy. Stars on footpath might be ok but you'll never get a photo as if you stop you will be approached by someone. Don't bother making a special trip and if you do go well don't say you weren't warned!!",rach m
40,Hollywood ....is Hollywood,"My hubby didn't want to do the tourist thing but I persuaded him. To make the experience more comfortable, I hired a limo for our tour in Hollywood coz The weather was so hot, I couldn't see how an open top tour bus was gonna be comfortable in the blazing sun and because parking was a nightmare we decided to leave our car in a car park a few miles away from the centre of h.wood. Anyway we saw the stars and handprints, visited the chine / dolby theatre, drove down to see the Hollywood hill, went to Beverly Hills , had lunch and went round Hollywood. For some reason it reminded me of London, apart from the fact that people in h.wood smile and say hello more lol",slimbeau
10,Horrible,Went here expecting to see glitz and glamour. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. It's very dirty and tacky and filled with people dressed up as 'stars' trying to get money from you.,Aubrey72
40,"Hollywood Los Angeles, One Day","In Los Angeles, you will likely go to Hollywood. Besides seeing the “stars” & “handprints” of the famous movie stars along Hollywood Boulevard, the Walk Of Fame, visit the Dolby Theatre to feel the red carpet walk of the Academy Awards, and view the “HOLLYWOOD” sign on the distant hill if the weather is fine, you will most likely proceed to Universal Studios.In Universal Studios Park, there are many rides, live shows and many other attractions for the whole family. Of course you must not miss the world-famous Studio Tour to see the movie making scenes, special effects, and some amazing movie stunts.Complete your day tour by walking thru the Universal Citywalk located just on the right side of the park entrance.",chan henry
50,Best holiday we have ever had,"We as a couple do not do the touristy thing, but before we had our holiday I researched as much as I could. Everybody likes different things, so don't be discouraged by some of the negative comments. We found a lovely rental in the heart of Hollywood, and this was an amazing find, it had a pool and a Jacuzzi for two weeks and it did not cost as much as some of the hotels were charging. The main thing it was central to everything, we chose not to rent a car as the buses and metro were so good. We purchased a Metro pass for the 2 weeks we were there, this also saves you money rather than paying daily for the bus and the trains (metro).We had a day out to San Marino to visit The Huntington Library, this place is amazing, this place is really amazing and so tranquil, but you do need a whole day to get around it all. The farmers market was a 10 min bus ride and it stops right outside the market.We also visited Venice beach, Santa Monica, The Grove shopping center and The Americana Mall and waterfall show, a lovely place to shop and it has a cheesecake factory to top it all.(Great food) The best advice I can give is to do your homework before you travel, it saves time and money. I used google earth to see how far the distances were from our rental postcode and printed out directions by bus and metro, I even allocated restrooms along the way. I hope this is of some help to you, and I hope you have a great holiday, as we did !",Toni S
10,Hollywood glamour is gone,"No doubt the worst place we visited on our recent trip. It's dirty, filled with homeless people and meth heads. The famed Chinese Theatre and Walk of Fame is just a battleground of idiots wanting your money. I had to physically pull my son away from a possible confrontation from some gangster rapper dude who pushed a CD into his hand and then demanded money. Where are the police? I can't image what this place is like after dark. Oh yeah, parking $2.50 every 10 minutes and a nearby parkade. On the brighter side we drove through some of the hilly neighbourhoods admiring the views and the homes, just stay away from the garbage that is Hollywood Blvd.",alhan10
40,It Depends on What You Expect,"I’ve lived in LA for a long time but hadn’t been out of my car in Hollywood for a long time until I attended a recent event at the Egyptian Theater on a Saturday afternoon. I parked at Hollywood & Highland (great view of the Hollywood sign) and walked around there for a bit before heading down Hollywood Blvd. Yes, there are people dressed as various characters that will pose for pics for money, street performers, homeless people, Scientologists offering a free “personality test” (just say no), people hawking tours, etc. The nicer areas of Hollywood Blvd are Highland west to La Brea. This is where Hollywood & Highland is located as well as the Chinese Theater, the Roosevelt Hotel, Musso & Frank (wonderful restaurant with a great Hollywood history), and the El Capitan Theater. The farther east you go, the grittier it gets. Yes, there are some restaurants I wouldn’t go to, but there are some decent ones as well. I ate at Jameson’s an Irish Pub across from the Egyptian and it the food and service were good (big beer selection too). Lots of cheap souvenir stores – to be expected in a tourist area.Hollywood is definitely in better shape than it was in the 90s, but LA is a big city with all of the pros and cons that entails. There are a lot of homeless folks, some who are a bit nuts (also nuts who aren’t homeless). The police presence is good – a lot of bicycle patrols. You need to be aware of your surroundings, etc. There are always criminals looking for opportunities to pick pockets and all – but that’s all over, not just Hollywood. I’m a petite female and I’m not afraid in Hollywood – but I take common sense precautions.Having said all of that, I’m not sure what people expect Hollywood to be like. I’ve seen old video clips from the 40s and it’s cleaner and there are shops and such, but it’s not wall to wall celebrities. There used to be more studios in Hollywood, and there were the movie premieres at the theaters (still are). The Roosevelt Hotel and Musso and Frank were celebrity hang outs of a sort. It’s interesting, especially if you like film history, but it’s not glamorous.",Koda
30,A lot of homeless people ..,Hollywood Blvd is worth a visit .Then leave quiclkly before it gets dark .The area around the historical theatres ( Chinese /Egyptian )as well as the hand prints/stars are worth seeing .There really is history to be experienced here .It is a shame that the city does not see fit to have the streets cleaned and the cops enforce loitering laws to move the street people along .The costumed characters are a step below the homeless population in the area The homeless may be asking for money and wallowing in their own stank but at least they are not confrontational and demanding like the costumed characters in the area .Don't dare take a photo of a character without remitting payment .They will chase you down .I watched Elmo get crazy backed up by the Cookie Monster .Superman just stood there ...doing nothing .It was sad .,tomchuck19
10,Apart from the Hall of Fame...,"This place is certainly not glitzy, in fact I would say it is a downright awful area, with only Hollywood boulevard being slightly flashy. The rest of the area is run down with either closed shops/restaurants or poor quality ones. I was astonished as I believed the hype and did not believe the comments of others who have visited this severely run down place. Coming here after staying in Beverley Hills, you wonder if you took a wrong turn somewhere and landed in a bad end of town! People talk about going to Hollywood to make it big, well they certainly are not talking about the area!!!!",DMyers148
50,Fab!!!!,"We saved very hard for this holiday to LA, and I was not disappointed!!! It was so surreal to be on hollywood blvd, seeing the sign and seeing the likes of Frank Senatras foot and hand prints! Rodeo drive was very special as I treated myself to a pair of Chanel earrings. Did farmers market, the Grove, other malls and if course Melrose Ave, with a drop in at Dash. Used metro all the time and never felt frightened. I'd love to go back!!",Carcam71
40,Its Hollywood!,"Yes it dirty, yes people are annoying but its Hollywood - you gotta go! Lots of people will ask you if you want to go on their bus tour, we found by saying we already had one or had already been on one they left us alone straight away, rather that at first we were just saying no they practically chased us down the street.Definitely a must see, you couldn't come to LA and not go to Hollywood....",Cassie-Andy
10,Not our favorite,"Hollywood was not what we expected. It is dirty, you are constantly harassed by people in the street trying to give you CD's, it doesn't feel safe. It was the only place on our trip that did not impress.",DJane01
20,Freaks come out at night.,"Felt like we had to show the kids Hollywood. It's ok. Dirty. Weirdos out at night. It's like going to Niagara Falls - Canadian side. Lots of lights, rundown souvenir stores, people dressed as celebs, and hype.Handprints at Chinese Theatre was fun. There's a decent mall near the Chinese theatre that has clean places to eat.Now that the kids have seen it, we can move on to better places to see.",maddiecat22
20,What a Shame,I was here 25 years ago and it has not changed much. Its dirty and rundown and only worth a quick stop to see the Chinese Theatre and a little bit of the walk of fame. The city would be well served to clean and wash down the sidewalks which apparently serve as restrooms for the many homeless. Didnt feel safe with my family there and would not eat in any of the restaurants.This will definitely be my last visit.,Dave4008
30,Have Fun But Be Careful,"I try not to visit. Last time was in March. Too much cruising. Not enough cops. If you are part of a group, stay with your group.",WinePrince
30,Hmmmh,"Well don't get your hopes up too much , it's not like you see on TV.Its actually just a sidewalk in a run down part of L.A thats it. I guess if you're a hardcore celebrity fan it's nice to see but besides that doesn't offer much.",Runningback22
10,Disappointing,This area is VERY dirty and run down. Deprivation is the word that stands out. Grubby places to eat and grub bier sidewalks. Make a quick trip to the Chinese theatre and Dolby theatre then move on quickly. Go early in the day as it get very busy with tourists.,Dawn E
30,Disappointing but something you must experience !,"Having always wanted to visit hollywood, I must say it was a bit disappointing. The allure of hollywood is lost as soon as you step onto hollywood boulevard, where you find yourself asking "" is this it?"" The hollywood walk of fame could do with some major renovations. The only worthwhile stretch of street runs between the graumans theatre and the hollywood/highland centre. Other than that expect to see run-down buildings and strange characters who will do anything for a quick buck!With that being said, I'm glad to have experienced hollywood. It truly was amazing to see all the hand and footprints of my favorite celebs. The Madame trussards wax museum was also great fun and we managed to get a few very realistic photos with our favorite celebs!!Most reviews are negative however visit hollywood with no preconceived expectations and you won't regret it!!",Ash1128
20,Very Dissapointing,"The reality is that Hollywood is a dissapointing place. Many people hear about it and think it must be beautiful. It's not. It is dirty, crime ridden and crowded. Go to Mann's Chinese Theatre, see the footprints and handprints and then leave quickly. The Hollywood & Highland shopping center is ok too. You may get some laughs from seeing the street performers and characters here.",JohnB00007

20,A bit of old L.A.,"It's not the glamour spot that tourists imagine, and definitely not the a spot for ""star gazing"". For real glamour, choose Beverly Hills !",meralee1122
40,Dirty,"we were surprised how NOT glitzy Hollywood was, tramps walking around begging for money and litter, the Hollywood walk of fame needed a good wash. nice to see crowded as you would expect and this made it difficult to see all the stars on the floor. but if you go to Hollywood and highland centre and go to the foot bridge you get a good view of the Hollywood sign without the long drive to see it close.",KiRo
30,"You kind of want to see it, but once you do you wonder...","why all the hype?It's a bit dingy...a bit scruffy...but still worth the visit at least once in your lifetime.I qualify my review by stating: I'm not a movie buff, a movie star follower or anything like that...Perhaps the best way to see it is via a tour where there is a story behind what you see vs just wandering on one's own.Plenty of options for shopping for souvenirs and places to eat.",SandyBC
30,tourists may be disappointed,"Hollywood is a real town with supermarkets, small retail shops and such. Tourists expect to see movie stars on every corner, but the reality is that movie stars living in LA don't go to Hollywood unless there is something going on at a specific venue. West Hollywood has great bistros and restaurants, but Hollywood in general is a big disappointment for most tourists.",queenwendy
50,Take a tour,"It's definitely helpful learning the history from someone that actually knows. My family took a food tour with Tourific Escapes, there's driving around, walking around and great food stops along the way. It's the entertainment capital of the world!",huadao15271527
30,Aistralia to Hollywood,"Bith me & my friend (bith single mothers) took our 9 & 7 yo old boys to hollywood. We came from anaheim & vegas. DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING SIMILAR!Hollywood boulevard is the main attraction.The star tour was great.We were told by taxi driver to go downtown for really cheap shopping. It was crazy Cheap. But get yr walking shies on. Its not in a mall. Its streets & streets. There is a fabric district. A toy district. A fashion district (mainly shoes & clothes. ). Not biggest range of clothes.It was definately worth going but there was NO TAXIs. We called for 2 taxis & it took over 2 hrsOk looking for a hotel. Honestly we would compare it to a rundown Redfern. Very poor suburb. Any really doesnt feel safe at all. We changed hotels. Because it was in such a bad area we thought we just picked a bad one. & rang expedia. Which are people in malaysia. Who coccomended closer to the boulevard. Yes it was closer. But still had to catch a taxi. It was still a very poor area (stayed at the vagabond on vine). The hotel was a touch better but still, not grat At all. We felt completely unsafe & felt in order to get out, we needed taxis at our doorstep. There a beggers & homeless people everywhere. Not too many children around. And honestly the people there are ruder than anywhere we went.If we could do it differently would have stayed there 2 days (just for boulevard & cheap shopping down town) & probably headed to queensland for the last few days of our trip to unwind.Wish i could say differly. But it wasnt a great experience. Still better to have had it tgan not though. Good luck!",Mia.
20,Most of Hollywood is dirty and run-down,"""Hollywood: is only nice around the one-block area of the Chinese Theater/Hollywood Mall area. The rest of the neighborhood and area is dirty, run-down, and frequented by bums and runaways that ask for money. Every time I walk around there (mainly to get to the Egyptian Theater), I feel like I have to keep an eye on my back. I do not feel safe at all in the eveningIt is somewhat nice in the area near the Chinese Theater...lots of high-end stores, tourists, and activities. Parking is reasonable in the big underground garage at the Mall.But if you wander away from the area you will see the awful underbelly of Hollywood. It is very sad and I do hope they will someday clean it up.",Rogerdob
40,Great atmosphere,"We caught the subway from Union Station to Beverly & Wiltshire and walked around seeing the walk of fame, all the characters dressed up, Grumans Chinese Theatre and other Hollywood icons. We then went to the viewing platform at the Beverly Wiltshire Centre to see and photograph the Hollywood sign. We didn't do anything special while we were there but we enjoyed the atmosphere and the iconic sights.",shellsb
30,Just another tourist trap,I really wish I had enjoyed it but it was just not my type of thing. The typical tourist thing and a lot of ticket touts. It may sound bad but I really don't want to go round and sit at the end of the street and look at people's houses! The walk of fame is also a bit of a bore. Sounds negative but I did enjoy the experience so worth the trip,George-T-Hull
40,A day in Hollywood,"We turned up in the morning started to walk down sunset blvd near vine st, as we new nothing except what we here in songs etc, asking some locals they sent us to Hollywood blvd, looked dirty but we done a tour and things picked up from there, Disney soda fountain nice for a relax, shop and some thing to eat. We were lucky enough to catch the oblivion movie premiere this was a highlight ( any premiere would be) only down side so many tour operators hounding you all day to do a tour",Matt D
40,Hollywood Tour through Vegas.com,"My sister and I took this 199.00 tour of hollywood. The driver (Gordon) picked us up right on time. We were in a van that sat about a dozen of us. It was a pleasant ride. He did stop a few times for rr breaks and what not. We did get a bag when we got on the van that had a muffin, granola bar cheese stick peanuts an apple and some juice. We arrived at the beach and were given time to walk around shop eat etc.... He did have a lunch for each of us which was a turkey (or ham) sandwich, chips, water (unlimited) and I don't remember what else. From Santa Monica beach we went to the Chinese theater and we once again had time to walk around and be at our leasure. After we came back to the van he took us around other parts of Hollywood, like rodeo drive and the Beverly Hills sign where we went and took pictures. Over all it was a great trip, the only thing was that we could have used a little more time to walk around. Overall I was pleased with the tour! I did tip the guide 20.00 because he was very nice!!!",Anna R
20,An Appreciation,"I 've lived most of my adult life in Hollywood. Most Southern Californians greet that news with incredulity. Hollywood means drugs, runaway children and hookers. The neighborhood had that. Today, the property is in flux, if not upscale. The recession cooled the building boom. The neighborhood between Hillhurst Avenue and Laurel Canyon lacks hotels. SEATAC has more hotel choice than the neighborhood..Without hotels, tourism here is problematic.That is one reason Hollywood -- a neighborhood within the city of Los Angeles-- remains the most disappointing tourist destination.There is hope. The Egyptian Theatre is a venue for serious cinema. Eateries open all the time. So do clubs.",Roy W
50,Awesome shops and landmarks,"The shopping here is great, and so are the landmarks! From the Hollywood Sign, to the Walk of Fame, Hollywood is a classic that never disappoints! So many photo ops and places to see, definitely come he if you are visiting SoCal!",Sophie M
50,I finally made it.,Hollywood is a big tourist city it was packed when i was there i enjoyed walking & looking at the walk of stars but it was one star i had to find Mr. Michael Jackson & yes i took pics of me touching his star a golden moment.,mz_Washington
40,One of the Most Recognized Signs in the World?,"Love to see the sign.. My husband and I were both born in Hollywood. On a clear day, we can actually see it from our house near Marina del Rey. Makes my day!",JSW842
50,Walk of Fame,"The Walk of Fame is a must-to-do in Hollywood, it is very full the so be early, don't take to much things with you, because homeless people are everywhere and want your money. At the walk are many souvenir shops and under your feet the stars. there are more than thousand one each sideway so don't look all the time to the ground you're not alone ;-)if you're standing in front of the chinese theatre walk about 15 minute to the righthand side and you can see a the HOLLYWOOD-sign on the Hollywood Hills",travellersolo
40,Not so glamorous!,"A must if you visit Los Angeles but not as glamorous as the movies portray it. Lots of Theatres, Tourist attractions and tacky souvenirs to see and buy. Be prepared to be nagged by wannabe actors dressed as popular movie characters who want to be paid for photos. Also wannabe hip hop artists pushing CDs into your hands. BE WARNED do not grab or take the Cd because then they want payment even if you didn't want it. Keep hands in pockets and learn to say ""No I'm not interested"" while in Hollywood.",CourtneyandDoug
30,Hmmmm. So this is it?,"Hollywood is like TV. Lotta hype, mostly rotted minds. The walk of fame is exciting, but you would think they could tax the movie moguls enough to keep it clean. We went early in the morning before the dopers and homeless were cleared out of the doorways so it was also a depressing view. Kind of like seeing a Michael Moore documentary (at least my impression of one cause I never actually watched one) or a Charleton Heston give to the Hope of Man charity commercial.",nabenom
40,Not all Tinseltown,"Don't think that Hollywood means movies and stars only. Actually Hollywood is a huge place in LA. Although the Walk of Fame is within Hollywood, the real Hollywood encompasses a greater area. There's North Hollywood, West Hollywood etc. There are less glamorous streets with shady characters trying to sell you homemade CDs of their own singing etc. So have a wider perspective when you visit Hollywood.",Walking with Wings
30,Fascinating for tourists,"I live there so it's routine for me, but I enjoy the interest that visitors have when I show them the various parts of Hollywood, from Hollywood Blvd. and its famous sites to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery where Rudolph Valentino and many other stars are buried.",Jacques C
40,Can be fun but plan ahead!,Had to do the Hollywood thing just once! The Chinese theater was my favorite thing! The rest of it was just a tourist trap! Stay away from tours they are way over priced! The Roosevelt hotel is also worth stopping by it is beautiful if you like old architecture. Really wanted to see the Max Factor museum but found out its closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so missed it! Hollywood is only really a half day trip if your not into souvenir shopping!,Smjanusz
40,its hollywood the dream land of films,we went to see hollywood by Starline tour ( combo tour of los angeles city tour plus hollywood); we booked the ticket online through a web site named Kijubi; over all service was good with hotel pickup; we went first to hollywood; i was very excited to see the place of which I know the name from my childhood...its hollywood; you will see the handprints and footprints of all great film personality and actors at Chinese theatre; also you will see the hollywood bowl and the famous stage for open air concert; from there you can see the world famous hollywood sign; you will see that again several times;we went hollywood just 1 week before the oscar so that the famous dolby theatre was almost ready with red carpet; and taking pictures standing on the red carpet ( obviously covered with plastic sheet) was very exciting; as we went with tour company they spent very little time in each place; but you can cover lot of place; we went to see the famous beverly hill (from the bus) where hollywood star have residence; then we see the market where stars do the marketing; I couldnt see any price tag on any item in those shops probably to prevent dizziness of the tourist and I had no courage to ask the price; if you want to spend some time then you can go by metro red line and get down at Hollywood/highland station;one sided fare is $1.50 per person; always keep your camera ready; if you are lucky you can see any hollywood star in your vicinity,jayasish
20,Not Much To See,"The only tourist attractions worth seeing are the old Grauman's Chinese Theater (with the stars' footprints and handprints in cement), the Lasky-DeMille Barn -- a film history museum opposite the Hollywood Bowl, and the Firehouse Museum south of the Boulevard on Cahuenga.",James P
50,"Yes, it is tacky, but it is Hollywood","Yes, it is tacky, but it is Hollywood. The Grauman Chinese Theater forecourt has hand and footprints of old time actors as well as new personalities. The adjoining Hollywood/Highland complex has views of the Hollywood sign. There are plenty of tacky shops to buy the must have souvenirs.How can you say you went to Los Angeles and not visit Hhollywood?",Cavydad
20,Run down and tacky,"If you're at all short for time, then give Hollywood a miss. It's very run down, with most shops either selling tacky souvenirs or boarded up. In the mornings, when it's empty, you notice lots of homeless people and every few yards there is yet another sales guy trying to sell you a tour of celebrity homes. In the afternoons the pavements are crowded with tourists.",Karen504170

10,Not full of stars,"Hollywood is being rebuilt, slowly. There are some fun restaurants along 1-2 blocks. The rest is seedly, dirty, and full of bums.",Gary D
30,Expected more...,Upon my trip to Hollywood I was expecting it to be all glitz and glam - instead it was rather a dirty and not so bedazzling place. It truly was a disappointment.Hard to see the stars on the Walk of Fame as hundreds of people are doing the same thing.,Brooke V
40,Goin' Hollywood,"Even though I live a mile or less from Hollywood, I rarely visit. Recently I just drove down the Boulevard and some of the cross streets and realized that it really is a remarkable city that has really cleaned up a lot over the years. My first visit was in 1978 and I thought the city was a royal dump and didn't return until 1987. Since there it has really cleaned up and become increasingly popular. It is still a tourist haven with shops galore and anywhere along the Boulevard is a great place to just stop for a few minutes and watch people going by - totally free entertainment you won't find in any movie theater.",vicdru
40,HECTIC!!,Don't think it's going to be quiet! It's the busiest place on earth! Not quite as glamorous as we thought it would be. But still so many iconic places to see.,Travel.gram.guy
40,LA is more accessible than you think!,"My family and I planned a four day trip to LA and we had an awesome time. We booked a hotel, Best Western, that was only five minutes walking distance from Hollywood Blvd which definitely saved us a lot of time and money. Everything was easily accessible on the Blvd including all the attractions covered by the City Pass. We also watched a movie at the El Capitan Theatre which was an awesome experience and had dinner at Musso and Frank which is the oldest restaurant in Hollywood. We also rented a car and drove down to Santa Monica. The weather in December was quite cool but the weather was great in general. Definitely want to go back!",Angel C
50,Must do for movie fanatics,"Hollywood is a must place to visit if you are into movies. Must dos - Hollywood hill, walk of fame, Graumann's Chinese theater, Kodak theater. Park at H&H center for free, provided you buy something from 1 of the shops there.",CalGirl84
50,Done almost everything in Hollywood,"Seen a red carpet movie review, broadway show, hollywood bowl concerts, universal studios, sunset strip, wax museum, Ripley's and much much more. Hollywood is cool, it has a ton to do, never been disappointed visiting.",Erik4Travel
40,Hollywood & Highland Needs More Restaurants,We went to the development to eat prior to a show. There used to be a lot more eateries. CPK was about all we could find.,suemb
30,Can be a real gem if you know where to go!,Avoid the tourist trap of Hollywood and highland. Google walks around Los Angeles or Hollywood and get to see another side of Hollywood that you never dreamt of. See how real people live and admire the architecture as well as hidden stairwells. Prepare for a real adventure!,mariasolis1
50,Not as glamorous as I remember,"Things are a bit more trendy, with the information age we are jaded to the experience, it's always nice to go to Mann's Chinese Theater foot print and hand prints of the stars..... walk the stars on both sides ofHollywood Blvd, fun experience.",Maureen M
20,Several Bright Spots and Much to Like Surrounded by Filth,"Hollywood has come a long way in the last 10 years. The Kodak complex (Hollywood and Highland) and surrounds were a great addition. It added nice shopping, a great theater venue, great restaurants and much needed parking. Grauman's Chinese theater is still an amazing historical and architectural experience. The Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripley's believe it or not and the Guiness Book museum help transition you to the touristy and kitschy hollywood and the balance starts to get pretty filthily. Don't venture too far East with kids or teens or you will have to explain the window displays in the adult shops. Unless you are callus, you will also quickly be affected by the transient and underground population that is mostly tucked away during the day, but still very evident. This area is still the world capital of teenage runaways and teenage prostitution and the derilict and homeless population thrives as well. Unfortunately, there is really not much left that is truly glamorous left here. I would not discourage a visit to see it in this light, but with limited time in So Cal, this would not be high on my list.",David K
40,I love this town,"Hollywood is amazing. Just avoid Hollywood Blvd. Other than that you're not going to be disappointed in the history, the architecture, the restaurants, and the shopping. I don't live in Hollywood, I live in the Valley (which is far superior to Hollywood if you want to actually raise a family, park in front of your house, and grocery shop without having to take a ticket).",SoozGO
50,Sureal,The Hollywood sign was well worth a trip to. Its kinda in the middle of nowhere on the way to a horseriding ranch but there are plety of spots to stop and take those souvenir photos. There are no toilet facilities or food stops up there and if the weather is wet be careful because it can be quite slippery going up and down the hill.,T0RTIE
30,Hollywood Story,"Hollywood is okay. It's mostly either very touristy or very seedy. But there are somethings you should check out. Do the walk of fame, do the chinese theatre, and please eat at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.",Geoffrey S
50,Hollywood,"Its a weird and wonderful place, seeing is believing!Lots to see,from the tacky shops to upmarket,Authentic diners with all the original dishes and on tablewurlitzers,or irish pubs to obviously more upmarket places,Great place to people watch and watch we did.Would we go back ! you betcha we would .",barbaraWales
50,A little bit of Hollywood,Growing up around Hollywood I have seen it go through many stages. This is the entertainment center of LA I love looking up and seeing the Hollywood sign. You walk around Hollywood Blvd and there are always characters walking around looking like someone special.,buddyone1
50,Hollywood Sign,It's always a beauty to be able to see the sign on the mountain first thing in the morning. It's serves as an inspiring beacon over what has become a not so movie star worthy place.,Jennifer L
30,an iconic sign,"every visitor to hollywood wants their photo taken by the Hollywood sign so make sure you do, its something you'll proudly show you family and friends. Don't expect to walk close to the sign as that is blocked off but you should be able to get close enough for those photo's to be good.Everyone else is doing the same thing so the streets leading to the sign get busy, parking is difficult in really busy times.It really is a quick visit, a few photo's and you are done, then on to tour the rest of Hollywood.",Andy T
30,Best thing in Hollywood (except Musso & Frank's),"You can't go there; you can just look at it. And take pix. I'm waiting for the day a texter runs over a group of tourists having their picture taken in the middle of Beachwood Drive (what are they thinking!!!???) A good photo-op is on Gower near Paramount Studios, as long as you don't have to get up-close-and-personal. This sign illustrates the power of slightly loopy ideas. It's great!!!",Kay T
50,best of Los Angeles tour,"My husband and I had a day to spend in the Los Angeles area and decided to try Bluesky tours for an overview of the highlights of LA and surrounding area. Are we ever glad we did! Avi, our driver and tour director took us on an exciting and interesting tour. We covered all the highlights, including downtown LA, (Grauman's Chinese Theater, Kodak Theater,etc.,) the Hollywood sign, Mulholland Drive,Santa Monica, Venice Beach and canals,Beverly Hills, the Coliseum, and much more. The great thing about using Bluesky tours is that there are never more than 8 people at a time on tour, and there are several stops that allow you to really see the areas at a leisurely pace. For example,we stopped in Santa Monica for 1&1/2 hours and had plenty of time to walk around and take in the beautiful ocean views, visit the farmer's market and have an enjoyable lunch. Avi was very friendly and knowledgeable, and we learned a lot about the area. We highly recommend Bluesky tours.",Yvonne P
40,Enjoyed the trip,"My husband and I visited for the first time here, it was nice. When visiting it's a good idea to purchase 2 maps. One ---- map of the ""stars home"" location. It saves a lot of time and gas. Two---- map of the location and names of all the stars on the ""walk of fame"" route at Hollywood blvd and Vine st also. It saves time for picture taking. The characters standing and walking around on Hollywood blvd can be rude. They dont want you to take their picture unless you pay them $5 or $10. So they will turn their backs to you or hide their faces, or walk away. The show ""IRIS"" ( A journey through the world of cinema) at the ""Dolby"" theatre is a MUST to see. We loved it. Take the city tour it's worth it. There are individuals rushing up to you to take their tour bus but I found it better to book the tour ahead of time, before the trip.",Imogean R
40,2 hour hop on and off bus gave a good perspective,"The red route of the starline hop on and off bus was a good way to get a perspective of the Hollywood area . It covered the major landmarks of the area with some narration as well, pointing out film studios etc as well as sights around Hollywood blvd and west Hollywood.I'd recommend a option like this to see more than the Hollywood blvd and the walk of fame",angieMelbourne
20,Hollywood Boulevard,"Walked all the way from Hollywood & Vine all the way down Hollywood Boulevard.The walk of fame was neat and did not realize that there is a symbol for Television, movies, Record Artists and Radio. Although interesting to see along with the Hollywood Sign I can't see what all the hype is about. The trash all over the streets, derelicts hitting everyone up for money.NOT A SAFE AREA ! The sign is simply boards on top of the Hollywood Hills. Don't quite get the draw. The Chinese theater was a bit interesting but got the feeling that they wouldn't even give you the time of day. The shops were nothing but junk shops all being made in China.It felt somewhat like Times Square in New York City. The people were extremely rude.Been there, Done That and quickly removed it from my list of places to return to.",RLW306
10,Don't make eye contact with spruikers,"A big disappointment. Did not feel safe at all. Con men everywhere trying to hook you in , don't take the bait ! The place was just sleazy.Know your destination and head straight for it.Good for t shirts only.Was relieved to get out of there and head to the Griffith observatory where we all felt safe again.",David P
40,Hollywood,you can't get right up to the sign but you can get close if you hike up the Hollyridge trail. It is really just a sign but so iconic.,Laura D
10,Starline Tours,Absolutly the worst experience. Do not use this company. Rude busdrivers. Incompentant employees at ticket areas who are evasive with information on tour pick up & drop off times. Signed up for 2 hour tour...71/2 hours later we got back to hotel....nightmare from beginning to end. Disputed charges with American Express Card due to horrific treatment. Ruined our trip to LA.,mfrceo
30,See it as part of a tour,"Hollywood is a lot like many of the LA sights, is best seen as part of a tour. The sign is great, Universal Studios is well worth the visit, but the rest can be best seen as a drive by. Can be tired and dirty and not a destination.",Kevin Rock
20,Disappointing :(,"Was really looking forward to a day in hollywood and it was nothing but a big disappointment.There was nothing glamourous about it at all. Everywhere is dirty, the walk of fame is so busy and full of people trying to sell you rubbish that you can hardly get a photo without someone standing in front of you. Very disappointed. Somewhere I suppose you have to see while youre in LA but don't get you're hopes up!",cookie2291
10,Yikes! Creepy and crime ridden,"I've visited Hollywood several times and for the past 20 years it's been a dicey place. When I last visited, there had been a noticeable downward slide to the city. Quite run-down, lots of vagrants, significant increase in crime and litter. I won't be returning unless I have to. What a pity!",Marie E
40,Beautiful Hollywood sign but cant come closer,"When travelling LA with the trip in 4 days only, it was in Oct, so the weather there is not really good for us. We had to go to The Hollywood Sign 2 times in 2 days. Raining in 2 first days when we were in LA, so when coming to the Hollywood sign 1st time, we couldnt see it because of too much fogs and very cold. 2nd time is in the 3rd day, the weather is better. there was sunny and windy. perfect weather for taking photos and sight-seeing. A pity thing is that tourist couldnt walk up to the Hollywood Hill to touch the sign any more. However, Hollywood sign has some beautiful places to see like the down-town with the whole view of the city and high - buildings in fogs and under the sun, especially, the Nest - Bird House on the hill - very special thing and impressive.",Twee N
20,Disappointing...,"I went there with my friends and we had a pretty bad impression. It's, definetely, not as we picture from the movies. The streets, except for Walk of Fame, are dirty, everything is expensive and you feel like you'd been robbed a couple of times after a little while. There are people(most of them sellers) looking for tourists at streets to make offerts, that seemed to be false. I'm glad I had not bought the Hollywood city tour and I came by myself, this way I did not spent too much money on it. I guess the best to do in Hollywood is the Madame Tussauds wax museum, at least its funny.",Manuela Hollós
20,If you have to see it....,"Planned to stay in Hollywood at the end of a bigger vacation. I assumed it would be easy to find lots to do here but in actuality all there is to see easily is the walk of fame and the Dolby and Chinese theaters. I am glad we only budgeted one afternoon here as that was plenty of time to see the major attractions. Dirty, seedy and unkempt are all fair descriptions. Tourist trap with street hawkers at every doorway. Stay away unless you must see it.",DB105
40,Hollywood Sign A Landmark of History,"Something from the old days to remind us of when Hollywood embraced creativity and drama. Pass by the sign and you know this is where it all began in terms of exciting entertainment, screen plays and acting at it's best.",Lee W
30,We saw the sign,"Don't get to excited about it it looks just the same in real life as it does in pictures and that was while we were zooming past. Perhaps if you are a movie buff it would hold more significance. Forget Hollywood, California has alot more to offer than superficial crap",potsandme
10,Beware of scam artists,We were befriended by a man (Terry) on Hollywood Blvd claiming to work for Universal Studios and that he could acquire discounted attraction tickets for us. As we were planning on taking a Hop on Hop off tour he offered to get us discounted tickets at an upstairs office in the Kodak Theatre. He obviously knew his way around and went up an elevator in the lobby of the theatre to get our tickets and never returned. Welcome to LA.,Valleyboy27
50,Hollywood is Hollywood,"Very touristy but fun anyway. Farmers market on Sunday is the hot tip! Fantastic fruits and veg. They have meat, lamb, and sea food as well. Interesting musical performers selling their cd's.",LincolnInnVT
30,good to walk!!,"The area is great to walk and see the stars name. The only thing after a while of looking down it get tiring. Advised find the star you want to take a pictures with to avoid neck pain. Has Kodak theater, ripley believe or not.",lalocadr19
30,"Worth a visit once in your life, I suppose","Some people have called it ""seedy"", ""dirty"", and ""smelly"". They're right. We went out because my wife won a charity auction to spend a day on a set with a movie star from our hometown area. That was very cool. Met several stars and spend about 8 hours on set. Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.Other than that, there are boarded up buildings,and homeless on alot of corners. In front of the Chinese Theater, you do get pressured to buy pictures with pseudo-celeb's and people dressed in costumes. There's also musicians, comedians, and other performers wanting your money. You are llucky to get pictures of stars on the Walk of Fame. Very crowded near the theater.We went last August for the set visit, then went back in February to see the Craig Ferguson show; which was included in the auction but they weren't filming in August. I would have been ok with getting it all done in one trip and not going back. It is truly the ""Land of Fruits and Nuts"". Part of my dislike for CA is political, so I'll leave out those comments. Hollywood is kind of cool to see...once.",Greg P
40,It's like a really tough jigsaw puzzle. Rewarding if you put the time in.,"A review of Hollywood seems quite a broad thing to cover. First place to start, West Hollywood, this is where the young, trendy and rich seem to live. They all have little cute dogs and look incredibly healthy. Shopping - there are some amazing shops such as Jonathan Adler, Fred Segal and many others, all require a car to get to. But well worth the hassle for people like me who struggle with the geography and road directions. It all seems to merge into one, I'm sure locals cna tell it apart and see dramatic differences, but to outsiders like me, admittedly I've been a few times in recent years, it still all seems like one street looks like the other. Slowly it is unfolding and revealing itself, but LA is a bigger mystery unlike most other major world cities. Which is a good thing. You have to take time to get to know it.",major_rawls
40,Dirty,"It was a great experience, but definently a tourist trap. I spent my time walking down the star side walk. Each step I took I was attacked with fliers, tour groups, or fake celebrities trying to get pictures. There where lingerie shops, tattoo/piercing, and tourist shops on every corner. It was for sure cool and they did have a few neat stops. I ended up being a part of the crowd and even got a piercing done on Hollywood Blv. I will be going back without a doubt because even though it's dirty, it is Hollywood!",thecatwhotravels
30,Used to be fun,"First- it was dirty and seedy. THEN- it became clean and touristy. NOW- it's dirty, smelly in some places and then touristy and ridiculous in others. The Chinese Theater found a way to block your ability to take a clear picture of the building by setting up a green screen for you to stand in front of so you can BUY THERE PICTURE. Really?!?! anything for a buck.",preciouspinkxxx
40,The mecca of Movie..what more to say,Felt like part of the place while moving around the houses of the big and famous ones.. Bell air was though the best followed with the trip to Universal studios. For the Indian and esp the Bongs a must place is the Ramakrishna Mission (Vedanta) in Hollywood.,SENSUJIT
20,Best seen from a Distance,"Don't worry about climbing up to see this...or down to see this from Mt. Lee Road (usually it is locked anyway). Go to the Griffith Observatory to catch a great view of the Hollywood Sign, while visiting a truly amazing venue. Two California icons at once...then head down to Hollywood and have lunch at the icon ""Pig & Whistle"" on Hollywood Blvd. it is next door to the old Egyptian Theatre and has been opened again in all its 1930-40 glory!",SCVDeb
50,It's cool,You park and hike up just a bit but do not get to the actual sign. You can take some really cool pictures though. You can see it from the city also but it's cool to get up as close as you can too.,heidisb
30,Disappointed...,"Making our headway through California, we stopped at Hollywood before going to Beverly Hills. We cannot recommend even driving through Hollywood. Many vacant building, bums on street, etc. as one suggested, find a good place to take a pic with sign in Hollywood and spend the rest of the day in Beverly Hills around Rodeo Drive.",ExHospitalityPro

30,Hmmmm,"Visit LA and you have to go to hollywood, but it ain't all the glitz and glamour you'd expect. chinese theatre is tacky, and loads of people dressed up working for tips, can be a bit pushy at times but they're just making a living. worth looking at the stars but you won't spend long here unless you get pushed into joining one of the many tours.Overall definaely visit if you're in LA but dont expect too much",colin h
10,Are you nuts?,"If you visit Hollywood, you are just as nutty as most of it's inhabitants. If you go at night, don't stray off the boulevard. It was crazy and dirty 30 years ago. It hasn't changed. You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig. They have tried to make your visit a better experience with new buildings, restaurants, and theaters. Unfortunately, they didn't put up a fence to keep all the predators and dirt bags out. Women, put your purse around your neck. Men, put your wallet in your front pocket.",mgard11

40,How Far Do You Live from Hollywood?,"""How far do you live from Hollywood?"" is a question I am frequently asked by people living outside California when I tell them I live in Los Angeles. It's almost like people only want to know the Hollywood part of Los Angeles.Growing up in Los Angeles, we only visited Hollywood when relatives or friends from out of town visited and we pretty much knew only about as much about Hollywood as they knew. I actually, at times, resented the attention that ""Hollywood"" got, but no longer.There is lots to see and lots to do in Hollywood, but then I can go home. There are the most popular things to see and do, i.e. Footprints and Handprints at the Graumann Chinese Theatre, The Stars on The Walk of Fame's Hollywood Blvd., the various views of The Hollywood sign from a multitude of vantage points. But there are other aspects of Hollywood. Last Tuesday I spent the evening at the Hollywood and Highland Jazz Concert where I listened and danced in my seat to Pete Escovedo's Latin Jazz Band. This venue was one block from the Graumann Chinese Theater and within the same complex as the Kodak Theater. Universal Amphitheater, Universal Studios and Citywalk is about 1 mile away from Hollywood and Highland, and The Hollywood Bowl is even closer. Today I recognize that there is a lot to do in the Hollywood part of Los Angeles.",cgmeigs

40,enjoyed seeing this on a trip - lovely views nearby,Good to get nearer and the trip up there was informative,caz_crock
40,Interesting for first time,"Hollywood is well... Hollywood. The area itself, along with Los Angeles, tends to be said that it's smoggy, dirty, and well, not all that great. In some cases, I can agree with that, for both cities. It's not the glitz and glamor that you'd like to think is there. I imagine if there's a red carpet event for the El Capitan Theater, then maybe it'll be glitz'ed and glam'ed up for the stars about to see whatever movie it is they are premiering at the time.The walk of fame and all itself is fun to walk down completely the first time, but I think any visits we make after this will be spent doing other things. This was my second time here. First time was nine years ago, but we only got to see sections of the Hollywood Blvd. and walk of fame. This time we walked the whole thing so I got my fill. Be aware that the walk of fame goes for many blocks. Way past what is the ""highlight"" of the Blvd. I use that term lightly, however. I should say where the action is. But it is worth going beyond that area, as you'll find some stars with multiple stars, and some stars are way away from the action.The busy section of Hollywood is obviously along the Blvd. If you're over near the Metro Red Line Hollywood/Highland, then you'll be near the action. El Capitan Theater is that way, as is Jimmy Kimmel's studio, Hard Rock, and Dolby Theater (previously known as Kodak Theater until this past Monday).When I say this place is busy, prepare yourself. Because it's extremely busy. You have the Chinese Theater here, as well as the walk of fame (a lot of the names you'll want to see are down this way, including Charlie Sheen, if he is your cup of tea), costumed characters (which are so poorly done that I couldn't recommend any folks take pictures with them.. go to Disneyland if you want that picture with Mickey, the memories will be better), Jimmy Kimmel's studio, El Capitan Theater, and Hard Rock. A lot packed into one small area of the walk.The problem with this area is the costumed characters, who are poorly dressed, and just random crazies that hang around. One homeless man in area at one point went running around screaming at someone. And the poor here will beg your socks off if given the chance.Hollywood is made out to be this wonderful, great place. And sure, it's an experience the first time you get to go there and take it all in. But it's not the overly great place they'd like you to think it is. It's worth visiting your first time there. Afterwards, I imagine there are better places to visit in area.",MukuSix
20,It's the city...what can I say?,"Hollywood is filled with lots of places to go and things to do, but it's just an overpopulated chaotic city for the most part. It's big, loud, smoggy, and dirty. The Hills are the best part of the city because of their panoramic views, but if you aren't going to be spending any time in the Hills, the city is what you'll see. It's not a beachfront city. The Walk of Fame is overrated. I mean, it's not like you can stop at every star to check out the names on them. There's people walking constantly and if you hold them up ""star gazing"" you're gonna be just another annoying tourist. The hookers on the strip aren't exactly what I'd like to see every time I take my family out for the day. The best you can hope for in Hollywood is to tour a studio, spend a couple days at Universal, and find some restaurants you can't find at home.",Genee W
30,Not whet you think,Our kids were very excited to see the famed Hollywood but really it's not to exciting. We liked rodeo drive much better than seeing anything in Hollywood it it very rundown and kind of trashy... We drove through and only got out of the car at a McDonald's to use the restroom. Downtown LA and the beach are much better epically for family's! The Hollywood walk of fame isn't to bad but goodluck finding parking!,Beachlover2888

Everyone has expectations of glamour etc..but once U see the area for yourself you will find out ""the real deal"". Take alot of pix because there is enough to see to and take them home with you to show others ""the real deal"". Your experience is a matter of opinion but I did find it interesting my first time out. I live in La now and has seen Hollywood Bl. transition. Businesses have closed but a complex is now opened full of shops, eateries, a bowling alley, a nightclub etc..and there are sidewalk kiosks and more sidewalk entertainment.",Tacmystery

We hired a car and visited the Hollywood Sign, Hollywood Boulevard, the Stars homes, Santa Monica & Venice Beach, Warner Brother’s studios and it was truly amazing.We signed up for a Starline tour to Warner Brothers, which was a fantastic day. A Warner Brothers official takes you around the studios on a cart. We got to sit in the 'FRIENDS' replica studio and had pictures taken in Central Perk on the couch! This was a highlight for my family!I wouldn't recommend the stars homes tours if you have your own vehicle - this is because you can by a Map for $5 from the street vending machine and do the tour yourself and save a lot of money. You only really get to see the Stars gates and not there homes. We did the Malibu Stars home and quite disappointed that you only seen the front doors along the coastline - it would have been much better if you were in a boat and seeing the backs of the houses located on the beach.We also did the sign ourselves and this was another highlight, we got really close and took some fabulous pictures.Santa Monica & Venice beach were also amazing - Venice being the better as there is a diversity of people there and it’s great to see. We also saw Elijah Wood filming a scene for Wilfred - that was cool.All in all a great experience and so glad we did it :)",LancashireLassInOntario

50,One of the best memories of my life!,"I was picked up from my hotel right on time in a spacious luxury minibus with plenty of leg room. The tour guides Mark and Dave were so happy in their work and really made the trip for us. They gave us a full commentary of sights and attractions on the journey so we didn't miss a single thing. LA was amazing and we stopped at various areas along the way including Beverley Hills, Rodeo Drive, Famous stars houses, The Walk of Fame, Joshua Tress and the famous Las Vegas Sign. Plenty of photo opportunities. We were given lots of bathroom breaks along the way and were given a lovely packed lunch and unlimited water. The bus dropped us outside our hotel on the way back and I tipped the guides as a thank you for their fantastic service. I have been on many trips around the world and this has been by far the best one yet. Adventure Photo Tours Las Vegas are definitely the ones to book if you want a stress free, enjoyable trip with tour guides that will go the extra mile to ensure you have a fantastic memorable trip...",CLAIRE D

50,Great People Watching,"Hollywood is fun. The variety of people is fantastic. There are some fun night clubs, good shopping, and visiting the touristy places is cheesy but a good cheesy. If you can catch a movie at Graumann's and El Capitan you'll be participating in a bit of Hollywood history. Stay at the Renaissance Hotel if you can swing it- it's super central and quite nice. For a bit cheaper go to the Hollywood Hills Best Western attached to the 101 Cafe- you'll want a car though because it's a couple of miles from the center of Hollywood. For the 3AM Brazillian food delivery that you'll be wanting, call Bossa Nova- they have a good variety of tasty food.",Schparkly

30,It's really just another town...,"The glamorous image that Hollywood has is mostly hype. Yes, there are still studios in the area. Yes, you may actually see a star walking around in the area. But you are just as likely to see suburban homes, strip malls, traffic and normal everyday people. Some areas of Hollywood still have the old houses that look like F. Scott Fitzgerald could walk out the front door. But it's also got some cheesy areas and things like ""tours of the star's homes"" which is rarely true. Take the legend with a grain of salt.",P-and-R1976
50,What's not to love about Hollywood?,"It's been cleaned up, and is nice and shiny now. The Kodak theater, home of the Oscars, is on Hollywood Blvd., there are lots of attractions from high end to cheesy. Wax museum, shopping, street jugglers, and costumed characters. The walk of fame is fun, but it's so long, it's impossible to ""read"" the stars all in one day.",beckyjake123
20,"Dirty, worn, and grey","I think that people imagine Hollywood as glamour and shining lights. The streets and sidewalks are rough, and very dirty. Trash is everywhere.

50,Loved it!!!!!,"Hollywood is not as you would expect, Hollywood Blvd is a smallish Street with all the attractions next to one an another, which makes it brilliant for sight seeing, especially if you are short of time. I spent most of the day here and had plenty of time to do what I wanted to do.I visited Grauman's theatre, the Kodak theatre (wish I took the tour), the walk of fame (all the way down the street to The Beatles and Elvis Presley's stars and did some shopping.We also did a tour of the Movie stars homes which was the best thing we did on our trip, we really enjoyed it. Yes you can't stop and yes all you do see is gates and trees most of the time, but we had a great time and would definately do it again.All of the movie star homes tours leave from outside and around the Grauman's chinese theatre. Don't pre book tickets on line, if you time yourself to go on the tour later in the afternoon you will be able to pick up a tour at cut price as the many companies are trying to fill up the seats on their buses.",TortMad
30,what's the hype?,"hollywood is quite a let down, or perhaps its about managing expectations... we drove past hollywood boulevard on the 1st evening, the immediate response frm my sis n i was.... 'tha's it? hollywood?!' guess we were expecting more happenings along the boulevard. the highlight to us was madam tussade museum, we had loads of fun taking photos with the 'stars'.",Eggyorkwoo
50,Loved Hollywood!,"This was my first time visiting LA, and of course, I wanted to go to Hollywood. I absolutely loved it. There is so much to do. I got off the bus from North Hollywood at the Kodak Center, and immediately got my first view of the HOLLYWOOD sign. What a nice way to start my touring. The Walk of Fame lines Hollywood Boulevard for blocks and blocks, and there are more stars on Vine (many from the Golden Age of Hollywood). It's fun just walking the Boulevard to discover favorite stars from the movies, television, radio, etc. The forecourt of Grauman's Theater is amazing. I took the theater tour, as well. I liked it, and am glad I took it, but some people may consider that it is not worth the $12.50 fee. Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum is great - the figures are so life-like and the museum is lots of fun, too. There is so much more to see if time allows - The Kodak Theater, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Egyptian Theater, Capitol Records at Hollywood and Vine, the Hollywood Museum, RIpley's Believe It of Not, the Hollywood Wax Museum, the El Capitan Theater and much more. Tours are really not needed for the center of Hollywood because everything is in such close proximity, and the Metro or buses can get you to Paramount Studios or some of the locations a little farther away. Since my time was limited, I did book the Citysights LA Hop On, Hop Off tour - poor choice!!! I do not recommend this tour. It got me to Rodeo Drive, La Brea Tarpits, and the Farmer's Market, but I spent way too much time on the bus just riding or standing on the corner waiting for the next bus to come. Just riding the bus (and not getting off) on the ""Hollywood Loop"" took two hours! My time was limited, and so I considered this an incredible waste of time. If you have a car or can figure a way to negotiate public transportation to get you to the points that you want to go to that are not within walking distance, it is a far smarter choice. The one tour that I did take that I liked (at least, sort of) was the Movie Stars' Homes tour. I'm not sure that the one I took was the best, but what I did like is that it started on Hollywood Boulevard and headed to Beverly Hills. The guide pointed out all the highlights on Sunset Boulevard along the way, before we climbed into the hills to see the stars' homes. After seeing the stars' homes, we rode to Rodeo Drive and then looped back to Hollywood Boulevard with continued commentary on the sights. You don't get off the mini-bus on this tour - It's just a ride and see, but it gives a good overview of the city looping to the west. The beginning of the Hop On Hop Off tour the next day was a repeat of this tour without the homes.",caram30

He provides snacks, water, sodas, etc. I was very impressed by him. Also, with him, you don't have to ride in a hot bus. You are shuttled in an air conditioned Mercedes van.",Keysha M

The Capital Records building, Hollywood & Vine, the Roosevelt Hotel, The Walk of Fame, El Capitan Theatre, the Hollywood sign, Gromans Chinese Theatre, the Kodak Theatre (so you can walk down the very same aisle the celebrities do for the Oscars), the Hollywood Bowl and Madame Toussade's.There are also many sight seeing vendors that bombard you all over the streets in Hollywood that can take you on tours or you can do it yourself on foot.Other venues to consider are Groman's Egyptian Theatre, Hollywood & Highland Center, Hollywood Forever Cemetery (lots of celebs buried here), Ripley's, Guiness World Records, Hollywood Wax Museum, and so much more.",DiabloDeb
10,Poor Tour with EHollywood Tours,"We, along with many others, paid for a Hollywood Homes tour with E Hollywood Tours. Their web site is; www.ehollywoodtours.com. These guys pick up on Hollywood Blvd and promise to visit 50 homes, crime scenes and the Hollywood sign. The tour started off well, then the guy ran out of fuel, so we had to stop at a pertol station. He then left us for twenty minutes at Rodeo Drive before a boring run through the traffic, back to Hollywood Blvd. When I stated we were promised a visit to the Hollywood sign, this was denied. All in all; a poor tour with few houses visited and little information given out. I would book with one of the reputable companies, or hire a car and drive around yourself.",littleian

We arrived to our first stop in LA to be surprised at how nice the weather was. It was amazing. Warm and we happened to be a bit over dressed. As the day went on seeing the sunny and beautiful LA was just what we needed as Las Vegas was a little cold on our visit.I have to share with you all that Sean our guide kept us on our toes and we had many laughs throughout the day. He also was wise to show us some good food options and kept the trip very budget friendly.Avatar Tours and Sean were a lot of fun.

50,"Avatar Tours ""LA in a Day""","My wife wanted to travel to Los Angeles from Las Vegas but we did not want to drive on our own. I found this company called Avatar Tours that offers hollywood tours. There were two other companies that I found to offer tours but their prices were substantially higher and offered less site seeing in Los Angeles. I think one was called Action or Adventure Photo Tours and the other was Quality Tours.I was picked up from Monte Carlo Casino at 6:15 am, we arrived at Santa Monica at 10:30 am. I slept for the first two hours while my wife was having a great conversation with a couple from England. The ride was not too bad, I thought it would be much longer.Santa Monica beach was beautiful, especially in November, I can see why so many people live in this city, it felt like 70 degrees in NOVEMBER! We spent an hour here at the Santa Monica Pier and walked on the boardwalk for a bit. We loaded up and drove around Santa Monica to see some of the city.We then headed to Beverly Hills and saw some of the mansions that the local celebrities live in, we saw the Playboy Mansion and the house where Michael Jackson died. I forgot some of the others, seemed like every street had a celeb house on it. We walked Rodeo drive and took pictures of all the Ferrari's and Aston Martins driving by, it was like being at a car show. My wife went in a few shops to look at clothes.After Rodeo we went to a mansion that has been in a lot of movies, I forgot the name of it, but it is surrounded by celebrity houses. We walked around the mansion and got some amazing pictures.We then went down the Sunset Strip and ate lunch at a place called Chin Chin. It was nice sitting outside watching the expensive cars go by (I love nice cars). My wife kept hoping to see a celebrity but we didn't see anyone. The food was great and the ambiance definitely made you feel what Los Angeles was all about. We liked that this tour allowed us to eat at a local restaurant as opposed to the others offered a sandwich and chips for lunch. The guide offered different places in different price ranges.After the Sunset Strip we went to Hollywood and spent an hour at the Walk of Fame where we saw the Chinese Theater and the Hollywood sign. This was the busiest place by far of all the other places we saw. We found really good souvenir shops here, the stuff was better priced than Vegas Souvenirs.From here we drove back to Vegas. We arrived back at about 8:20 pm. I can tell you this: THANK GOD I DID NOT DRIVE ON MY OWN! The guide knew the city so well and you could tell by the streets he chose that he knew how to save time. I saw so many streets packed with cars that we zipped by going on side streets, we could have never seen all that we did in one day without the guide. The guide was funny and fun to talk to making the trip feel much shorter than if he had just been spitting out facts the whole time like some tours.This tour was well worth the money, I have scratched Los Angeles off my list of places to see and feel like this was a great bonus on my Vegas Vacation.",paulkrager62

50,The Hollywood Movie Tour & The Hollywood Tragical History Tour - fantabulous!,"We took the Hollywood Movie Tour by Dearly Departed Tours on a Saturday morning at 10:30AM. It was so-o-o-o excellent - and it was only $40.00! Very, very well worth the price. (See my review of the Warner Brothers Studio tour, which was NOT worth the $48 price.)This tour takes you all around Hollywood and on up into the hills and up to the Griffith Park observatory, among many other places. It shows you houses and locations where famous films were shot - AND when you are in front of the house or the building or whatever, a drop down screen inside the 13 passenger mini-bus is showing you a clip from the actual film depicting that very location within the movie. This is just so utterly cool, you cannot believe it!So when it is the opening scene of ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and James Dean isdrunkenly crawling on the street in front of his house, there you are, looking up at the house and there on the screen is James Dean crawling on the street that is in front of you. And if it is Julia Roberts and Richard Gere embracing on a fire escape at the end of ""Pretty Woman"", there you are, sitting in the mini-van, looking right at the building and the fire escape while the clip is showing on the screen. Awesome!My adult daughter and I both enjoyed this tour, although I had a better knowledge of the film classics - like Sunset Blvd. - and she had a better knowledge of some of the more recent movies that I have not (yet) seen. (Hello, Netflix!)We had a quick lunch at a Mexican Restaurant right there on Hollywood Blvd. and then met back up with the same tour operator for the afternoon tour at 1:30 PM - The Tragical History Tour of Hollywood. Again, at $40 well worth the price. This tour took us to venues associated with famous Hollywood deaths and scandals. We saw the Viper Room where River Phoenix died and as we sat out front, heard a recording of his brother's 911 call. We saw where Fred Mertz (actor William Frawley) died. We saw where the actress who committed suicide by jumping to her death off the ""H"" in the HOLLYWOOD sign lived at the time of her death. Yes, within walking distance of the sign, but she would have had quite a little trek to get up there! AND we saw the famous ""Michael Jackson gate"" out through which came the ambulance bearing his already-dead body. And we saw....... well, you have to take the tour!This tour is accompanied by a ""Death Book"" - which, no, you do not get to keep - a binder which contains photographs accompanying many of the stories. Such as the actual autopsy photos of The Black Dahlia (uggh!) and a photo of Bella Lugosi laying in his casket dressed in a Dracula suit. (Not so bad. Actually, he looks....... appropriate!.)The guide for each of these trips is intimately familiar with the stars and their stories - both old time stars and current stars. Dearly Departed tours is a very small company - 2 vans - and the guides are friendly and a veritable fountain of information. The multi-media presentation-format is extremely well thought- out and very well put together. You see more than you could ever see on your own. The 13 passenger limit makes asking questions really easy. And despite the subject matter, there were lots of laughs along the way!In all, it was a GREAT day of touring. We learned so much and just had a really good time!Note: Easy to find with a Hollywood Blvd. meet up spot. We parked a half block up from Hollywood Blvd. on Cherokee Street in a Public Parking garage for $10 for the day.",Deeana M
50,Seeing Those Hollywood Sights!,"We stayed the second night of our trip into L.A. very close to Hollywood Boulevard at the Hollywood Orchid Suites Hotel (truly Hollywood's Best Hotel Value). Before hitting the sack as some might say, we had dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen at the Hollywood and Highland mall.The next morning we got up and had breakfast at Shelly's Cafe on Hollywood Blvd. The restaurant was home to several scenes from ""Million Dollar Baby"" with Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank. From right outside Hollywood and Highland you can see the El Capitan theater which houses all of the Walt Disney Pictures film premieres. Next to Hollywood and Highland is the Kodak Theatre which is home to the Academy Awards every year. We walked down the block (to the right from Hollywood and Highland) to Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Later that day, we took a tour of the theater and for $12.95, it's worth it. A tour guide takes you from the theater's big screen to the VIP Lounge upstairs. Walking up and down Hollywood Blvd., and looking/taking pictures of the thousands of Hollywood stars, the Hollywood Walk of Fame stretches from Hollywood and Vine to Hollywood and La Brea. Now, certain stars such as Julia Roberts and George Clooney don't have stars, so it's suggested that you check who has them before going so you don't spend your whole day looking for ones that don't exist. We took Vine St. down to Selma Ave. and walked Selma Ave. to Highland Ave. passing the Crossroads of the World, the famous Hollywood High School and the Hollywood Museum (which we went into). The museum holds thousands of props from your favorite blockbuster films. The upstairs acts as a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. Since the Hollywood sign is shrouded in fog for most of the early morning, we took a picture of it once we got back to Hollywood and Highland (arguably the best place to snap a photo of Hollywood's most historic landmark). We had dinner at The Grill on Hollywood at of course, Hollywood and Highland. After dinner, we went inside the Roosevelt Hotel and took a few pictures. My wife had been wanting to do that since we arrived there.",travelertrip96
30,All the glitz and hero worship!,"You have at least three studio tours to choose from: Universal, Paramount, and Warner Bros. We enjoyed the Chinese theatre and walk of fame.

30,Visit to say you've been there,"The Boulevard is where the stars are embedded into the sidewalk, there are the famous hand and foot prints , the Kodak theatre, Manns Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood sign and thats about it.Ok to spend about an hour there, parking is 15 Dollars, eateries up the steps next to the Kodak where you can also see the sign in the distance. Shops, souvenirs and bus tours all available, photo's with lookalike stars every few steps.",paulday4482016
50,Los Angeles in October,"First time to LA, and it was fabulous! Hollywood and Highland are a must, you can see the star walk and the handprints in front of Mann's Chinese theater. We also did Madame Tousseaux's (sp?) Wax Museum - it was worth every penny! Some of the best pics from our trip came from the museum! We were surprised, however, how small that tourist area was - you can walk around and do a funky museum or two within just a few hours.We went to Bar Marmont on the Sunset Strip for drinks in Hollywood - very pretentious and high prices ($15 for a cocktail), but worth it for one night to get the Hollywood nightlife experience.Rodeo Drive was a highlight for me - its amazing how many insanely expensive stores and cars there are in a matter of 3 or four blocks! We saw a few celebs, one of the judges from ""so you think you can dance."" It was exciting to see them but I felt too uncomfortable to approach them - it was almost sad to see all the papparazzi just waiting for something to happen, they were like vultures! We took a ride through Beverly Hills to see the mansions - they were incredible. On a side note, unless you are uber-rich, if you want to do more than window shop take a stroll down Melrose (about 5 blocks from Hollywood and Highland). You'll find some funky and affordable boutiques there.Overall we had a great time, and will definitely be planning another trip back as soon as we can!",kshaw27
