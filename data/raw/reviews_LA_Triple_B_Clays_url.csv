50,A Great Shooting Destination,"Triple B Clays is one of the better shotgun sport facilities in the Los Angeles area. The well stocked shop is well staffed, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. A large variety of shotguns are available to rent if, like me, you didnâ€™t arrive with your own. The trap and skeet stations are kept mechanically sound and clean.Recent heat and humidity slowed me down during this last visit but resting between rounds at the shaded benches located at most stations helped get me through six rounds of trap.If all goes well, I hope to shoot at Triple B Clays again soon.",Kansas_City_Herder

40,Very nice sporting course in LA,"It's hard to believe that this gun club is in the heart of the LA basin. But, once there, you'd think you were out in the countryside away from the city.The course is challenging for both new and experienced shooters. There were some rabbits and some birds presented from towers. In all, it was a fun and challenging course but the presentations were not greatly different from courses in Ohio or other parts of the country. This is a great ""inner city"" course that is welcoming and challenging to most any who shoot it.Nice pro shop, lots of branded stuff to buy although, like most courses, at very full price. Ammo is plentiful, but full-price at the pro shop.Don't have anything to complain about. This is the fourth course in LA that I've shot and it's not the best or most challenging, but it's VERY well taken care of and relatively easy to get to from just east of LA.",Garfield1111
40,Back again after 20 years,"I used to shoot here in the mid 80's when I lived in the South Bay. Since then I stopped by a few times, the last time to buy a gun in their pro shop some 20 years ago. It seems both the pro shop and the range is under ""new"" ownership. We shot the sporting course and it was for the most part well kept and maintained. Almost all of the machines in their 25 station layout were working.The targets were fair although a bit lacking in variety. There were no raised stands with the targets below your feet and as with a lot of US courses no overhead shots.Overall a lovely and well run course.",ZhuhaiBill
50,Deluxe SoCal clay target shooting.,"There aren't a loot of places to shoot clay targets in Southern California. Triple B Clays is in a beautiful green park setting. They offer trap, skeet, sporting clays, 5 stand; and Olympic bunker trap. This venue offers an excellent pro shop, premium demo guns; and, a surprisingly good restaurant. The staff is helpful and very friendly. Highly recommended.",James K
50,Great introduction to Sport Clay Shooting,"Trying to be a good dad, I took my son (17) to Triple B Clays to experience some sport clay shooting (I use to call it all ""skeet shooting"", but now I'm educated!), and had a great time. We bought an instruction package which included all the necessary stuff (guns, shells, clays, golf cart, and an instructor for an hour. Our instructor, Bud, was very patient, and explained the safety and operation of the guns. A nice guy, and clearly very knowledgable about safe gun handling and the entire operation. This place is huge! I was shocked that you really need a golf cart to traverse the facility, buy you do. My son and I really enjoyed our time there, and did quite well with Bud's instruction. It seems we only scratched the surface of what the place offers in terms of variety of events, but it opened our eyes to an entirely new area of safe fun and competition. Highly recommend for a fun time for new shooters. By the way, the magic word is ""PULL"".",P_-_N_-_Travel
50,"Pull, Bang! Bang!","I was introduced to Triple B Clays by a family friend living near LA, wouldn't have bothered to search for it otherwise. I've shot guns down firing ranges plenty of times, but never anything like this, so when I saw the website, I said why not and gave it a shot (I know).Driving over here was quite easy, just off the CA-60 freeway, and all the way whilst driving in, you are welcomed by row after row of shooting aisles, giving the site a very impressive feel. This place also has a decent restaurant, so you don't have to go out of your way to find a place to eat.It might be better to call ahead to make a reservation, but I didn't make one (I went on a thursday), and fortunately, there was an instructor on hand to help instruct my family and myself. Picked up how to shoot the guns quite easily, but having had some shooting experience before definitely helped. It felt awesome to be able to shout pull and all that like in the movies, and the pricing felt reasonable. Paid for two 'beginners' packages at $95 (USD) each which meant we got 100 shells between the two participants which is more than enough to become acquainted with the sport.The staff were very friendly and encouraging throughout the entire experience, as well as very helpful in pointing out what we could do to hit more targets. The occasional bird also flies by the place, which gives the entire experience a more authentic 'hunting' feel. There are plenty of places the clay pigeons fly out of, so you'll never be bored like in a conventional shooting range. This to me, trumps any other type of shooting experience, given the 1) wide outdoorsy feeling, 2) helpful and friendly staff, 3) moving targets.I only hand enough time for the beginners package, so I'm not too sure what 'pros' would do at the place and payment, but I will definitely go again when I'm visiting LA.",Jonathan K
20,Don't expect to be treated with courtesy,"This is a very nice shotgun field catering to skeet and sporting clays. They do have a few trap fields, but it seems that trap is more of a nuisance to them. I shot an ATA event there that took 4 1/2 hours to get 14 shooters through due to inefficiency. I was going to shoot a practice round before the event, but the fee was $10.00!!! That's 20% more than the registered targets cost!!! I got the feeling that they really didn't want anything to do with trap. The staff were short fused and unhelpful. I gave them two stars because the skeet and sporting clays fields look very nice. I don't know how the staff is with those sports. Don't just take my word on this, do a yelp search also and get the story on these guys. I'll never go back.",MIKE P
