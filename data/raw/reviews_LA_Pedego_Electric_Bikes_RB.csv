50,Awesome Experience! Great Owners!,"We had no reservations, but were able to rent late notice. Owners are sweet and helpful and set us up right away. Did the day rental to take bikes to Marina Del Ray and back. Chose these over Segway and were so glad we did. Awesome experience and so much fun. Scared of running out of battery or not making it up hills... no problem for these powerful bikes! Would highly recommend this experience!!",juujumama
