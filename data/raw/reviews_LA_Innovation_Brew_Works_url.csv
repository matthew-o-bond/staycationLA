20,Better not be in a hurry!!!,"The Crew works at a very disorganized pace. They can only handle one order at a time not able to prioritize the orders; it's first in, last out. A simple salad will take as long or longer than a sandwich or pizza. The cashier has to switch between internet orders and people in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryHunterUSA
50,Great sandwiches!,"Met my good friend here for lunch, she works nearby and recommended this place. Gets busy at lunch! Once you order and pay, they give you a number and food is brought to the table. Nice service, thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raintreeflower
30,"Survice needs some help, pizza great!","My daughter is a student at CPP and wanted to try the new brewery. Very cute inside, the pizza was great, but the service was lacking. We received our pizza in about 10 minutes, but had to ask for our salads twice before getting it well after we had finished the pizza. Friendly, but not well organized",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB1812
50,pretty nifty to check out,"It's a little different and run by students. The beer is great and they chemistry behind it is awesome. Nitrous in your beer? Pretty good.If your looking for something different, want to learn something and have some decent food, this place is worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504birens
50,Really Local Food and Beer Restaurant,"The beer is brewed on site by students and uses hops and some other ingredients grown by the University in Pomona. The food also incorporates local produce for the sandwiches and pizzas. The crisp crust pizzas are good- the bbq chicken was tasty and the margherita had a bit more cheese that I needed, but it had just the right amount of good sauce and fresh tomatoes. They also make craft sodas and the root beer was just the right combo of sweet and zesty. They get very busy but they took our order before we even got to the register so that speeded things up. Casual and noisy in main area. The area outside is nice and the area right next to the brewery was quieter. We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LNLew
40,"Delicious sandwiches, tasty beer","The menu here is limited (primarily pizza, sandwiches, and salad), but what they make, they make very well. My favorite is the chicken club - hot, crunchy, and flavorful. You can choose what you want on it, but I like it the way it comes. Of course their specialty is their beer, which is terrific. They have a good variety on tap, and my husband and I can always find something we like - typically the Luther Holt for us, but there are many options. There's plenty of seating, and the staff is friendly I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catsaway9
30,Food is average as is the service,These people really seem like they don't care about goo service or good food... the dishes are inconsistent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachtravel
40,Food Better Than The Beer,"Although it's a brewery, the food is the real star here!I tried 16 out of the 18 beers/ales in two taster flights that day. If say I've visited easily 50 our more breweries and I'm pretty open minded and well versed in beer.Unfortunately, out of the beers/ale I tried, only 2 were good, 3 were passably decent and the rest I could even finish the taster.On the other hand, the pizzas were amazing, unique and served quickly.Go here for the food, skip the beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emcii
50,Great Food,"The food has always been great and tasty! From the moment this establishment opened for business, it was a hit! The staff is friendly and after a hard day at the office, the beers the students brew are awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonGon58
30,More Food than Brew,First visit confused us. Seemed more like a Pizza/Burger place rather than a Brewery. The food was above average and the beer was good. Overall a B rating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav990
30,Upscale craft brewery/restaurant,Had dinner and beer here May 2016 on recommendation of our hotel front desk. On the cal poly campus although not a ton of students during our Thursday night visit. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Prices arent too bad at all and especially for the pizza. All pizzas are about $8 and a lot for one person and loaded with toppings! Personally I don't really care for craft beers so I won't rate them but my buddy does so that's why we went. No bathrooms inside so you have to use the public ones that this tech center shares. Lots of free parking right outside as well and close to the highway. Both inside and patio dining and sports on the tvs inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banny9949
50,Bring an open mind,What an amazing place - one of the only campus based breweries. The beers are creative and the pizza is the best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/631charlenea
40,Good pizza,Pretty good place for cheap eats with a group. The ordering was conducive to individuals ordering independently and then sitting together.I got a very good sized pizza for under $10. I considered it a deal for being a gourmet pizza and in CA.They don't have as much beer selection as you would expect for a place with brew in the name. Only a handful of wines. No hard alcohol.The deserts looked good but I didn't try any.Nice patio area too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAworktravels
40,Great Sandwhiches and Pizza,"If you are near Cal Poly campus, you can't go wrong with this new Pizza / Brew works. During the daytime you can get good breakfast and lunch sandwiches.... I'm sure pizza too. The pizza is very tasty as well.If you are in meetings close by, this is a great option for a tasty quick meal with plenty of seating and TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaron_worldwide
40,Very Good Pizza,"They make the pizza right in front of you, and you can get as many toppings as you like for the same price. The crust is perfect and just how I like it, thin and chewy. Too many places with such thin crusts burn them to a crisp. They have a great variety of beers. My sister tried 2 different brews, and really enjoyed them. The service is very quick. I have also tried their side dishes and salads, which are good, but not as good as the pizza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
50,Cal Poly's Best!,A wonderful spot for a burger and brews. Reasonable prices and the student vibe is energizing. This is a long-awaited addition to the local college scene. Sit back and relax after a long day of lecture and labs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
30,Learning brewery,"Part of the Cal Poly Pomona campus, this is a learning brewery. A great space with tons of space and outdoor seating. Beer selection is varied and interesting. A good place for a beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/axs666
