30,"Different way to teach the history of the Holocaust, didn't work as well for me","The Museum of Tolerance is different from every other Holocaust museum I've been to (NY, Israel, DC). It's hard to explain but basically you and any people that walk in around the same time as you walk through the museum watching videos. You stand in one area and watch a video then the audio moves further down, you walk a few paces and another video starts there, etc. It was interesting, because I'd never been to a museum that approached it this way and I did see some interesting footage that I don't think I'd seen before. But I didn't really enjoy standing without walking for so much or that we had to stay in a group or that there wasn't really anything to read or get more information about. It's an interesting concept, but perhaps a limiting one? We knew they closed at 5pm, and we showed up a bit before 3:30pm. We were told that they don't really recommend anyone starting after 3:00 but didn't really understand why! Now I do! It takes about 1.5 hours to do all of the videos with the group of people you're with. There's a bit more to the museum, but we didn't get to explore that as it closed at 5pm (strangely, the Anne Frank exhibit is open until 6:30 although the rest of the museum closes at 5). If you live in LA, then this is a fine museum to visit/take your children to. If you're traveling to LA and have been to other Holocaust museums in the country, I don't necessarily think that this museum is a must see. Interesting, but not a museum I'd recommend (certainly not over other Holocaust museums).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
50,Truly Sobering,"We visited with our teen boys during spring break, on the way home to Northern California from San Diego. It was truly sobering. The museum itself is well done, but the most impactful experience is the opportunity to hear Holocaust survivors share their stories. While we had all learned about the Holocaust in school, hearing a first person account gave a very different perspective, making it “real” in a way that books simply can’t. We realized the importance of hearing such testimony while we still can (the survivors are mostly in their 90s), and returned during summer break, this time buying a membership. We heard two more survivors. Although there are common threads, each has a different story to tell. We returned during winter break, again on the way home from visiting family in San Diego. This time we heard from a survivor, as well as a former white supremacist. I believe speakers are scheduled daily. This is a must-do not just for families, but for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShesaBadMammaJamma
20,"Not really a museum of tolerance, more about Jewish history...","I was surprised that there was no mention of the Holodomor or Palestine or other massacres committed by Jews. So they should rename it to museum of Jewish history. The references to civil rights leaders are also shallow in that they don't talk about Malcolm X like they talk about MLK. Being a Jewish museum, they have to welcome immigrants and discuss their plight from only one side. So, if you are Jewish and you want to be given a serving of confirmation bias, this is the place. If you are not, then maybe find different museum? It won't teach you about the Holocaust, any more than watching Schindler's List or another Hollywood drama will. They never discuss it with hard evidence and facts, just anecdotes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7874KVbenjaming
20,"Well-intentioned, but shallow and tendentious","If you have any previous knowledge about World War II, the Holocaust exhibition will not bring much learnings. The interactive activities are interesting, but their target is high school students, not adults.The World Today exhibition is shallow and kind of tendentious, since it brings only one point of view of historical facts (for example, atomic bombs against Japan are not mentioned).Also, videos are outdated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/644willianf

Also, I wonder why this event is so publicized while the Armenian genocide and the Rwanda Massacres are pretty much ignored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceAbbey
50,Tolerance,"This museum is for everyone. We should never forget what was done. This needs to be remembered so it never happens again. Going there is a very moving experience. You get to pick a picture of a child, at the end of the visit you find out if the child survived. While the museum does go into details, it’s not as heart wrenching as visiting one of the camps. Allow 2 hours, parking underground is free. Staff is very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncjc2013
50,Educational and Instructive Experience,Two hours was not enough time to see all this museum has to offer. We did the Holocaust memorial section intending to do tolerance section later but ran out of time. We will definitely go back. Important for adults and children to see how easily a civilized society can degrade into chaos and horror.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrarN5357OB
50,Educational,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the museum. Instructions were easy to follow & when I got stuck, help was at hand.I cried my eyes out watching the atrocities I knew about but was so different experiencing via survivors.A definite must do for every person who wants a better future .I wasnt even aware of this Museum prior to my visit to Mexico City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsl2019
50,Listen to a Holocaust Survivor,"This will change your perspective about the holocaust. Next best thing to actually visiting sites. The holocaust exhibit is a permanent exhibit where you get walked through the experience of being Jewish during WWII, The exhibit goes changing as your progress over the years. Eventually you end up in a replica gas chamber and it becomes so real. On Sundays, they typically gave actual holocaust survivors as speakers who share their story, about every hour or so, and its different guests every time. I've listened to a concentration camp survivor and a hidden refugee child. It's an unforgettable experience and privilege!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepais
50,Excellent museum with opportunity to hear holocaust survivor,"This was a wonderful museum. We visited both the main museum dealing with racism and hate speech as well as the holocaust. We also visited the separate Anne Frank Museum which was perfect for children to visit. We also had the opportunity to listen to a 90-something year old holocaust survivor who had survived Auschwitz. He spoke for around an hour and was truly inspiring. There were interactive exhibits and a ""guided visit"" around the holocaust exhibit - well worthwhile visiting. We spent around five hours in all there. Parking was free and easy under the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros57
50,Museum of Tolerance,"Very Informative about the history and informations that i never know before. Parking easy to find, spend like 2hr here...would highly recommeded it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
50,Tolerance for All,"This is a small modern structure that is beautifully designed. You should make reservations since some days there are many tour groups including schools. (Groupon requires this).If arriving by car, there is free underground parking and someone will ask you to open your trunk for inspection. At the front desk you purchase or show your tickets and then your purse/bag is checked. A wide upward sloping ramp goes up to the actual main museum and there are elevators if not able to walk up. Black & white photographs of Holocaust survivors line the wallsEvery area has interactive digital and visual presentations. My one complaint is that when listening to one portion I could hear the one coming up next ahead in the background. (A bit distracting especially for kids or adults with attentional issues (who pay attention to everything) or for example those with receptive language disorder).There was no brochure with map and often we were not clear on where to go next if not for someone ahead of us leading us on. I wasn't clear at first when they said the next tour would be in ten minutes. However, it is a self guided tour which operates on a timer, explaining why the doors have a schedule as to when to open up to get in.When the doors opened you walk through as the exhibits light up and fade to alert you it's time to move on. Not a lot of walking between them ( no more than 50 footsteps) with many areas having round silver metal mushroom seats for anyone wanting to sit for 1-3 minutes.) There are many things to read such as letters but only 2-3 people can crowd around at a time and 2 is best.The staff is friendly and helpful. They remind you that the only restrooms in the bldg are ahead to the left of the entrance and checkpoint and no others once they go up. Believe them. This is true!There is a small book store/gift shop on this level with books for children and adults to purchase.There are numerous impactful images but not just those about the Holocaust. There is a whole room wall showing what has happened in a timeline from the past to the present in a world filled with hatred, anger and sadness. Injustice, autocracy, bullying, starvation and suffering are everywhere, not just in the Middle East.It was mind-boggling when seeing the video of the huge ship with over 1500 humans (Jews, /Christians, intellectual scholars, gays and lesbians, political dissidents, disabled mentally or physically challenged children and adults, scientists, teachers, musicians, artists and writers including the newborn and the elderly of our species) leaving Europe in a panic and then being denied safe entry into U.S.A. ports by then President F. D. Roosevelt. They were taken away when landing back where they came from and we all know they were all arrested and likely died there or in the camps. There were only 2-3 blurry videos of mass graves, and nothing that would prevent a mature teen from seeing them.Take your teens and young adults who have never heard about all the many struggles shown here.They will see that the Museum of Tolerance is really about teaching how and why we all need to be tolerant of any human who acts, looks, and thinks differently than we think or are told how to think they should act, look and think.I think of the photo example of how when you crack a brown shell egg and a white shell egg into the frying pan, they look the same. It is inside what counts, not what it looks like on the outside! Inside we are all humans who need to learn how to be tolerant if not naturally tolerant.Going to the Museum of Tolerance would be beneficial to everyone who is yearning for a better world for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
50,Anne Exhibit Outstanding,"Visited the museum with my two daughters (8, 13). Wasn’t entirely sure what to expect but was grateful for the opportunity to experience such a moving exhibit. Here are a few tips:1️⃣ parking is free and in the garage below the building - they have security guard at the entrance who checks driver license and trunk.2️⃣ the main museum exhibits about the holocaust are recommended for kids 12 and older so we decided to view the Anne Frank exhibit, which is recommended for kids 10 and older. Even though our youngest is 8, she kept up and was respectful and engaged the entire time. We did speak with her before entering about the expectations and seriousness of this particular museum.3️⃣ with the single Anne exhibit cost you can roam the entire 2nd floor with additional exhibits as well as listen to the holocaust survivor speakers they feature on the hour. You can also go up to the cafe.4️⃣ there is a small gift shop with some interesting books and gifts. We ended up purchasing a copy of “The Diary Anne Frank” with forward by Eleanor Roosevelt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolofam4

It covers the horrors of the Holocaust AND also includes a real serious message about tolerance of others. It included a multitude of topics including racism, sexism, bullying etc. etc. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MUSEUM! BTW: there is free parking in the building.My only negative is that the floor plan and layouts are a little confusing. I wish they had provided a map to help a visitor get a good orientation of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947
50,Worth a visit to see “Anne”,"We heard that the Anne exhibit was fantastic and we were not disappointed.There were two main exhibits when we went; Anne ($15.50 admission fee) and Holocaust Section ($15.50 admission fee). We decided to only visit the Anne exhibit as we didn’t want to pay $31 for both.Parking is free however so that was a nice plus.You start with an orientation of the exhibit then go on to the tour (we didn’t have one though, we just went to the start of the tour). It starts with two short films about Anne and her family, as well as what it was like during their time. You then go around on a narrated tour looking at items used/photos of the families who were in hiding.The tour ends with a third film in a special dark room which was quite saddening yet interesting to watch.Highlights: all of the items, photos and films perfectly fit in with the theme. The tour was very well done and you could either stay at the narration speed or go off ahead on your own.Lowlights: paying to see the two separate exhibits, each being quite expensive.If they ever had another exhibit like this one I would go again as I know it would be planned to perfection with all details looked into with great research and accuracy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb
50,Excellent Presentation of Holocaust and Other Issues,"We only had a 2.5 hours here and during that time we interacted with an interesting presentation about the Holocaust. Despite knowing quite a bit already, it was both very touching and added information.There was material on other forms of hate and discrimination, and we hardly had time for it.A huge bonus for us was that a Holocaust survivor spoke at a 12pm talk. This was also moving and informative.I am surprised we had not heard of this museum before this trip. It's definitely a must-see in Los Angeles if you are interested in learning ore about our own inhumanity. Definitely seems relevant in these times of anger and hate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extrospect472

What an amazing discovery about important subject matter in this day and age. We spent 4 hours there, learned a lot about tolerance and intolerance in this country and world-wide; and we kept remarking that this is an unknown treasure in LA, that needs to be discovered. The only negative was the snack bar/café that left much to be desired -- drab surroundings and a limited menu; and the museum store that was rather small.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913alm

The museum is informative and interactive, making it meaningful and comfortable to visit at the same time. But by ""comfortable"", of course, I am by no means referring to the content itself, but how the museum is designed to friendly lead the visitors using sensors and speakers (The exhibits would start ""talking"" when you are in front of them) and to help people who are not familiar enough with the history to understand with ease. At the end of day, you will walk out of the museum feeling painful, but with your heart full. (I'm putting this in parenthesis since it won't change my 5-star rating, but still- I wish all the technology used could be well maintained since some buttons were not working when we were there, and some devices simply stand on the tables without any instruction).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qinghuix

The museum offers a pseudo guided tour around a holocaust exhibition and if you at fortunate then an opportunity to hear from a holocaust survivor. Although the holocaust exhibit is probably the main highlight, I found the reflections on modern day intolerance and violence an excellent exhibit. Worth going to this museum but do expect to spend 2/3hrs here at a minimum. Its also worth a mention that you can book tickets online as there are time slots to help with crowd control, i.e. School tours, but they were kind enough to let me enter an hour early than my slot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hichu

40,Well Done,"The Holocaust exhibits provide video representation of German history and events leading up to WWII and the Holocaust. It is well done. Our walking tour was conducted by a daughter of Holocaust survivors. It provides a sober and impactful portrayal of this dark history. There is also an Anne Franke exhibit which we did not partake. This museum is worthy of your time. The only complaint that we would have is that you progress through various periods. The video is, at times, not loud enough and you can hear video from other areas of the exhibit. Headsets would be a much improved option. there is a great deal to learn and it is disappointing that large groupsmay not hear all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiseppeGord

50,Well Done Historical Experience,"This Museum is different from others in that it provided a excellent look into the Holocaust and separate Anne Frank diary and events during this period. We took the interactive holocaust tour first which lasted about 1.5 hours. This tour was excellent because it provided an easy to understand historical account for the history before, during and after the holocaust. It made us think more than just view history. We then took the Anne Frank tour which lasted a little more than a hour. This was well done and a good partner with the first tour. Our teenage kids stated engaged the whole time and came out with a better understanding and appreciation for a sad time in history.

10,"For children, but more a lesson in propaganda than a museum","It's not a museum so much as an onslaught of reminders that humanity can be horrendous. For education in the Holocaust one should be reading and watching documentaries, not using a one hour walk through as a substitute for education and critical thought. While certain themes were excellent, the concept is mixed up and somewhat unclear, though one can guess that it's meant to warn us against another Holocaust. The problem with that is that horrendous genocides still occur today and I wonder how many people actually walk out of this exhibit with solid plans of action. Leery of the fact that the ONLY Muslim representation I saw was negative. I would not allow my own children to attend and believe critical thought and actually travel is what grows a mind and heart.

If you already know the history, have had sensitivity training, etc., it's still powerful--an important refresher. Quite a few of the exhibits need just a little more framing or more clarity in the directions or information. It's not 100% clear how to experience the exhibit. For example, one more sentence would have helped clarify the intent of the choose-a-door prejudiced/not prejudiced exhibit. I have no doubt that the museum does great with programs for schoolchildren or tolerance training to educators.

That plan ended once we heard the speaker talk.She was 7 years old in Budapest when she was separated from her family and sent to a concentration camp. Now 80 years of age, she shared her story with grace and details only one who was there could talk about.She really distilled the essence of the horror of it all in a very personal way, one that went beyond what more abstract readings of the camps could give.

When we got there we were told there was a 30 minute wait because of a school group. The rude woman at the reception desk said the only way to get in sooner was to pay the up charge for a special exhibit. We asked to use the rest rooms and were told we could not because the rest rooms were in the museum and we could not enter for 30 minutes. That's outrageous.

Enjoyed the art exhibit, the garden, & the architecture. Started out on the Holocaust exhibit and turned back. Been to many, and found it too emotional, but definitely will convey the horrors of the time & be most worthwhile for the deniers & those with little knowledge of the Holocaust.

50,"Important History, Moving Speakers","This museum focuses a lot on the rise of Hitler and the importance of paying attention to demagogues as well as focusing on the events that followed his rise and the Holocaust. This was very interesting and well done. On a small technical note the exhibit runs on a timer so it guides you through by lighting up the part of the exhibit you are supposed to look at. This was oddly confusing at times and certain parts would start playing while another nearby part was also playing, making it hard to hear. Could do with some slight changes/better directions in that regard. The absolute best part were the speakers. They had three Holocaust survivors speak at 1,2 and 3pm the day I went. The speaker I listened too was engaging, poignant and it was an honor to have her come share her story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magellan1492
50,Never Forgot the Experience,I first attended this museum for a field trip when I was in private school at young age.

It starts out gently, discussing the history and development of anti-semitism in Europe, with dioramas depicting people (narration gave each persons' history) and conversations , nd segues to graphic illustrations of the horrors of Kristallnacht and the concentration camps. Take tissues - many patrons were openly sobbing. If anyone has any doubt that the Holocaust was real, they need to go to MOT.The Anne Frank exhibit was likewise very moving. I learned much more about her life and circumstances than I expected. I didn't realize she died only a few weeks before the Liberation. The artifacts are well-presented, and the narration of the slides was wonderful.The ""Museum of Tolerance"" part was a snore.

50,Emotional and Informative,"Los Angeles offers visitors to the city many world class museum options. My wife and I walked out of the building three hours after entering and felt transformed. We comfortably watched films, read commentary, retraced history, participated in exhibits, heard guest speakers in a modern multi-story building and never felt rushed or crowded. The abundant information complimented the emotional impact rather than sanitize it and we never felt drained or offended. Finally, hearing a Holocaust survivor speak in person humanized the visit and made the experience all the more memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaela108
50,Amazing and Inspiring - A Must See,"This is an experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life. While it is an emotionally packed experience, it is also inspiring. The Museum is very well laid out and the exhibits are exceptional. The focal point upon entry is a beautiful and wide spiral staircase that has photos all the way down. These are the photos of some survivors and their quotes. You find words of love, hope, compassion and of the strength of the human spirit. I found it uplifting to the soul to read their quotes.The main museum exhibits are the holocaust museum and the tolerancenter - which is a more contemporary look at intolerance in the world today but carries a message to help us learn how we can each help. The exhibit is interactive and engaging.The holocaust museum is so well done. It does an excellent job of describing the events leading up to, and during the holocaust. The tour is self-guided and you go in groups. You go through various exhibits - paced with the Audio/Visual guides that lead you through each group of exhibits. It is thoughtful and educational and engrossing. There are places to sit at various stages for those who find standing for an hour and a half or so to be taxing. The progression of the tour is well done, and you are not rushed - there is time between the end of one section and the start of the next for you to stop and look at the exhibit before moving on.On the day we went, they had four holocaust survivors speaking. We listened to one of them and it was an experience that is unforgettable. What she said rang true, she was the last of a generation who would be able to speak about their experiences first hand. I am glad that we were able to listen to her speak.The special exhibit is the Anne Frank Exhibit - which is well worth the extra ticket. From her life before the war, to the fate of the family and the others in the Secret Annex, we get an excellent insight and view into her life.The museum is appropriate for adults and there were children as well. In the Tolerancenter - there are videos that have a warning that the images might be disturbing to young children - as they show the aftermath of several tragedies but otherwise - it would be good for children middle school and older to go through. There were several smaller children the day we went who went through the holocaust museum section with us that didn't seem bothered - but the exhibit is never gory but there are brief photos of the dead that are shown in places.They do have a cafeteria on site that had good food - which is good because you are unable to bring in anything other than bottled water - so you can eat there rather than leaving to walk to find another place to eat. They have salads, sandwiches and grilled items that are made fresh.For anybody who has avoided going here because they think it might be too sad - in all of the sorrow and horror - hope lives and the lessons learned will help us, and every future generation help to make the world a better place. While I had tears in my eyes at times, there is also so many stories of how many people, regular people, did what they could do help. Tremendous acts of courage and compassion in the face of all of the fear and horror. While sad, this is also one of the most inspiring places that I have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minerva451
50,A trek through some of history's darkest and most treacherous days!,"Take a day or afternoon and spend it at the Museum of Tolerance (MOT) in Los Angeles. It is a trek through some of humanity's darkest and most treacherous days, mostly concentrated in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The majority of the Museum centers around its Holocaust exhibit where I spent most of my time. The Racism & Prejudice exhibit is also a must see for every one as well as the Anne Frank display! A visit to the MOT entails a certain degree of reflection and insight, and you will leave the museum with a different perspective if you allow yourself the opportunity. I truly think the world would be a better place if everyone could make the effort or have the opportunity to visit the MOT and learn about pivotal historical moments that are often swept under the rug by modern society. The MOT really captures the ugly side of history which must be studied and reflected upon in addition to the 'pretty' side of history which is so often given preference. For after all, it is by learning from the mistakes of our past that we do not repeat them in the future. Though you will probably leave the museum feeling heavy from its slight intensity, you will be eager to share your experiences with others and make a positive difference in the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmllhughes5
50,Exceptional!,Truly one of the best museums I've ever been to! I was lucky to listen to a live presentation for one of the few holocaust survivors for in which he talked about his sufferings and how he survived from the horrific holocaust.The holocaust exhibition is one of a kind. Very engaging and keeps you want to learn more. It's very sad though and I felt sick at the end of my almost 3 hour visit because of how bad and intense it was back in the day.Don't miss the chance to go there! Don't say you haven't been told; I already did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMS_1194
50,Very inspiring,"This place was very interesting. We took the self guided tour through the holocaust museum and I thought it was very well done. I noticed there are a number of exhibits with burned out bulbs which I think was a minor distraction but the message was still obvious. I think everyone should see it but what I thought was worth commentary is that we had our car searched and my license was requested before parking. I noticed there were no muslims at the museum, those who seem to be the most intolerant of our society. I also noticed and heard messaging that it seems everyone except them needs to be tolerant. I think I would rethink that notion.Highlight was listening to a holocaust survivor tell her story. She had to be 94-95 yrs old and retold her story as if it happened last week with such vivid detail. It's not the first time I've listened to a survivor but her story was riveting and really capped off the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beauchicken
50,Moving Experience,This museum takes a long time to go through. We moved from space to space as directed by sounds and lights. Nothing is left to the imagination.A stellar experience - the Anne Frank exhibit also moving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWMtravels
50,Great place to visit,Great place to visit. Enjoyed the Anne Frank exhibit. A good place to have such an exhibit since she was fascinated by Hollywood. Her large portrait looks out towards the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jal07
50,Extraordinary and emotionally moving,"I was quite impressed by this museum. It is well worth a visit. The docents are kind and very knowledgable. The museum has unexpected components that deal not only with the holocaust, but all sorts of human rights violations, through history, and throughout the world. A small part of the exhibition is outdated, as the statistics are a few years old, but mostly, it is spot on! I want to return sometime as the is much to read about and experience. The Jewish Holocaust related material is well done, and it is easily to be moved to tears many times. The gist shop upstairs has the really nice jewelry and stuff, while the ground floor gift shop has music posters and books - good books. They have materials on the civil rights movement, Native American struggles and much more. I highly recommend this museum, even if it is a bit out of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleschip2019
40,Get tickets online before you go,"I arrived early on a Wednesday and was excited to see that two holocaust survivors would be speaking that afternoon. Unfortunately there were a lot of school groups and tickets were sold out until the late afternoon. I didn't think to buy tickets ahead of time, but wish I had so I didn't miss the speakers. I headed over to the annenberg space for photography to wait (free, 15 min walk from museum), which had an exhibit on refugees. It was very interesting to see such moving photos and then come back to the museum and learn about tolerance. Great exhibit on bullying that the students were very into. Give yourself 2+hours to see everything. Definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/768katherines
50,Exceptional,"Hard to do tough subjects in a compelling way, but this museum succeed in all visual and engaging ways to be provocative, illuminating and powerful. Permanent exhibit is stellar, but the Anne Frank exhibit is off the chart. Just when you think you've read, seen, heard all you can or might want to about Anne Frank, here is an exhibit that opens your mind with a creative display that engages multiple senses in multiple ways. A must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Life-Changing Experience,"I visited this museum as a class trip. I don't know how the museum operates normally, but there were docents that guided us around the exhibits and were very informative. Even the Anne Frank exhibit was visited, which is a story about her life through exhibits in various rooms. Some objects are very symbolic and add great meaning to the visit. However, some of the exhibits contain dated information, and according to my teachers, some of the information was incorrect. Other than that I enjoyed the experience very much and I hope I can visit it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtraveler267
40,Serious place of meditation and reflection,This museum is somewhat camouflaged by its location. It's on an unassuming block in a relatively lackluster neighborhood. But the exhibits and the depth of presentation on the issue of the Holocaust and other world genocides is impressive. The exhibits are well-curated and informative and the layout is easy to navigate. Check out the displays on current issues in America and the modern media.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcduncan2001
40,"Education, Tolerance & History ...","The Museum of Tolerance is an outstanding collection of historical items, artifacts & ephemera primarily focused on the 1933-45 Nazi Germany era, but with asides to post war examples as well. Staff is knowledgeable and very helpful. Superbly presented so that learning & understanding is forthcoming. Worth the visit. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Maybe I wasn't focusing on the right things.,"When we got there, we were given an orientation time on a ticket. So we wandered outside to the courtyard. There we found cement pieces big enough to trip on and what I think we're lights sticking up out of the cement about a half inch, big enough to trip you too. After wandering around we went in to use the bathroom facilities. I guess someone lost the key, because the paper towel bin had been ripped off the wall and was sitting next to where it was suppose to be installed. While waiting for our time to enter, we picked up a paper with info about a movie showing upstairs about Ceased Chavez. Finally, we realized that although there was an employee standing at the entrance to the circular ramp to the other floors, no one seemed to be waiting for the entrance time on their ticket. So we asked and found out we didn't need to wait until that time to enter. Well that was annoying. We decide to go see the movie upstairs playing in just a few minutes. No one was waiting to see the movie and someone asked if we needed help. Oh, they weren't showing that movie anymore. She tried to upload it for us, but it had already been removed from the laptop player. Uh, okay. We went downstairs to see the interactive display. DANG, the air conditioning wasn't working so we sweated through that hour and a half diorama presentation. Gave a little more feeling to the suffering. LOL. Once we got out of there we entered an area where the air conditioning was working. There didn't seem to be any signs to indicate where to start the next part of the self guided tour. Everything seems to be on a timer, so the fake restaurant area and whatever that was next to it that you had to press the A B C D buttons, wasnt working the first time we went in to check them out. Overall, I think something good for school kids, but as an adult I think I could see the same info on The History Channel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynellaJ

50,"Be Ready to Leave Crying, but, Go Anyway.","The Museum of Tolerance is, for the most part, dedicated to the victims of Hitler's reign. It is a great place for most ages. I would not take a child under 9, because it is very upsetting. It reminds of all of what can happen when we don't stand up to hate. The exhibits are almost too real, but so needed and so emotionally moving. Go there, leave crying, we all do, but know that you were just reminded that we are all in this together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Everyone should experience this,"I live in LA and have always wanted to go but I was concerned that it would be too depressing. It was so eye opening and a regret not going sooner. Everyone knows the basics and some know more but this experience cannot be missed. The way in which the information is communicated is very well done.Make sure you leave enough time to experience everything. I was there for 3 and a half hours and still missed one of the exhibits. It was very cold in the exhibit so make sure you are prepared.Most importantly, they have speakers every day. These speakers may be survivors or as in my case the story of a 12 years old Jewish boy who was able flee in time and eventually come back to fight in the war against the Nazis. Do not miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauratR6495KD
50,"Moving, Inspiring, Beautiful","I went here for a school field trip and it was breathtaking. I don't even think we got through the whole museum, but the parts we did see were amazing. The holocaust section was striking. There were some modernized touches, like lit up vignette areas explaining things. The exhibits were so chilling, including a section designed for Auschwitz-Birkenau. They held some of the actual artifacts from it, and included a testimony hall where you could hear the words of survivors. I heard from one of the survivors himself, and I couldn't help but be in tears. He told me ""you will remember me,"" and I certainly will for the rest of my life. This is a beautiful museum and it really opens your eyes to just everything that happened. I don't recommend it for anyone who is super nervous or pent up about historic events like genocide, and I don't think it would be great for young kids. Maybe about 12 and up, with the understanding that you show respect at all times, because it is such a huge sentiment. I encourage you to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmalQ2854AC
40,A great history of the Holocaust...,"As a history teacher, I had high hopes for this museum. We got discounted admissions through an online re-seller, and made reservations for a Sunday morning. Interactive exhibits, which are heavy on reading. The auto-guided tour of the Holocaust is informative, but runs over an hour. I guess, having visited the National Holocaust Memorial in DC as well as visited some camps in Europe, that I wasn't expecting to learn anything 'new', but impressed overall with the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttaylo3
50,Very moving,This is beautiful place. Teaching tolerance to improve our world. We can all learn something here. Call for tickets or sometimes you can find them on goldstar. Be sure to make a reservation. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bethlinda
10,I am intolerant of the Museum of Tolerance,"Museum of Tolerance badly signed so you can't find parking garage or even the building, badly conceived, badly planned, badly logistically considered, badly explained, badly acted, bad seating, bad lighting you can't even read the exhibits, badly paced, bad idea to force people through to hit timed movies, badly structured, badly fit-together, badly thought about acoustics, badly informed public, badly everything - well built though - bad idea to force people to keep moving unless the whole exercise was supposed to simulate the humiliation and degradation of the people who really did have to take the journey to the concentration camps!!Are you trying to create intolerance of the Museum of Tolerance? Because that's how you create intolerance of the Museum of Intolerance. Mother. Now who's got some Glengoolie Blue?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cubecritter
40,"Interesting, educational museum","This was the second time we visited the museum. We received a free discount for the Anne Frank exhibit, which was very educational and interesting. I highly recommend that for future visitors. I also appreciated the coverage of other marginalized groups, such as the Mendez vs Westminster case, which I knew little about. Be sure to bring your ID, which you will need to show at the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625krispyd
20,Could be so much more,"The bottom museum has a modern world and a WWII Holocaust section. The modern world wants you to realize the power of words, but it doesn't help people understand how to think. They could have discussed ethos, pathos, logos. They could have helped viewers spot bias, or introduced propaganda and discussed the advertising tricks used to sway the masses (bandwagon effect, etc.) I know many school groups attend the museum, a huge opportunity to teach critical thinking skills was lost. For example, they had a poll about the Syrian refugees but didn't provide any background information or pros/cons to letting them enter the country. Also, WWII side had to be done slowly in a group--too controlling and claustrophobic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
50,"A panorama of civil rights, intolerance and genocide","We were not aware that picture ID was required to enter. I had left everything at our hotel. Fortunately, my husband had ID and eventually, the security guard allowed us to enter, but only after extensive questioning. We had not made reservations and the museum was not busy on the Sunday morning that we were there.There are guides throughout the museum who advise you how to use the interactive displays. In order to understand the message, you must invest the time to read the displays. We spent over two hours there and felt that we needed at least 1-2 more hours.Very highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninapo
20,Must get reservations!,"Sure, the web site I looked at weeks ahead of time ""recommends"" reservations, but it should explain that a timed reservation is REQUIRED. We arrived at 10:30 on an off season Tuesday and were told we could not get in till after noon. Like many tourists, we had other things to do that day and could not wait that long. The receptionist rather curtly stated that the web site suggested reservations. When planning this trip I did get specific reservations for other things when it was required and I followed instructions to arrive at the Science Center after 1:00 to avoid the school groups. However, this web site was not that specific. It should be much clearer. Maybe next trip...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chl0e48
30,"Moving subject, disappointing exhibit","This review is just for the Anne Frank exhibit. First of all it was moving and inspirational because it was Anne Frank's story and words. It would be hard not to be moved by it. However the exhibit was a disappointment to us. The exhibit was almost entirely audio/video with reproduced artifacts and pictures. Also it was very controlling. You have to move from one section to the next with the audio. When one of my younger kids move ahead before he should have we were reminded by staff that this is not how it works. It is more of a scripted tour/movie experience than anything else and for the price we paid it was a huge disappointment. We could have just watched a documentary and looked at some pictures online and had the same experience. I also found the staff somewhat disconnected, they did not seem to enjoy being there at all. The security guard at the parking area was awesome though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingmeand3
40,Fresh Glimpse into Power of Anne Frank as a Writer!,"In some ways, Anne Frank was the original blogger. This exhibit highlights her letters to cousins pre-hiding and then brings her diaries to life with family photos and memorabilia of the time. The timing is a bit rushed - would be better if guests could control the audio. We also toured near a volunteer who was giving a tour to another guest - it was a bit distracting to hear the audio and him talking at the same time. That said - I highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCKi
40,Better than D.C.,"I would have given this a 5 star, but it was a bit confusing how to get a personal child card at the beginning. Otherwise, the Holocaust part of the tour was very informative, with good pacing throughout, and not too overwhelming with detail. The heart-wrenching stories and graphic videos/pictures might be too overwhelming for young children, however. The highlight was listening to the amazing story of Jean Greenstein, a 91-year-old survivor who miraculously survived the Nazis, the Hungarians, the Russians, and all that time posing as a German soldier and working for the underground to save fellow Jews from Auschwitz. His 93-year-old sister was also present. She had survived concentration camps, and both of them were reunited in Romania. Sadly, their parents and siblings did not survive. The tolerance section of the museum was all right, but it almost seemed like an after thought. The upstairs immigration section, although intended to be contemporary, is outdated. In order to draw more young people who probably did not know Joe Torre, Billy Crystal, or Carlos Santana, more recent immigrants might help. The idea of portraying home life in an artistic and personal way, however, works. My wife said the Museum of Tolerance was much better than the Holocaust Museum in D.C.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyw1992
50,Rememberance,"Excellent museum of the Holocast. Not an easy thing to witness let alone review, but very well done and poignant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divabo
20,Very disappointing,"The Museum of Tolerance does convey the horrific information about the Holocaust. This is important to share. There's no denying that. However, we had a very disappointing experience. First, visitors must be aware that this is NOT a museum where you will be allowed to explore at your pace and take in what you wish. You will be controlled and directed. We were VERY put off by the aggressiveness of the first employee (Kenya) we encountered. She was stern in her tone and not welcoming at all. We wanted to linger for a moment to see the Simon Wiesenthal information, but were told ""no"" and directed to the start of the exhibit. Once in, the automatic doors open and then close behind you. You are in darkness and must listen to the recorded options that take you through. It's all very scripted. The unfortunate part is that some of the audio from one side of the exhibit leaks into your area as well. So you get distracted listening to what you're hearing and then the next portion. (Plus, there was a crying baby in the group before us...in the closed space, that echoed.) You see some images and are moved along to the next section. We did not like this at all. We were also disappointed with how much emphasis is on the Jewish experience. While it's very important, everything else seems to be a secondary issue. Little is said about Darfur, Armenia or other genocide. It's there, but literally gets a sentence or two. You get the feeling that it's bad, but there's no in-depth information. Further, modern day issues such as Matthew Shepard are addressed, but the situation gets about three paragraphs on the wall and nothing more. Videos show events such as the Selma to Montgomery March and school integration, but there is nothing nearby to explain it. If you aren't familiar with what you are looking at (or even who the major players are that are shown throughout), you are NOT going to learn from this video. There are not captions and nothing to provide insight. As you leave, there is a VERY cheesy futuristic (pseudo Star Trek) looking room where you can sit to be quizzed on events. It's all fine and well, but we had to wait for the looping video to restart and then the scoring screens didn't work. As we exited, we noticed the guy at the welcome desk just sitting with his iPad playing video games. In the gift shop, where we hoped to find books that we could read on various topics, we instead encountered a CD player blasting Bob Seger's ""Night Moves"" and the attendant singing along. Hmmm...not exactly the respectful atmosphere I expected while looking at information about Anne Frank and pondering a purchase of ""Night and Fog."" Finally, I think there is great opportunity lost here. If we're to make a difference, as this museum seems to stress, there is no information about WHAT would work and why. There is nothing that offers ideas or concepts on moving forward in a powerful way. We left, still stung by Kenya's attitude from the start, and then more of an emptiness because so much bad can happen in this world...but what can be done to make it better? We were first time visitors. I will not go again and do not recommend this venue. You do not get your money's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chgo919
50,Interesting and inspirational,"This place an eye opener and very well put together. I love museums and this one was a great place to come to. Sad and intriguing to hear the history of the all who was lost and the end result of the Holocaust.

The exhibit has a lot of Anne Franks original letters and correspondence and photos! I thought the young adults with us had read the book. They had heard of the book and want to read it now! The tour guides you through Anne's life before and during the war.You come out having the experience of knowing what it was like for a young girl and herfamily being Jewish during that horrible time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcd931
50,I recommend very highly,My husband and I decided to go in to have a look and spend a good part our the day visiting the permanent exhibit about the Shoah and also visited the special exhibition about Anne Frank. The whole museum is very interesting and the fact that you walk in groups with or without a guide is great! We also listened to a fascinating 91year old survivor telling his story.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgross135

Tour takes about one and half to two hours depending how much you study the displays.My biggest tip is look for discounts on the internet. Groupon sometimes has 2 for 1 tickets.

Most discount advise to MAKE RESERVATIONS prior to attending as the event may and will sell out.Parking is free; however, first come first serve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arbyboy
50,A must-see,"In late April 2015, along with a friend, we visited the Museum of Tolerance, in Los Angeles. The Holocaust Tour is about 1 1/2 hours. One moves from area to area, guided by lighting and the dialogue from the previous venue. There is seating at each place. Through pictures, video clips, moving characters [?] one is given a glimpse of the issues leading up to WWII and the Holocaust. This can be a haunting and profound experience for some. The day we were there, we were very privileged to listen to a Holocaust survivor tell his story, in the Theatre [about 2 hours in length.] There are also other venues, other issues to explore, but we did not have enough time for this. Take some time to stroll in the courtyard and see the Holocaust Memorial. If you go, please allow most of a day to view this museum [we only had the afternoon, and it was not enough time].",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revdj
50,Amazing and inspiring,"This museum is a hidden gem. It had so much information regarding not only the Holocaust, but discrimination and lack of Tolerance in general. I was there as an educator with a group, and our tour was brief, with workshops attached as professional development.

50,A must visit for all ages as you cannot learn enough about history,We happened upon this as we were staying nearby.

And then a history of the holocaust and other world terrors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Italianshopper
50,Awareness is key,I have been given the job in administration and with it comes many responsabilities. When I had been in the classroom it was imperative to get inner-city kids to become aware of those outside their city limits. The idea of tolerance is difficult for upper elementary and junior high students as they have issues unique to the age. So to bring them to the museum was a must. Now that I'm out of the classroom it is even more important to make sure that new teachers to our district is just as aware!!! When the actual survivors come and are able to be interviewed and you're able to ask questions and share with them.... priceless!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4-421
50,Really emotional,Wow what a great museum. It has an emotional insight to such human injustices.I saw a number of short movies inside as exhibits which added to the experience.It covered a number of subjects from the holocaust to the la riots.I recommend this to anyone visiting Los Angeles and especially to locals.

The museum is very well set up for groups, and there were lots of school groups the day I visited. It did not detract for a moment, as the museum is very large.Focussing very much on Jewish experiences, the museum is not limited to the Jewish experience, but is a call for understanding, education and tolerance of all.Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl

50,EXCELLENT!,"This museum was designed in such a way that there's something for every age. It was informative, interactive, interesting, educational and fairly priced. There were so many different cultures and religions present, because this concept applies to every living human being. The take home message is that we can never turn a blind eye to any misjustice that is occuring anywhere in the world, because the world is getting smaller each day!! Each person can and should do something in their comfort zone to make a difference in the world. My teens loved this museum!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3128JSsharong
40,Everyone should see this,"Tolerance is in short supply among many individuals and groups. This museum could change that, hopefully. It's a bit overwhelming and very sad. Allow a lot of time to read everything and take it all in. Get a good kosher lunch (great falafel) to give yourself a break. The Anne Frank exhibit costs extra but is totally worth it. Our only disappointment was with the gift shop, which was closed for inventory although it was supposed to have been finished. We'd all received their catalogs for years and were anxious to make purchases in person, and we kept checking back but were never allowed in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961nancyw
40,Beautiful and sad,"I've been only on Anne Frank exhibit, which depicts a sad moment in the story of humanity. There is several objects that were used by Anne Frank's family, pieces of her diary and documentaries that help us to understand a little bit more about Anne Frank, her dreams and her sorrow. Beautiful and sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PedroHGS
50,"Reflection, inspiration and celebration of courage","Having been to the Holocaust museum in DC and the Jewish museum in Berlin, my husband and I were excited to visit MOT in our own city. We were also using a Groupon that was about to expire. We arrived early Sunday afternoon and easily parked across the street in the Chase bank parking lot. There was a line of about 20 individuals and when we arrived at the counter, we were informed that the Holocaust exhibit was closed due to computer issues. Thankfully, we opted to see the other exhibits and have our ticket extended for a return.We explored the tolerance center for about an hour and enjoyed the historical accounts of many marginalized populations and individuals including a current perspective on bullying. At 2PM, we discovered that a holocaust survivor was going to be presenting her story. We quickly made our way to the small theatre where Elizabeth Mann was waiting for the audience to arrive. She was sitting in a chair with a microphone and appeared physically frail but mentally lucid. As an 89 yr. old with a vivid history that began in a fairly affluent Jewish family living in Budapest to an inmate at Auschwitz, she was truly inspirational. As we listened to her story for almost 2 hours, we did not want the “movie” to end. Her final words were “as long as you have life, there is hope……and with hope, there is success”.As we left, my husband and I were energized and filled with hope and inspiration. We knew that our experience was unparalleled and remarkably unique. We plan to return and see the remainder of the exhibits knowing that we will need to reserve more time. We highly recommend a visit that includes the testimonies of survivors and Ms. Mann was a fantastic speaker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherrieseg
50,Amazing experience,"I attended a conference at the museum and I cannot say enough about how everyone should visit. I was fortunate enough to meet a Holocaust survivor, Mr. Morris Price. Hearing his story of survival was life changing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseD3342
50,A Great Educational Experience,"There is not much that needs to be said about such a powerful place. Not for the young, but ages 11/12 and up, a great educational tool for kids and adults to learn about our society no matter what religion or race one comes from. A must if you are in the Los Angeles area...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWorldWide2014
40,Well done!,"Wonderfully informative and well presented. This was interactive and was more then just looking at pictures. Each section can take 1-1 1/2 hours and there are 3 sections plus the Anne Frank exhibit (not sure if this is a temporary exhibit and does have an additional cost). I would recommend this for adults and teens, not for small children because some of the material could be graphic for littles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260liza
50,Extremely well Done. Shocking. Informative. Necessary. Bring your friends and family. Go!,"I was brought here by a dear friend yesterday. I live in the Netherlands and these events happened on my Back door step. The Museum is well designed and you can absorb all the important information well as it is so realistic. This Museum elicits from you sadness, anger, disbelief, compassion and hope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammysue
40,Both educational and interesting,"It is hard to find a museum that holds the interest of a 12 year old boy, but this one met that challange. The exhibits are very well done, and you will learn a few things even if well versed on the topic. There are a few hands-on activities, although we didn't have time to take part. The reviews are right, you will need 2-3 hours to spend here. One reason is the holocaust section, which will take at least 50 minutes due to a series of scenes that light up and provide audio as you walk through, basically controlling the time you spend unless you want to miss something. Overall, it was a very worthwhile experience and I wish we had more time to spend there. Parking is underground and free, but there is a cost of admission. Security to park and to enter mimics airport security for some reason; not an issue but I though it was a bit silly for a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justusor
50,Wish i had more time!,"If you are interested in this please make sure you have plenty of time. We were running short on time so I wasn't able to enjoy it to the fullest. But what I did see I was really impressed with. It just so happened they had a group, looked like school kids, that was listening to a survivor. It was fascinating to hear her personal story! You also were given a card of a person who went thru the holocaust and were able to see their story and print it out at the end of the tour. Like I said, leave plenty of time to really enjoy the museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsander4
50,This is Great !,We took our grandkids (13 and 11) to this museum during our vacation in LA. We had previously visited a Holocaust Museum and we really didn't know what to expect here. But we were absolutely thrilled. The staff here is great and very patient and helpful. I think the section on current intolerance is a great educational experience without being too rough for kids. I think our grandkids learned a lot from this visit. Everything is first class and I think very honest and necessary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IverJohnson
50,Amazing interactive experience,"The Museum of tolerance is... Wow. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The Holocaust wing was the most interactive exhibit I've ever seen, all with movies and dioramas. Without ruining the surprise, you end up in a to-scale replica gas chamber! The staff all seem like they love their jobs and it made the whole visit that much better. Definitely worthwhile if you're in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuixotixAU
50,Everyone needs this education.,"Museum provides an education that everyone can benefit from, regardless of religion, race, level of education, or knowledge of the Holocaust and history. The museum is also great for youngsters, presenting the information in a way they'll understand and benefit from, without being too graphic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetFancyMoses
50,So realistic and educational.,"This place will give us all a large amount of goosebumps due to the gruesome, cruelty that the jews endured. You will get an insight of all that went on and let me tell you that, you will shed some tears. Some of the survivors may be there and tell you about their personal experience if you go in an educational group. It is so realistic that as soon as you get out of their you will feel like you lived it. They have all kinds of different attractions such as; sitting down and pretend dining where the germans sat down and ate, being able to see actual footage of concentration camps,babies being thrown out windows etc. God bless all jews and my respects ♥",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WSING
40,Great for kids but used to be better when it was more hands-on.,"This was the perfect length for kids and the digital generation. We did the Anne Frank exhibit, which was narrated well by actress Hailee Steinfeld. We really loved learning so many more details about Anne Frank's family life and how they managed to hide out for so long. I learned a lot. There were lots of original photos and artifacts. The main exhibit was also well-paced and enjoyable for kids. The kids really felt close to their ""child"" they received at the start and to hear about their fate at the end was intense. However, having the entire journey narrated through video and moving as a group had less of an impact than when I went there as young person. Back then there were more artifacts like the clothing, toys, and other real objects that make a museum more impactful than pictures and videos with narration. But for introducing this generation to the issue, it's great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HumboldtWoman
50,Very moving,This was the second time we visited this museum. The first time was over 20 years ago. This time we only visited the new AnnFrank exhibit. We found it very moving and emotional. It is told from the perspective of Ann's father who was the only family member to survive the holocaust. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnthegoDelrayBeach
40,"So much to see, so little time","After arriving at the Museum of Tolerance, we saw that the guest speakers had already started, so we rushed to the second floor. Not the best move since we missed getting an overview of the museum from the greeter who explains where everything is. We just wanted to get in to hear the speakers as it was already 1:30 and the session began at 1. That day, the speakers were: a Holocaust survivor, and a Racist/Gay partnership whose lives connected then reconnected at this museum. Very touching stories and short video, that won an Academy Award nomination. After hearing the speakers, we wandered aimlessly around the museum not knowing what to see first with our limited time. The museum was closing at 5 on the Friday and we had a lot to cover in 3 1/2 hours. My husband went off one way, and I went another. At the end of the day, we met up, but I had missed, what he said, was an incredible, moving, Holocaust section. I walked in to the end of that section when I asked one of the volunteers if there was anything left that I could see that would be the most valuable, and she said to come through the back door to the gas chamber to hear the final video, which I did. Sadly, I didn't get to go through the entire section, which my husband said was the best exhibit. There's always next time. All in all, the museum offers different areas of tolerance, whether it be Bullying, Racial, Holocaust, along with other areas, the whole concept was fascinating. I highly recommend stopping in at this museum if you are in the L.A. area. I will definitely be returning to see the areas I missed the first time, and to hear more speakers, who usually start speaking around 12 p.m. Plan on a full day if you want to cover everything. School groups come through as well, but we were lucky that it wasn't busy that day, so we could move quickly through all the exhibits. Great way to spend our first day in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ejas12345
50,For people of all ages wanting to better understand the Holocaust,"The museum is relatively large and has different sections and also stages various activities and programs. So to really optimize your time there, it's best to check the website for all that is happening on your chosen day to visit. If you're lucky you'll be able to attend a presentation by a distinguished visitor speaking on some aspect of the Holocaust. Bernie Elias, first cousin of the little Jewish girl [and author] Ann Frank of Amsterdam, together with his wife, made a presentation to a group of school kids and docents, with tremendous meaning for all present. Some of the exhibits cover the profound cruelty and violence of that part of history, but in a measured way. For teens and adults the museum has the great advantage of going into some depth as to the behaviors and motivations of the perpetrators. Indispensable for anyone seeking a full grasp of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisandroVoyager
50,Great visit,"The layout is a little confusing and backtracking but overall I highly recommend the museum. It is a Holocaust museum but teaches about tolerance for all, not just Jewish. The Holocaust Museum in DC is one of a kind and something hard to compare it to but MOT is just as good. While I was there they had an ""Anne"" exhibit that was very well put together, one of a kind expression of her story. They also can have a number of survivors speak, which can be emotional too. I think it is important to tell the story, that are getting to be so few left, it is important that we do not forget.The Gift shop was very small and the guy behind the counter was on the phone on a personal call while waiting on customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paula885
50,Life experiences,"The Museum of Tolerance is one of those ""must see in your lifetime"" experiences. Looking back at past atrocities, as well as those happening today, gives the viewer an opportunity to see the world from a different and unique perspective. It is a history lesson that looks at all that can be bad in the world, as well as all that can and is good. I don't recommend taking young children as some of the exhibits are graphic, and call ahead to make reservations because they often sell out.There is a restaurant upstairs that serves kosher food that is reasonably priced and good. Parking is in their own multi-level underground structure.There is a lot of security, probably because they don't want anything to happen here. They're not friendly, but everyone else is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScooterBillionaire
20,Museum of Intolerance,"We went there January 2014 and I was disappointed over all. Some staff were surly but there were some great displays and dramatic presentations. About 2/3 to 3/4 of the material delt with intolerance and savegery toward Jews throughout history. About 1/3 of the material and interactive presentations were about intolerance toward other minorities and people in general. The interactive materials were geared toward high schoolers.My big gripe was that I expected a hopeful, tolerance encouraging presentation and it was just the opposite for the most part. 90% of the presentations described how intolerant some people can be with no information about all the great programs around the world that exist to encourage understanding, compassion, and tolerance.Many of these programs exist in Israel and Palistine and strive against all the mutual hatred to bring mutual respect and peace. Not a word was presented about any these tolerance programs. Even the book store was devoid of the wonderful tolerance liturature that exist. My hero, Ebu Patel and his Interfaith Youth Core, was nowhere to be seen. Museum of Tolerance? I think not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryBuellton
10,Children Only,"One would imagine that a museum meant to expose future generations to the horrors of the Holocaust would be somber, contemplative. One would be wrong. This is a propaganda theme park. At every turn, there's another screen with someone talking AT you. There are ""interactive"" screens designed to lead groups of children in study of modern-day terrorism, as if it is somehow related to the Holocaust. The entire structure is filled with giant groups -- tours -- of children, each with a guide or teacher of some sort. To go by yourself is difficult and unpleasant, starting with trying to get in, as other reviewers have mentioned.Having bought general admission tickets online, my wife and I drove the half-hour to get there and were told that the ""next"" admission was 1:30. This was at 11:00 a.m. Reservations are ""recommended."" We next phoned in for a reservation, got a machine, left our details (as requested). We arrived, went through the ID check and car search, got to the desk, and, surprise -- no reservation. At this point I complained and the manager appeared. ""Let them in,"" she said, warning us that 300 children would be present, as they were the last time we tried to get in. I asked an employee if it was filled with children every day, and she said yes. All the employees are not only curt but unfriendly, as though it were policy.No map is given. No signs on the exhibits mark a preferred path, so we chose to walk through the museum avoiding the tour groups. At least five times, someone asked if he or she could ""help us,"" the emphasis being on suspicion that we were somehow doing something wrong. ""No, no, we're fine,"" I said. One man, glaring at us while leading a pack of kids, said, ""You're going the wrong way.""Having been to museums all over the US and the world, I can only sadly report that this was the worst museum experience we have endured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWDiner999
10,Not as tolerant as the name implies,"Wow. What a horrible experience. We never even got in. Shouldn't a tolerance museum be happy to try and accommodate those who are interested and care about human rights issues? We were rudely told by the front desk lady that they were sold out of tickets for the day. We decided to just go into the gift shop because I never pass up a chance to buy a new human rights book so I can read and understand even more. While in there my fiancée had to go to the bathroom. Unfortunately, the only bathrooms are inside the area where you can only go if you have a ticket. He asked the front desk lady if he could use the restroom and she said to ask the security guard. He just shook his head no. I don't entirely mind dealing with rude staff at normal places but the TOLERANCE MUSEUM?! why don't you either hire better people or train them better?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kafreena
10,Really poorly done exhibit,"Yesterday my boyfriend and I went to the Museum of Tolerance to see the much discussed exhibit on Anne Frank. The entire experience left a bad taste in our mouths.For starters, I booked tickets online that morning for 3:00pm. We arrive at the museum at 2:50pm, get our tickets, and head upstairs to the exhibit. I hand my tickets to the guide on that floor, and they rudely tell us that our tickets are for 3:45pm (the lady upfront apparently couldn't find my reservation, even though I told her 3:00, and took it upon herself to just give me a later time without saying anything) and that two big groups were ahead of us, so we couldn't go in. So first we had to wait 45 minutes for our tour. I looked at my confirmation and sure enough, I had booked for 3:00.The tour starts at 3:45 and we're in a group of around 25-30 people, most of whom are elderly. We slowly shuffle up a narrow hallway at a shallow angle. The exhibit is largely done on a series of screens no bigger than a normal television. And you have to walk to get to each screen which gives a presentation about 5-10 minutes in length. This doesn't sound too bad expect that if there's a group that big, a lot of people aren't going to be able to see the film. The entire exhibit is made up of narrow hallways, and my boyfriend and I were largely stuck at the back where we couldn't see anything and we were too polite to shove our way into the view. We hung back at the previous screen, but the whole exhibit is on a timer, we would have had to wait until the next tour group came to see the films. It seems ridiculous that they couldn't just have the screens on a continuous loop so that people could spread themselves out a little more. As a result, our money was basically wasted. I saw maybe less than half of the content that we'd payed for.Lastly, the layout was awful and confusing. You are shuffled back and forth in the exhibit without rhyme or reason by the huffy staff. Like I said, there were a lot of elderly people on our tour, and they seemed to have trouble walking up the sloped entrance, and walking the narrow hallways to reach each screen, and we were expected to be able to stand for a very long time. It would have been much better to have one presentation on a big screen with chairs, and then allow people to see the rest of the exhibit at their leisure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341jessicat
10,English visitor,"The unfriendly security check was a bad start which got worse downstairs when we were unable to process our children's photos. An attendant said they had been having trouble with the computers. So we asked for our money back, which was a further unpleasant experience, the manager saying no refunds but the very nice woman on the till saying they did!!More a museum of intolerance and not the kind of service I have been used to in the 20 years of visiting the U S!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilma13
50,Educational + Entertainment = Edutainment,Wow! The interactive museum challenges you with scenarios and role playing to see what you would do in different situations!Its a highly entertaining way to teach about our past and prepare for the future!We had a great time and highly recommend!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52AdamH52
50,A must see for everyone.,"You'll leave there feeling like you learned something new about yourself, the world we share and inspired to make the world a better place. Put this museum on your must see list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJJ226
50,Newly opened Anne Frank Exhibition not to be missed,"The Anne Frank Exhibition, a permanent exhibition, had only recently opened when we arrived in October 2013. We'd visited before and found the Museum's ""Finding our Families, Finding Ourselves"" exhibition, narrated by Billy Crystal, very memorable. We would have visited again just to see that, as new narratives are added. But the highlight of the visit was the new Anne Frank exhibition, and it is certainly a beautifully put-together experience.Timed and narrated, and with helpful guides to assist, it is a combination of audio-visual materials, artefacts, and spaces that do more than just tell the story of Anne Frank and her family's experiences hiding in their secret rooms in Amsterdam. The diary ""comes to life"" as you see images of their home in Germany, their move to Amsterdam, the changing political situation, her father's attempts to get the family to the safety of the United States and the years spent in hiding.The bookcase ""door"" to the room where a film recreates the space they lived in, gives a sense of both expectation and dread. To see the other objects on display -- the letters to and from Anne to those outside, the yellow felt Star of David which Jewish residents were forced to wear, and to hear the church bells replicate the bells Anne heard while in hiding, create a very strong sense of intimacy with the story. There is film footage of Anne and a narration post-war from one of her relatives.Particularly affecting was the wall of neatly folded clothing that wraps around the entire exhibition, floor to ceiling. It starts out colourful and cheerful, with the bright coloured floral prints and patterns of children's clothes. As you travel through the exhibition subtle changes take place. The clothing becomes more subdued, then drab, before morphing into the grey stripes of the uniforms of those condemned to Auschwitz.If anything seemed out of place it was the ""interactive"" element at the end of the exhibition. Touchscreens display a range of concepts taken from the diary on topics such as ""valuing your family"", ""making the world a better place"", etc. and encourage visitors to share their own reactions. The visitor reactions I saw displayed were hardly profound, meaningful or in keeping with the tenor of the exhibition and came close to devaluing and trivialising the experience. Not a good end. See the exhibition, and also the other exhibitions including the main holocaust exhibition; they are very good. Skip the equivalent of ""twitter"" responses at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binduAustralia
50,"Holocaust, Civil Rights, Human Rights, Genocides ...","Very worthwhile visit, beautifully put together. Self-guiding so you can spend as much or as little time as you want. But there is always someone close by to answer your questions or help you find the exhibit you are looking for. Free parking garage, security check inside. Book store/gift shop.I especially enjoyed the replica of a sidewalk cafe where you could ""listen in"" on the conversations taking place before the Holocaust. it put you back in time, into the heads of people living then & their perceptions of what was happening. Ordinary people some of them. Could it happen again?There were displays, films, re-enactments, photos, and interactive exhibits. Fascinating!I would allow 2 hours for sure unless you are with small children. Maybe more depending on your level of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daljulie
50,puts everything into perspective,"Glad we made the time to visit although it is hardly an uplifting topic but one that shouldn't be ignored or forgotten. The holocaust exhibit was very well done, building up the story of the atrocity that affected millions of people. It's a shocking tale but one that must be told. I think that the presentation in the museum was well balanced but graphic and disturbing at the same time.The absolute highlight was the talk we attended by a holocaust survivor, William, who talked for an hour about his life, his experiences during the holocaust and how he rebuilt his life and was successful after arriving in US after the war. A truly inspirational man with some amazing experiences and perspectives on life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBinCA
50,Well done!,"A very thoughtful display of important history, that must never be forgotten. Very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly staff. I would encourage all people to spend time in this museum, to honor the memory of those lost and to protect the future of our world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickaKay
50,Great experience,"My husband, myself and two teens have been wanting to visit museum for awhile and it's worth the drive through L.A. traffic. Easy to find, grateful for free parking. When entering museum everyone goes through security check, and you are then guided down to exhibits. The holocaust exhibit is very well put together, though we did get confused when we were supposed to move from one portion of exhibit to the other at times. The highlight of our day was ""Gloria"", the holocaust survivor speaker that touched our hearts. Crowds were low on Monday and I found all staff helpful. I would recommend everyone visit this museum to reflect upon themselves and to never forget some if the horrific past events in history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksjr2007
50,It May Change Your Perspective on Life,"They will tell you that some of the images may be disturbing for young children. I'm North of 50 and I found many of them disturbing. A number of the tour guides and speakers are Holocaust survivors. It's important that those horrendous events are never forgotten and never repeated. I made sure both of my children heard the stories. The events are laid out in a very factual manner and they go into some depth to answer how we as a species could ever have allowed such egregious acts to take place. A day at this museum will refresh your soul. I am neither German nor Jewish, but after visiting the MOT, may never look at the world quite the same way again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Talisker55
30,it was okay...,MOT was pretty interesting but i expected more. i guess i got my hopes up from reading the other reviews. it's worth a trip just so you can see what it's like for yourself. good thing about it is there's free parking! ;D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz

50,Definitely Moving,"While the museum was busy, there were definitely moments of reflection and self-examination. The importance of understanding this event in our history and educating people on the importance of treating each other with respect and as human beings deserving of love cannot be left to chance. For me the highlight of my visit was being able to listen to a first hand account from a survivour. I would like to thank her for giving her time to relive and share such painful memories for the purpose of educating others and hopefully changing any negative attitudes people have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariceNZ
20,Very rude staff and a yawn fest for the under 50's,"For a place named 'Museum of tolerance' the workers sure are intolerant! On pulling into the car park we were told ""No food, no drink, no sharp objects, no pepper spray or weapons etc. etc. are allowed in the museum"". Not a problem I thought. We parked and took the elevator up to the lobby where we were charge $15.50 for entry (a little steep if you ask me). The woman who gave us our tickets never made eye contact and seemed very indifferent towards customers. Passing through the security area we were told to place all electricals and metallics into a tray for xray. I placed in my wallet and camera and the security man abruptly says ""You can't take pictures here"", to which I replied ""Oh? Ok, that's fine I won't take any."" ""Are you serious?"" he said. My jaw almost hit the floor I was so astounded by his rudeness. When I asked if i could leave my camera with staff in the lobby, the response was ""No"". I was made to return to my car to put my EXPENSIVE camera away. Much to my disgust considering their VERY limited liability for lost, damaged or stolen goods in their car park. On a side note, If your under 50, This place - although informative - is an outright yawn-fest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smb892009
40,"A Little Hard to Hear, But Very Impactful","I was a chaperone for 8th grade students coming from Thousand Oaks, CA. They'd been studying the topic. Firstly, let me say that the parking lot driveway was very steep! Don't drive a manual transmission there!!! Ha. Also, they do airport style security screening (except I got to keep my shoes on) so don't accidentally bring your pocket knife or anything. We had some rather large groups of kids segmented into groups with tour guides and I was not liking the way that there's no separation between many of the exhibits, most of which feature recorded sound (either with video screens or 3D exhibits) and I was having trouble blocking out the extraneous noise. The kids didn't seem to be having trouble but some kept drifting off and I would herd them back into the center. THere was one station where the kids printed papers that described a specific Holocaust victim, with a photo. Going through the exhibits one by one taught you about the sentiments leading up to the holocaust, and while now and then it seemed a little bit boring compared to some musuems where each exhibit is it's own entertainment...when we got toward the end, I realized how the exhibits prepared me: arriving at a recreation of one of the concentration camps, we walked through a doorway of brick with barbed wire, and then into a room that had a very realistic miniature model of an entire concentration camp...and I just go goosebumps and I wanted to cry so hard. But of course I couldn't, and I gathered all the kids in to look and it really brought home the message of how horrible the holocaust was. The skies were grey with the ashes from the crematorium. The kids were so quiet. Then they had to choose a doorway to walk through next: ""Heathy"" or ""Sick or Old"", something like that...really made you think. Lastly, all the kids sat down on the floor and listened to a holocaust survivor speak about her experiences. She was amazing, she told her story in a way the kids could relate to and she kept her overall message positive. She invited them to write to her and many of the kids gathered around her after the speech, clearly interested in her. Overall, it was a very eduational experience. You might want to call and choose a time when there AREN'T big groups of field trip kids there. There are a few places to sit during the tour but you will be standing for long periods of time while listening to the exhibit recordings. It would be a great place to visit if you were in a power or wheelchair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurousMom63
50,Passionate and beautiful exhibits,The museum has an excellent memorial exhibit on the holocaust. There are a lot of facts and personal stories. I took a group of college students and they all seemed to have been touched by the experience. Clean facilities. Would definitely recommend a good 3-4 hours at least!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleN101
10,Complete waste of time,"If your a leftist hippy, you'll love it.It was just a waste of time.All the exibits seemed to only focus on showing how white people are an evil presence in the world. It was just so eye rolling stupid. But jess, there is 5 billion people on the planet, do you really expect everyone to get along. It was heavily weighted toward one particular agenda. After the tour I almost felt like I should go find the nearest gay person (which I also learned are all beautiful and innocent and never do anyone any harm) and give them a hug and apologize for all that western society has done. WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/James520
50,INTENSE! ! !,"We have all read about it, learned about it, talked about it . . . and watched many documentaries about it . . . but going to the Museum of Tolerance was like being there. The exhibit put you back in time. There was not a dry eye in the building at the end of the tour. I came out with a different outlook on life. A new found appreciation for life. I cried all the way home.This is not for small children but very educational for tweens and teens. Lots of interactive activities that ask you questions. Clothing, handcuffs, and other artifacts recovered from the concentration camps are on exhibit. This includes the braids of young girls - they were cut off just before entering the gas chambers. This shook me to the core.Security is very tight. They check your vehicle including car trunk due to all the anti-Semitic threats they receive.This museum is not only about the Holocaust but also intolerance of other groups and what is going on now in our world.I am not the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmargoann
50,Visit with family,"I went with my kids and was afraid they were too young (9 and 11), me it was a fantastic experience for them. We saw speech and they were very interested and even asks few questions. I highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Ades
50,An Unforgettable Experience,"We visited this museum during a Thanksgiving trip to LA. This museum doesn't focus solely on the Holocaust (though it has an excellent Holocaust exhibit) but also about intolerance toward all groups of race, religion, ethnic origin, etc. Topics covered include hate speech, war, poverty, and terrorism. The museum is very interactive, with such areas as ""The Point of View Diner"" where you watch a movie about intolerance and then ask questions of the characters, and a theater where you answer trivia and opinion questions about a controversial topic. Not all areas focus on depressing issues: The ""Finding Our Families: Finding Ourselves"" exhibit is about immigration and has recreations of famous immigrants homes.The highlight of our family's day was being able to hear from a real Holocaust survivor, who shared the story of her family and her experience living through the Holocaust. We got to know her family through her story, and we were dismayed to hear she was the only one left. The whole talk was very moving. When you visit, be sure to take the time to listen to one of these speakers.The museum is a whole-day endeavor: It took our family 4 hours to see the three main exhibits and hear an hour-long talk from a Holocaust survivor. Upon entering, a staff member will give you ""orientation"", and from there you can roam the museum on your own. The museum has a kosher cafeteria and there are many kosher restaurants within walking distance.The Museum of Tolerance is a must-see for adults and teens, but young children will probably be upset by it. If you can take some of the tough subject matter, it is one of the most educational and enlightening experiences you will ever have. A visit to the Museum of Tolerance will help change your view of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phyllis125
50,Tolerance,"This museum has free underground parking, but an entry fee. To avoid the crouds we went after 12 noon during a week day. I like this museum because it provide and incredible experience for pre-teens. They like the ""high tech"" and interactive part as they are learning about history. The personnel is NOT as friendly as one would expect at a TOLERANCE Museum. The only thing I do not like is that as one is walking the audio changes, but one can still hear the aurdio of the area one has left behind and in some parts the transition took a bit long, making it a bit confusing as to where we were supposed to go. It was hard to focus, but overall this is a great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHernandez
40,Not friendly,The museum it self was wonderful....allthough I couldn't see it all because of unfriendly museum staff and volunteers telling us to do this and do that. I finally gave up seeing it because of how unkind all the stafff (except one lady in a scooter) was. I paid alot of money to be made to feel like an intruder. All they needed to do was smile and talk like they wanted us there. A real disappointing experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryglenda
40,A sobering but fascinating must-see in Los Angeles,"This museum provides an incredible experience unlike others. There are multiple participatory exhibits, versus just looking at things/reading placards. Several exhibits involve audio; others involve scrolling text that you can pause or forward through, all describing different instances of oppression throughout human history.A couple of exhibits involve showing you video of different situations, like a drunk driving accident and how it happened, and having you vote your opinions as to who was at fault; then seeing how the rest of the group voted. They are very focused and interesting exercises aimed at causing you to think beyond just your automatic first reaction.The piece de resistance is a tour through several rooms that sequentially depict, through pictures and audio, what it was like in Nazi Germany and then what it was like for the people who were sent to concentration camps. This was very moving and sobering.Also, the museum provides at certain scheduled times firsthand accounts from concentration camp victims and also, when we were there, at least, slavery.My only complaints: One, the museum workers are often very interrupting, trying to get you to go to this or that other exhibit or try out this or that feature, when you are standing there trying to read/absorb something that's caught your interest. Two, it's often hard to hear there because of all the conflicting audio at the different exhibits.It's still well worth the visit, but be prepared to wave off the workers and also cup your ears toward what you want to focus on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wordl8y
30,museum teaches you tolerance in their service,"The hands on area and the Holocaust exhibits were fantastic. However, they were very busy and it was very hard to get to use the hands on exhibit due to the amount of people there so we left after only a half hour. If we hadn't been ushered into a group for the Holocaust exhibit, we would not have gotten so much out of it. Another volunteer was leading a company group through and a few of us tagged along.There needs to be more direction from volunteers/employees as to how the exhibits work. On one floor (there are four levels), there was no one around to tell you how to start through the exhibit. So we went through the family exhibit with no audio information, even though there were tv screens in each section to tell you what is happening in that setting (not on motion sensors). (This is how the Holocaust exhibit is presented, you listen to audio, look at visual, then move on to next setting). So this part of the exhibit and the other 2 floors we felt cheated and did not get the full impact.Also, the web site does not tell you that you need reservation and that they only let off so many people every 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Like most people in this line, we thought you could just arrive at any time and go through it. We had to wait an hour before being let through. They do search your vehicle before you can park underground for free (which was nice). Also they search purses and you have to walk through a metal detector before entering the exhibit. Also, there is no bathroom for ""public"" to use before you enter exhibit. I had to go and the security guard wouldn't let me go through, so we had to leave the building and find a bathroom elsewhere. However, when we came back a different security guard was letting other people go and come back.They do have a small cafeteria on 4th floor - but expensive. They have 2 gift shops. They tell you that each exhibit will take 1 1/2 hours each. No photos or videotaping is allowed.My suggestion - have more volunteers to direct people through the exhibits on different floors and let you know where to start or have guides to take you through it. Overall, I did learn more facts from the Holocaust exhibit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmom1369
30,"Good exhibitions and good museum, poor service..","The exhibitions, especially the holocaust exhibition are impressive and well done. The Holocaust exhibition was interesting but as it progressed, started to feel somewhat creepy. There were lots of recreations of concentration camp gates and one particular alleyway which segregated men and women (plus children). It felt realistic and because of that, rather scary! My 20 year old daughter started to feel scared because of how cold and realistic the whole place was.The museum itself is rather pricey too and the staff not very good. It look us at least 10 mins before we were able to be served to buy tickets, not because of a que, but because the lady working at the counter was too busy playing on her computer and talking on the phone to attend to us!When we finally got into the museum, (after walking through metal detectors and x-ray machines..) we were asked to wait another 10 mins they said in order to give us an orientation before we went on our way to look at the SELF GUIDED exhibitions. the 10 min wait extended into 30 mins and by then, we were frustrated because we had a somewhere to be and had only allocated about 2 hours to this place.If you look past the poor service and at the actual content of the museum, its fantastic! but the service just really brings it down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yapdudes
50,Impressive museum with lots to offer,"There is free parking in the undground parking garage. Before you enter, you need to show your id and pop the trunk. There is plenty of parking and the premises are very safe and well lit.Once inside, you pay the 15$ and pass through an airport tyoe metal detector. There will be somebody briefly explaining you the museum. There are pictures on the wall of holocaust survivors wo are presently working for the museum and the day I went, I could have had the opportunity to listen to a holocause survivor speak but unfortunately, I had a meeting later on and I missed the chance.I went through the self-guided holocaust exhibit tour and it was an impressive experience. Even though, I knew its history, I could still appreciate the exhibit as it is done with such great detail. The self-guided tour lasts for about an hour and 15 min. Apparently, there are 2 other exhibits, which lasts just as long but with the receipt, you get the opportunity to leave and come back throughout the day, which I find is pretty neat. I will definitely head back to the museum with more time on my hands; as it is quite a heavy subject and the exhibits are made with some much passion and detail. All in all, it is one of the best museums that I've visited and holds a very powerful message. I can only recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gone_aforeign
