50,Professional Theater at bargain prices,"We saw an outstanding production of Othello for a quarter of what one would pay for a similar production in Los Angeles. The actors were professional, highly skilled, and well rehearsed. They took their roles very seriously. Lighting, directing, etc. was done so well that you didn't notice it; it just made the actors more believable.Parking was easy. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. And the cookies at intermission were splendid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906scottf
50,The best theatre,"Always something new to see, acts are amazing and live. Makeup is so relevant with the acts everyone get surprised. After the show everyone get a chance to personally meet each actor with director in front of Mahan Indian restaurant . I love this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahanindian
40,Small but with a big heart,"I've been going to the productions of this theater for a couple of years now... it may be small but it has a big heart! The actors don't get paid and all the money collected at the door goes to pay the rent of the locale. Also, one night is dedicated to the Susan G. Komen Cancer Foundation. The productions range from comedies to suspense to serious drama. Got to love a place that lets you pay whatever you can at the door!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsCDinLA
