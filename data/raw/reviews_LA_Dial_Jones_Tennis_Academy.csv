50,Excellent tennis lessons with a fun spirit,I have taken lessons for the last three summers with Dial Jones. He has improved my game and always lifts my spirits. He is genuinely concerned about your welfare and helping you improve. Absolutely love his lessons!,Hope P
50,Bringing back my game - Thanks Dial Jones Tennis Academy,"Hadn't played tennis in a number of years. Contacted a few instructors, Dial Jones Tennis Academy being one. After a clear rundown of their various offerings and a couple locations, I ended up booking a private lesson with one of their instructors, Mike Phillips. Mike is great! Took an assessment my game, gave clear encouraging direction, and was understanding of my many water breaks. I plan on moving forward with group classes offered by the Dial Jones Tennis Academy, which I appreciate that they offer as I do enjoy the social aspect of tennis as well as the game.",Savoy H
50,Brilliant - Hunter the head pro is a really great coach,"Our experience with Dial Jones Academy was with their head pro Hunter. Having had one other coach previously my partner and I had 7 lessons each with Hunter during our stay in Los Angeles and he was absolutely brilliant. My partner and I had different levels of experience (me a self taught park hacker and my partner brand new to the game) but he was perfect for both of us - tailoring the coaching for our specific needs. Our improvement was extremely fast and we were delighted with how it went. Hunter has a really clear way of explaining things and really cared about finding solutions for any issues we had. He clearly knows his stuff and also has a really great, constructive way of giving feedback. He was also very flexible with bookings etc and easy to deal with and to top it off he's a really nice guy.So overall I couldn't recommend him more highly.",A C
40,The best weekend,This is a great place. I enjoy coming here on my free time. It is near the beach therefore it has fresh air and a good environment,Joyce L
50,The Dial Jones Tennis Academy Team Make It Personal - Personally Incredible,"After a 15 year absence away from the game I got the courage to get back on the court and restart this middle aged guy (me) passion for the game. From day one I was given focused personal instruction and almost forgot I was in a group class. My backhand has never been better.(thank you Hunter) Genuine, authentic and caring - that defines the Dial Jones family of professional instructors.",_r_blongiewicz
50,It was a gift,"Great, My wife and I visited lake Chelan for our 28th years of marriage anniversary, we decided to take just an hour class of Tennis.

50,Tennis lessons,"Our family spent one month in Venice/Santa Monica and had the fortune to find Megan and Sanad at dial Jones tennis academy. Fantastic courts, good advise on strategy and techniques but most of all great fun!We loved it and will be back!Family Lohr",stefanlohr
50,Great tennis experience,"I split my time between Venice CA and New York City, and every time I come back to CA the first thing I do is arrange for some tennis lessons with Dial and his fabulous staff. I have worked with Dial and Sanad, and each brings something special to the court. Sanad is the most enthusiastic tennis pro I have ever met, and I've met a lot of them. His love of the game is inspiring and he is not only a great teacher but he also gives you a great work-out on the court! Dial is a phenomenal instructor. I had stopped playing tennis for almost 30 years, and I went to Dial to see if I could take it up again. Not only did he bring my game back, it's better now than it was when I was in my 20's and playing every day. I can't recommend this program highly enough.",Susan S
50,A Renewed interest in the Game!,"Don't think I've ever run into a instructor that was so gifted in teaching, and so passionate for the game. He's amazingly patient with the young kids (as well as the adults!). With every lesson he's been able to meet me at my level and yet push me to get better. I always have at least one or two ""take-aways"" from each lesson, so I feel like I'm always progressing, and then looking forward to the next lesson.",Bill F
50,Dial has done magic for my topspin!,"Had my 3rd lesson with Dial this week and going back again in the morning. Very friendly and knowledgeable Dial has been a big help in getting me comfortable hitting topspin forehands and backhands. When at the beach, Dial is your guy for Tennis Tips!J",John D
50,"Dial Jones, an awesome teacher.",We were down in Santa Monica on a girls weekend away and we wanted to play some tennis. I found Dial Jones and he was fantastic. He was great teaching my friends beginner tennis and was fantastic with me - correcting a couple of errors on my back hand. We all learned a lot and had a great time playing with him. He is the real deal and well worth the money.,Patricia S
50,That rare kind of great teacher,"Was looking for a little practice and exercise and found Dial Jones in Santa Monica. This guy is the real deal. Great energy, great technique, and he clearly lives to teach. He can vary his lesson from instruction to rallying to cardio seamlessly. When I was done, I felt like I learned a lot, met a wise teacher, and had a lot of fun. The complete package. Can't say enough good things about him.",David A
50,Great hitting and instruction from the probat Dial Jones Tennis!!,"I decided at the very last minute to find a place to take a tennis lesson or hit with a pro while on vacation near Santa Monica during the holidays. Dial Jones couldn't have been more of a pleasure to work with and set my friend and me up with Diana since he would be away during my stay. I was blown away by the fabulous beach location and amazing courts. And hitting with Diana was the best! Her instruction was targeted and immediately helpful. She was a delight to work with, always positive and encouraging and we had a fun time playing in the unusually cold weather! If you love the game or are trying it out in the LA/Santa Monica don't hesitate to call Dial Jones Tennis.",Luandnyc
50,Thank you Dial my serve is now a weapon instead of a problem!!!,Dial Jones is great as a person and excellent at knowing how to improve my game with few lessons! I was visiting Santa Monica for a few days and finding tennis courts at the beach was already a pleasure. Getting great instructions was beyond my expectations ...I'll be sure to contact Dial again as my overhead could get some fine tuning...see you soon Dial. Nicole :),Nicolegandhi
50,Look no further than Dial Jones in Santa Monica,"My wife and I were vacationing in Santa Monica over the summer and keen to find a pro that could help us rediscover our love for tennis. Thankfully we found Dial at the first attempt! Having met many pros of over the year, Dial has a unique combination of talent, patience, encouragement that helped us remember why we love the sport. Dial would be a fantastic coach for a player of any level, from somebody who just wants to enjoy the sport and get some excercise, to somebody looking to develop as a competitive player. On top of it all, he is just a great guy and a gentlemen. The whole experience was a real pleasure and we hope to be back in Santa Monica soon for another hit. Finally, the courts are just beautiful. Located right by the ocean with a great breeze...it doesn't get much better!",COTB
50,Dial is awesome!,Perfect mix of encouragement and technical tips. Would highly recommend Dial as a coachfor children or adults.,Jmures
50,Excellent Coaching whilst on holiday!,"Our 18 year old son had two excellent sessions with Dial when we had 2 days in Santa Monica in ideal settings close to the magnificent beach. Not only did Dial quickly identify areas of his game to work on ( Dial called it ""cleaning things up"") but he gave practical help in making sustainable improvements that can be worked upon when back in the UK. Dial coached in very friendly and motivational way, putting us at ease throughout. Dial comes highly recommended!!",WalesUkJodiemay
50,Fantastic Tennis Instructor!,"I recently moved to Santa Monica from New York City and ran into Dial while playing tennis at the courts down by the beach. Dial was extremely helpful even before I decided to take lessons with him! After I decided to take some lessons with Dial, I was very happy I did! Dial is easily better than any instructor I took lessons with in New York. He has a calm, patient, demeanor, and knows exactly when to give instruction and when to just let things develop. I can't recommend Dial enough and strongly suggest taking a lesson with him if you get the chance, even if you're just here on vacation for a couple days!",ChristianPuga
50,Best tennis instructor on west side,Dial is featured on the tennis channel- used to be a pro on the tour and is a great instructor and all around good guy. Highly recommend for all levels,totallytodd

Hawkins",Sophie H
50,Excellent Pro & A Beautiful Location!,Definitely take a lesson with Dial. We started with two and he squeezed us in for a few more. Great instruction and fun tennis no matter what your level. We came away with new skills we could use right away on the court. Dial is a top notch Pro and we have been to numerous Top 100 Tennis Resorts.What is better than tennis right next to the beautiful Santa Monica beach with a talented Coach?,Suzanne K
50,Great Location With an Even Better Tennis Pro!,"I first met Dial about ten years ago when I used to live in California. Every Sunday my family and I would each have half an hour lessons with Dial. I learned a lot from those first lessons and most of the skills he taught me, I still use now ten years latter. He gave me the foundation for the four hand that I use today. I also remember fondly having lots of fun. Dial did not just teach me tennis, he taught me to enjoy the sport. I play tennis for my high schools team and I attribute my love of the sport to Dial.The location where Dial gives his lessons is right on the beach. The beach is literally right across the street. It probably was one of the more scenic views in Santa Monica, that I can remember. The courts were well maintained and in great condition.This past summer, I got to see Dial again. I also got a quick lesson that reminded me of what a great pro that Dial is. My backhand has always been one of my weaker shots. While working together, Dial saw that my backhand was weak and we focused in on it. I had already heard a lot from various pros on what I needed to do to fix my backhand, but none of their advice seemed to work. Dial was able to not just see the problem, but then he was able to find a solution to my backhand that worked. He was patient and worked with me as I screwed up. Now, my backhand has never been stronger, something that has benefited me as my opponents get stronger and more consistent.I just wish that I got to go back to Santa Monica more often, so that I could take lessons with Dial.",rgl2019
50,Fun times on the court with a great pro!,"Dial is amazing and I feel lucky to have found him. From our first initial email contact, through the 5 or 6 lessons I've had with him, he's been everything I've wanted in an instructor -- fun, knowledgeable, encouraging, insightful, patient, professional, considerate, and more.I've learned so much in just a few lessons, and Dial does an excellent job not only verbally explaining the techniques, but also with utilizing drills and hitting that bring the techniques to life and help my body incorporate them.In sum, if you're looking to improve your game, learn tennis, and have a great time while doing that, stop looking and give Dial a call!",blonde m
50,"Great Tennis Coach, great communication and teaching style","While visiting Santa Monica this summer I had a series of lessons with Dial. It was easy to arrange the classes with great quick communication. Dial was able to help improve my tennis very quickly. In only a few lessons, I felt my tennis had really changed for the better, changing my stroke enabled me to play with much less effort for a better result. It gave me so much more confidence in playing. I really appreciate Dial's friendly approachable personality, meaning the classes were always fun and gave me a great sense of achievement. I highly recommend Dial and would have more lessons if I am back in LA.",UKFemaleTraveller
50,tennis lessons with a fantastic pro,"My husband, myself, and our two sons (ages 7 and 5) have taken many lessons with Dial whenever we are in Santa Monica.Dial is a master at customizing drills to suit any skill level while keeping us engaged and having a lot of fun.My sons love having tennis lessons with Dial because he is friendly and they love the way Dial teaches them the proper techniques to become confident players.",Andrea B
