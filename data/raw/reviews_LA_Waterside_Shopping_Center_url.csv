30,It is Perfectly Fine.,"The Waterside Shopping Center in Marina Del Rey houses a market, pharmacy a Starbucks and several family owned shops. Some are cute, some are just expensive. If you are in the area and need something it is a fine place to go, just like any other strip type mall. If you are looking for local fun, this is not it.Parking is free and you will find a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Good place for strolling,"Waterside has shopping, dining,, and a Ralph's market. There are a few restaurants and lots of parking. California Pizza Kitchen is the most popular place where there is usually a long wait for a table in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
20,Nothing to do,Very few restaurants and coffee shops. Starbucks and The Loft are the only two things that I enjoyed visiting at the Center. Hopefully more stores prop up soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chezk

40,Handy little spot,Handy little strip of shops that is easily accessible via the free beach shuttle if you are staying in or near Marina Del Rey. It has a really decent sized Ralph's supermarket (grocery store) and a large bank and some lovely little boutique shops.
