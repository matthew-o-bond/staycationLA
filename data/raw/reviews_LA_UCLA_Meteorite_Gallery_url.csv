40,A small museum with a sampling of meteorites from the UCLA collection,This is a small museum tucked away in the Geology building on the UCLA campus. It shows some very nice meteorite samples and you can even touch some of them. It's a added attraction to the other museums at or near UCLA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyjull
40,Super cool Tiny FREE museum where you can touch meteorites!,"This is one of those awesome hidden opportunities LA has to offer! This is a FREE tiny museum that is in a single room in the UCLA campus. It’s very small, but it’s pretty amazing! You get a chance to see some meteorites up close and personal, touch them and even use a provided magnet to prove their magnetism!You probably won’t spend too long here, but the campus is beautiful. I’d recommend seeing the (also free) Fowler Museum which is a short 8 minute walk away also on campus. There are other things to see here too like the botanical gardens and a sculpture garden. We also did the (again FREE) Hammer museum a short drive away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,touch a meteorite,The Meteorite Gallery is located in room 3697 of the Geology Building on the UCLA campus. Its main hours are on the weekdays. Most of the meteorites are small fragments with extensive explanations on their formation and history of the fragments. Alongwith the meteorite gallery you can walk up and down the hallway and browse other interesting rock collections,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
