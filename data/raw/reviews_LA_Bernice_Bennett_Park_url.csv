50,Convenient walking venue!,"I needed a brisk walk after driving all day to attend a wedding in Westlake Village. I discovered this park just before dusk and headed over. The park was idyllic, lovely with folks attending a quinceňera, few using play equipment. This park had a lot of green space but what was distinctive were winding walking paths that interconnected with the residential areas adjoining the park. I walked for about 50 minutes and covered three miles. It was delightful as it was nearly a full moon that night. There were supplementary lights along the pathways so one could easily walk here at night without feeling uncomfortable. There were clean and convenient bathrooms and although the community building was in use (as stated previously) there was ample parking. If I were ever in the area again I would certainly pay a visit to this park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529carried

40,Fun day or night,"I was actually just introduced to this hidden gem by my 13-year-old son. We spontaneously drove by after dinner one night recently, pulled out the baseball gloves and a ball, and had a catch under the lights on the basketball court. I'll definitely be coming back - it's only 1 minute from my house!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7006MYrobm
