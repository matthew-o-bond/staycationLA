30,More like multicultural parade,"This parade is to celebrate the Chinese New Year and it's held about the same time every year, what makes it uniquely LA is its more like the multicultural parade complete with marching bands, Mexican dancers, used to be Scottish bagpipes, etc. oh don't worry also a few dragons, lions, and other Chinese items. If you like to be around hundreds of firecrackers make sure to stay till the end when there is a lighting at ten end of the parade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
30,Lots of People During the February Chinatown Parade,"We happened to be there during the Chinatown Golden Dragon Parade on February 21, 2015. There were lots of people already lining up along N Broadway. It was really colourful and very interesting. We saw Miss Chinatown 2015, marching bands, floats. Many of the shops were closed for the Lunar New Year.It was an awesome experience not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BornToTravel888
