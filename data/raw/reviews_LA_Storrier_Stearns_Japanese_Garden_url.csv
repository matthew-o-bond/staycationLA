50,Peaceful Sanctuary,Love Japanese Gardens so this was a perfect place to spend a couple hours relaxing and admiring the beauty. Definitely worth a trip!,Hayley B
40,Hidden Gem,"This is a lovely smallish garden. I mean it's much larger than my garden and may or may not be larger than yours, but it is a substantial and beautiful Japanese style garden with lovely nooks for sitting and reflecting. It is a breath of fresh air.",Denise A
50,A real delight.,"We absolutely loved this garden. It's not very large but is delightful. It's meant to be savored like a very fine piece of chocolate.Although it's located in a perfectly flat area, when the pond was created, they used the excavated material to create a hill, which gives the garden interest. There is lots of shade and there are many places to sit and meditate in this very peaceful, tranquil place..We arrived right at opening time (10 am) on a Sunday and parked on the street. It was a good move as when we came out, there were no spaces left, and we were right across the street from the Arlington Garden, which is very different but also interesting.",BlueTravels
50,What a Delight,"This Japanese garden is more intimate than many other gardens/parks. I took a docent tour which was well worthwhile. The docent was knowledgeable and more than willing to answer questions and give an insight into what constitutes a Japanese Garden. Afterward, it was so pleasant to stroll the pathways, and sit and enjoy the vistas in such a serene setting. The last Sunday of every month there is usually some sort of program/activity, and I notice that there are also special events like the Gallery openings, book signings, tea tasting. The announcement of these seem to be all on their website. They also hold classes in the garden. I am so happy to have discovered this place.",chezdrey
50,QUIET Japanese Garden in South West Pasadena,"This is a teasure, but it has very limited hours when it is open. Nefore planning a visit check to see if their hours work for you.",Warner L
50,A calming getaway just a quick step away ...,"This private Japanese garden is a little-known treasure. Small but well maintained, the garden boasts waterfalls, statues, ponds, picnic tables, and an authentic Japanese tea house, all shaded by a variety of trees. The grounds are cool and quiet and you wouldn't know that just outside is a busy city thoroughfare. The staff is knowledgeable and very helpful and there are origami classes and tea ceremonies offered at various times. A great place to come -- with others or by yourself -- to take a break from the hectic pace.",aliencat
40,An intimate garden delight - find it and it's yours,"You may be lucky enough to stumble into this adorable little garden. I found it through a tea festival, and I couldn't think of a better setting to drink tea and pause while this living art moves before you.Precious is the perfect word for the plants and animals that paint the landscape in all seasons. I would consider an hour or two to visit, though much of that time is sitting, technology free, appreciating the many details before you. There is a small gift shop, and other special events throughout the year.",christina_onthe_road
30,Small but Relaxing,"Apparently I have driven by this many times and never knew it was there! It's definitely a hidden gem. There is an entry fee, which is less expensive if you get your tickets on line ahead of going. It's fairly small but they do seem to have lots of events, such as tea ceremonies, musicians and more. I went with a group for the First Friday origami class. It's included with admission, and was quite fun. I think if you enjoy this garden, a membership is the way to go as $50 gets you entry for 2, along with other perks. There are also higher levels of membership.",NatAtHome
20,Not Worth the Admission,"This is not a big garden and they charge $10 to visit. It use to be someone's home who happened to love Japanese Culture.There are other places that have much nicer Japanese gardens that are laid out in a more Zen-like fashion. This seemed to not be planned but ad-hoc.The staff was ok, but affected w/ the society matrons' do-gooder attitude.I must say, the current art display, of using kimono silks to make a piece of art was lovely & innovative.But, I'll not be visiting again.",Auntie-Nanuuq
40,A magnificent garden in Pasadena,"I recommend this venue as it is so unique in So. California. This Japanese Garden was constructed on 2 1/2 acres (former tennis courts) in 1935 with a few ponds and a beautiful tea house. Happily, the owner of the home, took my group on a tour so we heard the history and explanation of the flora and fauna. For instance, we learned that raccoons ate many of the 50 koi, only 13 remain. He explained about the fire of the original tea house and about the compost unit along the house. He told us about the future plans and the Hiroshima Camilla outside the tea house. Do try and take the tour otherwise you miss the historical value of the property.",Hildmat
40,Peaceful Wedding Venue,"This is a lovely, peaceful garden and koi pond. I attended a wedding here and it was beautiful. There are small paths to walk around the koi pond and great opportunities for wedding photos. There was valet parking for the event but I don't know if that was a third party hired by the bridal couple.",Shizue H
50,Peaceful Morning,"I really liked this garden even its small dimensions because it was really peaceful and welcoming. I went there to do some photos, go for a walk and relax in their nice places to sit, as well as the house on the park. I was alone there wasnt people at all during the morning, and I really enjoyed.",Eul√†lia B
50,A Japanese Garden Gem,"We were a group of ladies on a tour who live in So Ca and were quite surprise to find this lovely, small but very picturesque Japanese Garden. We had a afternoon tour, check the days open, usually Thursdays and Sundays, there is a small fee.Jim Haddad, the son of the owner was outstanding in telling us the history behind the gardens. It is not terribly large, pretty winding paths, a large pond filled with Koi, one could sit and enjoy the sounds of the fountain and beauty. A Tea House that does a Tea Ceremony by reservation, really a gem to see and enjoy.",MHM316
40,Pleasant Surprise,"We took a little day trip just 45 minutes away and had a pleasant surprise The Storrier Stearns Japanese Garden in Pasadena is basically someone's back yard open to the public. It is worth looking up the history of the garden online. We joined a little group with a docent who explained different parts of the garden. She described the different plants and the rebuilding of the Tea House with the (fortunately not seen) changes in order to meet today's codes. The nice part is that she was not boring like can sometimes happen. After the tour we took time to walk around and just enjoy the large pond with Kio, the sound of the waterfall and the quietness of the garden . When you go you might want to take time to have tea and sit in one of the several areas and just relax and enjoy the quite of the garden.",NormKeith
50,Breathtaking Garden.,"The historic garden is small, about 2 acres. The location is exquisite. I arrived for the 11am tour on Sunday and learned volumes from the Jim Haddad, the son of the woman who bought the property from the original owners. The history is quite colorful. This place is only open on Thursdays and the last Sunday of the month. Make reservations if you want to get in. I was told capacity on any given day is 100. We bought a Groupon for $12 for two people. Regular admittance is $7.50, so not a big deal. Parking is either in their driveway if there is room or around the corner in a school parking lot. Do this at least once.",Nancy D
50,Wonderful venue for a work retreat,"We visited this site for a several-day work retreat, and absolutely loved it! The garden is small, but extremely well-maintained, with ponds and fish, winding paths, a tea house, fountains and statuary, in addition to the historic house. A small oasis of peace and calm in the heart of the city. And I can't praise the staff enough - friendly, welcoming, accommodating to our needs, warm and enthusiastic. I feel fortunate to have experienced this delightful treasure!",SuperSnorkeler
50,Historic Registry Japanese Garden,"Going to Storrier Stearns Japanese Garden is like relaxing in a beautifully landscaped garden. There is a pond with many plants in and out of the ponds and gardens. The tea house is tucked away in a corner. It is a small venue--like going to someone's home with their fabulous, fabulous garden. I'm guessing that each season would offer different plants. We happened on the gardens via a watercolor class we wanted to take there. The teacher, Pete Morris, was excellent and we were extremely grateful for the opportunity. The garden is open only on Thursdays and the last Sunday of each month. However, they have many cultural and educational programs like that fabulous art class with such exquisite subject matter! It is in a neighborhood and across the street from Arlington Garden. If you like gardens and serenity to make your trip special, visit this off-the-beaten-path gem!",JanHana
30,"NICE BACK YARD, SURPRISED AT HOW SMALL IT WAS","We enjoyed the visit but I guess expectations were off track. It would be a great addition if they were doing garden tours of local houses and this would definitely be one of the top ones, but as an attraction with a $10 entrance fee, I don't think so. The staff are wonderful and they make you feel welcome. Their tours of the gardens are fun. The tea house was my favourite so make sure to take off your shoes and go inside to enjoy the peaceful calm.Lots of parking on the street so that was great. Glad we went, super glad we had a Groupon discount but would not venture back again.",SenorGancho
40,Japanese Garden Stroll,"This is a small, but beautiful, Japanese garden in a residential area. It was designed in the early 40's. Very well maintained, limited parking, and limited days of the month which it is opened. A very enjoyable morning stroll.",brproactive
50,Hidden gem!,Found this charming garden via Groupon voucher and what a nice surprise! A beautiful little garden with the rich history in a residential neighborhood in Pasadena. Really worth the visit and doesn't take too long but a beautiful site,Tom B
40,Lovely Quaint Peaceful Garden,Small Japanese garden open on Thursday evenings and Sundays with various events. We visited during the Japanese Tea Festival. The offered a formal tea ceremony in the tea house but only by advance reservation so we missed it. Will return. Parking in Arlington. Entrance is hard to see if you are headed east.,GirlJustWants2Travel
50,The best of Pasadena's passion for preservation--three strolls within blocks,"Time your visit for the Japanese garden because it has very limited hours. I've been to many Japanese gardens and really loved this one, definitely worth a visit. Call and ask what time they will have a tour since the guide added a lot to our visit. Street parking on Arlington next to the Arlington Garden, your second stroll. Check out the plaque on the history of the site and enjoy this relatively new garden. Both gardens owe their existence to mansions that once were on the property. Then walk over to the Markham Place Historical District (which is about 3 blocks in size) to see an amazing collection of every style of home built between 1887 and 1904. A perfect day!",KarenECS
30,Remnant of a different time in Pasadena,"100 years ago Orange Grove Blvd in Pasadena was called ""Millionaires Row"" for all the mansions lining that street. Many of the mansions had gardens and this is a remnant of one of those gardens. It is a Japanese garden featuring two ponds stocked with enormous koi. You can have a pleasant stroll around those ponds and see a replica of a Japanese tea house.The entrance fee is steep, $10 for walk in and $7.50 in advance. It is a small garden and unless you sit on a bench and rest for a while you are paying about a dollar a minute for the time it takes to circumnavigate the paths. I guess the price is ok considering the upkeep and how few visitors there probably are.You can also walk through Arlington Gardens which is right across the street. If you are coming into Pasadena from the 110 freeway you drive right past these and it is worth a stop if you are going to spend the day in the area. You can thoroughly explore both in under an hour (much less)",So_Cal_Illini_81
20,"Not worth it, not as pretty as the pictures, but...","I have to say I was disappointed. The check in procedure was crowded and disorganized. There are few signs,and none pointing to where to park, so we parked a few blocks away and walked to the entrance, but then a guy there told us we'd have to move the car ""or we'll get in trouble with the city"". Not a whole lot to see; it was not nearly as pretty as the pictures. Two positives. The koto and harp music was beautiful. Also, there is a free city garden/park right across the street that was really nice, and we spent more time there, walking around, sitting and talking, etc. I'd recommend taking a picnic lunch to the free city gardens.",GoingForCoffee
40,Wonderfully Secluded,"Easy to miss if not using GPS, this is a wonderfully secluded and tranquil Japanese garden. Very limited hours (10am - 4pm Thursdays and the last Sunday of the month). $10 at the door, or $7.50 if you book online. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",Jeremiah G
50,Wonderful Japanese Garden,"Located on Arlington Avenue, off Orange Grove Blvd, is this a replica of a Japanese Garden, it is very secluded, you have to park on site and not in the street, but for 10 dollars, well worth a visit. The garden has many winding paths, a 25 ft waterfall, two ponds with iris, lilies, over 13 ( I counted) koi and the jewel is the tea house, which you can enter. The volunteers are incredibly knowlegable and friendly, I got a mini tour included. But if you want you can sit and enjoy nature and serenity in a busy city. I am buying membership, at 50 dollars a year, you can come here any Thursday between 10 and 4, and also once a month on Sundays, when Japanese cultural events are held. They also have a monthly film series. Bring a camera, the views are incredible, beautiful stone lanterns, bronze cranes and leafy trees, and no crowds, unlike the Huntington gardens, this is a gem, will be going again soon!",Alison S
50,A hidden gem,"The Storrier Sterns Japanese garden is an authentic Japanese garden hidden in a residencial area of Pasadena. It is only open certain days and times, so check their website before visiting. Has a tea house on the grounds as well. Well worth a visit if you like small initimate gardens.",K_OKane
50,Secret Garden,"This is a gem, on the National Register of Historic Places.The Storrier Stearns Japanese Garden was designed by Kinzuchi Fujii between 1935 and 1940 for private owners who lived on what was then a large property. The US government sent him to an internment camp. So much about the garden is worth seeking out, not least Jim and Connie Haddad who were on site during the open hours.It's not immense and overwhelming, like the Huntington's spread. Instead, it is both private and unreadable until interpreted. Jim Haddad described the 10,000 gallon underground tank, which collects rainwater for the ponds. Small efficient pumps run the circulating water featureHis composting project is cool. Many tons of rocks were hauled in and moved without mechanical equipment; the pond was dug by hand.The tea house is peaceful. Take off your shoes and stay awhile.",naraks
