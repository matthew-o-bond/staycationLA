50,A unique landmark that cannot be skipped,"Beach Boys Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson grew up and shared a bedroom at their modest family home at 3701 West 119th Street in Hawthorne. It was demolished in the 1980s to make way for the 105 (Century) Freeway, but is remembered with California Registered Historical Landmark No. 1041 in a residential neighborhood at the foot of the freeway embankment. This is where they launched their band in 1961--they signed a contract with Capitol Records in '62.SITE OF THE CHILDHOOD HOME OF THE BEACH BOYSIt was here in the home of parents Murry and Audree that Brian, Dennis and Carl Wislon grew to manhood and developed their musical skills. During Labor Day Weekend 1961, they, with cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine, gathered here to record a tape of their breakthrough song, ""Surfin"". This marked the birth of the rock group known worldwide as The Beach Boys, and the beginning of an historic musical legacy that would change the recording industry. The music the Wilsons, Love, Jardine and friend David Marks broadcast to the world an image of California as a place of sun, surf, and romance. Brian Wilson would become a legendary producer, arranger, and songwriter.California Registered Historical Landmark No. 1041Plaque placed by the State Department of Parks and Recreation in cooperation with the City of Hawthorne, May 2005.This unique masterpiece is how a celebration should be done. Given the time in history and the weight of The Beach Boys in modern Americana, this monument could be easily compared to Cristopher Columbis house in Genoa (Italy) or The Curia in largo Argentina (Rome) where on March 15th 44BC Jukus Caesar was killed.The Bas-Relief of the gorup is insiper by a famous picture taken from one of their biggest hits: Surfer Girl (see my photo).",Bruno D

50,Annual Pilgrimage,Every Summer we visit California from England and one of the highlights of our holiday is to visit this monument. My granddaughters love coming here to see their names inscribed on the bricks.I have loved the Beach Boys and their wonderful music since 1962 and it is such a treat to visit every year.,Steve M

50,A must stop for Beach Boys fans,"If you're a fan of them, this is a must stop. I found it out of curiosity driving from LAX to my hotel nearby in July 2017. it is located in a residential neighborhood with bars on the nearby homes so I didn't stay long being totally unfamiliar with the area. It is located along the 105 Freeway where their childhood home was torn down to make way for the freeway.For fun, I took my Summer of 75 t-shirt to display when they and Chicago appeared together at the Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland for a week long series of sold-out concerts. It was my first concert I attended.Nice memorial to their childhood home.",mfreeze1958
40,"Fan of ""The Beach Boys"" or just love the music? Worth a quick stop!","The Beach Boys Monument in Hawthorne, California, commemorates the site of the childhood home of brothers Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, who formed the band ""The Beach Boys"" with their cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine. The monument marks the former location of the Wilsons' house, which was razed in the mid-1980s during construction of the I-105 freeway. On the monument is an image face, inspired by the album cover of ""Surfer Girl"", depicting the three Wilson brothers, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and David Marks, all holding one long surfboard.If you call yourself a fan of ""The Beach Boys"" or just love listening to their songs, this small monument is worth a quick stop. To reach the monument, exit I-105 at Crenshaw (Exit 5). If heading west, turn left at the end of the off-ramp, then turn right to head west on 120th Street (just after crossing under the freeway). If heading east, the exit leads to 120th Street so turn right at the end of the off-ramp to head west. After a short distance, turn right onto Kornblum Avenue; a sign will tell you where to turn for the monument. The Beach Boys Monument is visible to your left from where Kornblum Avenue has a T-intersection with 119th Street.",akisaurus
40,Interesting Plaque,"I visited the Beach Boys plaque located where their house once stood in Hawthorne, CA. It is along side a freeway wall. The plaque is interesting, but parts of it are starting to detoriate due to age and neglect. The location is very difficult to get to, we had to turn around several times.",Metrotorrance
50,Standing where music was made that changed the world!,"If you love Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, search this out and stand where music was made that changed the world!

30,Beach Boys Monument nice stop along the way.,"I think the monument is long overdue, a nice stop along your trip. It is located near where they lived growing up, by the Hawthorne Airport. Your visit wouldn't take more then a few minutes, as it is a small brick wall with a carving of the boys holding a surfboard. It has a plaque with their song titles and would be a fun photo op for any Beach Boys fan.",Suezleque7
40,Must Visit When In The Area,"We drove over to Hawthorne to visit the Beach Boys Monument before boarding a cruise ship. It's located close to where the house where they grew up. The house was demolished to make room for the freeway. It has a relief of the ""famous"" picture of them holding the surfboard. Their songs are listed along with the original Beach Boy names. Allow approximately 10-15 minutes for the visit, pictures, reading. Glad I finally made it !!",VailAZTraveler
20,The City of Hawthorne doesn't give them any respect!,"Without a doubt the Beach Boys are loved by millions! I live in the area and see many a fan visiting the memorial!! Now, I know we are in a drought... however, in my opinion the City of Hawthorne could give the Beach Boys more appreciation and effort to this much deserved monument!!",BillyWilly2014
40,Beach Boys Monument for beach boy fans.,"It is a dedication wall to the beach boys, blocks in the wall have their song titles. If your nearby, its worth a look. Plan on 5-10 minutes for picture taking and viewing.If your there, the Hawthorne airport is down the street, where Space X is. Make a left on 120th, a right on Crenshaw, and you'll see their first rocket that successfully returned after delivering it payload to orbit, and landed.",Albert L
40,I finally got here!,"I have loved the Beach Boys for their entire history so I have always wanted to visit this monument. It's small little plaque at the site where the Wilson family once stood before being torn down for a freeway. You have to use your imagination to picture the boys practicing at their home. It is in a neighborhood and the freeway traffic flows loudly nearby. If you are a Beach Boys fan, this should definitely be on your bucket list. Make sure to go in the daylight or you will not be able to see it well.",nwb
50,Beach boys house,Great way to explain the past with your children. Most people don't know the Beach Boys childhood home doesn't exist anymore. Most people will be surprised what the county did with the land instead of making their house a landmark.,C380BJmichaelg

50,A Must-See for Beach Boys Fans,"The Beach Boys Monument was on my to-do list for this trip to the L.A. area. I'm surprised I haven't gotten to it sooner. Dedicated in 2005, the monument pays tribute to America's Band, and is erected on the site of the Wilson brothers' childhood home on the corner of 119th Street and Kornblum Avenue. When the Century freeway was constructed in the 1980's many homes in the area had to be removed, including the Wilson's. This tribute helps to keep the memory of their home alive. My only complaint is that the city is not taking care of the landscape framing the monument. Both palm trees have all but died from lack of water. Come on, Hawthorne--these are your sons!While in Hawthorne, be sure to check out some of the other hangouts of the Wilson kids in the 1960's, including two which have not changed much at all since the day: Foster's Freeze (called ""Frosty's"" by the boys) and Pizza Show, where Brian came for pizza every weekend.",cynsha
40,"Snug on the City street curve, Snug to freeway-105","Found on the outside curve of two small city streets, unimposing. Saw names i knew in the memory bricks that support the medellion/reliefs.

Was glad to go to the HAWTHORNE MUSEUM in the old Police Station by the City Library... now that was worth the time.",Anaheim_Marilyn

30,It's Just a Plaque,Now that you've seen the picture..... you've seen it. Being a big beach boy fan I traveled over there to see what it was. So unimpressed. Sorry I really wanted to say something better about it.,family0f5traveling
40,A must for any serious Beach Boys fan,"A stop here will only take a few minutes, but it's meaningful to have the site of their childhood home marked, considering how easy it would be for it to go unnoticed. Anyone who considers themselves a serious Beach Boys fan will want to pay their respects at this spot.",elvisandwich
50,Home of Legends.,We visited this monument again this Summer at the beginning and end of our California vacation.We have invested in several bricks on the monument and now our grand daughters can read their own names on the Monument.It is lovely to think that they in turn will show their children the Monument in years to come.....assuming of course that it isn't knocked down as the Wilson's home was!The neighbourhood seems to be being gentrified along with the expansion of the nearby airport.Pizzas at Pizza Show and ice cream at Foster's Freeze complete a perfect Beach Boys commemorative trip.,Steve M
50,Where the Sound Started,"The homesite of the Beach Boys parents is now literally buried by the footing of the Century Freeway, but there is a Memorial Monument on the quiet residential,street where it was located. Here is how to get there. Take the I-405 to,exit 44, El Segundo Blvd. take El Segundo Blvd east to Prairie Avenue. Turn left onto Prairie and travel north to 120th Street. Turn right onto 120th Street and travel a couple of blocks to Kornblum Avenue. Turn left onto Kornblum and travel to the dead end. Turn or look to your left on 119th Street and you will see the low brick monument slightly to your left, tucked into the slope of the Century Freeway. A great photo op if you're a fan! Enjoy!",etweeden
50,Interesting if you're in the neighborhood,Not a fan of the music but they have an incredible story. It was very kitchy and kind of surreal. It was close to our hotel and very touching that the neighborhood fought to have this built- even though the house is gone.,jschlademan_13
30,Not Exactly Graceland,"This stop is not for every visitor. There is no building, no graceful setting, just a monument made of brick and concrete marking the location of the Wilson brothers house from once this legendary surf band began.Most likely only the true Beach Boys fan will appreciate the visit. The houses surrounding the structure will provide some sense of what the neighborhood use to be and a sense of where the band got its roots.If you are a tried and true Beach Boys fan, after stopping at the monument, drive to Foster's Freeze on Hawthorne Blvd. just north of 120th St. (one of the hamburger stands mentioned in early songs), order your customary milk shake and look for the poster marking the locations mentioned in the various Beach Boys' tunes. If time is available cruise by those locations as well. This is Hawthorne's Hollywood Stars map. It can be a fun way to spend a couple of hours.The monument is located in a small neighborhood isolated by the 105 Fwy near Prairie Ave. and Imperial Hwy. There are directional signs in key locations that will assist you in finding your way. Most GPS devices have no trouble in locating the spot.After your visit to Hawthorne, take Imperial Hwy west to the ocean and turn right to cruise Manhattan, Hermosa, Redondo and Torrance beaches. And have fun, fun, fun, with or without a T-Bird!",LifesaSnap
40,just a landmark,trip down memory lane to see the maeker of where beach boys grew up and began......many dedications on the wall and fond memories of beach boys and their songs....just takes a quick stop to see it,Leonard C
30,A Quick Stop to Pay Homage,"This is a quick visit that will mainly appeal to fans - just 15-30 minutes to see/read/photograph the monument. It's located on the site where The Beach Boys grew up, formed their band and got their start in the music business. It's a residential area, and the monument is right next to the 105 freeway because the house was torn down when they built the road.",CrankingChick
10,"Eh, Eh, Eh.","Skip it.When they tear down the freeway (or the expressway behind it) and build a monument worthy of the Beach Boys... then go so it. Until then, the pictures posted are much better than visiting.",Rubten
10,Don't Waste Your Time,"This monument is anything but. It is a waste of resident's tax money and is not on the site of anything to do with the beach boys...no house remaining, etc. It is on the end of a street, a stand alone little thing with a bunch of tiles and plaques patting all the local politicians on the back. Avoid.",ILoveSantahohoho
50,Landmark #1041,"Somewhere I heard someone say that one of the most important things that one can do with his life is to create something that will outlast it. That is what the Beach Boys did with their ever popular music which they shared with the world. A fitting monument has been erected to their genius in front of where their boyhood home used to stand on West 119th Street in Hawthorne, California between Doty and Kornblum. I appreciated the time that I spent at the monument. It is free to the public and is California Historical Landmark #1041.",Ms T B
50,"Nostalgic, Special","Since my last visit to see the Monument where their childhood house stood, new houses have replace the ones similar to what they would have lived in. However, just to be where they made that first tape, Surfin, is a special thing for any Beach Boys fan. Its worth reading the bricks and seeing who contributed is well worth time spent there. My daughter is now living in California and doing all the things i dreamed of.",iwells6

50,Pilgrimage.,"Whenever we visit California we always visit this monument to celebrate the Home of the Wonderful Wilsons.Their boyhood home was knocked down to make way for a freeway.....Americans always value tradition!!!!!Anyway there is now a monument in its place.For a fee,fans of the Beach Boys can purchase an engraved brick for posterity.In the area you can also see Fosters Freeze where Fun Fun Fun was written.",Steve M
40,A real slice of Americana at the Beach Boys historic landmark and its free.,"Do you remember when songs were nice and happy, without violence, drug references and profanity? If not, listen to the harmonious tunes of the Beach Boys. I would rather hear an upbeat song, than a song about being beat up.As a California girl, I grew up listening to the Beach Boys, in my room and everywhere else. My friends and I would eat at the same Foster Freeze as the Beach Boys, in a different decade.The monument itself is in the actual location of the Wilsons’ front lawn and the rest of the land where the house stood is an embankment and freeway. It is only fitting that this attractive landmark, replacing part of the band’s home, resembles a giant brick fireplace. This is where the band first started and recorded their hit song, “Surfin”, changing the music industry.People who donated to the monument each made inscriptions on their brick. Some bricks merely have Beach Boys song or album titles like “Endless Summer” or witty lyrics quotes and their donor name. Others bricks are poignant, remembering the band members who have passed on and the joy that the Beach Boy’s music brought into their lives. There are even two dedications for people who were in the service: to all veterans still with us and all fallen veterans.Each band member has their name engraved on a brick with a gold colored 45 record-shaped background. The solid white mural, located on the upper middle of the monument, depicts the Beach Boys. It is fashioned after the “Surfer Girl” album, but with all six band members, instead of five. I would have liked to have seen a more detailed, colorized, portrait of the band, instead of a general characterization of them.Some websites give poor advice by informing people to enter directly on 119th Street, in Hawthorne, to the monument. The small streets, in Hawthorne, like 119th interconnect, curve and dead-end in a maze. Don’t get lost, the way we did.In an effort to help make your trip to the monument more enjoyable, here are the following directions to get around, on the town:From the Los Angeles Airport, to avoid the freeways: (Go during daylight hours).Take Century Blvd., go east to AviationTurn right on Aviation, heading south to 120th St.Turn left on 120th St. going east to Kornblum St.You will cross Prairie Avenue. The next traffic light is Doty. The very next street is Kornblum without a traffic light.Crenshaw Blvd. is too far.The Hawthorne airport will be on your (right) side of the street.Turn left on Kornblum, following this street all the way down to the monument.Kornblum curves left and ends at 119th Street. The monument is on the right.Rush hours traffic on the freeway is: weekdays 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., but by the Los Angeles airport, it is usually busy. The best time to travel on the freeways are 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and after 8:00 p.m. to usually the rest of the night until 6:00 a.m. See the landmark in the daytime, while there is light.From the Los Angeles airport, by the freeway, to the monument:Coming out of the airport on Century Blvd., going eastTurn right on Sepulveda Blvd., (pronounced Sah-paul-va-duh.)Stay in the right laneTake the 105 EastGet off on the Crenshaw Blvd. EXIT only, STAY in the right lane(The freeway lets out on 120th Street)Turn right onto 120th StreetThe Hawthorne airport will be across the street.Kornblum has no traffic light and comes up fast, so look for the street sign. It is one block before the first traffic light on Doty. Doty is one block too far.Turn right onto Kornblum and follow it all the way down to the monument. Kornblum curves towards the left and ends on 119th Street. The monument is on the right.The immediate neighbor, by this landmark, has become richer since the band has lived here. There are a few newer, well maintained, larger add-ons, Mcmansion style houses. The environment is clean and quiet, considering the close proximity of the freeway.There are plenty of photo opportunities, as there is a red curb in front of the monument and therefore; it is clear of obstructions. Parking is free, a little distance down or across the street. This will be a short visit to read the placard, inscriptions on the bricks and take pictures.Bring your camera and Beach Boy tunes and add some music to your day. Do wop, ooo, woo.",catnewman

20,"eh, maybe if you are a huge fan",It looks like an overgrown brick bbq from the 50's with a plaque commemorating where a house associated with the beachboys once stood. I think it was torn down for the freeway.You can find something better to do with your time,MTSstm
40,Long overdue Honour,As a life long Beach Boys fan and visitor from England i was determined to visit this landmark. It was not the easiest place to find and i had to ask a number of times for directions. The images of the group members are not as realistic as i had hoped for but i was impressed by the brick work and inscriptions. It took Liverpool some time to acknowledge the Beatles landmarks and it is great to see this permanant reminder to America's greatest band.,iaindaza
40,Beach Boys Memorial,"This unassuming blue-collar town is where the Beach Boys grew up, picked up their guitars and changed the world.
