40,Great view,Up on the hill you get a panoramic view over Los Angeles especially on Hollywood and the famous Hollywood sign. We saw a sundown and really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobias2402
40,Classic,This is a classic old Hollywood Hills neighborhood. Narrow streets. Good views. Great architecture. Better seen on foot than in a car due to narrow curve streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
