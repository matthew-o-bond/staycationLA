50,Where science happens,We spent a few hours at the Observatory. Seeing the location where so much astrophysics occurred and is still occurring is amazing. If you are an astronomy buff this is the place to go. The museum has a collection of letters to and from Hale and your see signatures from Alexander Graham Bell and Einstein. Seeing the telescopes where so much was discovered and is still being discovered is humbling. The cafe was not open due to the time of year but we had a picnic lunch on the rocks where we could see the city of LA and all the pollution it produces. But the skies were still clear around the observatory. Would love to come back at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarciaB262
50,The focal point for our modern understanding of the universe,"A pretty drive up a winding mountain road with great views of the L.A. basin out to the ocean, leading to the centerpiece that changed our understanding of our place in the universe. If you have the time and don’t mind spending a bit for a private tour, you will find it well worth the investment. You will receive an in depth history of the development of the site, the many discoveries made here and the remarkable scientists and enthusiasts who peered through these historic instruments and wrote their names in history. A special thanks to our guide, Bruce Padget, whose love of the stars and Mount Wilson are evident in every word. Go, learn and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwX2677ZI
50,Under rated,Great science going on here. Skip the Griffith Observatory and see a real telescope with breathtaking views. Watch out for rattle snakes. There really are quite a few around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449jaredw
40,Fabulous night sky/view of L.A.,"Spent Aug. 17 at the Mount Wilson Observatory. We drove and parked in the parkinglot, then took a waiting shuttle to the Observatory area. My husband listened to a talk about stars (about 1.5 hours long), which included passes to the large telescope later that evening. The room where the talk was given was crowded and not air conditioned and my 13-yr. old felt quite nauseous after the very windy road trip up to the Observatory. So she and her sister and I opted to walk around outside, where they spotted three deer roaming casually around. My girls like to explore off the path and although I warned them about rattlesnakes, it took a passerby to tell them he had just seen one under a nearby rock to make them believe it.Unfortunately, we were late to the talk so we were about 215th in the lineup for a view through the telescope (second to last). We waited until 11:30 before we could get a viewing. We passed the time looking through the smaller telescopes which were pointed at Jupiter and Saturn (amazing views), looking at the fabulous view of LA., watching the moon rise and looking through the room with explanatory photos the history of the Observatory. If you go to a talk, get there early because it could be a long wait! Bring along a warmer sweater and/or long pants. It was hot that day but once you're at the Observatory, it cools down considerably as the sun goes down.If you have mobility issues, getting up to the large telescope might be an issue. You could listen to a talk, and make your way to the large telescope viewing area, where you can look through the smaller telescopes, but once you go inside the large telescope, there are several narrow, windy steps to ascend before you reach the top. Bathrooms are in a trailer and these are also only accessible by about five narrow steps.My only reason for giving this 4 stars is that the talk advertised food available afterwards but didn't say that it wasn't included in the price. We were lucky to have cash with us (the burgers, hot dogs and fries were not cheap) but others had no money with them and were out of luck for dinner. This could have been better advertised for people who have never been to the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleWardKantor
50,Greatest Observatory,"On these grounds, from data collected here, we learned the size of the universe and also the universe is expanding. And that there were other galaxies, like Andromeda, out there beyond our Milky Way. This is mecca for astronomers, and you can visit here too...daytime visits are free, and eager docents like Bruce Padget are fun founts of info...but ask too many questions and you'll get too many answers. The history of the guys who built and funded this place is as fascinating as the science once done here. There are two big telescopes...the 100-inch and the 60-inch which are open to the public at night if you attend a lecture..and they've got musical events too that take place under the dome. Very cool acoustics for chamber music!! I was at Mt Wilson last night and I got to see the Ring Nebula near Vega thru the 100 inch telescope. The Los Angeles Astronomical Society also was on hand outside the dome to let guests look at Saturn and Jupiter while waiting for their turn. Very orderly. Fascinating place. Food available too from Pie n Burgers. The blueberry pie was full of fruit and not too sweet. Check out the Mt Wilson website for events that can give you access to viewing through these historic telescopes. Ample parking. Mountaintop setting is gorgeous. The drive up on Angeles Crest Highway from Los Angeles is winding just watch out for speeders... the Mt Wilson Red Box Road, which has a lot of winding S turns...very fun in my little Miata...but again check your speed, enjoy the drive. Great getaway near Los Angeles to see stars above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2Playwright
50,Mount Wilson Observatory! Total awesome experience!,"Mount Wilson Observatory! Total awesome experience! The Mount Wilson Institute gives scientific lectures, last night was on the periodic table, followed by a visit to the 100 inch telescope. The lecture was geek friendly, what a fun and interesting experience. Non geeks might have been bored stiff.We were assigned times to visit the telescope. Arrive early to get a low number. I had 28, there were 250 visitors do the math. Twenty visitors could go in at a time, we were in the second group, and spent over a half hour viewing the telescope and taking turns looking through the telescope. We viewed a double nebula! Awesome!Non geeks might have been bored stiff!!Pie and Burger catered the event. Word of advice, quickly and immediately leave the lecture hall and get in line for burgers and pie.Great view over Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,"Up, Up, Up Into the Clouds","My daughter is a graduate student at Caltech and we went venturing up here during a recent visit not really knowing what we would find. Oh my! The road winds up, up, up and around ... and then suddenly you're on top of the world. We were there on a mostly foggy day down in Pasadena but we came up out of the clouds into beautiful blue sky. I'd love to come up for one of the events where you can actually look through the telescopes but just walking around up here was a great pleasure. An added benefit: some of the biggest pinecones I've ever seen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kleic
50,Mount Wilson,Took a trip up here yesterday. Absolutely breathtaking. Being above the clouds and breathing normally seemed odd but what an experience. Highly recommended. Grab a coffee at the cafe when you get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerB339
50,Amazing and underrated ! Don't pass this up !,"I don't know what was better, the drive up or the spectacular views from the top!This is a relatively unknown to most who travel to LA county, but it shouldn't be. Griffith Park was great (different), but if I had to pick one, the drive up to Mt. Wilson wins.The drive up the winding mountainous road is stunning. You can stop along the way to get a glimpse of LA in the distance at various points on the side of the road - there are designated pit stops for this. The final stretch to Mt. Wilson on it's unique mountainside road will especially not disappoint. Once at the top the view of LA and the surrounding LA forest does not disappoint -- spectacular! Just make sure you go on a clear day.There are really two reasons to make this drive: 1. the spectacular drive and scenery, and 2. the observatories and the significant history they represent -- with the realization of what discoveries were made there by Edwin Hubble walking around this place felt sacred, and in fact it is! There is a little museum with old telescope equipment and related stuff on display you can tour also. Prepare to get some exercise walking around but nothing grueling that would discourage you from going.This was a low cost, no crowd way of really making a Winter trip to LA a great one. I went during off-season so the cafe was closed and I'm sure there is more people in summer, but I can't imagine you'll be fighting crowds no matter when you choose to go. There was literally only about 10-15 people walking around on the weekday I was there. I was also lucky enough to get great weather in January. The temp was in the 50's which was about 20 degrees cooler than at sea level at the time.From downtown Burbank it only took me approx 50 minutes to the top.A must-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDL747

50,Beautiful are!,The observatory is amazing! Great hiking and wildlife as well as foliage! Views cannot be captured with photos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanofThornbury
10,Really disappointing,"Attended a talk here last month, which included a view through the larger telescope. Having attended similar events at other observatories around the world I was really looking forward to it.The talk didn’t last long, perhaps 45 minutes. Given the event started in the early evening, there was a lot of waiting around, this is where the night started to get very disorganised and very disappointing. We were all given a number when entering the talk, this number correlated to your turn in the telescope. When we finally got going at approx 8pm (once dark) groups were sent in, in slots of 20. Problem was there was over 220 people and the groups seemed to be in there over 35 minutes-you can do the maths. It ended up being a long night. Worst still is that other than a small museum, there is nowhere to sit or keep warm.Our group were allowed in at 11:30pm, after finishing the talk approx 6:30pm. Tr tour consisted of a brief look at the inner workings of the telescope and some of the old lenses, cogs etc. It would have been much more interesting if it was a decent hour to be taking in the information. We also got to look through the telescope, however even what it had been lined up to was underwhelming. No real background given or context to what we were looking at.Felt very sorry for those after us, especially those with children.The observatory along with its events could be really popular. However based on my experience, I would not recommend until more thought is given to guest experience.Should mention the views and the drive up to the observatory are fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahd8119
40,Great day-trip.,"Even the drive up was a pleasure. A real escape from the freeways of So Cal. I would recommend taking a tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable. Definitely gave us insight that would never have been realized without. I would recommend parking in the upper ""Additional Parking"" lot. It wasn't even close to full and puts you closer to the telescopes. You have to buy your tickets at the Cosmic Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenwE2220CC
50,Very Impressive!,Drove up the winding roads to reach Mt. Wilson Observatory. Well worth the effort - it’s not an easy drive; however the roads are in excellent condition and are well marked. You need a parking pass ($5.00 - good for 24 hrs) placed in the car. Access to the sights entails an approximately ten minute walk from the parking lot. There is a coffee shop near the lot.In addition to several observatories there is a small museum describing the history of the place and the telescopes. There are guided tours available but I think they have to be reserved ahead of time.The views from the mountain top are marvelous.A unique place to visit and experience a touch of science and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erk
50,Beautiful views at the top,"I've hiked up to Mt Wilson a number of times at different times of day and in different seasons, and it's special. Take some snacks, or get something at the café, and look out over the valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries

50,Great take in,"Get there early, it was cloudy and believe it or not a bit rainy on the trip to the top. Was cold, so jacket a must. Then the clouds parted and wow you felt like you were about the clouds. Do the tour if your into astronomy, well worth it to see the 100 inch telescope and also the history of the area. You can also rent out 2 observatories for parties, which we will do next visit. Amazing time with my family whil there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texasbud1962
20,Disappointing,"We walked here from Chantry Flatts but on arrival, there was not much to do. Parking is free, the views are good but the cafe was not open.There is an exhibition (meh!) and that is about it.I was thinking of bringing a Boy Scout Troop here but did a swift rethink!I don't think that the drive would warrant a visit especially after the burn",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickwarrilow
50,World Famous Telescopes and Discoveries!,"We arrived at about 1130 for the 1-3 pm docent tour of the Mt. Wilson Observatory on Sunday, 24 Sept. 2017. The observatory is world famous for many discoveries. The 60” Hale telescope, completed in 1908, was the largest in the world and became one of the most productive and successful telescopes in astronomical history. The 100” Hooker telescope, completed in 1917, was the world's largest telescope until 1949. Edwin Hubble used it to determine that the universe extended beyond the Milky Way galaxy, that other galaxies were millions of light years distant and that the universe is expanding.Sandwiches, chili, salads, souvenirs and tour tickets can be purchased at the Cosmic Café which first opens on 31 March, 2018. The tours start at the back of the Café. At the 150’ Solar tower, we were shown a live projected image of the Sun and sunspots. Volunteer, Steve Padilla, demonstrated how daily sunspot activity and their magnetic field strength has been recorded daily for the last century. At the Hooker telescope you can see the green glass at the backside of the 100” mirror which actually contains many defects and bubbles, see photos. Edwin Hubble’s observing chair is on display. Docent tours Sat. & Sun at 1-3pm ($15 adults, $12 seniors and 16 & younger, under 6 not permitted) & short tour 2-3pm, self-guided tours available. If you have a National Park Service Pass parking is free, otherwise pay $5 at the Cosmic Café for a day pass. TIP: The mountain roads are very narrow, steep & windy. Before driving here, please learn how to slow down by manually downshifting your car into lower gear otherwise you may damage your brakes!Did this review earn a “helpful” vote?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnAnnColumbia_MD
50,World class astronomical collection of telescopes,Wind your way up the Angeles crest highway to Mount Wilson that has a world class astronomical collection of telescopes!

50,A hidden gem,"Not many people know that this place exists. It is in the mountains above Los Angeles, situated in the Angeles National Forest. Many years ago there was a resort here, but it is no more. On a clear day, you are rewarded a great view of the Los Angeles basin. There are trails for one to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc

At an altitude of 5715 feet, the view on a clear day is as far as the eye can see and shows how sprawling the County of Los Angeles is.If you want to make a day out of it, I'd suggest that you dress for a hike and pack a lunch. Stop at the Switzer Picnic area on the way and enjoy a nice walk (hike) on a shaded path (up and back trail) and picnic alongside the creek. Or, if you prefer, enjoy your walk and then travel the rest of the way to Mt. Wison and on the weekends you can buy your lunch at the Cosmic Cafe where there is also a shaded picnic area.The observatory is open for self-tours weekdays from 10 am - 5 pm.

The observatory is at an altitude of over 500ft and is generally 10-20 degrees cooler.Great way to escape the heat and traffic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV
40,An amazing exhibition of scientific discovery,"This place is not the easiest to get to, up mountain roads with little forgiveness, but so well worth it. When you get there, and treat yourself to the exhibits, you'll find that this is the place where mankind learned just about everything we know about our place in the universe, and about how the universe is constantly changing. This history of the place is fascinating, the convergence of science, engineering, commercial interest, and well-placed financial interest is amazing. The people and personalities involved are fascinating. And the view of the Los Angeles basin is beyond words. Would only wish that detailed tours of the telescope were regularly available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,"Mt Wilson Observatory Tour - ""Enthralling learning Expedition""!","Absolutely wonderful experience where we scheduled a summer fun learning expedition high atop Mt Wilson touring the observatory that to this very day is currently employed by astronomers still researching the stars, planets & galaxies above! Lots of captivating history of this phenomenal place as our tour guide, Jed, offered extremely knowledgeable facts, dates, names figures of Mt Wilson and at the same time would tell stories of old making the tour all the more intriguing for us all. We ""Highly"" recommend Mt Wilson as an event you need to plan as unlike The Griffith Observatory, with all due respect is commercialized, Mt Wilson is truly an observatory that is real & in operation today used by scientist from around the world as well as USC & UCLA Colleges. During the 1pm 2 hr tour we got to see many of the telescopes & was allowed in the 100 ft. tower where a ""100 Ton"" telescope is still currently in use. There is also in theory the ""Worlds Largest"" Telescope on site! There are wonderful hiking trails close by & picnic areas if you wish to have lunch with the family or café with basic food & drinks to quench your appetite. The aprox 5700ft elevation offers spectacular views of the city below on one side & Pacifico Mtn, and the 10,000ft San Antonio Mtn. on the other side! This trip/tour is fun for families, couples, singles, adventurists, outdoor enthusiast, hikers, bikers, walkers etc. Do check out the online website for more detailed information however there is no phone # to call for personal q & a.High elevation provides slightly cooler weather up there & very nice breeze at times makes it very pleasant even during a heat spell when we went.

Go there and see the magnificent 100 inch reflector telescope that he used. Visit the museum, see the CHARRA exhibit, and enjoy the views. But - spend the $15 (or so) and take the docent led tour. You get to hear the great background stories of the place that make the people who worked there come alive. You also get to go beyond the locked doors and view the workings of the Solar Telescope and get up close and personal with the 100 inch reflector telescope.

I paid close to $10.00 for it! But the views, and scenic walks around the place are worth it. Hint**** Bring your own lunch and beverages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillR256
30,Nice being on top of the world (in LA),"While the observatory tour was a bit long and a little technical (an astrologer would be happy), the visit to the top of the mountain alone was well worth the drive up there. Go if you want to fantastic views, clear air and a taste of nature!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunometzz
50,You get to see where a scientific break-through was made - Amazing,"(Caution: This review is solely for those visiting on a weekday. The experience on a weekday is completely different than on the weekend.)Using the Hooker Telescope at Mt. Wilson, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables (a kind of star that is used as a means to determine the distance from the galaxy[18][19] – see also standard candle) in several spiral nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum. His observations, made in 1922–1923, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own.That discovery was revolutionary at the time. His observations would later lead to our understanding of an expanding universe as predicted by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and confirmation of what we now call the Big Bang Theory.To see the observatory and the Hooker telescope in it was a fantastic thing to be able to do. I could imagine Hubble looking through that telescope and shooting images through it to make his discoveries. There are other sights at the observatory, many buildings and smaller observatories, etc., but the Hooker telescope is why you visit Mt. Wilson. In the observatory which houses it, there is a darkened visitor room which enables everyone to see it through a series of glass windows, and photograph it well. You'll need to pump up the sensitivity on your digital camera as using a flash is worthless.From the center of LA it can easily take an hour to get there as the switchback climb up Mt. Wilson can't be done quickly. During the week visits are very different from weekend visits. Almost no one is there so the upper parking lot is empty, but you don't want to miss the photo opportunities from the low parking lot. You don't need a pass during the week as there is no one to offer it. The Cosmic Cafe is closed, though the nearby bathroom is open. The museum about halfway from the Cafe to the Hooker telescope is a single room of photographs on the wall. It takes little time to see it.So during the week, start at the lower lot and look around, then park in the upper lot. Bring water as you can't get any when up there during the week. Wear comfortable shoes. You'll walk a bit over a mile, a lot on uneven terrainIf you're a history and science junkie, this is a terrific place to visit. if not skip it as you'll be disappointed as there is no Disney here, just major history. If you're bringing kids, you better know the story of the place if you're coming during the week as there are no guided tours and no one to answer any questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NSL14
50,Great Hiking!,"You will need parking pass for this park.. You can puck one up at REI or the pack station at the Chantry Flats parking lot.You can choose how difficult you want your hike to be, because there are several trails. The hike to the top (the Observatory) is longer than is published. According to the staff, it is closer to 18 miles. The last three miles, of which, are pretty difficult.It is beautiful terrain, and I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianC947

We took a self tour there, went up to the telescope. Nobody was there. Waited for some time and turned back. Einstein was among the founders and establishes of this observatory. Being high in the mountains it can see far away stars and constellations. It can survive under heavy snows (photo evidence is in the museum). Water reservoirs are to provide scientists and the staff with water.Too many squirrels here and there. Huge and fantastic trees. Be ready to walk for a while before you get the observatory. Wonderful view to LA and surroundings.It's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamop2014
40,"Interesting and educational. A ""4"" with the drive.","Taking the ""2"" up to Mt Wilson is such an amazing change from the LA freeways and surface streets. Beautiful views as you rise from the San Gabriel Valley, through the dry hills, and eventually reach cool, pine woodlands. The Observatory complex contains several exhibit areas, and will take about an hour to walk the complex, read the plaques, and listen the recorded presentation in the big telescope building. A short walk downhill from the telescope to Eagle View [?] provides super views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
50,If space excites you ... WOW!,"I got up to Mount Wilson one afternoon and was able to take a quick self-guided tour of the observatory. What a historic, informative and naturally beautiful complex! I wish we had more time. We did not avail ourselves of the formal tour. I would still like to do that. We walked through a couple of the small museums and saw the 100 inch scope. The setting at the top of Mount Wilson is so beautiful. Views of the Los Angeles area are spectacular! A number of people came just to watch the sunset. Trails radiate from this area. There is a small outdoor, covered café where you can get snacks, which we didn't try. Remember though, the museums and other observatory facilities are closed from December 1 through the end of March.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skytrekker
40,Highway to Heaven,"Fascinating area. Lots of great hiking trails and scenery. The observatory and telescopes were very interesting. Our group spent the night in the 60inch observatory after a great tour of the property by Mike. Due to atmospheric conditions, the observing wasn't the best - but interesting none the less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyb869
40,Mt. Wilson Observatory,"Located less than 20 miles from La Canada, Flintridge, the views from Mt. Wilson Observatory are just breathtaking. We took a walking tour which lasted just over two hours, and was about 1 mile round trip from the Cosmic Café. The tour director was very knowledgeable and made the experience well worth the time spent. The cost of the tour is only $10 for adults, and $8 for seniors and children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5917HClindaw
50,Well worth a visit for the 2 hour guided tour,"My son is an astronomy buff and wanted to see the Palomar Observatory during our 10 day trip to the west coast but we were going to be in Los Angeles instead. Hence, we opted to go to the Mount Wilson Observatory instead, based on the positive comments made by others on this TripAdvisor site. I had read all of the reviews well in advance as well as read all the visitor info on the Mount Wilson Observatory's WEB site. We decided to head out there on a Sunday afternoon for the 1pm tour (you do not need to book in advance). This was in August 2014. The road trip from the interstate to the observatory is indeed very winding but not nearly as bad as others have indicated -- I encountered worse hair-pin turn driving while doing the Big Sur drive up Hwy 1 a few days later, or the drive down the mountain from Great Bear Lake in the mid 1990s (scary!). As indicated, you should allocate about 45mins to drive from the interstate to the park, as things get slower the closer you get to the observatory. You should also stop earlier on into the drive to photograph some of the vistas.We had a good dozen or so people on our tour which was lead by Barry Megdal (who I later found out was a lecturer for th engineering department of Caltech, and also one of the people who was involved with the Caltech Caper of 1975, where they had rigged the McDonalds sweepstakes). He has his own astronomy setup so this was not a tour from a park ranger... The tour took most of 2 hours and was well paced. We saw the outside + inside of the 150ft solar tower. We walked past the 60in telescope but got to go inside and view the 100in Hooker telescope. We also got to walk past one of the 1 meter telescopes of the newer Chara Array. The parking lot, beside the scopes, used to be a tourist hotel a hundred years go. Another hill top has all the TV and radio transmitters for the area.I had not realized it at the top, but the Mount Wilson Observatory is basically ""jump up the hill"" from downtown Pasadena. You can see it from most parts of the city. However, it is 5600ft up. A cable car would have got us there in a few minutes, but alas, it takes 45mins to drive indirectly via car via Hwy 2.All in all this was an interesting aspect of our 10 day trip and well worth it for anyone interested in astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCL9
50,great views,"the drive there is pretty windy so try not to get carsick! the views are amazing. more naturey and green than the views from griffith observatory of course. i will definitely visit again, hopefully when there may be some snow up there.what sucks is that this place is only open from april to november... but it makes sense. they don't want visitors to risk the drive up during snowy conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
50,Were We Discovered The Universe,"Prior to this very telescope astronomers thought that the Milky Way was the entire universe! So it is monumentially important to mankind.It pops up frequently in movies, many of which are my favorites.The drive up is scary but persevere as it is a great experience. Do check out the pictures of how the mirror came up the mountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
50,Fascinating Destination for Astronomy Buffs,"The drive to the observatory was windy and adventurous, as we were coming from LA. This has been one destination I have always wanted to visit - back in grade 5 or 6 I wrote a letter to this place, asking some questions about space, and an astronomer answered, explaining all my questions about stars and planets. Ever since that time 20 years ago I have really wanted to visit here, it has held a special place in my heart and marked the start of my interest in astronomy.Anyways, the observatory has some very interesting displays in the museum building. Lots of pictures and information about galaxies and supernovas. The Hale telescope is huge, the dome massive.I enjoyed walking the ""Bridge to the Stars"" - the same bridge Albert Einstein took a picture on. Definitely worth the trip, just for the majesty and history of the place.Bring your own picnic lunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaximRossOz
40,Great day trip for nature and science lovers,"Who: A great daytrip for anyone in the Los Angeles area. Not suitable for young children, people with mobility issues, or people who have heart or breathing conditions and who might be more sensitive to the high altitude. Also not suitable for people with a fear of heights!What: Multiple telescopes (accessible only via paid walking tour), a small astronomical museum, café, vantage points, hiking trails.When: The observatory is open April 1st through November 30th (weather dependent). Best to avoid hot summer months. Later spring (May) and early fall (October) are good times to go. Does not get busy even on weekends. There is a two-hour, $10 walking tour of the grounds at 1pm on weekends, and the Cosmic Café at the entrance is open weekends 10am-4pm and sells sandwiches, snacks, beverages, and souvenirs.Where: The Angeles National Forest in the San Gabriel mountains. About an hour from La Canada-Flintridge at the base of the mountain. La Canada-Flintridge is about 25 minutes from Studio City and 45-50 minutes from Culver City on a weekend with no traffic.Why: Great opportunity to learn about astronomy and the region’s geographical history, and a good place to observe different kinds of plants and animals that can’t be found in the rest of Los Angeles County. Depending on visibility, a good place to get some views of the rest of the mountain range and LA county below.How: Must drive. Drive north on Angeles Crest Highway for 19 miles and then turn right at Red Box camping ground and follow the road for another 5 miles. Fill up gas tank before venturing up the mountain. Purchase $5 daily forest adventure pass from the Shell station in La Canada Flintridge or at the Cosmic Café at the observatory.Bottom Line: A must-see for anyone in the Los Angeles area who is physically able to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollym874
40,Excellent place for people who love nature/science,"This place is rich with history. I missed the 1 PM tour, i suggest to take it.It is in forest area and there are nice paved roads, so it is really nice.you need a 5$ pass which you will get in most places. a must see place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vkailash
50,Hiking Mt. Wilson,"This is a amazing but long hike to the top of Mt Wilson via Chantry Flats trail head. The first leg of the hike you go past many cabins nestled in the trees. A lot of this hike is in the canopy of the trees. It's a steady uphill climb, but worth it. The trail is beautiful as you make the summit you come up on the Observatory from the back side. During the spring and summer months the snack shop is open to buy lunch before you make your descent. Otherwise bring plenty of water and some food cause it's going to be a long day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnEllis3
50,A must-see if you're interested in science and/or history.,"It's well worth scheduling a guided tour. The tour includes a visit to the solar observatory, which (logically) is the only telescope which works during the day. You also get to see the big 100-inch scope up close and personal. Our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. This is a don't-miss attraction for anyone interested in the sciences. The drive up the mountain is long and scenic. The tour spends a fair amount of time outdoors in the sun. Remember that the sun is more intense at altitude and that you'll be above the clouds even on a cloudy day, so consider sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seoh
50,"Combined Outdoors, Science, and History into one excellent afternoon","I can't believe that after 25 years in LA we hadn't been to Mt. Wilson Observatory. It only takes about 40 minutes to drive from Glendale/Pasadena. At the Observatory, you're at over 5700', so the views are spectacular (depending on the weather and smog). We decided to take the tour, which cost $10pp. It was worth it, mostly because it got us into one of the solar observatories and inside the big 100"" telescope building. The tour is given by volunteer docents. Our docent was not the best, but, we got a fair amount of historic information in the 2-hour walk. If you decide not to spend the $10 for the tour, you can walk around most of the facility and see some exhibits that are setup around the telescopes.The walk is pretty easy. There are some up-hill sections. But, it's all paved, and mostly shaded by the pine and oak trees. It all seems to be wheelchair-accessible.The Cosmic Cafe is the only place to eat up there. The food is not that great, but not bad. Sandwiches, hotdogs, ice cream.Absolutely worth the drive.http://www.mtwilson.edu/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/am_a_freethinker
40,Brrr...it was cold when we went up,We took a day trip up Mt Wilson Observatory. We didn't know it was going to be that cold so we didn't dress for it. Beautiful scenic ride up and down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueL732
40,Breathtaking scenery and View of L.A.,"This is a great place to visit! It is both interesting and educational. The view is spectacular and panoramic. The cut off road (Mt. Wilson Red Box Rd) from Angel Crest highway is a bit rough, narrow and curvy! That should not deter anyone. There are security areas and a fee to park anywhere for hiking or visiting. The tours this time of year are just on the weekend. Would definitely revisit during season to get a more comprehensive experience. Still enjoyed what was available!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATTSAR
40,Mountain road challenging curving drive and LA city panoramic view,The tile tells you the highlights of this attraction! Give it try on a nice clear day. You will be unstressed! My husband did it a lot for free stress management!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
50,Excellent opportunity to visit an observatory,"Try to get there when you can get a tour (at this time - October - 1PM on Sat. and Sun., be sure to check the observatory website). Even if you can't be there for a tour, there are several museum/exhibits that you can visit with much very interesting information about the history and science of the observatory. For anyone even mildly interested in astronomy, this is a must-see if you are in the area. The drive up there does require traversing winding roads, but they are completely modern, paved and well maintained. There is a small fee (free if you have a Golden Eagle Pass), you can get the permit at the observatory. The landscape and views are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pgscmk
50,Bird's Eye View of LA,"Come up here on a clear afternoon & stay for the most amazing sunset view of LA & much of Southern California. The ocean of lights below is really spellbinding. You must negotiate the sinuous Angeles Crest Highway to get here. It's a challenge, but beautiful. Recently reopened since a big forest fire a couple years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
50,"A different, and beautiful, day trip from LA","Visited here in July 2008. Be aware, at least at the time of my visit, that you need a $5 park access ticket that you can buy at a sports store down at the base of the access road.Beyond that, it's a beautiful drive up into the San Gabriel Mountains, through pines in the constant SoCal sunshine.The observatory is really low key, you can just wander around most of it, with great views often afforded, and a whole lot of interesting sites. I loved walking in the footsteps of Hubble, Hale, Einstein (he visited) and other titans of astronomy.If you're after something different, I'd totally recommend this. At bare minimum, you'll at least feel like you're out of the hustle and bustle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HD1979
