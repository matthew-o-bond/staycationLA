50,"Vegetables, Plants, Music, Books, and Arts!","A great Farmer's market with fruits and vegetables, eggs, a used book stall, live musicians, plants, and an arts and craft section with great jewelry and hand made soap. I am a local. This market has grown over the last two years and is worth coming from far away to enjoy it. The Metrolink trains stop nearby. Welcome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnIreland19

50,"Surprisingly good size, and great fun","Moving to Claremont from New York City, I’ve been looking for anything resembling good music/ farmers markets/ hip little pubs, relaxing coffee shops etc.... and I was so pleasantly surprised to find this market. It’s in a lovely part of downtown Claremont and spans a few blocks. The times I’ve been there, there’s been a woman playing live music (loved her) in the middle of the strip and little stalls of fruit, vegetables, flowers and other items on both sides of her. It’s a really nice vibe and great place to visit on a Sunday morning/afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey613
