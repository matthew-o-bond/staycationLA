50,Interesting architecture,"Russian village is named for a Russian immigrant who helped early residents of the area build houses out of rocks, broken concrete, railroad ties, anything anybody could find. Itâ€™s a very unusual architectural Max and worth walking through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnIreland19
30,Quick Drive By,"On our way to lunch at Norm's, we drove by this area located east of Claremont Village and close to the Metrolink station. The homes are unusual, and when we have more time, maybe we will take a little walk around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
40,Like nothing I have seen.....,The Russian Village District is like nothing I have seen before. I believe the homes are made up of the original paving of the streets. But it is a cool little place to check out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewelzpedroza
30,Architectural oddity,Local stones/river rocks used in building several homes and walls.Worthwhile for being not quite unique and more of an oddity for the area.Quick walk of 10 minutes or 4 minute drive and turn around and go thru it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Very Unique Architecture Nestled Between Suburbs and Claremont Village,"If you are spending a day enjoying beautiful Claremont, taking in the village shops and restaurants and enjoying the quaint structures and beautiful homes surrounding it, you must take a little drive through the Russian Village.Don't quote me, but this little neighborhood has an interesting story about a man who built these (or some) of these homes using found materials from other places. It is a wonderful example of 'up cycling!'They are located very near to the Claremont Historic Train Station and the village. I recommend attending the weekend Farmer's Market in the village and then grabbing lunch at one of the delicious, yummy restaurants. After that peruse the boutiques. If you have a Fitbit and are trying to reach your 10,000 step goal, walk through the surrounding neighborhood and Claremont Colleges that are equally charming. You are in for a nice, shady walk as Claremont is famous for its beautiful trees. Continue to walk towards the Russian Village (about a mile further), or hop in your car to park and walk through the unique neighborhood. When you are finished, go to Bert and Rocky's to enjoy some wonderful, homemade ice-cream. If you love chocolate, I recommend their delicious 'dark chocolate' ice cream. If ice cream is not your thing, they have handmade candies as well as chocolate-dipped goodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmm10
40,fun place to walk around,"Great little walk to see the stone walls and houses built of local field stones from the alluvial plains around Claremont, as well as salvaged and recycled materials including the sides from railroad cars, items taken from the wreckage from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, and materials from wrecking yards. Konstantin Stys was Polish, not Russian, but to locals it was the same difference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
20,Homes,"If you want to gwak at someone's home, drive by cause that's all there is. There are no tours. These are private homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellena303
30,Nice Drive,"I used to get drive down this street everyday on my way to work, and it was always my favorite part of my day. These houses are uniquely built each one different from the next. The stone work on each house is amazing. I wish they would do tours of these homes. I would love to see inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ulvgirl
40,It's a fun drive,I just like driving thru the village. It's a unique part of Claremont. I've been going thru since growing up. All the trees make it shady.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roger_G_909
40,Interesting place!,"We have friends that live here. Their houses are beautiful, but the road is busy and slightly dangerous. Visit if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280zacharyw
50,Russian Village ROCKS!,"neighborhood of 14 houses fun to drive thru, wish one could see more of the houses themselves - house tour needed here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieStoneybrook
40,I want one!,These historic stone houses are so unique and really very pretty. They aren't far from the freeway and easy to find for people who enjoy unusual architecture. We were more impressed than we expected to be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
30,"Another ten seconds of ""Wow""","Interesting that you have 8-10 homes made of river rock and cement chunks, in one condensed area. But, unless you are an architectural guru, most people would see simply old buildings made of stone. Most are old. One was completed a few years ago, and made to look like the older homes. Be careful when you drive through. Speed limit is 25 mph and Claremont police like to sit on a side street and give you some Claremont hospitality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zeroc2015
50,Beautiful houses,There is not a whole lot to this place. It's just a block or so of stone houses. But the houses are really cool and each one is unique. I would have bought one in a heartbeat if any had been on the market when I was looking. The area is definitely worth driving though if you are driving around Claremont trying to get the lay of the land.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaTye
50,A Wonderful Place :),"History has it that this was built by a man that immigrated from Russia I believe. He took old chunks of cement and fashioned wonderful homes from them in a whimsical, rustic nature. It is on a narrow part of Mills Avenue and you might be able to park before or after them and walk to see the outside of these private homes. You drive through them but might get out of the car to view them better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisandmary1969
