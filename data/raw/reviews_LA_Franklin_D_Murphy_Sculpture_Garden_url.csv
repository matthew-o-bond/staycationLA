40,Very Nice Place to Spend an Hour or Two,"This sculpture Garden is on the campus of UCLA. It is not large as sculpture gardens go, but it is very peaceful. The twenty or so sculptures (almost all in metal) are well spread out and separately labeled. The quiet setting is beautifully landscaped. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fletch1946
40,"Out of the way, but worth a detour","The Murphy Sculpture Garden is at the north-eastern corner of the UCLA campus, and therefore a bit off the beaten track. It will repay a visit, however. It is a peaceful place with a number of statues of varying interest. Which you will like best depends on your taste; I particularly like the Serra and the Etrog, but there were a couple of more representational works that I also enjoyed, notably the Maillol. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
40,Hidden Gem,This is a great place for a stroll or a picnic on a nice sunny day. It is hidden among the campus buildings in north campus at UCLA. It is a trek from public transit stops but worth the walk. There are works from the world's most famous artists. One of the few places in the world where you can study the works academically in a classroom then step outside and see them in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
