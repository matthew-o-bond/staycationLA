50,The most beguiling of all beaches!,"Approximately 1 hr drive from Venice Beach will take you to Lechuza Beach. My absolute favorite Malibu Beach. There are no parking lots, so make sure you find a legal spot on the street. Look for the brown beach access sign and triumph down the stairs to the most beguiling of all beaches.Take up shack in a small coves and just beach away! You'll have a ton of space to yourself. This spot is popular among some surfers, but they stay to the north end of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnossDesign
