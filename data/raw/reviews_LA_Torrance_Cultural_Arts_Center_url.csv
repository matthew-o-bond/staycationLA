50,Love supporting the local arts,"The theater (may need tickets in advance) and Japanese garden (free) are lovely. Torrance has done a wonderful job with these venues and the surrounding Civic Center area. I highly recommend the cozy local theater for any type of show, and a quiet walk through the adjacent garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
40,Very nice,"Have been to most of the rooms here including the main theater. This is a wonderful place. Great for families, children and adults!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6063CWjamess
40,Great Local Venues,"The Cultural Center is made up of several buildings, from the Toyota Meeting Hall-- great for receptions, award ceremonies, seminar and craft events--to the Armstrong Theater--not a bad seat in the house. (the sound engineers really need professional training however. That is why it doesn't get a 5 star.)The Ken Miller Recreational center also great for dinners, dances, etc. There is an Art Center and also classes for yoga, martial arts and ethnic dancing. The Nakano Theater is a great intimate cabaret type venue for all sorts of musical or theatrical presentations, many of which are catered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinkstraveltime
50,Urban Renewal Project Concert & Dinner Show,"The actual concert was just so so, but the dinner was delicious as always. It was catered in. Weâ€™ve been to lots of concerts here and they are usually very good. It is a small venue site but the sound is great.At intermission they have delicious cookies and brownies catered from The Torrance Bakery. Great place to go and have some great music and a dinner if you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torrancecal
50,Another Wonderful Torrance Institution,"There are lots of events throughout the year at the Torrance Cultural Arts Center. It's free and accessible to all. I love this place and I recommend living in Torrance, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancynancynator
50,Comfy venue dedicated to celebrating the arts,"We did the ""dinner and a show"" event during their cabaret series in October. My husband splurged so that I'd have a chance to see one of my favorite group of performers, Streetlight Cadence.We drove the 90 minutes (plus) from Disneyland and arrived at the venue about 40 minutes before the show was supposed to start. We had will call tickets, which caused a bit of a kerfuffle (three different people supplied three different directions on how to pick up said tickets), but in the end, everything was squared away and we were granted entrance.The ""dinner"" part of the ""dinner and a show"" was catering brought in specifically for the night. They were serving chicken curry with rice and a side salad. As they didn't have a vegetarian option available, I asked the ladies serving to just fill me up on salad and vegetables from the curry sauce, which they did.We found out too late that drinks weren't included in the price of the ticket, so my husband had to hunt down an ATM - thankfully, there's one onsite, very close to the theater. Five minutes later, money in hand, we each had a bottle of water to consume.The theater was a bit dark, and a tiny bit cramped. Most of the tables were reserved for their members, so it took a bit of shuffling for us to find a table to squat at. We lucked out in finding one with a good view to the stage and sat down to eat our dinner. Note - they said the tables sat 4 people, but I think that's a bit generous. Unless you *really* like the people you're dining with.The theater itself had great acoustics, and even enough space up front for the impromptu dance floor (granted, it was a dance floor for one lady only, but at least she had space to get jiggy wit' it...)Parking was free and plentiful, and the venue itself was easy to find. I'd definitely head back for another of their shows (they had some really intriguing ones lined up for next year.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimeyTravels
40,Great Entertainment through the Torrance Culture Arts Center,"I am a season subscriber to plays and entertainment at the Armstrong Theater. They have some excellent performances. For a local theater in the South Bay it is a great place for entertainment. I have been a season subscriber for three or four years and I have enjoyed the performances. Unlike other larger theaters, this facility is easy to get to and there is no charge for parking. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
50,Heart of the Arts,"My little great-granddaughters had their recitals at this center and the facility is beautiful and comfortable. Those that are physically challenged for walking, it is a little far from parking lot to the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989ritad
50,Great for Families or a couples night out,Great place for family shows or an adult night out. The Theatre is great. Classes are held for all ages in a variety of areas and fill up quickly so register early!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THERESEB971
50,Great place to see local concert,Recently saw a jazz band play here and it was a lot of fun. It is a bit tricky if you are challenged to walk as the decline to get to the seats is steep.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Home of the TCTV awards and much more!,"Weddings for a reasonable price, and home of the TCTV awards, where I was producer of the year 4x in a row and producer of 216 cable ACCESS shows.

50,interesting cultural activities,"I have either participated in or been a guest at several of the annual Japanese Bunkasai festivals there.

40,Hidden Gem,"The community space is a hidden gem. There is a theater, performance space, large meeting rooms, one with a stage, two commercial kitchens, classrooms, a tiny Japanese Garden, and outside courtyard. It is well-maintained and used by Parks and Rec classes, for wedding receptions, cultural arts programs, plays, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandmapam2014
50,What would we do without the Torrance Cultural Arts Center?,"Being a long time resident of the South Bay I can say that I've been using the facilities for over 20 years. The hula show is a big hit every year and my nephews play in a band that plays here. Friends have been married here in the Japanese Garden.What makes it great are the people. Every time I start a new class, a staff member greets me with a smile ready to guide students to their classes. I take a fitness class here and have tried several over the last decade. The prices are excellent and my current instructor is the best yet! Terri teaches a boot camp style Step and Circuit class that is probably the most challenging I've ever taken, and I've tried many over my lifetime. She is low impact but high results. I feel stronger than I've ever felt in my life. I owe it all to Torrance Cultural Arts Center and Terri!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHinSoCal
40,Very good venue,"This is a lovely local theatre offering a good range of productions. I don't think there's a bad seat in the house. Only quibble is that the entry to each row is slanted very strangely and can be difficult, especially for people with mobility issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UltimateWines

40,Economical classes,"I used to take my kids there for piano lessons, ballet class, and art class. The classes were very affordable but registering for the classes were a pain. If you don't log on at 8am the day registration starts, the class you want might not be there anymore. Sometimes even when you log in as soon as registration opens the classes are already full. In terms of tourist visiting there really isn't anything to see. They have a small garden that is nice but it's so small you can see it in one glance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PiaN925
40,Local Talent Shows Off,"Wonderful city cultural center. Lot of talented people exhibiting their art work. Very encouraging place for those so inclined with artistic talent. Happens not to be me, but I can still enjoy the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nate090
