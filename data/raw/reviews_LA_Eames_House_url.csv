40,Worth a visit if you're an architecture buff (and we only did the exteriorself-guided tour),"The Eames House is a landmark of midcentury modern architecture. Built by Charles and Ray Eames (the original design was also worked on by Eero Saarinen), it's pretty stunning and yet designed to be constructed from ""off-the-shelf"" parts to make it an affordable design that could inspire designs for homes for everyday Americans. The most affordable way to experience the Eames House is to do an exterior self-guided tour. It's $10. That might not sound like much if you're used to interior, guided tours, but we still really enjoyed our visit. You can walk all the way around the house and studio for a 360-degree-view of the house and docents are there to answer any questions you might have. Because the bottom floor of the house and the studio has so much glass, you can see into several rooms of the house quite well. They ask that you don't take pictures into the interior through the glass because interior tours are how they fund-raise. Speaking of, if you're really a buff and willing to pay for the experience, you CAN tour the interior (prices are on their website). It was pricey for us, so we stuck with the exterior tour. Definitely right for us. We made a reservation online, but two guys who came in at the same time as us didn't make reservations and they were able to pay the docent and still do the exterior tour. It's a bit hard to find - definitely follow the instructions on the website. We parked on Corona del Mar and then walked back down the hill and then down a private alleyway (the only way to enter the property). If you enjoy architecture (especially mid-century American architecture), this house is worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
50,Well worth the trip of downtown LA.,"Built in 1949 as Case Study House 8 and lived and worked in for many years by Ray and Charles Eames with their children, this house is an eminently livable example of how life in Los Angeles could have evolved but didn't. The docents here are exceptionally well versed in the house and its importance within the realm of American mid-century design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolfa832
50,A wonderful oasis on the edge of Santa Monica,"I had one day in LA before my plane left and the Eames house was top of the list. I wasn't disappointed. As a modernist house lover, and owner of one in Australia I was interested to see what this place was like in real life. It was beautiful, and only $10 to walk around the grounds, but a lot more to have a guided tour inside. I'd say do the $10 and buy some merchandise like books, or the Eames colour toy to support the foundation. The garden is peaceful and full of eucalyptus, it looks out over the ocean, so you can spend time admiring the lines of the house, paving and gardens close by or turn around and enjoy the ocean. If you love mid century houses, then do this for sure. I got a Lyft to the house, access isn't that easy and you need to look at where you can park the car or get dropped off and picked up from. It's walking distance to Santa Monica too. I could have stayed all day here. The do ask that you don't take interior pictures, which are all available online anyway so do the right thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceceliatravelshere
50,A true insight into Charles & Ray Eames,It’s an expensive tour to see inside the Eames’ house but worth it for the comprehensive information learned about the couple and to see the surprising style inside their modern home. And you’re helping preserve a piece of Californian architectural history. Essential to pre-book an inside tour or you can pay $10 to see the outside only but you’ll be missing a lot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TivoliTwo
50,Fascinating and inspirational,If you are interested in architecture or design this is a must. A truly classic design with inspirational words from Ray and Charles Eames.Well wort the admission fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontski
40,A chance to experience a different form of modernist living,"Usually you see modernist houses and interior design as very streamlined and somewhat clinical but here the experience is completely different.If you're not a fan of design, this might not be for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hampstershark
50,Brilliant place for anyone wanting to understand mid-century,We booked the personal tour and indeed it was worth it. This is a unique location (and the last of the original seven sites) which deserve to be preserved for future generations. It’s not perfect - work is ongoing - and you can see the wrinkles and warts but the overall ambience preserved and knowledge of the guides make it something to do.We are interested in post war architecture and this gave us a step change relating to it. You can only read so many books and visit so many sterile museums - to see where the Eames family lived and experimented was the key. You can see many of the items (some really random and weird) which they collected on their travels but which triggered their creative ideas. You can see the place they sat to watch their movies and our guide really brought the scenes to life. It was also great to see some of their experiments which eventually turned into the classics we know today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262nigelb
40,Must for design nuts,"I’m a huge midcentury design buff and dragged my two sisters along to look at the place. As everyone has said, it’s a small house and studio on a bluff overlooking the ocean. The docents are knowledgeable and will open windows for you to look inside but no pictures of the interior are allowed. One star off for that since I would have loved a flash free photo of the living space. Also, there is a path around the back that brings you to the level of the second floor but the windows are closed and you can’t look in there either. I get why they don’t allow people in since it’s a private house and not designed for groups walking through. Inspiring design and lovely grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTravel31253
40,"You need to book, pay and be on time","We only knew about this from my son who lives in Los Angeles . It is one of 25 homes built as part of The Case Study House program.You need a car to get there as it is up on a hill with a great view of the beach and a very large grove of eucalyptus trees.Most people interested in interior design would have heard of Eames chairs but it seems that Charles and Ray designed many things. This building is architecturally significant and you had to keep reminding yourself that it was finished in 1949.It was so far ahead of it's time.They have built a similar style building alongside, as it is the home of The Eames Foundation. My only regret was that you cannot go inside, just look through the window. There is someone there to answer questions but he was just leaving .They only allow so many people at a time on the property so you have to book ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311gerris
50,Worth the drive and $10,"Another review says this is a mecca of architecture, and I have to agree. I had only seen it in books, but to see it in person is a special experience. Yes, $10 seems steep. But it is worth it if you like art, design, or architecture. The home is on a low bluff overlooking the PCH. You can't go inside unless you are willing to pay over $250 per person. But you can look in the large windows and see the first floor kitchen and living room. It's enough to get a sense of the Eames ethos and lifestyle.A privileged lifestyle, that is, complete with indigenous art overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Pacific Palisades was also an exclusive neighborhood only open to caucasians. So it seems a little appropriated.But still you have to wonder, why hasn't this idea of simple living caught on for us everyday people? It is iconic minimalism. If only we could all live together like this in peace and harmony, with the bare necessities.So visit, pay the 10 dollars and be inspired to break loose of our consumerist way of life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRealKristie
50,Inspirational! Highly Recommend.,"We emailed ahead of time to reserve a spot for the exterior tour ($10 a person). So worth it! Admittedly, we didn’t know much about Ray and Charles Eames, other than some of their furniture design pieces. This was a great way to learn more about the history of those pieces and their creators’ life work. Apart from all that, the location of the house is simply stunning. Such a quiet hidden gem in bustling LA.Parking instructions are very clear in the booking confirmation(next street over where there is free street parking). The hosts from the Eames Foundation were great in getting us started and even laid out a picnic blanket for our young kids to play on while we explored the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timpossible
50,"Lovely, serene, educational.","One other couple was on the grounds when we visited. The walking approach to the property was a great reveal. The docents were very knowledgeable, like being there, and pointed out many elements of interest. The house is one of the Case Studies houses enabled by Arts & Architecture magazine. The emphasis was on designing houses for contemporary, post-war living, in Los Angeles, with mostly off the shelf parts. If you do deeper research the adjacent house, though now heavily altered was also a Case Study house which shared direct views with the Eames House across a mowed space. The plans were on view for thumbing through. To walk inside is a hefty charge, which the foundation uses to raise funds. Owing to the views from the open sliding doors, while I would have liked to walk in, we saw plenty of detail. My friend recalls being there in the 1970's and found Ray Eames in the house. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCooks
10,Don't go !,"No indication what so ever to find the place, seems the place is hidden, why not ?Hower, 10$/adult is really not value for money.After a list of ""Don't do"", you actually can NOT visit the house.Visiting the garden is tolerated (but don't try the swing !)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcl61
50,Like going to Mecca,"If you are into architecture or design--especially mid-century modern--this is an absolute ""must."" We sprang for the interior tour, and felt it was completely worth it. Our guide was informative, pleasant, and took the time to explain a lot about the Eames, their history, the house and studio, and their work. The setting is stunning as well. So for architecture buffs, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFVacationer
50,Beyond amazing,Had a wonderful internal visit here which is well worth the extra money although no photos allowed inside.Our guide was really helpful and gave a great insight into the lives of Charles and Ray.Easily the highlight of our trip to So Cal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IainMoo
50,A pilgrimage for architecture and design lovers!,"We visited with a group that was exploring the LA-area architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, so we had some very knowledgeable docents who were able to make connections between FLW and Charles and Ray Eames. I was enthralled by the place even though we could not go inside. The windows are so big, and many of them open, so you can still get a good look inside (but you cannot take interior photos). It is not a big place, so you can see how having lots of people inside would be a challenge.Exterior tours are $10 and must be reserved in advance. Free public parking is about a five minute walk away. Interior tours are offered as a fundraiser and are quite expensive (starting at $275 for two people) but I would do it on my next visit to LA. There is no gift shop, but a few books and things are offered for sale. The grounds are expansive and fun to explore - there are several excellent explanatory signboards, discussing the house and the historical importance if the Eames's.I know what I am describing sounds very restrictive and you might wonder, why go? I admit, this place is not for everyone. But for those attuned to architecture and design, you will understand the place in history occupied by Charles and Ray Eames, and understand why visiting their home is so worthwhile. If you are unsure... if this quote from Charles Eames resonates with you, you will enjoy visiting this site: ""The details are not the details, they make the product just like the details make the architecture. The gauge of the wire, the selection of the wood, the finish of the castings–the connections, the connections, the connections. It will be in the end these details that provide service to the customers, and give the product its life.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
50,Masterpiece,"The Eames House is a must for lovers of modern architecture. Located in Pacific Pallisades, not far from Santa Monica it's well worth the effort to visit. It's a unique house that is beautiful to view up close and from afar. You must book for a visit, but it's only $10 and worth every cent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509waynem
50,Early Modern House,Great house for the architecture fans. Interesting to see this modern place and think when it was built. A forerunner of so many ideas for later houses. I just did the outside touring. You can see in the windows and doors. Very expense to do inside guided tour. Nice setting in the trees. I also had made a reservation on their web site. The parking information is easy to follow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358ea
40,A must see for architect lovers,"I loved discovering this place. Felt like paying a visit to the Eames.There is a very special and peculiar atmosphere which I enjoyed.Plan about an hour to take full advantage.You can really get a thorough understanding of how the Eames lived and there is a lovely collection of artefacts, furniture, design, ... in their house and studio.But: you can't visit inside and have to stay in front of the windows. And taking pictures at the house is not allowed. You have to keep a couple of meters distance to take pics. A silly rule I have to say.Staff is very friendly and happy to explain whatever you want to know about the Eames.The venue misses a little café and library.There is a small 'shop' (more like a rack) where you can buy cards and books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
40,Architectural Masterpiece.,"You've seen Eames furniture, perhaps own some. So it's a treat to visit the home they lived in and well worth it.I booked the pricey interior tour that's $275 for two people, even though I was solo.It offered a rare view into their home, left exactly as it looked at the time of Ray Eames passing, including an unwrapped package! Coats were still in the closet and books left piled up.The setting is a home that people lived in, not a set for a photo shoot for a magazine publication, frankly almost to a fault. Ray Eames passed in 1988, so at points the reverence to how it looked on the day she passed seemed a little obsessive.That said. If you love architecture, don't miss this visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingSMH
50,"Book, go, take time to enjoy. Must see in LA!","Eames house is a place where you should take your kids. Book it, go ( read website instructions carefully, then it's easy to get there) and take 45-60 min to enjoy. It's not only for architecture/design fans, it's about how approach to life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerzy1969
50,Worth a visit for those interested in architecture and design,"Lovely, serene place and very knowledgeable guides and reasonably priced (kids are free).Note that pre-booking is essential, the tour is of the outside only (though the interior can be viewed through the windows) and photographs of the interior are not allowed. Also there is no parking, but it is very easy to find free street parking a short walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Munchkin208
40,Must see for architects and designers,"We had some free time while in LA so decided to stop by the Eames house. It was worth $10 to walk around and peek into the house. The docents gave some good background information and then we just casually explored for about 15 minutes. The tour does not go inside but you can see in pretty well and there is a documentary on the couple and the house if you want to see more. The house is showing its age, but still an incredible concept for the times. In an age where container houses are the rage, this house set the bar for unorthodox residential construction. Be sure to email in advance to reserve your time slot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Loving_Lady
40,ArchiTraveling at Eames House,It was very difficult to find.. the taxi driver got confused but it was worth the try. The house is really beautiful and unique but the 10$ fee for the exterior (only) visit is overrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
40,Architectural Treasure in Pacific Palisades,"Our out-of-town guests interested in architecture suggested a visit to the Eames House. Frankly my only vague knowledge of the Eames name up to that point was the iconic lounge chair. We followed the instructions on the Eames Foundation website, made reservation and found our way to Pacific Palisades on MLK Day. Parking on Corona del Mar Street was easy and after a short walk down a slope, we reached the grounds of this simple living museum where Charles and Randy, pioneer creative design geniuses, lived and worked over half a century ago. We paid $10 for a self-directed exterior tour. The friendly staff made a brief, informative introduction and we were on our own. Though we could not go inside the house/studio we were able to see the somewhat cluttered interior and various collections through the windows. We walked up behind the houses but were disappointed that we couldn’t see the interior of the loft as we had hoped. The meadow (garden) in front of the house looks out to the Pacific Ocean. There are several permanent display stands that provide historical background and photos to enhance the experience. The quiet atmosphere was calming – not many visitors. Looking at the house, one can’t help but realize that while its design concept may seem somewhat commonplace now, it must have been a very novel innovation and bold statement when first introduced in the late 1940’s. As we walked away after an hour or so, we felt grateful to have the opportunity to actually see in person this unique boxy architectural treasure, a national landmark, in our own city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LnS2004
50,Must see for architecture lovers,"I was fortunate enough to get a ticket on short notice for the self-guided exterior tour..Although self-guided, there is an introduction/orientation.I got mine from a very nice man (Richard?) and it was very informative.The views are also great. I took tons of pictures.I was able to see the contents of the house a few years ago at the Pacific Standard Time Exhibit at LACMA. Everything is back in place now. You can see in from the outside but no pictures of the interior are allowed.Obviously time has left it's mark on the exterior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Goddess_in_KA
50,Hidden place,This is a really special place which was the home of an important creative 20th century designer. Very interesting to anyone interested in furniture or architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rj100032655
50,A must for any architecture fan,After visiting other famous houses of architects and designers this is more a hard core one. The place is a bit hard to find and parking only possible a little walking distance away. They offer interior and exterior tours. The interior tour is guided but very expensive. The exterior tour is unguided and a reasonable $10 per person. You need to know a little about Ray and Charles Eames before you visit and then your visit will enhance your understanding. The house was their home and designed as such. It was never intended to be a show case and you feel that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sancho5a
50,Mid Century Modern Dream,"We did an external only tour of the house, which was certainly worth the small fee! The staff are very friendly and informative. Having told us a brief history of Charles & Ray Eames and how they came to build the house, they then left us to roam around and take photos, which was great for us. Really would recommend a visit for any mid century modern architecture fans. Parking was a bit of a mare, we parked down on the beach but there isn't really a proper footpath all the way up the hill to the house, but we made it and it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GHedley
50,"An Icon of Modern Architecture, Untouched, Secluded, and Intimate","The Eames House can be visited by both those involved in architecture & design, as well as whoever has interest in learning about this pioneering design for many of the modern homes your see all around Southern California. My visit was very intimate, with only 1 guide present, a charming young lady who was very helpful and enthusiastic about the history of the home and the Eameses. She was knowledgeable enough to discuss the home in a critical way, referring to the original Arts and Architecture magazine, and some other writings, but also in a more general way for a broader population, talking about the site, the home's elegance and its preservation. For exterior visits, If you're a university student, it's free, if you're just an adult, its 10 dollars. If you love taking photos, the home's exterior is all yours to photograph, as well as the site complete with a view of the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica.I took uber to and from the home, and the pick-up/drop-off point should be the corner of Chautauqua and Corona Del Mar, just because the entrance to the driveway is tight, as is unsafe, at a blind corner, on a relatively fast road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186jonr
50,Well worth the time,"I must disagree with the reviews implying this is more for those in the architecture field. I knew nothing about several of the well known architects from LA, much less the Case Study Houses, but learned of them while researching my trip. I quickly realized what an architecturally important city LA is, and made a point to see various important houses. The Eames House is a great example of how housing and architecture were viewed after the shortages of WWII, and the solutions offered. My visit was a great learning experience, made all the better by current intern Christine! She gave me a wonderful historical and architectural background, and I left far better educated about the Eames, the Case Study Houses, and architects in LA. Thanks Christine! Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip

50,The interior tour is absolutely amazing,"Having flown across the world to see the building, we decided to splash out and get an interior tour. It was BRILLIANT! I totally recommend going the extra and paying for this tour- it was worth every penny.Our tour guide was so knowledgeable and friendly (an incredibly helpful young woman we think was called Katherine ?) and we were able to spend a good couple of hours hearing about the house, looking at all the amazing objects in the house (including playing with the incredible musical marble run) and asking lots of questions, as well as looking through all the construction drawings for the house.It was such a privilege to spend time in the living room, it felt that the interior of the house really explains the warmth and fun of Charles and Ray and gives a new understanding of their design philosophy !Although expensive, all the money goes to a great cause and it was totally amazing. Could not recommend more highly, especially of the tour guide.Thank you for showing us round!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321tierneyl

We called on the morning of our visit and were able to make a reservation, but website recommends calling 48 hours in advance. Even though you cannot enter the house, the glass walls allow a clear view inside. Grounds are a nice walk; there are several stations with information about the building of the house and its changes over the years. Nice ocean view too. Staff are available for questions.

The publisher of Arts and Architecture Magazine started the program to support budding architects during the post World War II era, using modern technology from the war.My husband and I took the interior tour of the house. Very pricey at $275 for 1-2 persons, but well worth it if you love design. The dollars go for a good cause toward preservation and maintenance of the property. Plus, I am an interior designer and it was my birthday, so I treated myself!You can do self guided exterior tour of the grounds for $10 per person. Reservations are required for this, as well. Do not miss this opportunity since the grounds are beautiful and you can see inside most of the glass house anyway from the exterior. You can also walk through the gardens and onto the patios that the Eames designed. Just excellent!For the interior tour, I enjoyed the detailed information that the docent provided, the ability to see items in the house closely and the fact that the house remains essentially the way it was, furnishings, artifacts and all, from the end time that the Eames lived there. The house is an example of good, functional design. It also was an inspiration to me, as a designer, to see the common objects that brought so much joy to Ray and were her daily design inspiration. It was a delight to see the interior of the adjoining design studio where Ray and Charles worked.Definitely worth a visit, especially the exterior grounds tour. Don't miss it if you are in the LA area.There are no interior restrooms, but a high end port-o-let on the property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky053
