50,Best brewery in Westlake!,"Been here a few times for their beer and cupcake pairings, so much fun! The beer is fantastic (especially the IPAs) and they have something for everyone! My friend doesn't really drink beer, but she had their coconut stout and peanut butter beer and loved them both. Bartenders are always prompt and friendly, and more than willing to let you sample a beer before you commit to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoboSnacks
40,Patriotic Brews,"We heard of a new brewery in town. We headed on over there. Easy access right off the 101 Freeway. Exit Lindero Canyon and head North. Turn left on Via Colinas. Turn right at the first driveway. It is in an industrial park. This place is hard to find, but just keep heading towards the back, follow small signs and eventually you will find it, tucked into a little corner in the very back.We went on a Saturday afternoon and parking was limited because the other industrial companies were open. But eventually we found a spot. Hint: back your car in, easier to leave.Quaint little place. Dark like the inside of the ship. The decor was done based on a Revolutionary Ship in history. Seating is ample, lots of high tables, sofa seating with ottomans, no bar seating.Extremely busy but fast service. Prices vary $5-$9thumbs up on all beers.We had the Tyrannicide, Peanut Butter Cup, Weathered Sail, and Slippery Deck.Pro: Nice place to pass a lazy afternoon. Mostly locals. Dog Friendly (met a great pup named Bentley (A Large black New Foundland)Con: Kids welcome which makes for lots of noise and sometimes whining tired children throwing tantrums. This one little girl was tired and just started throwing things around. Not my bag. I prefer well behaved puppies.Besides I have never understood taking children to a bar and then driving home after having a few. (of course I hope they have a designated driver) But from what I observed all adults were drinking.They have Skeetball which is also noisy but fun. they also have free pretzels and mustard in little pre-filled silver cups.We will be back again. Maybe when the kids go back to school..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normail216
50,Outstanding,"This brewery is outstanding. Their beer is awesome. The attention to detail that went into the showroom is impressive. Great atmosphere.We were there Sunday and really enjoyed it. It was crowded and Brittney was the only one working the bar.She was super efficient and friendly. She poured beer, cleaned tables, greeted customers with a cheerful attitude. It was refreshing to see such a great work ethic.It's a dog friendly brewery as well. Our dogs loved it.We will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
50,Friday night...,"A friend recommend this place and I‚Äôm glad I stopped by...cool vibe, super friendly staff and their pale ale is yummy! üçª",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamstreetrose
40,Impressive,"Brewery in an industrial park that already has another brewery nearby. The beer here is really good. I had three beers and was impressed by the pilsner and wheat beer. My friend liked the IPAs just as well. They had a cupcake pairing on my visit, which was pretty cool. The inside is very nice with seating areas and skiball. Large TVs make this a good place to watch sports. The beer is a little pricey at $7 a pint, but very high quality stuff, probably my favorite in Westlake so far. I will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hitcher84
