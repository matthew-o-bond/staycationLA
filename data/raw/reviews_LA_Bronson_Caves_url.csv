50,Beautiful place,This place is amazing and beautiful and has 2 labyrinths made out of Rick's that are beautiful. the cave is fin fir kids to explore and they can climb the surrounding mountains. It's a very short and easy hike to the cave. Tou can see the Hollywood sign from this area too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whiskingapples
50,lovely trail,great place to hike. very close to hollywood. parking is mostly full but you get to find one eventually since people frequently getting out. dont forget to bring water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugarmann
30,Rather dissapointing,"The thought of visiting the location where the bat cave was more impressive than the cave itself. It was quite a let down when we got there, but on the upside we watched another movie (or episode) of something being filmed nearby. Unless you have time I'd give this a skip to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
40,The Batcave... Cool!,There is not a lot to see here but knowing that this was the bat cave of the tv show made this worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6146LOdavidw
50,Robin to the Batcave!,If you are movie or television fan who needs to see where these classics are filmed then don't miss this easy hike. I would watch the old Batman television series back in the day and seeing the car race out of the cave was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
40,"Easy to Get To, Nice View of Hollywood Sign","Easy to find parking in the lot across the from trail. Very short walk takes you to the ""cave"" entrance, walk through it and you come out where the Batmobile used to. My husband also recognized some of the scenery from Star Trek episodes. It was a hot day when we went, so we didn't hike to the sign, but you can see it easily from here and get a great picture of it with little effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtdlx
50,Must go to location for Batman fans,"This is a nice little hike in Griffith Park and a must see for Batman '66 fans. The Batcave exit was filmed here and, as you round the corner, the cave entrance is recognizable despite the fact that in the TV show they used a lot of foliage to disguise it. It was surprising to us that there are actually 4 entrances. If you aren't a Batman fan (or a fan of the many other TV/movies shot there), it's still a nice little hike. If you go a little early and have the place to yourself, you can enjoy bird watching and rock slide spotting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1187HBlisag
50,The Batcave!,"My partner is a huge Batman fan and I just kind of smiled and nodded indulgently when he said he wanted to see the Batcave while on our trip to LA. OK, dear. I didn't realize it was a whole canyon with hiking trails and scenery and rock formations and a great view of the Hollywood sign. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastrada
40,Batman memories on a walk all the family can manage,"This place is perfect for the full family from little ones to limited mobile. Make the shortish walk from the parking and come check out the place many of the elder in the group will remember, while the rest will have fun taking pictures of them selves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776nicholasb
50,"This is the Bat Cave from Batman! It was fun to see and the hike was even better, up to the Hollywood sign.","This was a surprisingly fun day and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to hike! We drove to Bronson Park and somehow found a spot to park (it's a very popular place). We had a short walk to see the Bat Cave and then a really long, gorgeous hike up to see the Hollywood sign. The first part of the climb is rigorous for couch potatoes ( it just gets your heart rate up, it's not too steep) but it's totally doable and worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugs222
50,Very fun afternoon,"While visiting California, my daughter wanted to go hiking and climbing. She loves nature and wanted to do something other than beaches and museums. I'm so glad she asked for us to find something like that. This was perfect for all of us and we had a great time. The cave is a very short walk from the parking lot. Although very busy, we didn't feel crowded. There is plenty of space to roam. We got to see a few coyotes up close, which was so much fun for the kids. You could tell they were curious, but never got close enough to scare us. It's nature after all, so they belong there more than us. It was a fun few hours and we could have stayed longer if time allowed. I honestly didn't know anything about Batman or the other movies filmed there until I read a few reviews today. We had a great time and would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmykids2
40,Batcave,Short hike off of Canyon Drive. This is the location where the Batcave was set in the old tv show. Itâ€™s actually a tunnel and not a cave. On the other side is a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign. There are two parking lots nearby. Something fun and free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674dianeq
20,Boring ðŸ¦‡ bat caves,This was actually a pretty boring adventure. The hike was too short and there really wasnâ€™t much to see. Itâ€™s not worth the bother to find parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pameladC9019ZJ
50,"Awesome Place in LA, but the Parking...","We went to the Bronson caves to take the children to see where the bat cave was.The only problem is that there is not much parking and the roads leading to are very narrow, If you go, go early. The walk is a bit steep, but manageable and not very far.The front is where they drove the bat cave from. It was dressed for the TV show shots, so it does look a little different than what you've seen on TV. The other side of the cave showcases a couple of climbable hills that will immediately make you think of dozens of westerns of TV shows that were filmed there, but you didn't know it at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATravelDriver
40,So easy to get to,A great little walk up to the Bronson Caves where the original Bat Cave was filmed. Easy walk and there are a couple of caves and several hiking areas. Lots of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11suzannek
50,Holy great place to visit,This is a must see ! I have lived in California for 25 years and never been here until today . Itâ€™s where they filmed the original Batman tv series opening shot. You can walk through the cave and their is an awesome shot of the Hollywood sign in background . Also when you leave the area of the caves you can walk to the back of the Hollywood sign which we did . That hike is mostly uphill and you will need 2 hours . Make sure you have lots of water and good shoes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Good hiking trails,"LA has a lot of hiking trails the the one in Bronson is my favorite. Usually not a lot of tourists or maybe just the times I go which is on weekdays. Short walk if you park your car at Bronson. You can also see the hollywood sign from here. Make sure you bring water especially on a hot sunny day, which is like everyday in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustlivinglife
30,Nothing special,"We first went on a longer hike in the area that is suppose to lead you to the Hollywood sign and that was pretty good, as it had some really nice views and a fairly decent long hike. After that we decided to check out Bronson Caves hike - it was really nothing special. It was a short 20 minute walk to these ""caves"" that didn't seem like anything special what so ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timeless_Explorer
40,A cherished filming location.,While it is man made. It was still pretty cool. I appreciated the surrounding scenery and that the caves split.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadkillz
50,VERY Cool!!!!,"Our family of 5 (boys ages 7, 11, and 16) explored this area for a couple of hours. My boys LOVED that fact that it was the ""Batcave"". You can also get some great pics of what looks like you are holding up the Hollywood sign just outside the cave. As were were descending to our car, we were able to see a film crew and all it's gear, driving up to the cave to get ready to tape a TV show so that was exciting. Don't expect a bathroom nearby though!! There was a port o potty at the bottom of the hill but it clearly had not been attended to in weeks and it was beyond deplorable!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlysH4531NS
30,A very obscure place,"I don't know that you'd call it a hike. You walk a half mile path that looks like a truck access driveway. It is wide and fairly level with a slight gradient. There are no signs, bells or whistles. You simply drive up into Bronson Canyon section of Griffith Park. A steeper hike one way takes you up near the Hollywood sign. The big, flat, wide path on the other side takes you to the cave/quarry. We're neither Batman or Star Trek fans (or the other movies filmed here) so we didn't get a big thrill out of it. It was a nice view of the Hollywood sign for photos and the kids climbed the walls of the old quarry and explored for a bit. Don't be too disappointed if you have to miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sickaworkin
50,TO THE BATCAVE,"This place is a nice, easy hike up to ""the batcave"". Also used in several other films and videos. The cave itself is pretty small but is surrounded by some nice trails and scenery. One of the really nice surprises is the great view of the Hollywood sign. On a hot day, the cave is nice and cool. This is a cool little hike that is really easy enough for just about anyone. I believe it is less than a quarter mile each way. Easy parking next to the trail. It can be confusing as to which way to go when you get there so if you park in the actual parking lot, which you should, the trail will be the one behind you and across the street. Not the one in front of you going into the woods. Pass the Smokey the bear sign next to the road and go up the slight hill to the cave. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chiggins
50,"""I must, but I cannot!"" - XJ2 (ro-man), circa 1953","for a fan of ""Robot Monster"", this place is a must-visit. its free, terrific little walk getting here, and you can feel the magic of the RM movie. Oh yeah something about batman too.Nice park and lots of nice trails as a bonus.Remember, XJ2 is really a ""pooped out pinwheel"", or so we learned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arizona-mark
30,Nice hikes with a bonus,"This place had a few different paths for some nice hikes, one that even lead near the Hollywood sign. But my favorite part/hike was the one that lead to the Batcave! From the 1960â€™s Adam West Batman TV show. So cool!!! Make sure youâ€™re covered up if you go here, itâ€™s unkempt and dirt/gravel paths. Be sure you bring plenty of water and sunscreen as some areas are wide open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deonna2
40,A Slice of Hollywood Lore,"My actor pal took me to see this modest tunnel that has been used in various TV shows and movies.

50,To the bat cave!,"Ok it's not well marked and a little hike but well worth it. Where they filmed the 66 batman bat cave exteriors and The Klingon prison in Star Trek 6. And robot monster ! The skinny- it's a cave, man made. But the views are breathtaking and the nostalgia factor is off the scale. You will feel like you've been there before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gregger0415
50,Fantastic way to visit the Hollywood Sign and see the 'Batcaves' too!,"Great little park at the end of Canyon Drive in Hollywood with parking, restrooms and picnic tables.

50,Unique excursion into a slice of L.A. history,I went to Bronson Caves with some friends. We wanted to see a few sights where old B movies and the Batman television series was filmed. It was a nice short hike to the cave with pretty scenery all around. The caves are easy to access. You can walk in and around the caves. From the east side of the caves you can see the old Hollywood sign in the distance. Great place to take photographs. I would go back and take my dog for an easy hike and for the scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimg793
30,It's Gotham time,A must see for Batman fans and a cool day out for the kids (can be combined with a picknick and the playgrounds of the park). It's a moderate hike up to the caves that can be accomplished in about 10 min. with the possibility to go up a little further to catch a great view on the Hollywood sign. Great for a quick hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/march635
50,We saw a clown!,"Not everyone will see a clown in Bronson caves (no, it wasn't the Joker). The walk up from the last parking lot on Canyon Dr was only about a quarter mile. The cave is actually a tunnel that goes through the giant rock. The tunnel splits into 3 separate tunnels each one smaller that the first. We did not try to walk through the smaller ones, but I'm sure a child could make it through. On the other side of the caves is a trail that goes up, up, up, and up. We didn't do that either. As we walked back to our car through the cave, there was a clown with tattoos getting ready to be photographed. But I could not guarantee she will be part of your experience. Still, definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
50,It's the Bat Cave!,"YES! My bucket list is complete! One of my all-time desires was to personally visit the Bronson Caves. Seen in many popular TV shows and movies, the caves have always intrigued me. It was the bat cave entrance in the 1966-68 Batman TV show. It has also been seen in lots of 1950s Sci-Fi and horror movies. In fact, about 180 movies and TV shows have filmed in and around the caves. The trek to the cave is short and quite nice. The trail is wide and peaceful. As you come around the last bend in the trail you see the entrance to the cave. You can also see the entire canyon area. Quite beautiful. The cave has one opening in the front and three openings in the back. It is not very deep, but it is a really cool place to visit, especially if you are a fan of B-movies, westerns, and sci-fi TV and films. Less than a quarter mile walk from the last parking lot on Canyon Drive in Griffith Park. If you go, remember, Ro-Man from Robot Monster called this place home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
50,How cool was this,First of all a nice hike.Then you go through the famous cave where Will Rogers filmed his famous (It's all famous) rescue scene. then you walk through and welcome to a Star Trek episode.Keep going nice mountains and Presto a great view of the Hollywood sign.You getting the picture yet. This is a good spot!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
50,bat cave,Brought my 4 year old son here just ti check out the place. My hubby took his bike and strolled them here. It was a fun day. You can view the hollywood sign from here too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mari_reys
30,"Flashback to the old ""Batman"" series","The cave is a short, uphill walk in Griffith Park. It is the cave that was used in the original ""Batman"" TV series. It's not really a cave but a tunnel but fun anyway. Have to imagine it with greenery around it and a drop-down fence. Just a blast from the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
30,"It's a tunnel, nice but that's about it.","It's not a cave it's a tunnel you can walk though. It's a very short walk (< 1/2 mile) from the parking lot and free, You can walk around the hill it's in and get a nice view of the Hollywood sign. It's a 15 minute to 1/2 hour curiosity. You can hike to the rest of Griffith Park from there but I can't say it's any easier to get to the sign from there. Also in the area there are historic stairs are documented in Charles Fleming's Secret Stairs of Los Angeles book that a hiker might find interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
40,"Cool place, whether you're a Batman fan or not!","Short hike up a gradually sloping hill to the Batcave from the original Batman series. Saw some college students setting up to shoot a short film for their classes. Also, provides a decent view of the Hollywood sign from just outside the cave. Get there early a.m. to find some decent parking or you'll find yourself with a much longer walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulwO8359AR
50,A short hike to a piece of LA history,"Bronson caves is really an old stone quarry from the 1920's. The tunnels have been used forever for film and TV production and photo backdrops. We once saw some fashion photographers there, taking pics of girls. You never know what you'll see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevincA8344UK
40,Fun to see the Batcave!,"It's a short hike up a sloping hill to reach this cave, and well worth the effort made to get here. If you ever watched the original Batman TV series, you'll recognize the cave instantly. I could visualize Adam West roaring out of the cave in his Batmobile, Robin at his side- really fun to see this place. When you walk through the cave, the other side offers a wonderful view of the Hollywood sign.The LA area hasn't had much rain so it's a very dry and dusty hike - not difficult but I think it would be hard on a very hot day. We went around 9:00 AM and it was lovely and peaceful- we were almost the only ones there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyGNewJersey
30,kind of cool to see,"bat man was filmed here (don't ask me which one). hard to find. if you do find the correct street, it dead ends, if I am not mistaken, and the path to is before the end on the right. foot path, not for cars. I read you can see the Hollywood sign from the other side of the cave, not true.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karyn2323
50,Peace and quiet,Parked and hiked up a bit to reach the caves that I found browsing TripAdvisor. We were the only ones there and it was nice break to get away from all the city noise. The area was beautiful to me. Walking around the caves some we saw the best view of Hollywood sign we've got our whole trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetters13
30,Eye to eye with coyotes,Still a best kept secret. We went there ar the end of the afternoon. And when we aproached the cave we encountered a family of coyotes. What an up close experience. Through the caves you have a great view on the Hollywood sign up the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxHubner
40,Lots of movie and television history at this location.,"It's a short and easy hike up to this famous cave/tunnel. The most obvious famous use of this tunnel was as the Batcave entrance on the 60's Batman television show. The tunnel is actually only about 75ft or so long but with the right camera angles you can't see the outlet on the opposite side. When you go to the back side the tunnel has split into 3 outlets with one the same size as the entrance and the other 2 much smaller. On the back side you realize these were used in many, many westerns as mine or cave entrances. The whole area on the back side was often used in westerns as it is obscured from the development of the LA area and makes it look very remote on camera. No flashlight needed and there are generally plenty of people in the area to make it feel safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coastermeister
50,Must go if you are in LA,"It is a fun way to get in shape and have a great view of the city. If you are visiting LA, this is a must go... you will get plenty of scenic pictures to show to friends and family.-bring a lot of water since there are not much shade on this hike.- when you arrive at Canyon drive (on your gps), you can park outside of the gate or inside. All parkings are free.- the first parking is on your right hand side.- keep walking... before go pass the second parking on left hand side, you will see a road on right hand side with a bear guy sign. Take that road. Go up for about 20 yards to the white gate that blocks car passing only.-go around the white gate up the road to 10 minutes... you will see the bat caves.- when you go to the other side of the bat caves, you will see the iconic Hollywood sign.-You can go back or follow the pave road to hike to the sign. There is no short cut to the sign. This road is the same road as if you go pass the second parking at the entrance.- if you want to skip the bat caves, then go pass the second parking on the left, pass the gate and the skate park. Then continue hiking up.- it is plenty of photo op when you get to the top. Round trip is about 6 miles.- take ibuprofen before hiking because your knees and legs will start barking after a mile up hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kukulimoku
50,Awesome little hike!,"First, not many people hiking up in that area even know what the Bronson caves are. We stopped and asked about 8 people after parking where to go - no one knew. We finally found a couple who directed us in the right direction.Easy 10 minute walk up a gradual hill to the caves. Some of the directions on the web ""at the fork in the road, go left"". Seriously, there's a fork in the road, you look left, there are the caves. My husband - a HUGE Batman fan - thought it was awesome. The day was perfect, kids had a blast running around & inside and outside the caves. Through the cave is a perfect view of the Hollywood sign. A man was inside the caves playing acoustic guitar, so we had mood music too.If you want something off the beaten path, this was definitely a delight and for us native Chicagoans, a 10-minute hike is about all we're used to doing ;-)Tips for parents - LEAVE THE STROLLER in the car unless you have a heavy-duty all terrain stroller. The road was pretty rocky/uneven. Sunscreen the kids too - full sun, no protection while walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heybets30
40,Short hike to the bat cave batman!,"This was a nice, short hike in a park in a semi residential area. The caves are small and would be fun on their own but much are much more of an experience if you are a fan of the old Batman series. You can take in the view of the Hollywood sign from the back side of the caves - makes a nice photo. Worth a quick pit stop if you an extra 30-60 minutes in your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missanthropchi
50,Visit the BatCave and Maybe See Action on a Movie Set!,"Bronson Caves is really easy to find. Especially if you don't use Google Maps. Just go up the Canyon Drive all the way to the end you'll see you small parking lot on the left that serves about 15 cars. It also says Hollywoodland Park. As you come up Canyon Drive the signs say Park Road Closed Ahead, pay no attention, to these unless it is the middle of the night. If you come early and get a spot there then you walk back down Canyon Dr about 50 feet and you will set on the left (west) a dirt road that leads up the hill. Typically that gate is shut to stop cars. You can walk around the gate easily. On this day the gate was open. I thought how odd but I parked and walked up the dirt road anyway. As I continued up the road I noticed that there were so many fresh tire tracks. It was as if it was a heavily used dirt road. Then there were all these power cables laying on the ground, thick power cables. And a lot of them. I did not know what this meant . I walked on up the hill not very far, less than a quarter of a mile and around the corner there were lots of trucks. There were lots of things that looked like palm trees on the ground. There was stuff scattered everywhere. I had found the cave but what were all these people doing here? Well I asked somebody and a very friendly man named Ace told me that they had been shooting a movie here and they were just cleaning up all the stuff and closing down the set. It was a George Clooney movie Hail Caesar that had just been shooting some scenes here. So I took some pictures of them of the the set or what was left of it. Anyway I walked through the cave and found that from the back of the cave where it comes out there is a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign and the radio tower. The Hollywood sign is not visible from the front of the cave nor on the walkway up Canyon Dr. But, if you walk out the back of the cave you will find a beautiful view. How interesting the cave is not very long maybe a hundred to a hundred fifty feet, none the less and it is the famous Batcave. That was my original motivation. To walk up there to say yes I had been to the Batcave. Well I have now completed that mission and one of the beautiful things about exploring new places is you have to go there. You have to be at the location where it happened. You have to show up. And you never know who or what you're going to run into. What a lovely experience it was for me today. Hope you're so lucky when you go to the Bronson Caves. Check out the filmography on Wikipedia and you will find a very long list of shows and movies shot at this location, called arguably one of the most use movies sets in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
40,WHAM! A double win on this short hike!,"Yes, we wanted to see the H'wood sign on our first visit to LA... we parked in Bronson Canyon-Griffith Park lot, took a short hike to caves used in some TV & movies (The batcave!), and as you come out of the cave, BAM, POW!

I have seen all the original Batman shows (multiple times) and I still re-watch them to this very day.The one part I enjoyed the most from the show was the ""Batmobile"" as it left the bat cave. As I arrived here today at the Bronson Caves I was excited to see this original Hollywood landmark. The real ""original"" Bat Cave where the REAL Batman & Robin shows took place!It was so fun to take the short hike to the Bat Cave. It was fun to explore and our family had a great time. This place is so cool. Several other families were also exploring the Bat Cave and we're having the same fun memories I was having!If you are ever in the area AND you are a ""Dynamic Duo"" fan - you MUST stop by and see it for yourself!DIRECTIONS: From Hollywood Blvd you will take Bronson north to Franklin. Then turn east (right) on Franklin. From Franklin you go north (left) onto Canyon Drive. You will eventually see a large open gate with a sign posted saying ""park closes at sunset daily."" - You have arrived! Park on the right in the very first dirt lot and head for the dirt trail to your right as you walk north.If you want to have fun with your family/kids/grand kids......bring a Batman mask & cape and LIVE the Batman experience with them. ***it makes for some good photo opportunities. If you can. ...play the original Batman music on a device to make it even more fun!Please note....there are no vehicles allowed near the cave and there is no WiFi or cellular reception/Internet available in the area of the cave with most folks with devices who visit.

40,"Good hike with good view, have plenty of water!","I absolutely love this hike. Try to come early because parking lot is not very big and fills up very quickly. There are restrooms (portable ones) at the parking lot. Before we head to Hollywood Sign, we always swing by the Bronson cave (bat-cave); which used to be the cave of batman Adam West. Trail is very wide, steep at times, but well maintained. There is almost no shade so make sure you have plenty of water. When you get close to the Hollywood sign, that are two ways to get there. one goes to the bottom of the Hollywood sign, the other one goes to the top of the Hollywood sign, depends which one you prefer. If you go to the bottom of the Hollywood sign, you can have amazing picture with the Hollywood sign behind you. If you go to the top of the Hollywood sign, the view is amazing. Hike is dog friendly while on leash. You'll also see many horseback riders. Overall, a fun hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mert51

There is a small parking lot at the end of the street. From there, go back and take the trail to the left (it is not labelled as Bronson Caves). That trail will lead you there.

40,Not Just the Bat Cave,"This is a nice, short hike up to the little caves that have been used as film locations for many movies and television shows, besides its claim to fame as the Bat Cave from the Batman movies and series. It was a warm day and the caves were delightfully cool. An added feature is out the far side of the caves is an excellent view of the Hollywood sign. The area is quiet for being in the midst of the Los Angeles area. This is not a well advertised location which makes for a nice peaceful hike and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manatee27
40,Nice hike to historical filming location,"If you are in Hollywood this is worth checking out. Not only will you see some movie history but you'll get a nice hike out of it. From Franklin Ave go up Bronson (Gelson's market on corner). Bronson Ave leads to a park. Park in the first lot and take the trail to your right (hard right). If you miss the trail and continue to hike up the road you will be on a much longer trail that leads to the Hollywood sign.Bronson Caves used to be a quarry that was abandoned in the 1920's. There is a huge list of westerns and sci-fi movies & TV shows filmed here and it was most famously the Bat Cave in the 1960's Batman show with Adam West. Many other TV shows used Bronson Caves for location shoots such as Little House on the Prairie, Dukes of Hazzard and Star Trek Next Generation.You can hike around and walk through the caves (not really caves as they have pass-throughs) and get a great view of the Hollywood sign. You'l also get a fair bit of exercise. Bring bottled water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musclegirl68
40,Easy short hike to the Bat Cave!,"A great short hike to the original Bat Cave and a location were a lot of TV shows and movies have been filmed, walk thru the caves and take a look around and see if you can't figure out which of your favorite TV shows have filmed around or in the caves and sometimes you might be lucky and see some filming for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
30,short...,short hike (more like walk) and short tunnel. it was about a ten minute walk and the caves were pretty cool. it was a very short tunnel... but i tend to enjoy everything i see because i like to make the best of everything. you can see the hollywood sign very well from here as well. this place closes at sunset so i didn't have much time to explore the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
30,"Not a lot to see here, but lots of history.","Yes, any time a scene was filmed that needed a cave in TV or movies before the 1970s, you could be sure it was in the Bronson Caves. The Batman tv show used it for the Batman cave, and it was in countless other shows. Easy to get to - drive up Bronson Ave north and go left at the end - that road takes you to the parking area - walk straight and take the first right up the slope - the caves are found after a very short hike. If you want a longer hike - go on the main path striaight up about a 2-mile slope to the top of the Hollywood sign. Better be in good shape for that one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knightline
30,Short walk to Small tunnel.,"We went up there on good friday. There was a shoot going on, which absorbed most of the parking area, which was a bit of a pain. The hike up to the tunnel was nice and short. The tunnel was quite short and quite roughly hued. I'm not quite sure how they were using it, since it wasnt really a tunnel to anywhere (its easy to walk around the mountain).We then started walking up the mountain, but its a bit of a hike to anywhere interesting, and a long way from the hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fxsam
40,A Popular Filming Location,"The Bronson Caves are a very popular filming location that has been used in coutless movies and television shows. Why? It is very close to the major studios in Hollywood and Culver City. It is a great backdrop for a mountainous scene and a perfect cave for filming. Actually it is a tunnel that has been left behind from the early days of Hollywood when they mined it for rock to pave Hollywood Blvd. It is most popular as remembered to be ""The Bat Cave"" in the 1960's television version of ""Batman"" starring Adam West. and Burt Ward. It has been used in many science fiction films, westerns, war movies, and even in ""Wonder Woman.""You can usually park near the entrance to the road leading up to the caves but beware that it is located in a somewhat remote location from the main Griffith Park activities. Just be cautios and aware of your surroundings while in the area. Most of the times I have visited here there have been very few if any other people in the area. Great photo ops!The dirt road leading to the caves is probably about 1/4 mile long moderate incline, easy hike. It is well worth the walk up and it provides you with a chance to see a filming location that has been used in many, many films. After you have been there, you will probably recognize it later when watching older movies and tv shows. I have recognized it in at least one episode of ""Combat"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lawtonka
40,Experiencing the Batman Cave!,"I hiked there with my hubby, then took my daughter and her boyfriend there. I don't mind to go there again because it is unique. A nice area for day hike and see the Hollywood sign close and clear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
40,Fun at Bronson Caves,"My grandson & I took the trail to the caves, it was fun seeing the caves and was surprised to see there is also a good view of the Hollywood sign. It was not crowded on the Sunday afternoon that we went, only saw four other people. It was free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maryjane10893
30,Bronson Caves - nice little Hollywood secret,"Short, easy walk to the tunnels. Definitely plan other activities with this trip. It took us only about 20 min. to walk and explore. I was a bit timid about going after reading the review from 2006 - but rest assured - it was clean, no graffitti, no litter, no homeless taking naps and no foul odors. Great little jaunt if you can share the history with your kids. The website: www.mydreamcametrue.com/cave was very helpful in finding it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2RTravel
50,Visiting the Batcave,"Iâ€™ve visited Bronson Caves (AKA: the Batcave) many times. They are located a short walk/hike away from the parking lot at the north end of Canyon Drive and are a popular filming location. Bronson Caves are not actually caves, but short, man-made tunnels. Exploring the tunnels doesnâ€™t take very long, so I usually combine a visit to the Caves with a long, moderately strenuous hike to the Hollywood Sign or a visit to other attractions in Hollywood. There are photos and a map of the walk/hike to Bronson Caves at mydreamcametrue.com/cave",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4amazingadventures
30,hike to a film location,"a drive up through some nice neighborhoods and enter the park. It's a short hike up some dirt roads; more accessable than a trail since film crews need to haul their equiptment to shoot. look around & you'll see one of the best views of the hollywood sign.the cave ( really a tunnel) is surrounded by hugh cliffs. the whole area used to be a mining operation, thus giving it an unnatural other world look that some productions want to have. A must see for fans of westerns and scifi films, including TV shows like Batman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegreatunknown
