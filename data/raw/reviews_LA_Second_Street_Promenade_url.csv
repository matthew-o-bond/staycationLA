50,another treasure,This is a great place to spend a couple of hours with a friend or just to go and meet people. We spent all day looking at the various vendors and objects with out any pressure to buy but rather just have a nice time. We definitely will be going back in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenaN6784HA
50,Fun!,I found some very interesting pieces here on Second St. A designer dress was $4.00 ! At the regular store it would have been $120.00. I found a fabulous leopard fainting couch too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnacL1082TM
30,Hard to please,"I must be harder to please than most TA folk, because I would never rate this old street excellent or very good. It's fine, don't get me wrong, but I see nothing special about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
40,A walk to remember 2nd street,The painstaking renovations are astonishing very pleased and when you walk the comfortable easy streets and find unique shops from vinyl records to trendy art gallery's bars restaurants and more including antique row..it's a pleasureable Afternoon well spent..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamc219
30,Second Street Promenade,"We enjoyed our time in Pomona. Unfortunately, what was once a street filled with antique stores now only has three. However, the three were fun and we had a lovely lunch on the street also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdunnicliff
40,New to Old,"The Promenade has had several vendors come and go, but is an interesting place to visit and to eat/drink. Many vintage shops, art work, restaurants, bars and sometimes outdoor music and more... parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgonez
40,Entertainment area,"This area is being revitalized with small shops, breweries and eateries. Plenty of options for dining and entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8296RCrebeccam
40,Beer and Burgers,"Second Street in downtown Pomona includes a couple of art galleries, a small mom and pop bookstore, music stores, the well known Glass House concert hall the mainly features punk rock bands, a retro 50's furniture store and at least 3 restaurants. One offers Mediterranean food and has an outside patio in front. The other two focus on a wide selection of craft beers and the menu tends toward burgers and appetizer type food. Service is very friendly at these restaurants.The Burger House has several large flat screen TV's showing sports. On the second Saturday of the month the neighborhood features and art walk and there are plenty of people milling around, I believe there is an open air crafts market on those nights at the main plaza next to the vintage clothing store. Stores stay open on those nights. For people in the general area it is worth the effort to go and poke around, some of the galleries serve wine and snacks on the second Saturdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124susanz

40,"Great for Antiques, Food and a Nice Stroll","If you're in Pomona or looking for Antiques, the 2nd Street Promenade is a great stop. It is only a couple of blocks and parking is not a problem so it is an easy stop. Lots of great shops besides Antiques, a bookstore, record shop among others. The Fox theater and the Glass House are in the same location so there are a number of hip shops also and even a tattoo parlor. The are number of great restaurants on the Promenade also. The area has a real nice vibe though it is still a bit rough around the edges. The area right at Promenade always feels safe but if you get a couple of blocks away the neighborhood runs down a bit. But it is definitely worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsgilber
30,Antique districe and arts colony.,"All sorts of interesting antique shops here. Vintage clothing, farmers markets, Arts walk, cafes and eateries of all types.

50,2nd Saturday Art Colony Latino Art Museum,"Great event to catch if you are in the area. Galleries open with great art work, a street fair and great people watching. The Latino Art Museum is a great place to see up and coming Latino Artists. Each month the show changes and staff and curator are friendly and helpful. This is a great place to buy art at reasonable prices. 2nd Saturday has a trolley that takes you around to all the galleries and is great thing to do without having to spend a lot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIKI95632
40,Always check for events,"The Promenade by itself, on Second Street may feel sparse compared to regular tourist venues, such as Claremont, or coastal towns, but having lived here through the last parts of it's heyday's, memories of those days always endears Pomona to me, and I'm sure of many others who work and are trying to bring back some of those great times.Its casual, and no rush, If one digs down alittle, the history is just as facinating as any other well known town. Such as ""The Vault"", now a building waiting for a rebirth, built in the 1800's, one can find photos of it when 2nd st. was still a dusty earthen road.There are car shows, musical entertainment, various foods, and wonderful eclectic pesonalities during various events.Wonderful building murals, easy people watching at outdoor dining venues are Very relaxing and the center to other attractions such as antique shops, theater, clubs, restaurants, museums, parks, banking, city hall, one of the finest libraries in the valley if not the best, and many more attractions, All within walking distance!! Take the Amtrak, or Bus to and from, parking is Free for the first 3 Hours, other areas are free, and Security is friendly and helpful.Check dates and times online or call city hall, some button pushing and they're alway wiling to help. See Ya there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boone5269
50,Coming on up!,"I was in Pomona about 2 years ago and visited the Antique Row. That's really all there was and now there's a bit of EVERYTHING here. They've really fixed the place up, the shops are little treasure troves and the variety is now visible. They now have a great sushi bar, Joey's BBQ, This little Mexican food bakery and restaurant that's finger licking good, and 2nd Street Bistro which has an delicious shrimp caesar salad. The shops are antique, vintagy, but there's also shoes, clothes and lingerie boutique's, a cupcake store, art galleries, The Glass house, hair salons, a book store and the night life here is great! Clubs and bars line up almost an entire block. If you haven't visited, it's definitely a place to stop by and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieC463
40,They have really spruced up this area!,"My only complaint is that the shops close very early, other than that, it was quaint with many unique and diverse shops, from antiques to art. I was pleasantly surprised. It rivals some of the more pricier downtown village shopping areas nearby, like Claremont and Glendora.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriS573
40,2nd Saturday,Must go to 2nd Satuday art walk. Eclectic artists and food. Overall a good time. Fun begins around 6 pm. Don't miss the Wine Bar !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNStars
40,Various events,"Many good events, plenty of stage seating for bands/shows.

Many many historic buildings worth seeing and /or photographing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boone5269
20,For the antique collector,"This ""promenade"" is really just a block or so long with an extremely high concentration of antique shops. It is not really a promenade...it's just a street. When we were there on a weekday, it was extremely quiet with most of the shops closed. I suppose that on the weekend they would all be open.None of the shops looked that particularly interesting to us...they seemed to be your average vintage collectable shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,funky little shops,"and a cool barber and a hair cutting school. fun to see the collections, close to Western U.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779fn
