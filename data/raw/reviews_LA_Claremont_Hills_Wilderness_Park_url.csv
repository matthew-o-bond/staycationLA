40,What a beautiful hike and views,I was looking for a cool place to run on my vacation and this place fit the bill. It has a challenging five mile loop up and down the mountain. I didn’t run the entire time because I was too busy taking pictures. The hike can be challenging if you aren’t in good shape do bring good shoes and water. The views are worth your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2114WAjasonh

20,poor signage; exposed fire-road type trails,"Granted, we visited the park in late December 2017, after months of no rain.

Don't think they know how boorish they behave while riding and how clownish they look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Great scenery!,"This is a 5 mile loop trail in the foothills. I'd call it a medium level trail with some pretty exerting spots and some truly gorgeous spots. If you go to the left, you get the dirt hill out of the way and you go trough switchbacks, ups and downs, then you end with a tree canopy that feels like a well deserved reward. If you only want a short pleasant hike, go to the right as far as you want then turn around and come back out the way you came. I've done that as an add-on if I'm doing the Thompson Creek trail. I like to go early in the morning and it's always a bonus if I get to see deer grazing. Occasionally there are other critters, just be careful. Other hikers will generally tell you if they've seen anything of consequence.The closest lot has parking for a nominal fee, the South lot is free for residents with a parking pass but paying customers are welcome there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisDuyan
50,Great workout!,"Get here early! As soon as it opens if you can! Check the schedule for time changes every month. If you get there later in the day make sure you have enough time to get back before the trail closes. They will cite you!! Parking costs 3.00 and year round passes are available through the city of Claremont, I am not sure of the cost. Wear good running shoes or hiking boots. When I go alone, I run and walk the trail in just under an hour. If I go with a friend it usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half to walk it. Take water and a hat. The terrain is dirt and rock, it is 5 miles and has quite a few hills and some uneven areas. I prefer to start to the left, either way there is no way around the hills, LOL. I've noticed during the summer when it gets extremely hot the rattle snakes like to come out!! So beware, especially if you take your dogs. You want to keep them out of the brush. I almost stepped on what I thought was a small stick and it turned out to be a baby rattler!! Just a heads up. I've seen tarantulas and deers. Enjoy, be safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetpea1066

50,Always a pleasure and a challenge,"I love this 5-mile loop. In a very short time you climb on the hills and hav a bird's eye view of Pomona Valley on one side and the high hills at the base of Mount Baldy on the other. The air is fresh and many times you encounter deers grazing by the trails. According to posted warning signs you may even encounter bears and bobcats as well as mountain lions, but it has never happened to me. The loop has posts so you know how far you have walked (or biked or run). Very pleasant in all seasons and good for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonatellaPolizzi
50,Great hike or walk for all levels,The good thing to know before doing this hike is that there is a $3 parking fee in their lot. Make sure you know your parking space # because you will need it when buying a day permit. But you can use your card to pay as well. You will need to place the receipt on the dashboard. There is no free local parking parking as the neighborhoods require permits. But it is worth it. The trails are dirt roads and well maintained. There are portapotties at the start and at the 1 1/2 mile mark. There is also a trail entrance to Potato Hike and other trails letting you know you are leaving Claremont Wilderness Loop. This is a great place to do trail running too. The hills are not too challenging but are a great workout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FitnessTrekker
30,Nice easy trails,"Easy to access with good parking available. It offers easy trails that are wide enough for large numbers of people. It can get busy on the weekends. There are enough shaded areas to make it relaxing to rest in. There are wild animals. Meaning one should use good judgement when walking with young children and dogs. Spring/Summer rattlesnakes, tarantulas, etc. other times mountain lion, bears, deer and coyotes are plentiful but usually ok if one stays to the marked trails and go during daylight hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandPearl

What is wrong with these people? biggest complaint is closure during darkness--you'll never see a sunrise or sunset in this wilderness park because the public safety folks must have convinced the city council they don't want to rescue people after dark. Dumb rule for a ""wilderness"" park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pb2468s

50,Awesome local hike with a great cardio workout!,"I've been going to this ""Claremont Loop"" as we locals call it about 2 times a week for the past 4 years now. It's about 5 miles long and actually connects to Potato Mountain (take Mountain Ave street north) which would add another 3 miles. The loop is a great cardio session with plenty of elevation gain. When you first enter, the left side route is easier and has a more gradual elevation gain compared to the right but is exposed to the sun for about 3/4 of the hike. The right side is much tougher with a much greater incline but is shade the first 1/4 of the route. The route is simple and shoes of all kinds work, but of course it's best to use hiking shoes or running shoes but they will get dirty/sandy. Once you get up top which is about 2.5-3 miles in, the view is awesome which overlooks Claremont and beyond and is just a nice nature hike. Many mountain bikers share the loop so please be aware. If you casually hike the loop it should take around 2 hours, but if you beast your way through it should only take an hour to an hour-30min.There is plenty of parking but the loop is jam packed on holidays. Also, it's $3 credit card purchase at the terminals (there are 2 of them, and yes they are safe to use) for parking for 3 hours. If you plan on hiking at night, please be aware of the time the loop closes. The City of Claremont is VERY strict on park closure and will ticket people who are still coming down the loop after closing hours (it's like $30 bucks, I know because I got a ticket lol and they close the park ON THE DOT). Although the $3 parking kind of sucks, this is my favorite local/city hike and I definitely recommend this to anyone especially for people looking to start hiking. This would be a good starter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekd688
50,Happy Trails to You!,"Nice wide trails. The day we hiked, there were a lot of hikers and mountain bikers. It was a very nice day and the views were terrific. I would for sure hike these trails again. Study the map at the bottom of the trail first so you have an idea of where you are going. Although there are some signs up on the hills, there could be more...to my liking. Happy Trials to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666malcolmp
50,Can be strenuous; but rewarding,"There are several trails of different lengths (c.3-5 miles) and difficulties. Most require some steep climbs but usually interspersed with flatter sections. Some come with seats up on top from which there are distant panoramas that may or may not be visible depending on the degree of haziness. Something that is not often mentioned is the number and importance of water control structures that are encountered on the lower sections of the park and remain visible as prominent features from higher elevations. These are mostly dry reservoirs that function to contain flash floods and the heavy load of rocks and sediments that are carried by them. They also serve to spread flood waters over percolation zones downstream where they provide underground supplies for towns along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills. The reservoir grounds and percolation zones are fenced and off limits to the public but shelter a wide variety of wildlife. Snakes and coyotes are often visible as well as several species of raptors. There is a fair bit of shadow on the lower slopes and the valleys but much of the upper zone is open to a sometimes fierce sun; take plenty of water and wear appropriate protection. Signs will warn about mountain lions though few have been seen. Advise offered thereon: ""Make yourself large""; a bit ironic in view of the stream of (presumably) weight conscious joggers and hikers that use the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taughboyne
50,Easily accessible hiking/biking in Claremont foothills,"CHWP is a great place for hiking and biking. I bike there on a semi-regular basis but have also hiked it a few times. The 5-mile loop offers nice views of the valley below, a few benches along the way and a simple gazebo structure at the top. The fire road is wide and well-maintained. It is not at all technical but the climb provides a great cardio workout. The trail is enjoyed by people of different ages, shapes, and sizes. I prefer going to the left at the fork near the entrance since the climb is more gradual and there's more shade from trees on the way down. Those looking for more challenging and less crowded routes can easily connect to roads heading to Evey Canyon/Potato Mountain or Marshall Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azamatj

50,The Best Outdoor Option in Claremont,"Hiked here two days in a row when out on business. Was looking for a place to get a little exercise outside and saw this on the map. Was pleasantly surprised how easy the access was and the nice parking area. The weather was prefect both days and it was the weekend so there was a ton of people out hiking. Took a little while to find a parking spot on Sunday. There view once you climb up a bit are nice. Only had time to go up a couple miles but sure enjoyed it. Would be a fun place to take kids to burn off some energy too. Didn't see anything for wildlife other than small birds. Didn't see much for liter which was great & a surprise considering how many people were out there.Considering the $3 charge to park, figured they could at least provide something more than portable toilets. That'd be my only knock on the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icuski2
40,Weekend Warrior Walk,"A pretty 5 mile recreational walk through the California foothills on a fire road. The two busy weekend morning days we went in January, it was a far cry from wilderness, no wildlife in sight save a few birds, though you could see scat on the trail. The mountain bikers shared the trail nicely. I would use this trail as a fitness walk or run, definitely not as a hike to commune with nature, too many people, trail too wide and packed down.Advice: if you go to the left at the trail head, the walk will be harder because of the steep 2.5 mile uphill that will get your heart pumping. If you go right, the elevation gain will be more gradual, though, obviously, it will be steeper when you descend at the end, so pick your poison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hikingrrrl
40,day hike,"This is an easy 5 mi loop on broad graded roads. It can be impacted by too many hikers on the trail and in the parking lot($3 credit card).

50,Great place to hike!,"Some helpful tips:1. Iphone's mapquest may give you the wrong directions to the site. Parking is on N. Mill Avenue.2. There are 2 parking sites. The first one is on your right and the 2nd one is on your left. The 2nd one is obviously closer to the trail.3. Get there early, because parking spots fill up fast and alot of people take the trail.The parking is $3 and it is debit/credit card only.4. There are a couple porta-potties in the 2nd lot. I got there at 6:30am and they were already gross!5. The best way to take the hike is to start on the left and go clockwise. The last 1/3 of the trail is in the shade, so its nice and cool as the sun rises. It is about a 5 mile loop. There are signs throughout the trail, so you know what mile you are on.6. The hiking path is wide and the incline is gradual. My 8-year old son was able to do it easily. I saw alot of older people doing it, too. I would have to say it is an ""easy"" level hike. The hike took us about 2 hours, regular walking pace. There are also benches throughout the trail, if you would like to rest.7. There were also mountain bikers and runners on the path. Make sure to look out for them and give them space to pass you.8. There are beautiful views, so bring your camera and your family/friends to join you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bscsf
50,An almost winderness close to a small southern California city.,"Claremont Hills Wilderness Park is in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains about 35 miles east of LA, north of Interstate 210. The main entrance at the north end of North Mills Avenue has a large paid parking lot; fees help pay for park maintenance. Another entrance is at the north end of Mountain Avenue in Claremont. The several trails in the park are actually fire roads, so they are wide and well maintained.The hillsides are grass covered with sporadic trees and bushes, typical of SoCal. The views from the heights are spectacular: looking west toward LA, the city's skyscrapers look like a magical city. Looking east are the San Gorgonio mountains. Spread out below to the south is Pomona Valley with its broad collection of small cities: Claremont, Upland, Montclair, La Verne, Pomona.And looking up and north are the magnificent San Gabriel mountains, the highest at over 10,000 feet being Mt. San Antonio, known locally as 'Mt. Baldy' for its rocky summit covered by snow all winter.Wildlife include mule deer, many bird types, coyotes, and very rarely an elusive mountain lion.Since cool air flows into the valleys below, it can actually be warmer as one ascends the trail, but wear layered clothes so you can adapt to whatever comes as you enjoy this conveniently located trail system protected by the City of Claremont.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerJohn2

40,Good suburban hike,"The area has fire service roads that offer secure footing and fast hiking with views. We did the Cobal loop one morning, and went up to Potato (trail goes out of the park) on another morning during our visit. There are some shady spots to linger in along the trails, interesting plants, lizards and snakes, and both mornings we saw deer. The parking ($3 for the morning) seems reasonable considering there are garbage cans and portable toilets along the loop route. There are signs showing routes and distances, though the roads show up on Google Maps, too.

Some people blast their music instead of using headphones.Advice1. Bring a hat and sunblock2. Bring water3. Don't forget you have to pay to park. Use the machine to get your parking pass.4.

50,This is a beautiful place to go on a 5 mile hike,There is a five mile loop that has a nice gradual climb.

There are a couple of parking lots but they fill up quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLB
50,Good hike for all ages,"This five-mile loop hike is excellent for people of all ages. It's got a fairly steep incline regardless if you take the left hand or right hand route, but the trail is wide and kind of like a fire trail. It's fairly well graded for those who don't do well on uneven terrain. Unless you'e a Claremont resident, there's a $3 parking fee (debit/credit cards only; no cash) and it's pretty much impossible to find a parking spot on the weekends. This hike is crowded pretty much every day of the week and it's not really a ""wilderness"" hike, but it's a good workout for walkers, runners, horseback riders and bikers. People often don't pick up their dog waste (ew), although there are bags available at the trailhead and trash cans along the hike. There are also toilets at the trailhead and one along the trail (portable toilets, so be prepared). I wouldn't recommend this trail in the middle of the day most of June-early September as it can get quite hot and there's virtually no shade. Regardless of when you go, it's a good idea to bring a hat and a bottle of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skaerje
