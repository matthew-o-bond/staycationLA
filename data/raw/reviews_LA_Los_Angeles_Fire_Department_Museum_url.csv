50,An awesome step back in time.,"If you’re in the area, stop by and see this awesome step back in time. From equipment, to uniforms, to artifacts. Things are well kept and well organized. Definitely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptraxler
50,Great hidden Gem!,"This is one of the best old fire stations I've been in! whether you're in the fire service or not, the meticulous restoration of the engines, both of which run and pump (according to the guys working there) is amazing. Once one of the guys discovered my wife is a 26 year fire veteran (and still going) he came to life and showed us every corner of the station, all of the old cool equipment that was used through the history of the department, and a great story about where the old engines were found and the restoration efforts.Across the street is Station 112 with some of the biggest and coolest fire boats I've ever seen! Be sure to go look in the windows of the boat bay! What a treat!Thanks for your service and efforts with the museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike3022
40,LAFD Museum - San Pedro (Harbor Museum),"I visited the smaller LAFD museum in San Pedro, not the one in Hollywood. Coming from a fire department family, all of the artifacts and vehicles were really interesting to me and I loved looking at all of the old pictures, especially the ones of the fire boats in the harbor. They have two Seagrave trucks from the 1930 or 1940s and an older model car that make for a cool photo op, especially for young kids (or big kids like myself).The museum isn't very large (it's a converted fire station) but there's a lot of information packed into a small space! It's only open for a short time on Saturdays and run by volunteers so I'm glad we were able to catch it at an open time. The former LAFD firemen who were there that day were so friendly and so great to talk to. They let us walk around for a bit ourselves while they ate lunch and then afterwards we got to talk to them some more.I can't remember his name (possibly Chief Gordon?), but we spoke with a man who was retired from the LAFD *and* the Disneyland Fire Department, which I thought was so neat. How many times do you meet someone who was in the Mickey Mouse fire brigade?! He was so nice and definitely someone who could tell a few fun stories to any kids who came to visit the museum.We didn't stay very long but we left with a few shirts, a hat and a pin and I'm glad we stopped in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/copperboom
50,A great hidden treasure for fire enthusiasts!,"We stopped at the museum for a morning visit. It is a converted firehouse turned into a museum and it is cool if you love all things related to fire depts, trucks or fire fighting. There are around 10 restored antique fire trucks and they are in fantastic condition. There is also a section with model trucks, antique apparatus and historical info on LAFD. It is staffed by extremely knowledgeable retired firemen. A great little hidden gem only 4 blocks from Hollywood BLVD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karlitotheswede
40,Great Vintage Vehicles,"I'd always been curious about this museum. I'd driven by it so many times. Finally I stopped in and took the tour. I loved seeing the old ambulances and vehicles. This would be a Terrific place to take kids. There is so much opportunity to learning. The museum is small. Even with an hour, you can feel as if you've seen it. When I was there, retired firemen were on hand to share information and answer questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,The History of LAFD,"I recently visited the LAFD Historical Society's Memorial and Museum on Fire Service Day. Coincidentally, it was the same day as their Annual Pancake Breakfast. The two-story of Fire Station was filled with all kinds of memorabilia from original fire department badges to beautifully restored fire apparatus. It’s a great place for kids of all ages. Open on Saturdays only or by appointment for tours. There is no fee, but donations are appreciated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Spend some time and talk to the Guys.....,"The place is interesting in it's own right, but we went on the Saturday of the Oscars, half of Hollywood was shut down, and we were the only people visiting this place. On the one hand, a total shame, because it's full of history and old fire engines, but on the other hand, we got a private tour from one of the volunteers. He was an excellent guide, really explained the artefacts and exhibits, and really gave you a flavour of how it mush have been working there. Only at the end did he admit to being the retired Fire Chief from the station when it was open !!Would totally recommend this place for anyone wanting to see something in Hollywood that isn't related to glitz, glam and the movies",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobH924
40,Great history and awesome displays.,I was lucky enough to find this gem in Hollywood. we went to go visit to see all of the fire trucks and history that they have to offer and it did not disappoint. even though my children I had been to a lot of fire stations this did not disappoint with the history and fire items that they had. The staff was very friendly and accomidating. 2 story building with lots to see and touch. Great for all ages. Nice little gift shop with lots of items to purchase. Best part of the museums is that it is free!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firenando40
40,LAFD Harbor Museum - Old Fire Station 36,"This review is about the LAFD Museum housed in the old San Pedro City Hall on Harbor Blvd. It is also part of the LAFD Historical Society. Old FS 36 houses a treasure of LAFD history, mostly related to San Pedro and it's harbor. It is smaller than the main LAFD Museum in Hollywood, but just as interesting. The docents are mostly retired fire fighters who worked the harbor area. It is located just a few blocks from the USS Iowa. You can visit both of these great sites in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
20,Impressive - yet disappointing,"We thought this would be a neat quick stop while in downtown L.A.You'll recognize the building... you've seen it on TV. The historic building is full of artifacts and equipment from over the years. Some of the equipment is impressive. But I felt this is a museum ""for"" firefighters, not the public.It's certainly understandable that operating a museum takes money and staff. The volunteers obviously have worked hard to preserve pieces of history. But more exhibits explaining how quickly a firefighter has to dress out in the middle of the night or Fire trucks that kids can sit in would go a long way toward improving the educational and ""entertainment"" experience of the general public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/formeryogi
50,The History of the LAFD,"On Cahuenga Blvd., just south of Sunset Blvd., sits Old Fire Station #27. For the past ten years, it's been the home of the Los Angeles Fire Department Historical Society's Fallen Firefighters Memorial and Museum. The original building, circa 1930, was completely restored after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Vehicles and equipment from the turn of the century up to the present can be viewed by ""kids"" of all ages. The Memorial and Museum and the Gift Shop are open Saturdays from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. Give yourself an hour or two because there’s a lot to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
