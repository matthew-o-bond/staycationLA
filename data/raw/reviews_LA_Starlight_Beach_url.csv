10,Do not recommend,"We went to Caralina Island but needed a place to spend the night before boarding the early ferry. We had plans to enjoy the Jacuzzi because Tripadvisor did not list a pool, just a jacuzzi. We thought it was odd nevertheless we continued with our booking. Upon arrival, we discovered both the pool and the Jacuzzi were out of service! Apparently they were working on a permit(?) Also I had requested a ground floor and at the front office they said they never received such request; they also said they did not have any rooms available downstairs and they don't have an elevator. We had to wait but they managed to find a room for us on the ground floor. However, this room smelled funny (humid?), we discovered some areas of the carpet were soaking wet (ac perhaps leaking?) and the ac's air also smelled rather strange... We stayed and put up with those issues since we were not planning on coming back. We made it through the night but do not pkan on coming back ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2506XRmar
20,Nothing Special,"The main reason to hike out here is its the end of the Trans Catalina Trail. Otherwise, skip it. Theres a roughly 20 foot drop off down to the ocean from the constant erosion. It's not a particularly good looking beach and is not for swimming either as you will get pelted with tiny rocks the whole time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsaud
