50,Great Intimate Theatre Venue,"Secret Rose Theatre is a very intimate, 60-seat theatre in North Hollywood's Arts District. My visits was for Turbine Arts Collective's SHPLOTZ improvisation performance, featuring Rob Watzke, Helen Slater, Helen Hunt, Kinna McInroe, Scott Beehner, Jordan Black, and Matt Cartsonis on guitar. My seat was perhaps 10 feet away form the performance area, and I enjoyed both the venue and the performance.",mshapiro99
