40,Very nice view,"The view from here was very nice, but not really a must-visit place, since almost anywhere in Topanga you get to see amazing views, especially on the hike right in front of it. But if you're not much keen on visiting much of Topanga, this place can be quite iconic solution and it's usually very quiet and not crowded at all.",Lela
