50,A Night At The Black Cat Cabaret,"This musical was a delight to watch, it is truly provocative, seductive, and fun. The cast consist of gorgeous talented women that tantalize the audience into a mystic gaze, and even participation. The music, and dance take you to the past, and bring you to the present with a charming and seductive All About That Bass dance number. The comradery of the cast gives it a strong sense of showmanship, making it a must see show.",eDShotYou
50,A Night at The Black Cat Cabaret in Santa Monica,"This Theater Performance and Arts center in Los Angeles is exquisite should be listed under the #1 things to do in Los Angeles. The night of the black cat was a night of comedy, burlesque and simply a wonderful musical evening of song and dance.Very interactive shows highly recommend it.",Rebecca J
50,The golden box,"The Golden Box with Michelle Danner is a class every actor/actressshould take. During this class you find out what your emotional triggers are, why some choices are more powerful than others. The golden box does not only benefit actors but writers/directors/producers as well. You learn how to create characters that are layered and more in depth. I recommend the ''Golden Box'' to every artist who wants to polish their craft. After taking the class I felt more in touch with my inner self. I could pull or imagine different scenarios in my life. Michelle challenges you to pull deep from within as well as the imagination.",Aqueelah H
50,best theater show in los angeles,"i came here with a group of 8 friends and our expectations matched the calibre of the talent in height, this is a huge show with a fantastic set and costumes. the 30 dancers and singers are all beautiful and from all over the world. every act from the Can Can to the erotic tango was memorable for different reasons and unique to the core. the love story and the singing was terrific with the most memorable part for me being ""la vie en rose"" and their signature son ""a night of the black cat."" warning if you sit in the vip seats expect for there to be a lot of interaction with the cast of dancers and the ""cats"" and one of the lead singer of ""mack the knife."" my one regret is that we didnt get the vip seating in the front with the tables but overall it was an excellent fun evening where we were transported back in time to an underground cabaret.",theaterloversanta
40,Audition for film and tv class at Michelle Danner's acting school,I came to meet with Michelle Danner at her informational session on Wednesday because of her reputation and because she has worked with a slew of other actors i highly admire. I was placed on a wait list for her Auditioning for film and television on camera which i thought would be a great way to increase my booking ratio. Once i finally got in i found this acting on camera class to be a terrific . Michelle Danner gives excellent feedback and tips on how to improve your performance and eliciting memorable performances out of her actors. The one drawback to the class was that one week she gave scenes to a film that my agent had already sent me out on!! I consider this one of the best acting for film classes in Los Angeles and i just signed up for her golden box acting technique class.,Valerie M
50,LA acting classes: Golden Box,"I took Michelle's Golden Box one of the best acting classes i have taken in a long time.I now have my own toolbox of acting tools. So much wisdom that will help me in my craft and career. I know how to work on my craft on my own outside of a class situation. I can use what works best for me from the different acting techniques. I have had a hard time to be completely open but in the exercises in class I was able to get out of my head and be completely connected to myself and my emotions, it was very emotional but I know that it really helped me, and finding my triggers is very important for my acting. I was reminded about my Why, Why I want to act, it is imprinted in my brain and heart but it is important to be reminded, to stay motivated and to keep my drive. Now that I have worked on my own backstory I feel like I can truthfully create a backstory for a character. The class also showed some really great acting moments with amazing actors, which was truly inspiring. It is always good to watch great acting and try to figure out what was great about it. I have all the tools and am very excited to use them and work on my acting. I am so glad and thankful for this inspiring class because I am now more connected to my craft.",Vera O
40,Cultural Affair,"The Edgemar is a small but very imaginative theatre. I recently attended might if storytelling unlike anything I have experience in Los Angeles. The Edgemar is great for the entire family, friends, everyone. The tickets for performances are super reasonable, located on Main Street in Santa Monica. Public parking is abundant and inexpensive. There are loads of restaurants for before or after theatre dining. The Edgemar stages live plays by notable writers/producers. I recently saw Train To Zakapane by Henry Jaglon, fantastic. Check the Edgemar ' calendar!!!",Margaret D
40,Pretty Solid Studio,"I'm honored I had the privilege to take both Michelle Danner's Golden Box workshop and her Acting for the Camera class, because I really wanted to receive her acting expertise. As an emotional person, I've always struggled with being an emotional actor; it's hard for me to be constantly emotionally ready. After doing my scene the first time, Michelle could obviously see this and asked me to step it up emotionally. I came back and did the scene again and tried to tap into my sensitive side and was able to raise the stakes. Although I felt better about it, I knew I still didn't have this skill down. I don't know about other actors/actresses, but I love an opportunity to be challenged because I feel like my best work comes when people push me to the edge on something I'm struggling with. It makes me constantly want to come in and be better. I'm confident that taking these classes will help me strengthen my emotional weakness and get me ready for the industry. I'm grateful to be taking this acting class with such a top Hollywood acting coach.",Olive B
50,Michelle Danner,"Insightful and inspiring.! The two words that best describe Michelleâ€™s Golden Box class. Edgemar is easily the best acting school in Los Angeles (LA). She has perfected putting actors in touch with the tools they already have to be successful. I laughed, I cried and I feel I walked away better equipped and ready to tackle my next audition. It is perfectly clear why Michelle travels internationally to teach this class.. This is a class that I would without hesitation recommend any actor at any stage in their career take, if they are looking to further master their craft . Being that The Golden Box serves as a prerequisite for Michelle's scene study class, I am extremely excited to see what more Michelle has to offer me as a young aspiring actor.",Daunte M
50,ONE WHITE CROW,"""One While Crow"" is the second play I've seen at the Edgemar, ""The Rainmaker"" was the first.The theater is surrounded by fun places to eat, so one-stop entertainment can happen here. There is paid self-parking at the theater, or free parking in the residential area just a block north of the theater. The staff are very friendly, the restrooms are clean, and refreshments are available at their snack bar.There are two theaters for plays, both are intimate, and neither has any bad seats. I saw Rainmaker in the larger theater and White Crow in the smaller one - both were very well directed and acted, and the sets were creatively designed.The seats were comfortable. While Rainmaker had been around for some time, White Crow had it's premier here, and the play was excellent!I see at least a play a month, and I will become a regular at to the Edgemar.",WF C
40,hits on all cylinders,"The play , "" The Rainmaker ' was the reason we came and it was a very good take. Small, theater with no bad seats. Cast was outstanding, interesting play and not at all expensive. A great way to see a play without paying through the nose. My hats off to this community based group. I appreciate the effort they do for Santa Monica.",Frank G
50,"Go for the plays, not for the refreshments","My husband and I just saw The Rainmaker at Edgemar Center for the Arts and we can't wait to go back to see more. We'd never seen the play or the movie so we had no preconceived ideas about what to expect from the performance. It was a small, intimate theater. Very comfortable. I felt like I was sitting in a chair in the corner of the kitchen listening to the neighbors interact. The actors were all superb in their roles. The only one who seemed to be overacting just slightly was the actor who played the Rainmaker himself - but after reflection, I realize that the character himself was an ""actor"" of sorts on the stage of life, so that was probably quite fitting for the role. The Theater troupe was Henry Jaglom and The Rainbow Theater Company. This play was quite appropriate for families (no children, just teens and up). Intermission was another story. The ""refreshment"" stand wasn't - I think somebody forgot to pick up the water, soda, etc. because in a theater that fit maybe 120 people max, they had already run out of water, wine, soda - and the drinking fountain didn't work. Fortunately, there was a Peets Coffee right outside the door so I'm sure they appreciate the business. If you go, be there on time. Nobody is allowed in five minutes after the start because you are literally walking on the stage to get to your seat! More than worth it. Go across the street afterward to Thai Vegan - It's a hole in the wall next to a Thai Massage place (I know - don't go there! LOL!) - order at the counter and the staff is a bit rude - BUT the food was absolutely incredible. Nothing over $7.00 - prices primarily $5 - $7. Well worth the comically inept (think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi) staff.",PasadenaTess
50,Community Gem,"Michelle Danner is very dedicated and some excellent actors have come out of this school and community theater.It is nice to have a theater in town, convenient and kind of cozy. Not all the plays are great but most are and its fun to watch the actors as they grow in their craft.",Disarma
50,Best Acting School Around,"I just started classes at the Acting Studio at Edgemar Center for the Arts. Michelle Danner delves into the acting process in a way I have not experienced. I noticed that just from taking her Golden Box intensive. Her method combines with her vast knowledge of ""traditional"" acting theories. She bridges the gap between emotional life and text, helping actors develop a very specific and personal process. Her work has given me tools that I can call upon at any moment. Training at this acting school has really helped my creative process. I have reached levels in my creativity that seemed unattainable at other schools. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced actor, Michelle Danner's scene study class will meet you where you are and push you forward. I am also looking forward to taking Brad Garrett's sitcom class when it comes up again!",Deion L
50,Community Theatre At Its Best,"Two thumbs up for cleanliness, comfort and variety of entertainment,(many of which are free or donation suggested). Located on Main Street where there are many affordable restaurants for pre or post theatre dining.",cuppajoe2
50,AWESOME !!,"I recently took Michelle Dannerâ€™s Golden Box, and it was the most eye opening two days Iâ€™ve ever experienced as an actor. Michelle walks you through everything you must consider and ask yourself in order to build a rich, colorful character. As someone who has never had a lot of traditional training, I found that Michelle manages to break down her years of professional training and experience into a useful toolbox to help you get to the root of who your character is, and why they do what they do. After taking Michelleâ€™s class, I feel better equipped to dig deep into the life of my character to create a back-story that will allow me to create real people and take my acting to the next level.",Clarachampi
50,Top Los Angeles acting school,"With Michelleâ€™s teaching, I am improving faster than I ever have. She works with some of the top oscar nominated actors, and I can see why they come here. I can also see how I can get there. The work is FUN; there is a real sense of freedom and playfulness â€“ anything goes! Itâ€™s so much easier to work with your instincts than in spite of them. I am learning once again how to trust myself, as opposed to other techniques that are rigid and external enough to almost take you out of the equation. Class here is supportive and challenging. All the elements that make you you are encouraged, but cultivated and fine-tuned. She will tell you when you can reach the next level, and respectfully push you there. I really can't say enough good things about her!",Julie M
