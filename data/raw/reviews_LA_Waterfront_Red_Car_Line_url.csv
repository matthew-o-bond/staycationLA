40,"Afternoon in San Pedro, CA","We enjoyed the Red Trolley in San Pedro. It only runs on Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 6pm. It takes about 30 minutes to go a full round. ""Crafted"" had a number of local craft booths with people selling their handmade items. The San Pedro fish market/restaurant and Ports 'o Call had interesting shops and restaurants. This free trolley was a great way to spend our day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racheloki
50,Free on Satursay!,"I took the redline to get to lobster and it was free and convience. The only problem was that services ends at 9 PM....so we had to walk back to our parking. The carts were full and I had to stand, but still had a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffd2000s
40,wonderful ride for a buck,"The line is short. Trolley train and stations are well restored. Water spray to music (like Bellagio, Vegas) is at the cruise dock end. This can be a little trip down memory lane for the over sixties! The station near our hotel (Crowne Plaza) was getting rebuilt so we had a long walk to the next station. Friday to Sunday. Just one dollar and a free colouring book for the kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieKamloops
50,A hidden gem in Los Angeles,"We drove over to San Pedro specifically to do the Red car line. This is a route using authentic streetcars based on the red cars that used to run in Los Angeles back in the 1930s and 1940s. The route runs between the World Cruise Center and the Marina Village. We got on it on its first run of the day (12 pm) and rode it down to the Marina Village. It only costs a dollar to ride and it was not crowded at all (probably partly to do with the fact that no cruise ships were in port on the day we were there). Because of my interests of riding on these, we got a bonus by being offered a look in the maintainance facility to see the other 2 streetcars (only one was operating). The 2 streetcars used for regular operation are replicas of the red cars and the 3rd one is an original that had been temporarily used for road use before being converted back to rail and due to the preservation of its heritage, it is not used as often for operation on the line, though it sometimes is. After getting a look inside the authentic streetcar, we rode back up to the Cruise Center. This is a must for anyone who likes riding historic railways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
