40,"Nice setup, variety of animals but old and rundown","I purchased a Groupon deal for 2 kids that included feeding for the few animals to feed and somewhat pet. But most animals there are not for petting. I like the setup as it’s in the back location of a family friendly neighborhood park in Montebello. There’s pony rides (very short ride), a very old merry-go round, and a train (that was not working the day I went). The place is small, but for small kids it’s ideal because they get bored after 30 minutes of the same thing. My kids enjoyed it and have stories to tell about their experience. There was a sign that was charging $5 per person to enter but no one that I saw was charged an entrance fee, only charged for the services they wanted.",Brownybros
30,Not Worth the Money,"This place is very misleading. It really is not a petting zoo. We took my 3 1/2 year old nephews here and they could not actually pet anything. You could buy feed to feed certain animals. And it's very old and run down. It was $5 per person to get in and the whole place only takes maximum 20 minutes to walk thru. The staff is not very excited about working with kids, it was a disappointment.",Lori M
50,The Kids Love this place,"Parking is free and there is plenty, many farm yard animals and bring your money... the rides are fun and you want to keep feeding the animals with little cups of food for you and the kids after you pay to get inside the farm yard to pet or feed the animials. It can get messy... bring your hand sanitizer and some paper towels after you pet these friendly cute banyard animals.",Manuel G
40,Great Neighborhood attraction,"This is a hidden gem in the community! It is a located in a nice big park with a large play area for the kids, a water play area (summer), and softball/baseball fields on the north end of the park, too. The Montebello Barnyard zoo features pony rides, a train ride, and a small carousel that is perfect the children 5 and under. They have groupon offers online, but it really isn't very expensive and well worth the money for the experience.",Christine H
40,"Will book our next birthday there, beautiful park!","We had a fabulous day! The kids adored seeing and feeding the assortment of animals. The train with country music is fun, the pony rides great, led by caring staff. I t looks like a small western town with plenty shady trees to keep it cool. Birthday party groups added to the fun atmosphere in the park. No parking issues, no hussle and bustle, a cheap and cheerful day out. Absolutely loved it!!",petersenmonica
50,Cute :D,"I brought my family here around Spring of 2015. The petting zoo is small, but it's good for children. My son fell in love with feeding the animals. We spent about 2-3 hours just feeding them. He also went on the merry-go-round and we got on the train, very cute for small children. :D",Graice C
40,Stop the car! I see animals.,"My 4 year old granddaughter was in town for a brief visit and time was very limited, but I was able to steal her away for about 1.5 hours and in that time I took her to the Grant Rea Park - Barnyard Zoo where she rode a pony for the first time, took a train ride around the zoo and was able to feed and interact with the barnyard animals. She loved it and together we created a precious memory that I will treasure forever. It's extremely affordable. I spent about $10.00 total and it's located within the park with free parking, two playgrounds, water fun and pleanty of grass to run and play in.",Arlene T
40,For animal lovers - big and small!,"Parents can reserve the barnyard area for children's birthday parties. For a fee, you have access to the fenced in area with tables and the animals. Even if you aren't part of a group, you can view horses, donkeys, birds, rabbits and more exotic animals through the chain link fence. The petting zoo is $5, pony or train ride $4, merry-go-round $3 or a combination ticket for a better price. Rides are for young children, probably age 8 and younger. Closed Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday through Friday 10 am to 4 pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm. (213) 718-5442",101travelers
50,Your buck goes far,"I love this place and so do my granddaughters. They get to feed animals, ride horses, ride a train and run around the park. Its very good when your on a budget",SMichelle5595
30,Small and quaint,"It's a great place in Los Angeles county for kids to get an up close and personal view of farm animals. While the place is a bit run down, smaller kids won't know the difference and will have a blast.",Jamez N
40,Great for lil ones!,"{{ My 4 yr old Superman Grandson says ""FUN!"". He said he loved to feed the goats. He rode the carousel for a long time. His favorite activity was the train ride. And he wants to go back. And ride the pony again. }} Now for the grown-up review. This is a very small ""zoo"". We spent about 45 minutes at the attraction, we were the only ones there that morning. The two staff were GREAT WITH KIDS. The train ride played some hick Western music, and the rest of time kid music played in the background (all added to the kid-frendly experience). At the ticket booth, you can buy chips or drinks. The guy made a ""Superman Slushie"" (red and blue frozen ice) for my grandson. You can feed the goats and other barn animals (and there's a hand washing station) If you have a lil one that would like to ride a pony, ride a bumpy faux ""train"", ride a carousel, and feed some goats (and other animals) -- this is the place! A great place to spend an hour, and affordable. The ""zoo"" s located in the back of a park behind baseball fields. It's not well marked, but you can see the place from the parking lot. Restrooms are located in the front of the park.",prncess803
50,Your kids will love this place,"This little zoo is set in the middle of a huge city park that has multiple play grounds, baseball fields etc. There are plenty of shade trees. There are plenty of animals that the kids can pet and/or get close to and feed. Parking is plentiful and nearby. After seeing the animals your kids will love to play in the park. During the summer they have sprinklers that the kids can run through so bring a towel or two. When our kids were younger we took them to this park several times and they had a great time.",Doug F
40,"it was worth a 2nd trip, probably more","quiet small zoo in montebello. no traffic, shuttle busses, parking issues or high price tickets. its very inexpensive to visit here. located near a park with ball fields.the livestock and geese were active and fun to watch. there is soap and water to clean your hands on the way out by the exit gate.hope you like the animal pictures i posted with this reviewthey also have a traveling zoo show for your party or get together.",tonystewart14
40,Sweet Country BBQ Bday,"The park is a nice size. It features a petting zoo, and pony rides etc for the kids. it also has a 2 playgrounds for the kids and a sprinkler system for the summer.The park also features 3 seperate roofed picnic areas for reserve. There is a tel# located on site however when I tried to call I was unable to connect with anyone. I was unsuccessfull in reserving the picnic area for my daughters bday. We were able to relocate the party under a tree that had additional tables.The only dislike about this park was the 1 restroom stall for the entire park. They need to invest in more restrooms.The kids enjoyed themselves and so did our guest. We had games and the prizes where a pony ride :) now how could you go wrong with that?",Whittier562
50,Sooo much fun! The kids and adults will love this zoo!,We go every year to this hometown zoo in Montebello. Its east of Los Angeles less than 30 minutes. Its reasonably priced and is less crowded than the big zoos. The funny zebra with his big teeth was the highlight of our last trip.Dont forget to pick up animal feed when you get your tickets.You can have your party or event here and the zoo can also come to your event! They have a large vehicle to bring the animals to you....Don't forget your camera!,tonystewart14
