20,Small Park with Trail and Homeless Encampments,"This is a very small park situated next to the hillside that is named the Eagle Rock. It's main claim to fame is the trail that leads up near the Eagle Rock. The trail is not too long and can be hiked under an hour. There are a few benches and tables. The terrain is rather dry and dusty during the summer. The main problem are the homeless encampments and it does not feel safe any longer. The last time we were at the park, there were four encampments near the picnic area...we didn't even feel it was safe to park our car and take the hike for fear that our car would be broken into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
