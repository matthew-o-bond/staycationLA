50,If you want some Skechers then this is 'THE' place to visit.,"I am a big fan and owner of several pairs of Skechers shoes and sneakers as they are just so comfortable. As they are cheaper in the USA than in the UK I always visit a Factory Outlet when I am in the USA and buy some new ones. Whilst in the L.A. area I came across this store in Gardena... ""The Worlds Biggest Skechers Factory Outlet"" I was in heaven. It is huge and has a great selection of Skechers to choose from for men, women and kids. Also Skechers clothing too. I bought 3 pairs!! Prices and deals are fantastic and the store staff were very helpful in showing me around to what I was looking for. I will be back next time I am in L.A.",Roberts69
