30,Still letting people into shows 30+ min after event starts,"Again I went to an event at Terrance Theater . This time parked in Terrance Theater parking which was easy in and out , clean and close by the theater , for $15. The theater is great, acoustics good , many stalls in ladies room with an attendant to alert you to open ones.Also nice outdoor space with both outdoor and indoor bars.Space heaters outside as well.What spoils it for me is the policy to let people in ( many many people in ) after the show starts, 30 plus minutes . I was in a darkened room for a concert of a singer with a piano and a cello and lots of excuse me shuffling by , in many rows and for a very long prolonged time with phone flashlights to light their way or find their seats .Why does this theater allow this to spoil the event and apparently every event . My experience for a different event 1 year ago exactly the same . Too many people to be late due to freeway or ladies room line etc. Is this greed over the performance experience ? Not only do I not feel valued as a patron , but apparently the administration doesn't care about the performers experience of seeing countless people shuffle in late either .For a back orchestra seat , tickets were over $100 a piece .I expect better for the price . For any price, just unacceptable.Otherwise could be a perfect little theater .",JoAnn
40,Great Venue,"The venue is intimate, makes you feel that you are part of the story. The acoustic could use upgrading. Clean and a nice layout.",Russ Lacuata
30,Not a great show (Shen Yun),"Not impressed. The music was great, awesome orchestra. The show itself was mediocre. You'd be better spending your money Cirque Du Soleil or a good ballet.",karenmartha
50,Nutcracker,"Took my daughter (grown) and daughter-in-law during Christmas. . . .Good production and nice theater. Love too, that it is very close to home",vsanchez1404
40,Quite good for concerts and plays,More like 3.5/5.0 .. Good / Adequate (Not Very Good). We were in the Loge section and the stage view was perfect. The sound is quite basic (unlike other venues that are optimized for concerts). Getting in / out is super easy and there is plenty available parking as well as easy 10 min walking access to so many great restaurants in Long Beach. Recommended !,PG13LA
20,Underwhelmed,"We attended The Terrace Theater for a performance of Shen Yun. Prior to our visit, I phoned the theatre to inquire about storing my mother’s walker during the show. I was assured that an usher would store it for us during the performance.Web site instructions were vague in terms of entry and parking and the day of the performance we saw no signage indicating we were in the correct place. Parking for the Handicapped, we were told by the attendant collecting our $15.00 parking fee, was in some vague land somewhere off behind him. When we asked about a closer drop off spot, he indicated an elevator in the opposite direction. En route to the elevator, we found numerous vacant spaces much closer to the elevator.From the elevator, we traveled to Level C and crossed a pedestrian bridge. Again, we found no signs directing us to the theatre entrance. A staircase leading to what appeared to be the appropriate level was beyond my 93-year old mother’s ability. The adjacent escalator appeared out of order. A small crowd of people with walkers, canes and wheelchairs stood in front of the sole elevator, visably upset. Apparently, able-bodied people were boarding on the level below us, so that by the time the elevator car arrived, there was little to no room for walkers or wheelchairs.It was nearly showtime by the time we cleared security upstairs. Given the unusually large number of people still entering and making their way to their seats, it really would’ve behooved the theatre to have delayed the start of the show a few minutes, rather than to disrupt the performance with mass migrations across the aisles. Much to the dismay of those who'd gotten to the theatre on time, the curtain rose and the performance began while a slew of people were making their way across the aisles, effectively blocking the stage. A number of others hung back by the doors, awaiting a more opportune time to be seated. My husband had gone on ahead with my mother, but when the lights abruptly shut off my mother had been unable to see, so they plopped down in the next unoccupied seats. I was one of the people who’d remained near the doorway, since something had to be done with my mother’s walker. The usher who’d been on duty had left his post and was now nowhere to be found. I flagged down a second usher, but he plainly had not a clue what to do with the walker. Instead of taking it from me, he sauntered along the edge of the auditorium, looking lost. Finally, he pointed at a vacant wheelchair area and told me to put the walker there. I was concerned it might be in someone’s way, but he’d already turned away. I never saw him again. Quite a difference from personnel at either the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion or the Ahmanson, who had taken taken my mother's walker and delivered to us at the end of the show.Why the theatre allowed beverages in the auditorium remains a mystery to me. Following Intermission, theatregoers again trickled back to their seats while the show was in progress. One woman carried a filled cup in her hand, utterly unaware that she was showering my pant leg with a cold, sticky liquid as she worked her way past.We waited to visit the ladies’ room until most of the theatre had emptied. A single restroom for a theatre holding 3,000 patrons? Seriously? Since it was down a flight of stairs, a small mechanical lift was available to carry patrons in wheelchairs and walkers. Once downstairs, I was horrified at the volume of ladies waiting to use the facilities. The line fully traversed the entire section. Fortunately for us, women took one look at my tiny, white-haired mother with her walker and insisted she go to the front of the line, which was certainly kind. From there, there was only a momentary wait to the handicap stall at the rear of the restroom.I haven’t touched on the issue of visibility since most of our issues were handicap-related/organizational, but let me add also that in our opinion the design of the auditorium wasn’t terribly conducive to good viewing. Seats weren’t staggered enough, nor was there enough of an upward slope to the auditorium. Consequently, I noticed a good deal of side-to-side shifting in seats as people struggled to follow the performance onstage.No, I don’t need to return to this venue. Once, I think, was more than enough.",Gail G
30,Shen Yun,Just saw Shen Yun at the Terrace. Parking was easy enough. Close to all the Pike stores and eateries. Have to say that the Shen Yun experience would have been a lot better but they allowed all the latecomers to continue to interrupt the show climbing over all the people who arrived on time. They should have let people in at intermission like many other shows do. No center aisle means I won't be coming to other shows at the terrace.,BoboTravlr
50,Great venue,"We had tickets to see Shen Yun at this venue. Beautiful theatre, ample parking make this a theatre we will visit often . Seats are very comfortable.",GretaGarboFranklyn
30,No center isle,"Nice enough theater but has no center isle. As I prefer isle seats (6""5"") this left me off to the far side, however the view to stage quite satisfactory. Also with no center isle that means lots of people to crawl past getting in/out of ths mid autatorium seats.",Bruce C
50,A Wonderful Venue,"To see the Nutcracker by the Long Beach Ballet is truly a remarkable experience. The Terrace Theater offers great views of the stage, great lighting effects, and a wonderful sound-stage. The ambiance at this wonderful venue only adds to the beautiful theater experience. Overall, Highly Recommended!",Robert V
40,Concert,"Nice venue., nice outdoor seating. We recently attended a concert. We were surprised on how much leg room we had and the seats were comfortable. We sat in the orchestra area, row 27, and we're happy we were able to see the stage pretty good.Event parking was $10 but the staff was organized and we were able to get in and out quickly. Bathrooms were clean and had attendant. The floor in the orchestra are was slanted and many of us felt as if we're going to fall, I'm not sure if this is the only area like that.",LALydz
50,First row Lodge,I booked my ticket for our event on Ticketmaster and got aisle seat first-row lodge. I highly recommend this seat. Easy access to the bathrooms and away from all the people filing in downstairs. We went to a special event so we knew the event was going to be good and the ushers were great. My only concern was the seat and it was perfect.,lroll
50,Great venue for different forms of Entertainment,"Since we live nearby, the theater has been a convenient choice for us. Recently, we enjoyed Jerry Seinfeld on a balmy Thursday evening at 7PM. As my husband and I walked to the front, we were astonished at all the food trucks lined up in front and the nice grassy area with comfortable lawn style seating areas. The ambiance is great with all the water fountains and large frontage where people can gather and often take photos. There seems to be plenty of parking options including those included with nearby restaurants. The entry is nice with small lines that form for ticket verification. Once inside, there are several bar areas and a foray with another area to gather. We were fortunate to get orchestra seats in the 15th row at almost a $100 each but it was worth it. The theater is ample but has an intimate feel although the sound system was somewhat troubling. For a Long Beach venue, this is a great option for entertainment. In the past, we have seen other famous comedians and we also saw the Nutcracker Ballet.",sherrieseg
50,CELTIC WOMAN GREAT SHOW,"Attended the Celtic Woman 10th anniversary show at the Terrace, nice theater and the show was excellent.Definitely recommend Celtic Woman - go see it if it is in your area.If you are not familiar with the area there are a lot of activities in this area and the parking for one specific location can be difficult to locate. Look it up before you get there.Enjoy and hope this helps.",3678JOHN
10,Awful,"We went to see Shen Yun Sat night. We didn't like the show but to add insult to injury, in the middle of the show an usher came up to us (twice) asking us what our seat #'s were. The 2nd time he said we were in the wrong seats. Mind you, this is while the show is going on. We got up to go see what the heck was going on. Turns out we weren't in the wrong seats. I guess some intoxicated guy had been arguing with the usher that we were in his seats. So we missed about 20 min of the show. Terrible experience. I generally like the theater but the way they handled this unfortunate problem was very unprofessional. Also the women's restrooms always have a long wait.",Linda L
40,good choice for a movie,Clean theater. Good selection of movies. Elevated seats.,simonandv
