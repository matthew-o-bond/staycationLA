50,Great relaxing place,Great casual atmosphere. Open and airy and bright (despite the picture at the top - no idea where that was taken). The beer selection is outstanding and the waitstaff is so friendly and attentive without being bothersome. Don‚Äôt know about busy nights but it was laid back on a Sunday night. I will definitely be back.,Guitarman5000
40,Nice place downtown,"Good selection of beers. Pub food with some interesting twists. Appetizers are a little pricey, almost the same cost as dinners. Staff friendly.",Jonathan S
40,Nice hipster vibe. Good food. Good beer.,Not a lot of choices in Covina. The place we had selected from the Trip Advisor list was closed for remodel. However we walked past this place and decided to give it a try... It's a small place (maybe 1500 square feet) that's somewhat beer bar and somewhat restaurant. We were almost alone when we came in about 7:30 PM but it was filling in by 8:30 when we left. I enjoyed the beer selection because there were several I'd never had which were good. The beers were about $8 per pint. Being a pub I tried fish and chips ($15) which was quite good and my partner had Mac N Cheese ($13) which was also very good. Somehow we mis-communicated the order and ended up with the wrong side so they gave us that for free. Bottom line $47.50 + $11 tip and we left happy.,FromVegas
50,So delicious,"We just happened to randomly walk into the restaurant and boy are we glad we did. I had chilaquiles with carne asada AMAZING!! Tortilla chips, ranchero sauce fried eggs, crema, salsa verse (spicy for you gringos but perfect for this mexican), Mexican cheese blend and cilantro.Could have used a little bit more carne asada but oh well. My husband had the country fried chicken fried chicken, corn bread, fried eggs, bacon gravy, and ROSEMARY TATER TOTS!!! Loved those tater tots!! Mimosas on Sunday and they show the NFL games. Check this place out the flavor of the food is what we are missing in Fontana.",jojo939792
40,Glad we went back,"Sometime ago we went here and as I remember we were not impressed. I am glad we gave it a second chance. We both enjoyed the sandwiches we had. I had the Beef Bulgogi Wrap (Beef Bulgogi, mixed greens, coleslaw, green onions, sesame seeds, creamy jalapeno sauce in a Spinach Wrap) not being a Korean restaurant I wondered how good the Bulgogi would be. It was very good. Good flavor to the meat and all the other ingredients work so well together. The wrap very fulfilling in a wonderful way. My girlfriend had the BLTA sandwich (bacon, arugula, avocado salsa, tomato jam, mushroom aioli, cheese on nice thick sourdough. The restaurant has a warm atmosphere with friendly service.",NormKeith
40,Fun environment,Food is good with wide variety of beer. Service is average but fun atmosphere and fries are great as is most of the entrees.,Rebecca M
50,late lunch,Went here for a late lunch with my husband and son.... Had the Cubano sand which and t was great! Also loved their brussels sprouts!! üëçüèΩ Will definitely comeback and try the French Dip and sweet tater tots. Great place!!!,mgatdula
40,Make Downtown Covina Proud,Small and quaint with a classic brew decor and feel. It's great to have this nice little bistro here. Nice selection of brews and a unique menu with delicious choices. The staff is well versed on their beers. This makes a beer connoisseur's visit that much more enjoyable!,marlenecalvert
40,Craft beer and gastro cuisine,"They always have a solid and diverse list of craft brews, you can et your bland beer someplace else. The food has some artistic flair and the chef has integrity, no changes to food items. He designed it a certain way and that's how you'll eat it, this is not Burger King.",pskalsky
50,"Fantastic selection of beer, nice area of town","Read the reviews and it looked like a good place to find a few beers that may be new to me. It did not disappoint! I think there were around 20 craft beers on draft! The food was excellent and you have to try the Portabello Fries, which have bacon! Babe burger and FishTacos were very good also. Nice atmosphere with tables that someone hand made out of old metal and wood. Meechelle our server along with the others were very friendly and helpful. You will not be disappointed.",Keith B
30,it's ok,"Have been here a few times but they change the menu so often we stopped going because things you liked were gone. We forgot all about them because about a year ago everything seemed to have truffle oil on it- and this is not an environment for that kind of menu item. We went back recently and it was good but honestly we just forget about them even tho we are local. I guess nothing stands out to make us remember even though our server was excellent. maybe it's the room, it's just not very comfortable.",travel1108
50,Great beer selection! Awesome Food!,Cozy is a great way to describe this place. It has a local pub feel. Their selection of beer is always changing and always good. The food is also quite exceptional. We love the Mac and Cheese and the flash fried brussels sprouts are awesome. Also be sure to get the house cooked chips.,Doran B
40,pleasantly surprised,Went in for a bite to eat and a beer. Good selection and the food was very tasty. Staff could have been a bit more friendly but other than that nice little place to stop in.,jcdundee2015
30,"Small, cozy place.","Was a small, but cozy place. Had their steak sandwich... it also was small, but taste alright. We went on trivia night, was fun playing trivia with the rest of the people there.",Swishy68
40,Good for burgers and beer,We tried this place out based on reviews from our good friends. They are pretty good with a great selection of beer and they have wine and other cocktails as well. Good place for a burger or sandwich.,grrracie
50,Good food to go with the beer.,I am not a heavy beer drinker but they have an excellent selection for every taste. The decor and vibe are very good also.,havefun065
50,Surprise gem,"Cool little find....be sure to ask for the Paleo burger, even if you are not gluten free! Craft root beer!! Great Happy Hour...place was packed on a weds night!",ZZshop
40,"Great tasting food, friendly service","The food taste great, not much on the menu for healthy eats. But great for that cheat meal and brew beer.",Ellisinla
40,Great Gastro Pub,"I eat here frequently, as I work around the corner. Their salads and burgers are consistently good, as are many of their appetizers. Wonderful, ever changing selection of craft brews (usually have more than 20 available). Good for watching sports also.",Martin K
50,Love that Pub,"Great selection of unique beers. Love the food especially. They have some condiments on the menu that I have gone home and duplicated for personal use. Just about everything from the Pub Burger to the Cubano, from the sweet potatoe tater tots to the portabello fries are excellent. Service is great and staff is friendly. Can be a bit pricey if you drink a lot.",Jeff D
50,Great food and beer,They have a great selection of food in addition to the beer. It's very small and gets crowded so be prepared to wait for a seat. The service is very good.,Sabina A
30,Great Burgers,"Pub style food and good craft beers on draft. Service is a little slow and hit & miss. Not very many places to sit, half of the space appears to be dedicated to kitchen and restrooms, a few TVs for sports. Cool place to hang out.",Kristen F
30,A Great Addition to West Covina,"Downtown West Covina has been expanding and this was one of the newer additions to the area. It's rather small and they have some good beer selections, but the food is really just MEH.. I had real high hopes for the Portobello fries, but they were so bad.. not crispy and the batter crisps were just straight hard to finish.",Johnny K
40,Dinner,Enjoyed Bread and Barley. The service was very good as was the food...not your usual menu...it was great to try new things!,RitaFan
50,Excellent Gourmet Dining,"Wine list extensive and good. Food and appetizers eclectic gourmet. Not normally found in San Gabriel Valley. Beers gourmet, local breweries, not my cup of tea. Prices reasonable and Exceptional service!",Miles H
50,What a wonderful addition to Covina!,"We have eaten here three times now, mainly so we could be sure this was a ""5"". If you like craft beers it's a must try & the food matches it! My husband usually shies away from craft beers but one of the owners, Carlos, suggested a few after listening to his likes & dislikes in beer....he loved them all! We have had appetizers (all unique & tasty), entrees were the same but what we like the most is the atmosphere; it has a speakeasy feel to it & we love that they utilized the original guys of the building to include aged bricks, wiring & beams. Do yourself a favor & check this place out....enjoy!",cdenoi
