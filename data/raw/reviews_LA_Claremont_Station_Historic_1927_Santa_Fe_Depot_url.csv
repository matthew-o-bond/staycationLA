40,History Revisited,"It's always good for the soul to take a step back in time.

50,Metrolink Station,We've passed this beautiful train station many times while riding the metro link train heading for Union Station in Los Angeles. We finally decided to take a look around on a recent car trip to Claremont. This historic building is well-maintained. We didn't get a chance to check out the art museum inside. There's a tall clock tower that faces the train tracks. This station is just a short walk from downtown Claremont.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016

40,Can't wait for the art museum!!,"I'm becoming a Tripadvisor junkie lol, so when I knew I was going to Claremont I wanted to see something I could only find there. We didn't have a lot a time so stopping by the old train depot. It's really pretty but what was exciting was to see that they are renovating it for an art museum. It looks like a beautiful building and I can imagine it will only get better with this museum. My wife and I also really liked that there was a history of Claremont on the side of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnwB1410HQ

40,We ought to have more like this....!!,"I grew up in Glendale, CA and Pasadena, CA where the train stations were as beautiful as they were useful. This one so reminded me of those two. They do not build places like this anymore, so it is a walk through the heritage of Claremont and the east San Gabriel to tour this station, which once not only anchored the town but was in the center of the citrus industry.A person of any age could enjoy this station...and hey, take a ride!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaOrangeCountyCA
40,Takes Me Back...,"Claremont Heritage offers tours of historic Claremont that meet in front of the depot on the first Saturday of each month at 10:00.

It's a beautiful building, restored largely to it's original condition...including the lovely tiles lining the walls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelnan8
