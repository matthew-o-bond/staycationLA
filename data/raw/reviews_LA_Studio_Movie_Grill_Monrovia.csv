50,Great Movie/Dinner Combination,"Our first experience at a movie theatre providing dinner. Was impressed with the atmosphere, cleanliness of theatre, food, service, and price. Would definitely go back. Overall a good value and great experience!",Ron F
40,THE ULTIMATE CHILL......,The new recliners with the sliding trays and drink holder are soooo comfortable. It is easy to forget that you actually left home. You push a button and a server takes your order and delivers your food and cocktails. You never miss a beat of the film. They have eliminated the concessions stands and offer fresh cooked food from the kitchen. Included on the menu is middle eastern food and a Bento box. Nice to see them embrace the multi cultures who may step out for a film. My opinion of the food was that it was pretty good. Last time I had the Margarita pizza. I am not a drinker; but significant other is. He gave the bartender a thumbs up on his very particular request. The theater is remodeled - very sleek. It offers a small sit down restaurant with a bar in the lounge area. You may be able to just stop in for a drink and a bite to eat without seeing a film - not positive. I found the booths cozy and the lighting very relaxing. They did a great job on the make over. I retract my previous review from last year as I didn't realize they were still in the throes of the makeover. Over all - great experience.,Byrdie J
40,Is it a 3 star or 5 star,"Ok I settled on 4 star as it is a 5 star but for me far less....... Its a wonderful redone movie theater with food and drink ordered from the seat, which is comfortable, i might add.My problem is personal...... On the handicapped seating, they do not have the closed caption unit available, so i set for two house basically not knowing one word of what is said, as the volume is low, which is good that the other theaters are not blasting in on your movie..... how ever i would like to know what is said, and my friend gets the H seat,where i could go up a stair or two.My other problem is they use a person who weights 125 pounds for the seat size, i weigh more so food tray does not come to me but is at an angle and i'd like it more flexible for size..... In fact the in Roseville is the same way..The food portions are sharable if you are going to dinner after and just want a nibble, other wise the portions are a full meal and very good. I've not had anything that wasn't excellent.. BTW the diet coke is great...",Ella O
