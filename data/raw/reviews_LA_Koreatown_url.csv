50,Soowan Gailbi Kbbq!!!!!!,"Whenever we go to Koreatown, we HAVE TO GO HERE! It is hands down the BEST Korean bbq we have ever been to. The parking lot is tiny. We got there at 4:30 and the spots were blocked off with cones. There were two guys who were there that moved a cone for us to park in front of the restaurant. There is valet and I believe it is $3. Otherwise, there is street parking. Let’s just start that I couldn’t find the restaurant on trip advisor to write my review, so it just sums up my entire Koreatown experience. We got the seafood pancake—AMAZING!— and two orders of Gailbi ($49) each. It was enough for 4 adults and 2 kids-the kids barely ate it but the 3 year old loved what he ate. With that came unlimited salad, but do not fill up on salad! Then the unlimited Korean tiny appetizer dishes came flooding in. We were in food heaven. My dad and husband barely spoke, because they were so busy enjoying every bite. The service was hands down THE BEST SERVICE we have ever had, and this has been true all 4 times we have been there. We travel to LA for the food (75%) and (25%) for sightseeing. This restaurant is an absolutely MUST GO. They cook the beef in front of you-hence the bbq part- and the meat was so flavorful and tender. The tea was a nice touch. The meal also came with soup. Everything was so delicious! They also had a small freezer stand that had amazing ice cream macaroon type sandwiches. We tried the green tea ice cream and the vanilla one. Yum yum yum!!!And a side note, one of us has multiple food allergies: milk, all nuts, and egg. Everything was safe to eat except for the seafood pancake and a few appetizer dishes that had mayo in it, but they made sure we were aware.",Greenapplepies
50,Cozy and Food Craze,"A nice walk to go around town. Well, you will feel cozy and think of why is it so quiet? Guess what? most of them are visiting the food place to get the best taste ever. Also, there is a very nice supermarket to buy your daily grocery. If you intend to cook at home or with friends for bbq, this is the place you should visit. There is bar and grill everywhere but you need to scout of it. Sun Non Dan in Koreatown will be the great place for you to have a nice hot soup when you truly need one. Nearby is the Zion Marketplace. Other than that, you have variety of shops that you could hop in to try their food, equivalent not bad. That one I have recommended, you need to seriously go early as waiting time is more than you ever expected. However, I and my pal were lucky enough to get the place! Yo, Y'all try it!",Jennifer O

40,Koreatown Plaza and Koreatown Galleria,"Visited both. Parked at the plaza which has more shops and is bigger than the Galleria. Teenager in our family went wild in the Music plaza at Koreatown Plaza, as she could buy all the merchandise not easily available back home. Some clothes shops and a very good food court where we had incredible Korean food at a good price. The Galleria on the other hand had a beauty shop that sold some unusual colours of hair dye that also atttracted our teenager and were a compulsory buy. Parking at Koreatown plaza was validated when we bought stuff from one of the shops so that worked out well too.",Melliehi

What I really liked about this Starbucks was how bright and light it was inside, loved the location. My toasted crispy cheese sandwich was just that light so very cheesy and deliciously tasty. A good strong selection of fresh cabinet food. And of course the added bonus of complimentary internet. This has to be one of my favourite Starbucks world wide. I highly recommend a visit.",Marlaina C
50,Felt like I was back in Korea,"So many places to eat and such little time! Stopped at the Koreatown plaza food court to get a wide variety of our favorite foods. It was like a regular mall food court, but converted all into Korean food places, down to the $.50 cent automatic coffee and the free water dispensers. Some of the best dumplings I've had since leaving korea. Free parking on Saturday & Sunday at the plaza.Visited the Tous Les Jours inside the Korea mart store and stocked up on the Korean beauty products at the aritaum beauty shop.",Angela R

There are plenty of places to shop for your K-beauty, and Kpop needs at local stores.If you're looking to try Korean BBQ there is a really famous all you can eat BBQ restaurant called Hae Jang Chon (really busy on the weekend expect a line). There are also great places to try if you have never eaten Korean food and want to taste authentic Korean kimbap, bibimbap (I recommend BCD Tofu House), seaweed soup, etc.Wilshire Blvd can become very congested with the buses, construction, and traffic so it's something to take into consideration when planning your trip.Wear comfortable walking shoes, as you will be walking around to various locations and eateries.You can definitely, spend a half a day shopping, eating (restaurants & Bingsu (dessert), enjoying Karaoke and visiting historic buildings (churches, and The Wiltern).",Erica Dozier

50,Real Korea in America,"We lived in Seoul for fifteen years over three different periods, and retired to San Diego three years ago. But we had never visited Koreatown before.We were going to an evening function at the Intercontinental Century City, but stayed at a Koreatown hotel which is a straight shot down Olympic Boulevard. We embarked on our many hour adventure, parking our car before noon at our hotel, and walking all throughout the neighborhood on an extraordinarily cold day for LA, starting with the Kim Family Store, which had nothing but Korean customers, with all the main signs in Korean.We trundle up Normandie to the Top's Art Supply store, where we found a tool that we could not find at any Michael's and which was run by really friendly Korean proprietors who recommended a luncheon place, which was really good. We eventually walked also to the Koreatown Shopping Center, which was okay with a nice food court, but we had already lunched.In walking to the Koreatown Galleria, we stopped into a big clothes mart, a shadow of what one might find in Dongdaemun or Namdaemun in Seoul. The Galleria had a food court, too, but on the first floor is a big Korean supermarket and a Cake House bakery, which had an assortment typical of what one might find in Seoul. Again, the customer base was overwhelmingly Korean. (I understand that there is now a Zion Market branch in Koreatown, but we didn't walk there. The original Zion Market is actually a San Diego institution, taking the name of a kosher food market before moving to a giant failed K-Mart.)We have also been to Koreatowns in Asia, most notably the one in Tsuruhashi in Osaka. That was probably more lively, but under more pressure from some Japanese politicians. The one in LA is very lively and dynamic, intermixed with a lot of Mexican places (we were sorely tempted to have a Oaxaca breakfast, but they opened too late -- at 9:00 a.m. -- for our travel aims.)We will visit again. Lots of other restaurants to try. Maybe we'll look for a cultural fest to come to.",Liars N F

40,Perfect place for Korean food and K-Pop items,"Visited Korea Town Plaza at Koreatown LA and we enjoyed the food at their food court. With very good value lunch, we get more than we expect from food court food. The beef ribs soup is plenty of ribs, teopokki is also for two adults portion.The plaza also housed for Korean grocery and other Asian foods. This is also a good place to find K-Pop CD, posters, and other items.",ucartech
40,K-Pop CDs and Food Focused Visit,"Our kids always want us to visit Koreatown whenever we visit LA. We had to drive around to the places we wanted to visit versus walking as Koreatown is larger and more spread out versus Little Tokyo.Favorite spots were:Zion Market - big selection of Korean food and other Asian food as well. During this visit they were giving out various food samples and we ended up getting shrimp chips, a box of barley and corn teas and noodles. In the back of the market they had at least two take out restaurants and an area where they cooked and packaged food for purchase (the galbi looked pretty good). They will validate parking if you make a purchase otherwise you can park along the street at the pay meters.Within walking distance of the market were a number of Korean BBQ restaurants (Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong), I love boba tea and Honeymee soft serve yogurt. Parking can difficult to find on the weekends.Music Plaza - Inside Koreatown Plaza. For K-Pop fans this place carried a big selection of K-Pop CDs and paraphernalia (stickers, posters, photos, mugs, etc.). They were pretty busy. When we bought a couple of CDs they threw in a couple of photo cards for free. Prices were a bit more than what I paid for CDs in HKG but they did have older CDs. Koreatown Plaza also has grocery, clothing and other stores but there was little interest in them compared to the CD or grocery stores.",wireless_in_CA
50,Great Neighborhood to Visit,"We thoroughly enjoyed visiting Koreatown for an evening. The area has a great feeling of a diverse community, with all kinds of small businesses and restaurants.

20,Do Not Go Here for the Night Life,"If you're looking for a night out, do not go to Koreatown. Unless you're Korean, you're unlikely to find a lively area at all here.Unfortunately I couldn't find ""Club Bound"" on Trip Advisor but this is a club that I started off with at around midnight. The entry fee was $20 and the crowd was boring and bland. As soon as I walked in, there was barely any people on the dance floor and the majority of people were sitting in their booths. Avoid Club Bound if you're searching for an Asian night.A quick wander through the streets in Koreatown uncovered very little bars or unique places to have drinks at. I would recommend the Normandie Club for a lounge vibe and good cocktails. Otherwise, avoid Koreatown if in search of nightclubs.Dirty, boring and lacking demographic diversity. The night in Koreatown is lifeless and disappointing.",HQV

It is funny to walk around here and to see all shops similar to any town in Korea. Many great restaurants and shops, cheaper than other places in LA as well as close to every major shopping center. LA really has the biggest Korean population outside of Korea and has a great variety of Japanese restaurants and Korean Barbecue. Cheaper than Seoul and much bigger quantity too.

40,Korean Waffle Pizza? Yes please!,"Koreatown's where you go if you're craving a culinary adventure. This place is a savory smorgasbord. The area itself isn't particularly pretty - a prime example of L.A. strip-mall style - but if you can ignore the architecturally-challenged surroundings, you're in for a treat.Those of you who haven't sampled the delights of Korean food, now's the time. Get ready for sweet, salty, earthy, acidic, spicy - what other taste-related words can you think of? They're all here! Start small with the bibimbop or Seoul waffle pizza then go big with kimchi and spleen soup. There's a bland mall and a few shops around here if you're in the market for Korean products, but why waste precious eating time?",BMunchausen
30,Koreatown Plaza - straight out of the past,"Visited the Koreatown Plaza mall on a trip last week. Its a mall straight out of the 80s. For those wanting to see what a mall looks like in Korea, this isn't it -sorry.Stores were mostly empty and there was very little foot traffic on a Friday evening. On the plus side, the food court had a lot of selections - but I always have an issue eating at places that are not busy - how fresh is their food?The pen stor on the bottom level is fun, but thats about it.",JackReacher2016

And voila I was there! I enjoyed a smoothie at robeks juice and aYummy & delicious Korean meal in a nearby foodcourt of a small 3 storey mall.Excellent layover experience! Several locals sold candy bars, water, sodas, and cell phone accessories on the light rail lines. Lots of lower income folks rode the light rail. It is definitely a cultural experience",busdepollo
50,Love to visit,"Koreantown also known as AKA ""Ktown"" is the largest Koreatown outside of Korea. Located in Central Los Angeles in between Hollywood and Downtown. Did you know this is the most crowded area in Los Angeles? I bet you didn't know that, neither do I till today.Ktown isn't something in top of the to do list among tourist, however this is something like weekly visit among many local resident especially among the Asian. This isn't just the place for Korean, there's a lot non Korean visit here as well.If you ask a local, where to find the best Korean food or KBBQ, about 9 out of 10 would suggest you visit Ktown, the amount of restaurant especially KBBQ in Ktown just insane. There are so many out here, the best selling point of KBBQ is many of them has AYCE which is All you can eat. Price range from $10 to $20 something that let you eat as many meats you could. This is popular among many local, who prefer this than a typical steakhouse that would cost double and doesn't offer much food in some case. There are also Korean bakery stores where you can find best pastries. I simply enjoy this area.",Cma P
40,A Taste of Korea,"So many Korean restaurants offered great food if you want to try Korean barbecued varieties and get some souvenirs. My daughter is a fan of many popular KPOP bands so it was a fun trip for her to roam around. As any typical Asian town everywhere, the neighborhood is not clean and not very safe to roam around at night. There were small KPOP music stores which my daughter absolutely went crazy for. There were authentic and hidden Korean barbecues, restaurants to visit. For lunch, we ate at Galleria Plaza and another plaza. They had a cafeteria filled with all kinds of korean restaurants. We had fried kimchi rice and it tasted like no regular mock of a korean restaurant but something that represents a small taste of Korea. Overall, we enjoyed this trip very much!",seabreezesakka
40,Something for everone trying to get a small taste of Korea,"Shabuya and Parks BBQ were incredible. Other places, like the coffee houses were not good, Koreans don't seem to know how to make coffee. I went to 2 different coffee shops and both times ordered a Latte Breve...meaning I want it to be made with half/half instead of skim milk... both places just gave me a cup of regular old shibby coffee... Finally stumbled on a coffee shop on Vermont and 6th Ave called Alchemist Coffee Project...mind blowing good! Also went to the Kobawoo House at the same address and they were very good as well.",David M

Not the hippiest joint i expected!There is no impressive Asian architecture or archways here as in San Francisco or LA s Japan or Chinatown to make you feel you are entering into another culture. The only imposing structure is the church in Wiltshire Drive aI tried to look like centralised food courts eateries/string of eaterie as LA or San Francisco Japan Town or Chinatown but could not find any !Will not make a bee line here again since there are real McCoys I could go to in Seoul. anyway I manage to find a chain Korean restaurant in Wilshire and they serve real good bibimbap.",Highadventurer

50,"Food, Drink, Singing… an All-Hours Party","To experience LA in a way that takes in the breadth of cultures that exist here, travelers simply have to get into neighborhoods like these. The entire LA experience is incomparably different once you've spent a long, buzzy evening hopping from place to place across K-Town.Do it like the Koreans do (I should know; I'm married to one): start with dinner and drinks at a Korean barbecue joint. There are a bunch on here, and you might just find my reviews there, too.Then it's off to norebang—the Korean private-room version of karaoke. You'll see couples going there by themselves… large groups packing into a single room… and everything in between. Again, there's an embarrassment of good spots from which to choose.Now you're getting into the later hours. Time for a refreshing beverage or three. Late-night spots abound.You won't have a problem figuring out what to do once the city's 2 AM liquor-sales cutoff time hits, either. After-hours spots offer coffee, desserts, hangover soup and more.By the time you're finished you'll be wrung out… and ready to do it all over again. LA's K-Town is one of those mandatory neighborhoods for travelers who really want to get into the fabric of the city, rather than just running a finger across its surface.

20,Where is Koreatown??!!,"I read reviews about Koreatown and thought WOW! I get to try some authentic korean food and do some shopping. Well, I walked and walked for blocks and blocks, not seeing any ""town"". There were random shops here and there was no ""town"". I wandered into a random store front, very obscure, and it turned out to be a amrket with lots of small vendors. There was no one shopping besides me. There must have been at least 30 vendors selling all sorts of clothing, assessories, etc. There were no prices, the people spoke limited English, if any. It was just strange and left me with a funny feeling like the prices could change at any given moment based on whether or not I spoke the language. Then I walked into a mall with Korean stores selling very high end, expensive stuff. Definitely not for me, nor for many people because the place was empty except fot the food court. Now we're talking. There were several small food stalls selling all kinds of asian dishes, some Korean, Japanese, Philipino, etc. The problem was it did not seem clean to me. The tables were dirty, and the place smelled off. So I left, not trying any of the goodies being offered. There was also a market. However, for some reason it was closed. Though there were people coming in and out, they were mostly staff. No sure why they were closed because no one spoke English. I felt like a foreigner in a small part of LA, in Koreatown. If you want to feel like you dont belong, go to Koreatown. BTW, you can get great Korean BBQ outside of Koreatown. So dont bother visiting unless you have time to kill.",8umble8ee

I was half expecting a little Seoul feel, but it looks like any other ethnic commerce area in America: a few storefronts and restaurants that one would only guess was Korean by the language on the signs. Unfortunately, we did our restaurant looking at what turned out to be the edge of Koreatown. We had parked at the Koreatown Galleria and walked up to Wilshire, stopping at one of the first restaurants we found.

40,"Great foodie part of the city, amazing barbecue, no well known centralized location","Definitely visit Koreatown if you are going to be in LA, the BBQ that can be found in this section of the city along with the other Koran style food is amazing and has changed the way I look at food. You must go here!But as a location to visit or spend time in, its a difficult area to nail down as it doesn't really have a centralized area where tourists or visitors can truly come to visit and enjoy the rich culture that the area has to offer, or at least none that I have been able to find.You can find the many centers, shops, The Buddhist Temple and other such landmarks within the Koreatown area on their website, but if you are a tourist and just happen to want to go without a plan or doing some research, you will find it a difficult visit as all of the cultural locations are spread out over a very large area of the city.Though if you want Korean BBQ, it won't be hard to find, and the sight of one of the hundreds of BBQ places signals your entrance into Koreatown.All in all even though it lacks a centralized tourist location it is a fantastic and (if planned) an intimate and enjoyable part of Los Angeles.",The_Roaming_Raven

50,The Heart of LA. Just Fabulous.,"People ask me why I'm so fond of LA Korean Town when I'm not even close to being an Asian. Well, here's why. I've never been to a more affable and welcoming place in my lifetime! PLUS, esp. for females, this is the best shopping place one can possibly find in LA. Not just because it has decent clothings and PURSES, but the price is very affordable for a middle class student like me. :) For example, I purchased a Coach Handbag for $30. Now, you'd probably tell me ""that's definitely FAKE!"".Well, it's quite rare to see a fake that has a perfectly original tag + the price tag that indicates the original cost being $120.00. I searched online and managed to find exactly the same purse being sold at 120 or above. So why wait? Visit LA Korean Town and HAVE SOME FUN!:) (esp. you ladies!)",Vacation33218
