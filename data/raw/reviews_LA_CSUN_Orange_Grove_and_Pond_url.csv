40,CSUN Orange Grove and Pond,"As the primary caretaker of a toddler, I'm always looking for things to do with my son. Especially free/cheap things. You need to get them out everyday (or as much as possible), and you can only go to the park or the zoo so many times while keeping your sanity.I read about the the CSUN Orange Grove and Pond on atlasobscura.com and am so thankful I read it! This is right up the road from me (more or less) and while it's not going to suck up a full day like The Zoo or something like that... it's perfect if you need to get the kids out for an hour! These are the only orange groves still in exhistance in the valley (or so I read), and you are totally free and encouraged to pick the oranges (contrary to local myth the students might tell you).In addition to the oranges, there is a nice little pond that are home to ducks, geese and (fast) turtles! My son loves water fountains, and there are a bunch of them along with a small waterfall. There is also a gazebo, which my three year old is currently a big fan of. There is a nearby cafe which we didn't check out this time, but might soon.There is a $2 metered parking lot, but also street parking on the south side of Nordhoff that is free during the daytime hours. I forget exactly when... maybe 10-4:30. Just go to Nordhoff and Lindley and there it is!!!ps. There is also an obcervatory, but it was locked, so might be for students only. There was a plaque, but that had no info on it's hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
