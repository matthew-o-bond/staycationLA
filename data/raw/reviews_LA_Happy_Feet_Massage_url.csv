50,Nice Massage and Acupuncture,"The massage here is the best in the area, but the acupuncture by Mark is even better--very, very helpful!",Gerald S
50,"One fun experience, great massage","Professional, authentic, relaxing. Felt great. Enjoyed. All pains went away. Better than most high end massages.",Robin P
50,Best place to get a full body massage without all the unecessary expenses of a spa!,We love coming to Happy Feet. It's affordable but massage service is top notch. They really know how to take care of you and massage you just the right way.If you're concerned with privacy or need all the fluffiness of an expensive spa then don't come here. Everyone is one big room but it is quiet and semi-private. You don't take off all your clothes. This place if for people who care more about a good massage than a pretty (and expensive) place.We've been to both and this is by far better!,MrBalan
40,I go there for Dr Mark only,"Quiet ambiance. i go to Happy Feet to see Dr. Mark, who is the best for acupuncture. The other staff seem okay.",Louise A
30,Good massage; don't expect much ambiance.,"For a straight forward massage, most of the non-English speaking therapists are adequate. Actually some give the best foot massages. However, I question the cleanliness/hygiene policy they follow. For example, I don't think they change the linens (actually towels) or wash hands in between customers.",SusanB933
50,The name says it all!,"Wonderful, quiet and relaxing environment with soothing music and competent staff. We went for the combination massage and were glad we did. The foot massage was excellent and the full body portion was most relaxing. Happy customers...",morris91030
50,So restful,"I have had many massages at Happy Feet and I have loved all of them. Plus, you do not have to buy a membership and they are open even in the evening.",bellref
50,Best massage in town!,I come to happy feet once a week and get the signature package! It's 70 minutes of bliss! Great massages and great customer service!,Elizabeth C
50,A Real Treat!,"We went to Pasadena Colorado Ave location, not the South Pasadena location, but I am assuming they are alike. I had bought 2 of their ""Signature Relaxation"" packages through a Groupon deal and treated my daughter to a ""girls day"" while I was on the West Coast for the holidays. It says reflexology, but it's really a full massage. We both loved it!",Mysticyat
50,Absolutely happy feet and rest of my body too,"Quaint little shop with a quaint little price. $40 for a 70 minute massage...can't beat the price considering its Pasadena. The massage was absolutely wonderful. Great pressure and hit all my problem areas. Caught myself falling asleep, but woke myself because I didn't want to miss a minute of relaxation. Really left on cloud nine.",Adriana C
50,Surprisingly best massage of my life,"On our trip to LA in January, my husband and I booked 2 massages here thru Groupon promotion. To be honest, we weren't expecting much. We had the Signature Relation Package with milk foot soak. Well...70 minutes later all stress, knots, tension...gone.My biggest regret is we live on East Coast or I be there 2/month.",Osullivan320
