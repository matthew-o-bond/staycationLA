50,Cloverleaf Therapeutic Massage,"Eileen is AMAZING! She takes the time to individualize each massage, and her overall knowledge and expertise is extensive. She was very quick to give her opinion about the source/cause of my hip pain, and the exercises/stretching she utilized were painless and effective. Her prices are very affordable, as well. You cannot go wrong with Eileen!",Missy J
50,Excellent therapeutic massage,I was visiting a friend who recommended a massage from Eileen. Perfect recommendation - I had the best massage I've ever had. She was amazing and so professional. Wish I lived closer.,klee1256
50,Cloverleaf Therapeutic Massage,"Visiting California from Atlanta, and really wish I could find someone JUST LIKE EILEEN at home. Eileen's knowledge and skills far exceed those of anyone from whom I have had a massage. I have had chronic pain in my neck for several years and after many ""massages"", there was no true relief. One massage with Eilieen and I a have more range of motion and no pain one week later. What was most impressive was the breadth of her skills. I have recently been exposed to structural integration (rolfing), a therapy with which she was very knowledgable. My experience with another therapist produced great results for piriformis and illiotibial band pain, but the therapy was VERY painful. Eileen's techniques give the same results and with only mild tenderness and no ""real"" pain during the therapy. I am on a serious hunt to find someone like Eileen at home. Treat yourself!!!!",dawn i
