50,Among LA’s Most Beautiful Buildings,"This is one of the most gorgeous Art Deco gems in the city and I just had the pleasure of attending an open house that happens only once a year! I love that I'm able to explore the entire building, from the first floor to the fifth, and have numerous opportunities to take great pictures, as this building is extremely photogenic from top to bottom.There is a whole plethora of visual styles on display here alongside the expected Art Deco. One room for example looks like something designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, while another room is similar to the modernist International style, a few rooms on the second floor are Neoclassical/Rococo themed and the fifth floor has a Southwestern vibe going on.To summarize this building is pure eye candy and a photographer's paradise. The Southwestern Law School has done an exceptional job at preserving this jewel and if ever you get the chance to visit, definitely do it as tickets sell out really quickly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Art Deco Wonder,This is one of the art deco wonders in Los Angeles. It has been carefully and wonderfully restored by Southwestern Law School and is an excellent example of adaptive reuse- from a department store to part of a law school campus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leightayl0r
50,Art Deco Treasure on Wilshire ...,"I can remember shopping at this Bullocks Wilshire location and marveling at the Art Deco splendor then and - now going back to visit it in its repurposed life as a law school. Too bad it couldn't have been into a museum. Regardless, it's an architectural treasure whose stature grows year by year. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Awesome building; enjoy the step back in time,"I signed up for the tour of this great building after talking with staff regarding the once-a-year open house and I found the experience to be very interesting and informative. Though some aspects of the décor had to be changed for the purposes of making the building a law school (as part of SW Law’s campus expansion in 1994) there is enough Art Deco vibe still there to make for an eye-opening visit. I spent a good 90 minutes walking around and taking pictures. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. I would recommend attending the open house to anyone who has the least bit of interest in either architecture or L.A. history.Definitely get a brochure/map upon entering and follow the self-guided route. The 30 numbered “stops” in the building are clearly marked and contain info that includes archival photos and/or a description of what a particular room/area was used for during the Bullocks days. Staff members are located in various places to answer questions as you walk through the building. The walking route depicted in the map goes from Floor 1, then 2, then 5, where most of the interesting things are. I recommend going in that order to maintain continuity, after which you can check out Floors 3 & 4 if you have extra time. These floors are of mild interest compared to the others and there are no numbered stops or staff there.For your consideration:(1) The open house and corresponding self-guided tour happens one day a year, so it’s best to get your name on the mailing list so as not to miss the next opportunity to go inside. Just call and make a reservation for what time you want to arrive. Fee = $25.(2) Enter the parking lot (free) from Wilshire Place just north of 7th Street. I was there on a Sunday and indicated to the parking attendant that I was there for the tour. He pointed out the correct ramp to take to get to the parking area.(3) Before going in stand in the Porte Cochère and look straight up to view the ceiling fresco dedicated to transportation (circa 1929).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239

40,Once an iconic deparment store - now a law school: Art Deco Building Bullocks,"Growing up in LA, I remember well the trip we took with my Aunt to Bullocks in LA. At the time, I was so excited to be going to this iconic Bullocks. So for me, seeing the building brings back good memories. We would go to the top floor tea room and have lunch. It was quite an outing.Today, the department store no longer exists as they went bankrupt in 1992, but the art deco building still exists.. So for me its a special building in LA. It brings back special memories.For those who like art deco type buildings, its very good. For others its probably just average now. I debated rating it average or very good, but given my memories rated it very good. Please realize that is a personal rating based on past experiences.Today the Southwestern Law School is there so unless you want to go there or attend the school there, its not as special to the general public as it once was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Once per year,"This was once THE carriage trade specialty store of Los Angeles, and the first designed with the automobile in mind, with the main entrance being from a motor court. Seriously trashed during the L.A. riots, then seriously stripped by soul-free Macy's. Now a law school. Can be visited once per year. Go. And boycott Macy's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
