50,Wonderful tranquil shrine,"To the aviators and pioneers of the sky is dedicated this ornate shrine. Built in 1924 it is the final resting place for the brave few who in the early days achieved crucial advances in aviation.Set within the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery it is highly ornate with impressive art work in carved stone. Featuring mosaics and statuary it is a fitting memorial to the trailblazers.A special plaque is dedicated to Amelia Earhart who in 1932 flew solo across the Atlantic and three years later accomplished similarly across the Pacific.Nearby is a scaled-down replica of the space shuttle Columbia, which commemorates the 2003 disaster in which seven astronauts were killed during its return flight.",permia
30,Peaceful Cemetary,"Found this while looking for something to do with some extra time in the area. There is a nice little memorial for aviators. Theres also a pretty fountain on the other side of the cemetary. Overall, it is not a need to make stop unless you have a personal connection or are very interested in aviation.",Carrie N
50,Final Resting Place for California Aviators.,"I stopped by to say hi to my friend Bobbi Trout and to pay my respects to fellow California aviation pioneer, Roy Knabenshue.",Stan M
30,Interesting but not a must see,"Some old time actors buried in the cemetery, including the last of the three stooges. If you are into air history would be more of a must do. Building architecture is interesting to see. In general it seems the cemetary is somewhat run down. Still funerals are going on so be respectful.",Jdk_mn
40,Interesting place to visit,"I stopped by here cause it was close to the Burbank airport and I just wanted to see what it was like. The shrine area has cool architecture and interesting facts. I didn't read all of the plaques, but I took pictures of a lot of them. The grounds are well kept. It is peaceful when a plane is not taking off overhead. Plenty of benches around the shrine.",Mark S
30,Lunch,"My wife and daughter like to go here to have a picnic lunch. It's not that it's quiet and peaceful a place for repose. No. It's on the take off path of the Burbank Airport so during the day planes are ascending every 10 minutes over this monument to the history of flight in California. Here you will find a replica of the space shuttle along with stones and plaques honoring those individuals who have contributed to flight. Corporate heads of aviation companies, inventors etc. are memorialized here but are not buried here. There are some benches about to sit on in the shade. This memorial is located on the eastern side of the Valhalla Cemetery down a single lane to what originally was the main entrance to the cemetery thus the arch through which you drove. That entrance is now closed off and entry is from Victory Blvd. No charge for entering. No charge for watching planes take off all day long either.",Daniel F
40,Right on the Flight Path - Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation,"This is an interesting and free place to see if you have some extra time in Burbank, California. The Shrine and cemetery are right on the flight path to the Bob Hope/Hollywood Burbank airport so airplanes are flying over head on a regular basis while you are visiting this tribute to aviation.",Swabado
50,What a great piece of architecture and memorial,Pay a visit to this cool place and see some history. The monument is very impressive with a lot of names that should be recognized. The adjoining cemetery is quite disappointing and really needs some maintenance.,GenotheViking
40,History off the beat and path,The Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation was created in 1924 as a shrine to early aviation pioneers. It is located in the Valhalla Cemetery.,Snobuz78
30,Hard to find; Crazy Hours,The actual museum is only open the first Sunday of the month from 1-3pm. Beautiful shrine to aviation. There is a lovely fountain to see too!,Karyn B
50,A wonderful memorial monument,Hidden almost in the center of Burbank is the Valhalla cemetery with the monument to fallen aviators including the Challenger crew. The Portal of the Folded Wing is flat-out beautiful.,David_DeMulle
50,Hard to find and worth it! - Aviation Pioneers Shrine,"The Portal of the Folded Wings Memorial is located inside a very large cemetery. When you come into the cemetery you must enter from Victory Boulevard and it is quite a long drive around to the far, what I would call, north east corner. It is a beautiful monument that was built about 1925 and was built to represent 14 fallen historical aviators of the era. There are monuments for each of them with their titles. their history, and what's unique about each one to be honored in such a beautiful Memorial. The accompanying photographs will display this beautiful memorial, from a what I would call a deco era. It is meant to include all aviators and in front of it has been added a replica of the Columbia space shuttle maybe a one-eighth scale I don't know as the real shuttle is pretty big. It is a tribute to the fallen aviators of that tragic event in 2003. I love the drive up to the monument surrounded by pine trees on each side completely covering the roadway. It reminds me of a main street in the town where I grew up. Just thinking of the bravery of some of these early aviators, some of the things they were willing to fly and test is mind boggling. This gives us memories looking into their works as they contributed to flight as we have it today. Wow do we have flight today? You bet! Hundreds of thousands of people moving every day all over the planet. Aviation and one part of its history is here at the Portal of The Folded Wing Memorial",CharleySays
