50,Very nice since remodel,"AMC has taken over the location and did a complete makeover of the tired facility. New recliners in the screen rooms. New everything! Amazing front lobby setup. Use to be $2.00 in the afternoon. Though ticket prices went up to $6.99 for matinee and $9.99 for evening, still worth the price. Nice to have a local theater, as being retired, can check out the matinee movies without the crowd. Very nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9516FIbilll
50,Good Movie Place,"Went to an early afternoon movie and it was so reasonable priced, I couldn't believe it. Since I go to movies infrequently, that was a double treat!! The theater was clean and bathrooms were tidy and clean, too. This was an excellent experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisterbrianl
40,Cheap family fun at the movies,With movies so expensive for a family to attend these cinema's are great at only $2 or $3 a ticket go ahead and bring Grandma too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1590CBmikem
40,Worried about AMC takeover,"When we last visited Starplex in La Mirada we enjoyed ourselves like we alway did at this theater. It is pretty clean and the new seats are very nice and comfortable.My concern is now that AMC has taken control, the good time might have ended. I have not been to Starplex for a some weeks mostly because they do not post movie times on Flixster anymore and their AMC app is terrible. Also it is rumored that there is a large price increase. Not good for our continued support.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byronh891
40,Good and Reasonable,"We go here occasionally to see a movie that isn't just out, but has been out for a while. The cost is very reasonable, and the theater is pretty good for the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sleepowers
30,movies,cheap movie theater enjoyed the movies. Small theater and not packed. It was easy to get in and watch a movie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eagleeyes142
30,Movies on the semi-cheap,"This place was great when the movies were $2. For $2 you could justify the sticky floor, the obligatory homeless person and the war zone that is the male restroom. I am a bit shocked that this place is the #2 attraction in La Mirada. There has been a slight improvement in cleanliness with the price hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Construct37
50,Cheap Theater,"I love these kinds of theaters. I love when you can pay a couple bucks and see movies that are old, but not out on DVD or streaming yet. I saw a 3-D movie there for three bucks. It is clean and cheap. I will sometimes watch three movies in one day there because they show great movies for cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vecchio7
50,"GREAT, PITY ABOUT EXIT SIGN LIGHTING","This cinema is fantastic except for one thing. The EXIT signs in each theater are far too bright and they are VERY distracting when you are watching the movie. I have to shift seats all the time in order to find a place which is the least dispruptive to my eyes. No other movie theater has such bright exit signs. In fact, they are about one tenth of the brightness. This cinema did not used to have such bright exit signs. The person responsible is obviously not a movie goer!!! I TRULY WISH THE MANAGEMENT WOULD ADJUST THE EXIT SIGN LIGHTING ....surely not too big a job. This way, I would go here all the time. If you are reading this, Starplex Management, try watching one of your own movies, and see how disruptive it is to your patrons....Please fix....Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldenSong
40,Inexpensive Cinema Outing,"If you get here before the evening showtimes, the cost is only $2.00 per person. After that the price goes up to $3.00. They have a selection of PG, PG13, and R rated movies so families, couples, and friends can have their choice. They recently renovated the place with new seats, etc. and they keep the Starplex clean. Hot dogs are only $1.00 and a small popcorn will run $5.25. They also have candy, soda, and popcorn combos for sale. Of course, the releases they do show have been out for awhile but I rather see a movie on the big screen rather than DVD. The price is right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliLAgirl
20,Price Increase....Bad,"Originally when this theater started in LM it was $1 and movies were not first run. They usually hit the theater just before DVD or at the same time.After a couple years it went to $2. Still a bargain if you go at the right time and avoid the ghetto people.Now the price has been increased to $3. That's 30% in one shot. You can't tell me your costs went up 30% overnight. I will say there have been some upgrades in seating but it's still the same ghetto people that frequent the theater. On top of that, the movies are basically coming out the same time as DVD.So tell me, why would I leave the comfort of my home to pay almost $2 more to see the same movie? I can pause it at home, use the bathroom, drink sodas that don't cost $4.50, and not put up with knuckleheads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bsaw
40,Cheap Seats - Clean Theatre $1 hot dogs,better than waiting for a movie to be released on DVD. Perfect to get out of the heat and just escape for 2 hours. Maybe go see a movies that you did not want to watch for $12 at the theater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlo642
