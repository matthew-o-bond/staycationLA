50,Beautiful artwork and beautiful artist!,She invites you into her shop as if you are old friends and loves to answer questions. Don't be afraid to ask her about her current project. I bought a beautiful piece from her that may friend and I almost fought over. We took pictures before she wrapped it up. Her work for the 2016 Arts Festival is absolutely amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222marciad
50,Nice art!,The young lady that owns the place was very nice and accommodating to us and took time to show us her work and other guest work that she had available in the studio. She does really great and unique work. The guest paintings were beautiful shots of island attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryMJackson
50,Art and Wine Tour,"Porschia Denning is a local resident artist who opened her own gallery this year. She also gives an ""Art and Wine"" tour of the island. My husband chose it from the ""things to do on your birthday"" list as she offers a BOGO deal for your birthday. We truly enjoyed the informative hour we spent with this lovely and knowledgeable lady.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesar388

50,Great reminder from your trip,We went into the gallery last week. Beautiful! We picked up two pieces that look great and will always remind us of Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddf825
50,Very beautiful new gallery and friendly owners.,"I am an artist somewhat and heard about this new gallery. It could be hard to find, near the back of the Metropole marketplace area but well worth it. Quite a small space but very unpretentious. It is run by an artist named Porschia and her associate, another artists I'm not clear of the name but something like 'Silvio'. Very beautiful local Catalina art and I believe they also do classes and 'interactive' type activities. A must to stop by and check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
50,Absolutely Stunning,"In addition to opening a new studio, Rain Dance Art, Porschia is also available for custom work on commission. This magnificent piece reflects Catalina’s multi-textured beauty. It features both terrestrial and marine life, and pulses with the vibrancy of the most beautiful species, ringing the rugged profile of the island itself. Porschia further adorned the work with a calligraphic scroll: genus – species and wisps of description as if torn from a biologist’s field book. The seductive mermaid floats above the opening lines of Hans Christian Andersen’s original Danish “The Little Mermaid,” reflecting the artist’s creativity, attention to detail, and playfulness. As a centerpiece of an island home’s art collection, it draws visitors’ eyes and hearts to both Catalina’s, and Porschia’s magic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CB90704
50,Wonderful new art gallery on Catalina Island,"I recently visited the new Rain Dance Art Gallery on Catalina Island and it is wonderful. It’s a small place, tucked back in by the side of “big” Vons (if you know Avalon, that’ll make sense. If not, just ask anyone). Much of the art is done by Porschia Denning and much of it features scenes and wildlife from the Island. I particularly like the images of the foxes and buffalo. She captures the true image of the wildlife – not like a photograph – but you can almost feel the breath from the buffalo and the coarse fur on the Island fox.She does all sorts of images and in all sorts of sizes, including illustrated maps. She also does custom work if there’s something in particular that you want.My only regret is that I don’t have a wall that I can let her create a mural on – that would be fantastic.If you’re on the Island, you owe it to yourself to drop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddh986
