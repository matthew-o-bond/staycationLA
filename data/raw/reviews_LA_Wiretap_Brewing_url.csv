40,New Brewery Worth Visiting,"With a name like this I had to visit. NSA IPA was a black IPA and pretty good. Cymbo and Vauxhall Cross also. Lucador and Echelon are their standards, but the ABV was too much for me on the day I visited. So I will have to go back for those. Great location near downtown and a brewery with a great vibe and interesting artwork. Friendly staff, not particularly busy on the weekend. Street parking. Worth a visit. Btw, Wiretap got its name from the owners who were involved in comms and Internet service. I am sure there is more to this story, but without a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant, weâ€™ll probably never know for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellJW
