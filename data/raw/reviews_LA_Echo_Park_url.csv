20,Overrated - Primarily Homeless Encampment,"Made the trip to visit the lake after reading reviews and it being listed as a ‚Äòmust see‚Äô in the L.A. area, unfortunately I was very disappointed. Not sure if I went on a bad day or if it‚Äôs extremely overrated?The lake is small and surrounded by encampments of homeless people, some heckling visitors as well as a lot of small vendors selling fruit and various goods. It‚Äôs really unkempt with excess trash and belongings of the homeless scattering the park.Parking is scarce and because of the poorly kept grounds I didn‚Äôt even bother trying to hire the overpriced swan peddle boats.Some nice views of DTLA but I wouldn‚Äôt rate it as being one of the nicest places in LA! If you‚Äôve got to tackle the traffic to visit the lake, or if it‚Äôs out of your way, I wouldn‚Äôt bother.",GeorgiaSZ
50,Stunning park,"One of the most beautiful parks I‚Äôve ever seen. We went early in the morning and people were jogging, walking their dogs etc. It was a beautiful way to start our day. There were ducks in the water and on the grass. It is a serene place and beautiful on the eye",RealDS

50,This lakeside park is a wonderful and beautiful oasis in the city!,"Amazing place! Park for free at Glendale Blvd and head over to the lake. Walk, sit, take the swans for a ride on the lake or simply just enjoy this green oasis in LA. It's one hundred percent worth the while.",S. Moeller
50,Great neighbourhood,"Strolled the neighbourhood for lunch, desserts, drinks and the lake on a hot day. Cool place with lots of character and recommend the swan boats for peddleboat!",robby321

50,Sundayfunday Day After Birthday,"Love the updated park, even though its been a couple of years since Echo Park reopened. But it‚Äôs much nicer, still, a few homeless people sleeping around the park and parking is just horrible. Nowhere to park and parking enforce is in full effect. As we were leaving the park late Evening parking enforcement was taking pictures of car plates, basically giving out tickets. You are considered lucky if you find parking near the park. But once you‚Äôre in the park its a nice place to sit and talk and just watch the children play. The little paddling duck boat is cute too. Lots of small vendors selling coffee, food, ice cream, clothes etc...",JustAretha

50,Stunning Park and Lake,"Echo Park is an historical neighborhood near downtown L.A. centered around the stunning Echo Park Lake -- a bird refuge that is home to the iconic lotus pads. Planted in 1923-1924, these stunning flowers bloom from March-April through October and attract photographers from all over the world. Long-time residents, tourists and happy newcomers flock to the lake on weekends, where there are often street performers atop one of the viewing paths that jut out over the water and entertain with every style of music and dance. There are also loads of vendors selling traditional Mexican street food along with huge servings of fresh fruit - my favorite. For children there is the playground or an outing on a swan-shaped paddle boat. The boats are available for hire at the historic Boat House, built in 1932, which is also home to Square One Caf√©.The lake itself has been the backdrop to so many Hollywood films, the 90 foot high fountain that sprays three jets from the lake's center is famous worldwide. Overall, this park is a jewel, in the beauty of Los Angeles.",lollydepaulo

The view is also gorgeous and there's people who sell fruit and other goodies out there during the day. It's a nice little boat house there too where you can eat or rent paddle boats.,Davina B
50,Beautiful Scenic Lake and Place to Watch Birds!,"I have driven by Echo Park Lake many times, but on January 13, 2019, I visited Echo Park Lake for my very first time, as there was a Photographers Meetup before sunrise. I was so glad that I went, because I got to explore and photograph the beautiful and scenic lake up close and in person before the usual daytime crowds, and I also got to photograph the beautiful sunrise, as well as the many birds that visited this lake! I was impressed at the many birds that were present, which made for excellent photo opportunities for a Bird Photographer like myself!The only sad part about Echo Park Lake is that there are homeless encampents. That is why it was good that I joined the Photo Meetup Group rather than go there to photograph solo. Since safety may be an issue at Echo Park Lake, I recommend that visitors come with at least one buddy present.",Christine H

40,A nice park to enjoy just a short distance from downtown LA,"Echo Park has been improved and is much cleaner than before thanks to a refurbishment of the lake and facilities a few years ago. It is pleasantly landscaped and the lake has beautiful lotus pads. At the time of my visit, there were numerous birds including ducks and geese among other birds. The walk around the lake is a nice stroll and the boathouse has swan boats available for rental to sail on the lake. There is parking available on the streets around the park, but there is no separate parking area. There were a few tents indicating that there may be some homeless population in the park, but it was not a problem when I visited. Otherwise, the park is a nice place to visit and enjoy the view of downtown in the distance.",geotech522
40,Cleaner than I've ever seen it before.,"I used to live in Echo Park back when it wasn't as safe and cushy as it is now. Brought my girl here so she can see where I spent my childhood, was a great experience seeing as how it's far cleaner and safer. So if you've been there you know the path in the park is one big loop, when you get to the turn closer to where the echo park pool and basketball courts are there are a lot of people just standing around smoking weed. Over by the picnic tables there is usually gambling and suspicious looking people. Other than that its wonderful, I love love how many turtles I saw there. Funfact: I love turtles!",Erick V. Berduo
20,Gritty Place with broken glass everywhere,I read reviews online about how nice this park was so I ventured all the say from Simi Valley to see it and was disappointed. The park is really small and there is not enough parking. I went early on a Saturday and I couldn't find a place to park my car. Also there were many homeless and drug looking people wandering around the park. I saw a lot of smashed glass on the road from where car windows were broken into. I don't understand the hype of this park and never went back again.,Ashley S
50,Swan boats and turtles.,"I‚Äôve been here three times. The swan boats are great and even better now that they have a roof on them to get some shelter from sun. If you go at 9:30 weekdays you basically have the lake to yourself. You get one hour at $11 per person. There are loads of turtles ducks and birds around the plants on the lake, keep an eye out! Lovely way to spend an hour and great coffee shops nearby. Make sure you‚Äôve plenty of suncream on!",RoMcD2014

40,"Lotus Flowers, Boat Rentals and Marine Life","Recently, I visited this park for the annual Lotus Festival. If you're in Los Angeles during the annual Lotus Festival it's worth checking out. The event is held over two days and has food vendors and free activities (face painting, bouncy houses, etc.) for children.Everyday Activities - within the park, you can rent a swan paddle boat for an hour. There are two grass embankments that allow space for picnics and tall trees for a lazy day in the shade. *Don't forget to bring a picnic blanket. There are birds, turtles, and fish swimming in the lake which is great for the whole family to enjoy. The Lotus Flowers stalks are a great backdrop for taking pictures.The lake doesn't have a barrier gate around it, so if you bring toddlers they may need supervision. There's a small cafe (breakfast options) inside of the rental boat area although it doesn't have a wide selection of food choices. The park is surrounded by houses and businesses but it's great if you're in L.A., and want to experience an afternoon in the park.",Erica Dozier

50,A beautiful lake set within a bustling city,"We visited Echo Park as part of our trip around Los Angeles. A stunning park filled with beautiful flowers, palm trees and a mixture of wildlife.Whilst there was hundreds of people in the park, ample space remained so you could claim your own slice in the peaceful environment.Reaching the park by public transport, much like most of L.A., requires some walking (depending on route).",TomNIwona
40,Mr Fountain's Opening Act,"Driving round LA without a satnav (GPS) in the car is wholly recommended. Mayb just factor in some extra time to allow for the occasional mistake. But eventually it pays off you feel as though you know a place even better. This trip I knew that roughly somewhere south east from our base was Echo Park and only about 15 minutes drive. It was fairly straightforward especially as it has a 200 foot tall spraying water fountain as a landmark to help navigate. But on this trip the water fountain had an entertaining opening act, after turning the corner it also revealed a drunk looking homeless guy in the foreground spraying his own water fountain into directly into the traffic. Good morning Echo Park. It was 10.30am and the day was fresh. Introductions over, we set about on foot exploring. It's fairly flat with some nature to ponder and much prettier and manicured than its rival and neighbour Silver Lake Reservoir. Although it's unfair to compare the two, Silver Lake is great for runners and walkers but no other attractions to speak of. Echo Park is calming and beautiful, and if you're in the area come down to soak up the tranquil atmosphere. It's definitely worth not being put off by the entrance at the north east corner with its debris of empty booze bottles, cardboard dens and Mr Fountain.",major_rawls
40,an oasis for relaxation,"Great little park to walk around in, enjoy your lunch, or even take a nap. Much more local-friendly than a lot of other attractions. There is a path around the little lake you can walk (lots of birds and lotuses to see), little boats to ride, and plenty of grassy lawn. An occasional ""tent-home"" may be on the edges, but we found it to be clean and safe. Go for a run with your dog, get a snack from a food truck, or enjoy some wine in the shade.Parking may be difficult, depending on the day of the week/time of day.",Amanda F

50,Many thanks to Lisa and Paolo at EPFC!,"From the Autry, I had to take two buses. It was a busy Friday after noon and if I hadn‚Äôt just missed the bus at the time I was exiting the Autry, it would not have taken so long‚Ä¶but it was all good. I enjoyed sitting under the tall eucalyptus trees, not doing, just being. The EPFC opened at 3:00 p.m. on this Friday, so I gave myself an hour to get there. What a wonderful journey. The reason for my journey there is I had purchased an old projector a few years ago, which had four old reel films in it. The projector needs a new projection light, so I thought better to bring the reels somewhere I could view them. I was happy to pay the $20 donation to screen the films using a small projector and a piece of white paper as a screen. I was hoping to find long lost film of Marilyn Monroe, or home movies of someone recognizably famous, but not so. It was worth the trip to EPFC as I learned they often have film-related events‚Äîscreenings, script readings, gatherings of all types to allow film lovers and filmmakers to network, and even rent equipment as needed. Fabulous grass roots place for the film and film-lovers community.",Sabrina N
30,Echo Park review,If you ever get tired of the standard tourist traps of Los Angeles and want to get away from the downtown area then you might want to visit Eco Park which is only a ten minute drive from downtown Los Angeles. The park has a great walking and or running trail and in the middle of the park is a pond filled with ducks. This park even has a restaurant where you can eat and chat amidst the solitude of the park and it has another area where you can rent a paddleboat to traverse the pond. A few areas around the pond are littered with the occasional vagrant person but the park is not overrun by them. Overall if you want to visit an area a bit off the beaten path and you wish to seek a bit of serenity in a sea of concrete hen a visit to Echo Park might be for you.,Troy W

30,ECHO PARK IN 30 minutes,"A pleasant walk around echo park lake with lots of grassy areas, boats and bikes to rent. On a sunny day this is a great place to enjoy...For most people taking the hwy to get to echo park it‚Äôs worth the traffic jams..",ChrisRusling
50,Nearly Perfect!,"Most of Los Angeles parks are in dire need of maintenance...not this one! LA has done a splendid job of restoring this one. No homeless are here! The lake, with its water lillies, is beautiful. There's plenty of green grass to sit on. A beautiful high rising fountain spouts proudly from the center of the lake. The only drawback, if one wanted to quibble, is the lack of reasonably priced food. There is a restaurant at the lake but it serves expensive food that's more designed for the Millennial crowd than for average folk. There is no parking lot, so get there early on the weekends to get a space on the street!",Rogerdob

The environment is cooling, there's a lot of Mexican food omg soooo good and its pet friendly. I highly recommend this boat ride and don't forget to give me a thumbs up üëçüèæ.

We thought at first a class, or a club, but just individual photographers trying to capture ""the"" picture of the lotus blooms on the lake. Credited to Aimee Semple McPherson who started the nearby Angelus Temple, these flowers are magnificent for about a six week period. Great serendipitous find.",pmjc

One thing that annoyed me was the lack of enforcement for dogs on leashes. I love dogs and usually wouldn't be bothered by this but one dog went crazy chasing ducks and ducklings and proceeded to jump into the water after them while his owner laughed and did nothing. Otherwise, this place is lovely. Didn't eat in the cafe but it looked nice, otherwise there are places nearby. Bathrooms in poor state!",RoMcD2014

50,Wanna walk in Los Angeles? Think Echo Park,"Los Angeles is not a city made for pedestrians. When I moved here I thought to myself people are lazy. They drive around and get stuck in traffic. They suck. Little Parisian fought hard and walked walked walked everywhere I could. And honestly I have walked through pretty dull and boring suburban parts of the city: mini malls and gas stations everywhere and not much to entertain the eyes in between.That is until I moved to Echo Park. And now I walk all over and feel happier. My dear readers, please don't expect the experience to be anywhere near a stroll down the streets of London or magnificent Paris. Expect palm trees and Billboards!Head to the Park! Enjoy the great renovation work they've done there. You can even take a ride an a paddle boat. Such a corny 1950 date! Water lilies, when in season, will make you travel to the other end of the world. On the week-ends latino street vendors will make sure you have plenty to drink and snack on. The churros lady and her husband with their antic machine have the key to my stomach. Fruit vendors are there too but my tummy likes carbs...From the park you can walk to restaurants, music venues, bars and stores (gentrification happening full gear so hipster shopping in motion). Walk around Echo Park. Walk. Walk. Walk. Because humans need to do it. Because we need a village. Because you need to relax.Visitors of the city can push the walk and go to Angelino Heights to check out the beautiful Victorian mansions on Carroll Ave. Or, they can head to Elysian park and the Dodgers stadium and make it a day trip with a baseball extravaganza in the late afternoon.Spend a day in Echo Park. Move to Echo Park. Visit Echo Park.Just do.",Mayounaise
50,One of My Favorite Spots in La La Land,I go to Echo Park at least once a week for a walk. I grew up in this neighborhood years ago when it wasn't so great. It's beautiful and safe now!

I would highly recommend exploring not only the park but Sunset Blvd in the surrounding area.,EagleRockers

Young couples walking their dogs, sunbathing and reading dominate this beautifully landscaped park.

Located in the Glendale area, the water is clean and the fountain is eye catching. The pond area is surrounded by walking area where you can take laps. Take a close look at the water, there are wildlife there including a turtle. This place gets very busy during the weekends. I stopped by here to stretch. The park closes from 10:30 pm to 5:00 am to prevent homeless from occupying. And oh yes, there is a playground across the street from the main park. Very nice.",Indiana_Jonesse

You will be joined by equally minded people Jogging, picnicing and fishing.Do not be influenced by very old reports of this being a bad area from when the area appeared in films such as 'My Crazy Life' as it is completely transformed since those days and i would have no hesitation in using it as a base if we come again.",1singo

40,Wonderful city park with downtown views and lotus flowers,"This small park is a real joy. It is located near downtown LA, with a terrific view of the skyline. It surrounds a small lake that features a pretty water feature, paddle boats, lily pads, and lotus flowers. In June-July, if you are lucky, you can see the lotus in bloom, like we did today. They are spectacular! Each year, in mid-July, there is a Lotus Festival. The walkway around the pond is pretty with areas of nice flowers on one side and picnic area on the other side.We had lunch at Langer's and walked the park afterwards, a fine idea as they are roughly 2 miles apart.I'd have given it 5 stars, but for noontime on a Saturday, the lady's rest room was horrid and filthy, as though no one had cleaned it that day - go before you arrive at the park.",Plumeria D
40,Activity and laughs,Echo park is a nice small park with a small lake in it.

Also, makes for a nice picnic and there are small shops within walking distance here and the boathouse servers up food.",Hoben01
50,You must visit!,"Its a beautiful park. Great open areas for picnics, relaxation, exercising or just taking a stroll. The Lotus festival was this weekend and that's always a fun event!",Mayra R
50,Neat place,"What a great park. You can inhale the scent of nature just north of downtown Los Angeles. The park is hidden in an eclectic neighborhood. There is a hiking trail around the small lake. You can rent a paddleboat for $10 adult, $5 children, for one hour. There is a cute little cafe attached to the rental place.",Brook B
50,Newly rennovated,"I loved the renovations on the park. It used to be dirty and smelly, but now it's nicely redone. The famous waterfall is the center of all it. Take a stroll around the lake and have breakfast at the cafe. Try out paddle boating too! There's ample parking around the lake too.",kisssmee
40,Nice walk if you are in the area,Echo Park Lake went through a major overhaul two years ago that has made great improvements. This is a nice way to enjoy a mellow day. The walk around the lake is close to a mile. The Angelus Temple is across the street.,zkrscasa
50,Walking around the Park,We were so impressed on the many Lotus Plants along the edge of the Lake. They are well protected from any kind of intruders because the nets were in-place. The many varieties of flowers make one really wonder and appreciate the real beauty of the nature. Some lotus grew so tall that some flowers were so big that really amazed me because it is my 1st time to see such beautiful plants.,Librado C
50,Trendy neighborhood to visit,"Echo Park in Los Angeles. this is a very fast growing neighborhood with trendy shops and of course right next to the Dodger stadium. Echo Park is a community with business that help one another and is worth to exploring. It is full of small restaurants, clothing stores, the famous land mark the lake, Dodger stadium, etc.. Echo Park is also famous for new upcoming trendy retail shops, bars/cafes and it is also well know for their Lotus festival at the beginning of summer at the park by the lake. it gets filled with vendors, food, clothing and lots more. just recent I visited a cute clothing shop "" Colibri on Sunset"" women clothes and accessories are adorable and affordable. also, Lot 1 caf√© on the same block both of these are amazing. happy exploring.",Roxfun
30,Nice place to relax...,good place to jog during the day...wouldn't be in the area at night. Lot's of shops close by to check out. Nice lake.,B J
20,Lots of Potential,"The area could be a real gem, but unfortunately after 15 years of ""on the way up"" it still hasn't made it that far. Great architecture, some great little restaurants, but still very shady.",2remem
50,Fishing,"Me and my Friend are addicted to fishing. Living in the heart of La their aren't to many places to go fishing within walking distance of our houses. Me and my friend and we established a pattern tossing Ika's through the lake. It is really cool when one of us caught a fish. People from the other side of the lake would say wait to come and see it. There would be crowds looking at the bass that we just caught. People always call us crazy and think that there are gangs over there, but when ever we go which was like once a week we never had any problem.",ISWAGYOU
20,"Overrated ""Trendy"" Neighborhood","Echo Park and Silverlake are both overrated. Parking is bad, and the area has been let go. Houses look decrepit and so do many of the eateries and other establishments. ""Trendy"" people have tried to make it a trendy neighborhood and I commend them on their efforts to revitalize the area, but it has come up really short. On a bright note, there are good places to eat and drink, as long as you don't mind them looking and smelling like something in a third world country.",LuvinLA
40,Urban lake oasis near downtown LA,"I visited this place for the annual Lotus Festival only to find that none of the lake's lotus flowers survived the winter season. This is quite a big park for an urban area. It takes about a half hour to walk around the entire circumference of the lake. You can usually find parking along the residential side streets.There is catch 'n' release fishing allowed at the lake and no swimming. You can rent a paddle boat here too. The lifeguards on duty are there to make sure that no one falls into the lake.This park is: dog-friendly, family-friendly, and an interesting oasis near downtown Los Angeles.",mktgurl
