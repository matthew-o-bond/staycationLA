40,An attractive and nicely presented Veterans Memorial Park.,"I visited the Veteran's Memorial Park in Redondo Beach when on my way to the pier. The park is nicely kept and very well designed and presented with its palm trees, flagpole, and memorials. A pleasant place for a walk and reflection to pay respects to those that have served their Country. Nice sea views as well.",Roberts69
50,"Great Views, BBQ Pits, Benches, Bathrooms, Open Space","After leaving the beach, we spent about an hour at Veterans Park. It has a great view of the ocean and was great for a picnic. It has water, bathrooms, and a large lawn for games and throwing a football or frisbee. We will be sure to go back. Parking is nearby.",Pfitzgerald1946
40,Wedding at the Library in Veterans Park,"This was a beautiful venue to host an outside wedding. May can be cold, windy, or hot. Historic Library on the nearby grounds planned the outdoor wedding on the grass. Reception was indoors in the beautiful library. The food was fantastic. Appetizers were skewered shrimp, chicken, tapenade on baguette bread. Side coffee bar was a thrill. Photo booth was brought in to make for a fin time. Dancefloor was installed. Bathrooms are located 1 floor down, so take elevator, or stairs. Highly recommended.",WalkingInLA
40,"Great visit, great views, nice bonus","Veterans Park is a very nice neighborhood park to be enjoyed - but not just by neighbors. Some of the oldest trees in the South Bay, a short walk to the Redondo Beach Pier, super play area for children, a thoughtful memorial to the nation's veterans, expanses of lawns and, on Thursday mornings, a small farmers' market. For those spending any length of time in the area, the senior center has loads of activities, and there is an old building on the national historic register.If you aren't in the park to buy lunch on a Thursday, walk a couple of short blocks to homemade-to-oder Mexican fare at the Los Caballitos lunch counter you'll find inside the corner market on Catalina Ave. - authentic, friendly, and tasty!",Marlin O
30,Thursday Farmers Market,"As far as the park goes, if it wasn't for the incredible ocean views from the back side of the park, it is just another park. There are a lot of large trees and so the grass is splotchy. There is a children's playground, though compared to parks in other cities, this playground is very dated.There is a farmer's market Thursday mornings, which is on the small side, and the prices are steep. But make sure to buy some fresh kettle corn.There is a small parking lot with meters, but the lot is typically full. In all honesty I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this park.",luv2trvlRedondoBeach
30,Beautiful spot next to pier.,"Great little park next to the Redondo Pier. Good for kids, picnics, or just hanging out next to the beach. Metered parking and not a huge parking lot but the pier has a parking garage also.",MK F
50,"Nice park for family, kids & events!","Veterans Park overlooks the Pacific Ocean, it's a 3 minute walk from the pier and a great location for family/kids to hang out on a sunny day! Feel free to ride your bike too as there are bike racks as well! Kids will enjoy swings/running around. It's also the location where they host events on Veterans Day & Memorial Day...for sure a great place to check out with the family :)",Jeff Ginsburg
50,Great local jumping off point for SCUBA diving Redondo Canyon!,"Veterans Park (Vets Park) is a nice, oceanfront neighborhood park with decent amenities, good parking, and well maintained grassy areas. I'm most familiar with it as a staging area for SCUBA diving. There are easy steps down to the ocean from the Vets parking lot, and good shower facilities on the way up to rinse gear and get the sand off. You'll often find SCUBA students completing their certification dives off of Vets, and divers of all experience levels staging gear behind their cars in the parking lot.",SACNORAD
40,Quite a selection of activities!,"There is a skate park, indoor and outdoor basketball courts, playground, grass, baseball field. utility room, gym, racketball, etc.",Richard K
40,Relaxing,"Decent amount of parking available, but get here early since it fills up on hot days. Lots of tables around to spread out and have lunch under the shade of the trees and close to the beach so you can work off that extra sandwich you just ate.",m s
50,"Calm, cool and collected!","We have been here a few times. The park is literally attached to the beach. Very clean and safe feeling, on the beach and only a few hundred feet from Redondo Pier.

50,beautiful setting,Beautiful setting minutes from the beach. Clean park with various swings and slides for the little ones to wear themselves out.,Steve M
50,Steps from the Beach,"This is a beautiful park that is only steps from the beach AND Redondo Pier. The park area includes a full playground for children and several picnic tables throughout, many with great ocean views. There is ample plots of grass to enjoy lounging under a tree, a wonderful Veterans Memorial. A historic library is also located on the grounds and is on the National register. Unfortunately, there are no daily tours of the building but private tours are available. Visit on a Thursday morning and you'll find a Farmers Market.Metered Parking",Christine L
50,Oldest tree in Redondo Beach is HERE! Tot lot too!,"This park is a beautiful green area across the street from the beach. It has a great Tot Lot and it’s clean and scenic. I’ve been visiting this park my whole life and it’s morphed into the picnic place when the weather is nice. When it’s colder, bundle up and walk one of the pathways in the park. You will find a great senior center too. Parking is kind of pricey so bring your quarters! Come play with the locals.",BorgHouse
40,Great Beach Park,"Nice grassy park with picnic tables, kiddie playground and a great ocean view with the sand just steps away. Metered parking lot.",JulieL0ves2Travel
50,Lots of room.,You can bring all of your activities and have plenty of room to enjoy yourself on the plethora of grassy area that covers the park. You can play with your friends and make new friends. It is walking distance from the ocean so at any time you can walk down to enjoy the waves or the soft sand. There is a center where you can book a private party as well in case you have a special event. To top it all off It conveniently close proximity to the pier.,NanaSteer
50,Amazing park!,This is the most beautiful park! It has a gorgeous view of the beach! I walk this park every day and feel blessed to live near the park!,Thanh P
40,"Come for the farmer's Market, stay for a lovely lunch.","This little gem of a park directly overlooks the beach, just south of the Redondo Beach Pier. They have a farmer's market on Thursdays from 8 am t 1 pm every Thursday, where we buy all our fresh veggies, the most marvelous fresh fish from Pete, sausages from Jim, and our yogurt, hummus and feta for the week from Meerhan. They have many different food vendors as well. So what could be better than a late breakfast or lunch (depending on when we get there!) at one of the many picnic tables in the park? Just be sure to bring a light jacket or a sweater for the breeze coming off the blue, blue water. You might even see dolphins, pelicans, surfers, or other local flora and fauna.",Susan S
50,Beautiful park overlooking the beach,"I love this park! It's great for kids, couples, families with well-maintained grounds, landscaping, historic buildings, playground, and picnic areas. There is an old library on the grounds that has been restored for events. It is a beautiful facility that overlooks the beach and Redondo pier.",gr8fish2017

40,Brief visit.,First day in LA at the stary of 2 month trip of US and Canada. Meeting friends. We were very jet lagged but enjoyed the walk to marina and shops. Very quiet. Lots of green space and play area.,Sandra B
50,A nice city park,"Veterans Park is a typical park with children's swings etc, Not far from the beach has some monuments to vets and is very clean to take a walk threw or around.",Joyce and Dean
30,"Ok, not Great","Veterans Park is a beautiful location with Redondo's old, historic library still in place, which is now used for weddings and special events. There is also a very nice veterans memorial to all branches of service in the park, which is a nice tribute to the men and women who have served our great nation. The down side to this park is that it gets overrun on the weekends by out of towners. Outside of this fact, it is located close to the Redondo Beach Pier (easy walking distance) and is a nicely laid out park. If you can avoid the crowds, you're obviously better off. Worth seeing.",CD1970
50,Nice area to stop off witht he grand children after the beach.,Good stop off on the way from the beach where you can let the children run those last bit of energy off. Nice range of swings etc.,iwells6
50,Great Escapes,"Take a walk along the Esplanade in Redondo Beach and sooner or later you will come to Veterans' Park. A lovely, quiet oasis amid beautiful palms and oceans breezes where you can contemplate life or you next meal (which is nearby).",Rosemary A
50,very moving and patriotic,We walked through on our way to our hotel and they honored all services and fallen heroes from Redondo Beach. We were impressed with the layout and the view looking down on the ocean.,golfnva
50,Great Ocean front park,"Perfect for little ones, big grassy field for picnics and right next to the beach and Redondo pier. Parking fills up quickly in Summer.",jeff M
40,Nice memorial and park,It unfortunately does not recognize the brave Merchant Mariners who died for our country and have achieved Vet status.,Dan T
50,Might be the best park in Los Angeles!,"With a nice playground for kids, clean bathrooms, shady benches, open grassy areas and picnic tables just steps from the beach, this park has it all. Not only that... it's a quick walk to the Redondo Beach Pier if you forgot lunch and need a hot dog-on-a-stick or a fish taco or a coffee.The pay-parking lot right next to the park is usually available during the week, but may be crowded on the weekends. There is enough flow of traffic that the wait is usually not long.On Thursday's the park hosts a farmer's market, so parking is limited to the pier lot or local streets. The farmer's market is fantastic, with produce, local products, flowers and prepared food. Before my kids went to school, we would come to the park to play for an hour or so. I'd get chicken and rice & fresh strawberries and eat at the picnic tables. Then we'd walk down to the beach to dig and splash before heading home with the kids exhausted.",Sarah M
40,A Great Local Park for Families,"I have been coming to this park since my daughter was a baby. It's got parking (weekdays are easier of course). It's got a view of the beach and the Redondo Beach Pier. You can walk to either. or you can walk up the Esplanade to Torrance beach for amazing sunsets and pictures. The toys and swings are in good condition and the bathroom is surprisingly decent on a weekday. Weekends here are very crowded. There is a library building where they hold weddings and it's a beautiful setting. The trees in this park are gorgeous for family photos or just photos of your kids, and great for the kids to climb. Bring a blanket and some water and you are set here. Oh and remember quarters for the parking meters. There is no where close to get change.",JuliK222
40,Nice park on the beach,"The park has restrooms, picnic tables, and a playground. Also, it is on the beach and close to the boardwalk. Ride your bike or take quarters for the meters. $1.50 per hour. You can also park at the parking garage for the boardwalk for $2.00 an hour",Jessica-Greg P
50,"Great place to relax, watch for dolphins and ""earthing"" in mornings since they don't allow dogs in park.","Wonderful park by Redondo Pier with old trees gnarled by wind. Regulars feed the many squirrels in the park. Mothers with babies exercising in group. I go ""earthing"" early mornings on the moist grass and don't have to worry about dogs! There is a small playground for children. Thursday's hosting farmers' market with vistas of waves. Spend sometime in the park and honor veterans of different services.",dwonglight
40,Proving Life can be a Picnic!,"It's the spirit of the place that does it, just about every weekend and definitely every holiday. The place fills with festivity, happy families, activity, and the spirit of the place becomes infectious.",Primo54
40,Sunsets!,Clean park and benches to view the sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Redondo Beach and Pier are right around the bend in the road and in clear view from the park.,tripdog002
50,Bueatiful,It has a PERFECT view of the Pacific Ocean and a really nice playground! It's the perfect place to take children too!!!!!,Megan S
20,Not really a Park,"This is a grassy area on the beach that offers nothing but a few tables. Why go here when you are 50 ft from the beach and have the pier as an additional option. Kids run around out of control, people feed the gulls so they poop all over. definitely not worth the visit. Go to the park in HB or MB",Marcthornton1
