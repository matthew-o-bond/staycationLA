40,What a View! Can see all of Long Beach Harbor from here,"Wow, what a view! Great spot for sunset or a walk at sunset. Usually see quite a few people around, but don't plan on going for the 4th of July. Either too crowded or will be closed because of the crowds. Awesome spot.",AKTraveler
50,Great View,"If you happen to be in the Long Beach area, Hilltop Park is a must-visit place! The view is amazing. On a clear day, you can even see the Hollywood sign from a distance. It's a nice place to make your kids run around and enjoy the fresh air.Tip: bring a car! You'll definitely be out of breath if you decide to hike Signal Hill hehe",PackYourBags100
50,Nice view,It's a great place to have a good view of Signal Hill and Long Beach.It's easy to park there.There are tables to have a picnic.,vicbay
50,Walk here everyday,"Beautiful park that always has people hanging out enjoying the view of LA and the ocean.Plenty of parking, clean restroom, walking trails, food trucks and ice cream trucks here on a regular basisNice place for fireworks but unless you live close by you will have to walk up the hill(best bet is the home depot parking lot for that day).",rcaldin
40,Panoramic View.,"Great outdoor area to exercise, chill out and enjoy the panoramic view of Long Beach. Well maintained area and restroom. You can have a picnic, there are tables and benches. Best place to see the sunset in the area.",Russ Lacuata
40,View from the Top,"A brief ride up Skyline drive brings you to Hilltop Park at Signal Hill. Parking was easy and we had a breathtaking 360 degree view of Long Beach and far beyond. First we saw the 2006 statue to the ""roughnecks"" of the oil industry which was most interesting. We then crossed to the park itself and were fascinated by the working oil drill. The views were enhanced by large boards with brief explanations of the vista observed. The ocean, oil drills, and general views all the way to Catalina were grand.",RenaM65
50,Top of the World!,"A great view, a great place to stroll, a great place for a picnic! Whether you are alone, with a group os friends or a family on an outing, Hilltop Park is beautiful and educational.",Barbara N
50,Good Workout,Going up North side is a strain on the knees. I prefer the longer route and walk the south side. Great view of the Long Beach Airport on walking trail. Water fountains at a couple of stops as well as at the top at the park. Winding trail on north side a nice walk down instead of taking the brutal road.,oahuhaole619
50,Signal Hill Resident,Beautiful view. Always worth a visit to stroll with my dog. I love the walkway around the north side of the hill.,Deb B
50,Magical view,"Hilltop Park has some of the best views around! If you want to see an amazing sunset just head over here. If you want a Tai Chee work out or Yoga with a view please come. This park has hosted many family get togethers, wedding and engagement pictures and just for a day of relaxing. get place to bring a picnic lunch and see what unfolds below the skyline.We come up here every 4th of July and we live on the hill. Everyone is always so friendly! Come and enjoy what our small city has to offer.",ginahicks921
50,Amazing views,The views from Hilltop Park allow you to see 360 degrees clearly over all of the LA area. The views of the Pacific Ocean are closest and you see sparkling waters. You can also see all the way to downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica from here. To the south you can see Newport beach. Beautiful park.,0221Serendipity
50,PERFECT SPOT FOR LUNCH,"I really enjoy grabbing a sandwich and heading up the hill. We'll get together with a group and go sit along the cement perimeter overlooking the harbour, LAX and on those rare days, take in the Hollywood sign. If you've got time a stroll around the top on their walkway is excellent as you can see the other side including Long Beach airport as well as out east towards Seal Beach",SenorGancho
50,"Beautiful park, especially at sunset","This is a must-see for any sunrise/sunset. On a clear day, you can see Catalina Island, and all over the cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach. No kidding-the best sunset/sunrise place for miles!!!",Michelle B
50,"Sunsets, sunsets, sunsets.","One of the best places to see the sunset in LA. (Palos Verdes May be better). It is a convenient and easy location to get to, to see the sunset from high above Long Beach. Not usually crowded. You can also have kids watch planes land at LB airport.",LouisVal
50,A hidden gem in LA,A beautiful little park on top of an oil field. Derek's are all around and still working. Has an amazing view in all directions A quite park to relax and have a bite to eat. Washrooms are on site. A must see.,Raroboy
50,GREAT SPOT FOR LUNCH AND THE VIEW,I wish they would list this as Signal Hill Park but it is what it is. If you find it you'll be rewarded. Off the beat and track and not that well known but a fantastic panorama of Long Beach to Rancho Palos Verdes to LAX to downtown and the Hollywood sign (on a clear day).Perfect to spot to bring a lunch and sit and relax and take in the view.,SenorGancho
50,If you are staying in Signal Hill/Long Beach come up for the views!,"This small park has actually more than meets the eye! First there are the veiws of course. Take your camera! You will see the ocean, downtown Long Beach; the sky-skapers of Los Angeles, on a clear day you might see the mountains that encircle the L.A. Basin and also the Pasos Verde Penninsula. You might notice there are some exercising activities in the park. Follow the path and there are more of them. We ended up on the other side of Signal Hill by the plaque commemerating the first oil-well in Signal Hill! Anyway the grandkids liked trying their skills on the various excercise/traininig/balancing, etc. Aparatuses One can also enjoy the views of Lakewood and all the cities beyond that at the same time. We walked back through the houses back to the main park on the other side back to our car. It is relatively safe for being so near Long Beach. No restaurants up there, but just go down the hill and there are lots of places on the Signal Hill/back part of the hill, do not go towards Long Beach though if walking. Not safe in the older parts of Long Beach.",HappyNorwegians
50,Great views,"I have lived in signal hill for 7 years and walk through and drive past this park every day. Its not over used, its well maintained and has great views.",rcaldin
50,Be ready for a workout!,"Hilltop Park offers beautiful views, especially when the sun is setting! It's a great place to walk and run, also. A road right next to the park, labeled ""Panorama Promenade,"" has fitness stations, as well. Parking is pretty much a park-wherever-you-can arrangement.",lymac7
50,What a panorama!,It's an awesome view from up here. You can see the mountains and the cityscape as far as downtown LA.,TAROTZAMM
50,A MUST SEE STOP,"After the many years of coming to Long Beach we finally got up to Hilltop/Signal Hill park. Awesome. It provides a fantastic, 270 degree panorama. With good visibility one can see the Hollywood sign on far side of downtown LA, to Rancho Palos Verdes to Seal Beach east of Long Beach. It is worth walking around and take in the 'necklace', all the stops they have with a Viewsign filled with interesting trivia.Great way to relax (or bring the runners and do the parkours exercise route), take in the view and enjoy. Sunrise or just before sunset are the best for colours and clarity",SenorGancho
40,Great view,"I live locally, but have never been up on Signal Hill. I just wanted to check it out. There is a great view from up there. It would be best to go there on a clear day.",Shari H
40,Great views even after dark!,Went with some friends who are locals and found this hilltop park to be enchanting. The night time views towards downtown Long Beach and the port were spectacular! This is a spot mostly locals know about but if you're driving in the area then by all means search this park out for some nice views of the surrounding area.,ARodriguezP
50,Great views,"Always love walking the dog around Hilltop Park. On a clear day, you have great views of downtown LA, Hollywood sign, Catalina.",SoCalBigGuy
50,Favorite Place to Walk... View the Sunset and see the City,Hilltop Park had phenomenal views of the city and ocean as well as great sunset views.There are several walking paths as well as hills to enjoy.,gmeredith
50,Come watch the sunset with me...,Come watch the awesome views and sunset! It's nice to come have a pic nick basket and enjoy the views. Telescope to view the Hollywood sign and downtown L.A.. Come soak in some sunshine and fresh air. Make sure to bring your camera...,Rita I
50,See the sun set and then the stars,Picnic dinners at the top of the hill overlooking Long Beach are an enjoyable way to experience our city and have time together. Go during the summer between 6:30 and 8 pm. to catch the sunset. The sun setting over the ocean is one of life's simple pleasures and it has yet to disappoint.,Susan A
40,"After rain, nighttime, and 4th of July","As others have said, the views are amazing. This hill gives a view for as many miles as the pollution allows...That's the downside. You will realize how bad the air is that you're breathing. So the best views are after rain and at night.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Fantastic views and nice to know that there's parking!,"Hilltop Park is the best place to go right after or the day after a rainstorm, when everything is clear (hell I'd go here for skyscapes as well when the storm is rolling through). With enough clarity, the height allows you, from this vantage point to see everything from the hills of Laguna to Culver City, the mountains behind Santa Monica, the Hollywood sign, and downtown LA. It's pretty great and I love how it's just in the middle of the city.Now I'll address the whole of Signal Hill. Parking for seeing the views is available at Hilltop Park, on the street directly across from Hilltop, and at Discovery Wells park also. However, this parking is limited, so when you park on the street just watch out for what the signs say. I'd highly recommend walking the Signal Hills Trail (short trail going on the northern side of the hilltop) that gives you even more views from west to east (as compared to Hilltop Park where you get south to north looking west). Also if you go on Temple Ave right before it turns into Skyline Drive, you can park on the street there and get a pretty unblocked view looking inland south to north. In total from the top of Signal Hill on a clear day, you can see Big Bear, Mt. Baldy (Mt. San Antonio), Saddleback, Laguna Hills, Catalina, Downtown LA, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Culver City, the Hollywood Sign, Santa Monica mountains and those mountains behind them, the planes landing at Long Beach Airport directly below you, and basically everything in between. To get equivalent views you'd have to drive to Palos Verdes and hope for a clear spot or go to Griffith Park or something. I can't believe it took me this long to explore it!",Europhile24
50,Free with Killer Views,"It is a small park on top of Signal Hill in the middle of a residential area, however the views are gorgeous. On one side one can see downtown Long Beach and San Pedro and the vast spread of LA on the other side, all the way from the Hollywood Hills (including the Hollywood Sign), downtown LA and the San Gabriel mountains. Day or night the view is incredible on a clear day.",Sam S
50,As wonderful as everyone says!,"We went after sunset. I didn't think it would be as good as all the reviews boasted, but it actually was. Beautiful view overlooking the city lights.",jscof
50,Perfect place to spend half an hour,Stopped at Hilltop park when passing by Long Beach. The Hilltop Park is a perfect place to spend half an hour with its magnificent view. Take a break and stay here.,Nikon
50,A Hill With A View!!,"What a great place to spend a few minutes of your day for a walk, sunset, or evening. The view of the coast, Long Beach and surrounding area. Sunset is incredible.mmIt is worth a visit. Nnthere is parking too.",Pat Bledsoe
50,Exercise with a gorgeous view!,"Peace, quiet and a little sweat! Scenery is beautiful. The community is extremely friendly. You will most likely see a few dogs on the way, not to mention meat heads and not-so-much meat heads (self included).",Summer M
40,A View With A Park,"Once covered by oil derricks, Signal Hill has transformed over the last 30 years, to include several newer developments-this includes several new parks to accommodate the influx of new residents. This park, located on the north side of Signal Hill (South of Willow, East of Cherry off Skyline Dr.) is one of its hidden gems! While the park has limited parking, including one (1) ADA parking space, it also has two (2) public restrooms, making this park great for families who no longer have to run home for that untimely break.",KJamesinSigHill
50,View the Mountains to the Sea,"Very popular, yet rarely ""crowded"" it is a must see! I live just two blocks from here and I never get tired of the Birdseye view. The sunsets can be spectacular, but anytime of day or evening is the perfect for a visit!",BubbyeNWA
50,Oh So Steep,"I found this park, only by accident, when looking for another location in the area and found myself driving up an ""oh so steep"" winding hill. At the top of the hill was Hilltop Park which offers incredibly breathtaking, majestic, and awe-inspiring views of its surrounding cities. It also has barbeque pits, picnic tables, and clean restrooms. A quiet park, it's a hidden gem and a great place to relax, exercise, or have lunch. I returned to this park a second time because that ""oh so steep"" winding hill was really worth the effort.",Ms T B
50,"Panoramic Vistas, Extensive Trails","Having been born and raised in Southern California I have driven by and seen Signal Hill thousands of times. Who can miss it? Until I was went up to Hilltop Park at the peak of Signal Hill, I never knew that there was a treasure there. Views to downtown LA and the ""Hollywood"" sign one way, snow-capped mountains another and Catalina and San Clemente Islands yet another, simply by pivoting in place. You can see a lot by just driving and parking, but an extensive network of walking trails allows you to unlock the real beauty of the area.The are also offers interpretive signage and monuments documenting and illustrating the rich history of Signal Hill as one of the first oilfields in California. I was also surprised that it had been the sight of a Balboa Movie Studios (featuring Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton, a restaurant and dance hall and the first all-jazz radio station in the United States.",tpeve

40,An amazing 300° view of Long Beach,We went for sunset and stayed through the turning on of the city lights. You can see all the way to the Pacific and the mountains as well. It would be a wonderful place for a date or for a family to enjoy the sunset and the park. There is plenty of room to have your own space and for the kids to run. I have to say the view was amazing and the price was just right...FREE.,hutchens74
40,Great views - especially at sunset!,This is THE place to be for sunset! Great views of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and over the ocean to Catalina.Parking can be a bit tight.,LJC309
50,"Hilltop Park in the Center of Long Beach, CA","When visiting Long Beach, CA, no visit is complete without a twilight visit to Hilltop Park. Located at the top of Signal Hill, a small city within the boundaries of Long Beach, CA, it gives 20 mile views of Catalina Island, the skyscrapers in downtown Los Angeles, the beach shoreline to the south and snow on the mountains in the wintertime....Walk downhill toward the LA skyline and you can make right turns for several blocks to work off those calories and enjoy a panoramic view of the area with city lights coming on at dusk...a double reward for healthy living!",LongBeachboy
