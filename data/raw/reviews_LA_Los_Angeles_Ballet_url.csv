40,The Nutcracker,"The LA ballet did a good job with their version of this ballet. Saw it at Royce Hall, on the UCLA campus-was a little disappointed that prerecorded music was used. Overall they did a good job",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicenurse1
50,Local Treasure!,I attended FREE classes at their community outreach day given about once a month. There are all levels of ballet classes from beginner to professional given by company members. There is usually a presentation about their upcoming performances between classes that is very informative as well as entertaining. I am so impressed by the caliber of dancers they are able recruit from world class companies. They deserve the support of Angelenos who have a history of not supporting fine artistic endeavors in their own city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spahopper123
50,Ballet Extraordinair!,"The performance took place at the Alex Theater in Glendale, CA. The theater it self is a great venue. This was our first time at the ballet and It was a pleasure to have seen Serenade and La Sylphide performed by the Los Angeles Ballet. The dancers are very professional and the costumes were great.It was so impressive that my 10 yrs old nephew who is a hockey fan and missed the King's game didn't say a peep!I'm glad we had the opportunity to enrich our knowledge and cultural awareness by attending this performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHernandez
