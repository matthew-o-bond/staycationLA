50,Quaint Theater House Packs A Punch,"Found this little gem on Goldstar. Parking was not bad on Sunday night. Find a neighboring side street and walk a little. The theater was quaint and all seats were within 10 meters of the stage. Concessions, beer and wine available at a reasonable price. I'll be back for sure. Saw ""Nosferatu"". Outstanding performance by all of the cast members. This is no low grade show. Highly recommend if it's still around. Very well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffreyv148
