40,Wonderful,"A great place to view meso american art and relics.Currently, they have some Egyptian artifacts on loan from LA county. Great way to get up close to some beautiful ancient art without the crowds of a bigger museum. The place is small, but worth a visit. They also have a some current artists and a display of photos from the Chicano movement/demonstrations from the 60's. You will not need a lot of time to view the collection. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. I enjoyed my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
40,Niche Museum,"If you are a devotee of pre-Colombian artifacts and contemporary Latino art, this small museum is for you. The permanent collection is built around the donation made to the college by the late Hollywood actor Vincent Price. It is indeed rare for a California community college to have its own museum. It is compact, can be toured in 60-90 minutes and could serve as a fine teaching tool to the thousands of students in attendance at the college. I visited twice. The visiting hours were not particularly convenient. Aside from the students stationed at the reception desk and the few who provide minimal security on the upper floors, there was hardly a soul to be seen which, depending on how you look at it, could be nice or disappointing. One does not get the feeling that this museum is the pride of the college or that it is heavily frequented by its students.The museum is what it is. If one happens to be in the San Gabriel Valley and the City of Monterey Park and is interested in the mission of this museum, then it is certainly worth a visit. There is a large strip mall across the street from the museum, so parking is not a problem. But when I visited, it was not open every weekday, so check the hours of operation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shatkin90404
50,Family Vaca,What a wonderful museum with precious beautiful paintings. So much history under one roof. You can get lost in so many rooms containing Spain's ansestory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Provecho3

40,Free Admission and Good 3rd Level Exhibit,We only got to view the 3rd Level Exhibit as the rest of the museum was closed to the public due to preparations for an upcoming show. But loved the different art displayed on the floor which made for good conversation for the group,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108syj
40,Maybe the best junior college museum around,"First visit to E LA College and the Vincent Price Art Museum was great. The new campus is beautiful, and the museum was well beyond expectations. Enjoyed the Ramirez special exhibition. Free parking on weekends in the adjacent garage, and lots of restaurants around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
30,Carlos Almaraz retro,"Wide range of work from the late, great LA artist Carlos Almaraz. A surprisingly large-scale museum for being in a Junior College. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocor335
