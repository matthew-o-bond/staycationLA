50,amazing Carrousel,"Date of Visit: Sunday, Dec 15th, 2019When you are on Santa Monica Pier, be sure to visit the LOOFF Hippodrome Carousel.I love classic and historic merry-go-rounds, and the LOOFF ones are amazing. We visit these carousels as often as possible and there is a Fabulous one on Santa Monica Pier.IT is beautiful, it has amazing characters/animals, and awe inspiring craftsmanship.Take some time and appreciat this beautiful piece of history and artisty and ride the Carousel many times - chosing different animals each time.",RogueTrippers
50,An absolute must! Rare Looff Carousel right on the pier,"There are so few wooden carousels left from the golden era, 1900 - 1920. Looff was the carver whose horses are most realistic and elegant. If you are new to carousels, it will be easy to see the difference between this masterpiece and the fiberglass horses which are much more common. Look at each horse, and notice all the different and detailed trappings, all the jewels. There is a goat and a pig on the second row. Take your time enjoying each beautiful animal - you'll have plenty of time. The carvings are exquisite. You may never have another opportunity to see a Looff carousel in your lifetime.",Susan K
50,What A Surprise Find,What a great find. Rides were a reasonable price and every one left happy at this find was we explored the Santa Monica pier area.,Aussie_Tourist79
50,Featured prominently in The Sting,"Featured prominently in The Sting. Looked for Paul Newman and the friendly women, unfortunately none were in sight. Just a fascinating merry go round, unchanged, after so many years. Going strong, best visited with a hot dog on a stick.",Cavydad
50,Paris memories in Santa Monica!,"As I traveled Europe building a business with my young children, one of the fondest memories were the many merry-go rounds found in Paris! We need more of these family oriented joyful activities in our town. The Santa Monica Pier is always a joy to visit, even though my children are now in their twenties and thirties! The sight and sounds of the merry-go-round brings great memories back and it's also such a joy to watch the local children run with joy to pick their favorite colorful horse! The small roller coaster is fun for all ages, the lights and views fromfrom the Ferris Wheel are beautiful! You'll find all kinds of good food as well, Have a great time!",Lori T
40,Fun on the merry go round.,Great family fun here and a ride on the merry go round is necessary thing to do. Come back again if you can.,Douglas R
40,Classic Americana!,"The Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome was built in 1916 and you can feel the history when you walk into it. It's like going back in time! (If you've ever seen the movie ""The Sting,"" part of it was shot in this building.) The classic Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel is meticulously maintained and looks remarkable, considering it was built in 1922 (and has been operating there since 1947)! The classic PTC carousel organ has been restored to its original glory and still sounds great to this day. A ride is a very reasonable $1 for kids and $2 for adults. I took my wife on it when we were there last and she giggled like a little girl the whole time. The variety of animals (all hand-carved!) are above and beyond your typical carousel, including whales and seahorses. After a ride on the carousel, whet your whistle at the classic soda fountain ice cream stand located nearby. I'm 39, and I have a blast every time I stop by here. Even if I don't ride, I love to stand there and bask in the glory of the ""good old days"" and I find myself wishing I could go back and experience them myself.No, if you miss this, you aren't missing anything epic. You are, however, missing out on the chance to experience something truly special. If you have the time and a few extra bucks in your pocket, swing by and support this lovely bit of Americana from Yesteryear!",Jake G
50,Lowest Cost Ride in Southern California - $1 for kids!!!,"This is the cheapest ride in SoCal. $1 for kids, and $2 for adults. For a vintage carousel.The upkeep of the carousel is amazing. For first time visitors to Santa Monica, it is a must see.",jmseight
30,I don't understand the hype,"I guess this one is for history buffs as there is little else to offer in the way of attraction. My kids weren't overly interested in actually going on it, especially as Pacific Park is nearby. Worth a walk past if exploring the area but otherwise nothing special.",GlenFC
30,So so,"Only $1 for kids and $2 for adults. Beautiful old carousel. However, we were disappointed because we hadn't realised that the horses on the outside of the carousel don't go up and down - we had never come across this before and think it should have been mentioned up front, rather than on a tiny sign at the exit. And we weren't allowed to change horses, so it wasn't much fun.",Wombling_Free_7548
50,History,It is always cool to see history. The carousel is inexpensive to ride 2dollars for adults and 1 dollar for kids. It is a must do on the pier.,Tcard2013
50,Nostalgic,My wife went for a ride on the merry go round which was a nostalgic reminder of those we had when kids. For that alone it is worth a visit. I would think kids would be happy to try it out as well as us oldies,Grant N
50,Great place to take your kids. This year it was its 100 year anniversary.,Great clean entertainment. Carousal has been operating at this site since 1947. There is a rest room nearby and a Soda Fountain in the building.,ZumaCapt
50,Classic Carousel,"A nice old style Carousel next to an Old Time style Ice Cream Store. It does not get any better that this. Oh yes it does, it's on the pier at the beach and only costs $1 (kids) or $2 (adults). Kids loved it!",Larry-L0v3
50,This is Old Santa Monica and You Need to See This,"The Carousel at the Santa Monica Pier has been there for years. It sat and waited while the Pier was reborn into what it is now. At one time, it stood pretty much alone, no visitors and the Pier was little more than a beaten down arcade and a few tarot card readers.Today, the Carousel is back to its true beauty -- The horses and unicorns, the hares, and all great things to pick a seat on, all hand carved, all carefully painted, the music restored all the same as it was before I was even born many years ago.The movie the Sting was filmed here, it is rumored that movie stars lived in the upstairs ""apartments"", who knows what is true. Did Shirley Temple really ride and love the Carousel, I don't know, but I want to believe it.The thing about this Carousel, it is not just for kids, but for everyone. It has the smell of happy times, it leaves you to recall your own childhood on a great Merry Go Round. It is truly a work of art and you need to see it. You have to ride it.",elizabethlascheid
40,Not just for horses!,"This classic merry-go-round has some impressively carved animals, may of them sea creatures beautifully painted in bright colors. Why ride a horse or even a unicorn when you can hop atop a whale, seal, or seahorse instead?",dunadan
40,Cute with vintage charm,"Super cute and nostalgic and the kids loved it, we didn't have a line so we didn't have to wait. Not much else in the building so make sure you go there when the aquarium is open so you can finish up at that end of the pier and head out to the rest of the fun.",Searchin4Vacays
40,Merry Go Round,Who doesn't love a merry-go-round! This is a beautiful one with a hare and goat mixed in with all the pretty horses. This a great start to a visit of the Pier and a very affordable ride. Be a kid again and take a ride!,theheatonfamily
50,part of Santa Monica history,"fun for adults, kids & everyone I know. I always enjoy visiting the merry go round. There are great photos of the early days. ;You can rent this place for parties, too.",SMOgal
40,Part Of The Tradition Of Santa Monica,"The Looff family were famed for their Carousels and this one is an excellent example of their work. Housed in the Hippodrome building, today it is rightly, still a very popular attraction. On a busy Saturday, there were a number of family ""Carousel Parties"" taking place around the revolving central focus and it makes for a great colourful attraction. Long may it continue.",bsandrs
50,Historic carrousel on the pier,Go here with your children ... or without them and be a kid yourself again! Fun galore! The carrousel is great for a short visit when you are at the beach. It is directly on the pier and is the Background for great pictures.,Raela
40,Loved This,No sorta creepy pier is complete without a beautiful carousel. This spot is worth a visit. My kids loved it.,KamranNezami
40,So much fun for a great price,"Very reasonable prices for a great time. Carousel was featured in the Sting, which is a nice little piece of SoCal trivia.",css1983
40,Great history,"A great building housing an historic carousel (1922 I think) that is kept in wonderful condition. Even if you don't go for a ride, do stop in to admire the Carousel.",Gavin H
50,Fantastic historical carousel and don't miss the fortune teller!,"I have been coming here since my husband and I had a date here in 1998. I love to ride carousels and this is a gem! The price is quite affordable and it's great fun for the entire family!I also never miss the fortune teller in the east corner. Where else can you get your fortune told for so cheap and get a souvenir card with the lucky numbers, horoscope, etc? Kitschy, but cool!As for the rest of the pier, meh. I don't have much interest in the touristy things and other amusement rides.We love to ride our bikes up here from Marina del Rey.",Saranger
50,Classic Merry-Go-Round at Pier in SM ....,"I have been coming here for several decades & find that the kids still marvel at riding the animals on poles. Actually should be designated as a treasure, because there are not very many Classic Merry-Go-Rounds left ....",David B L
40,Classic Carousel,"We stopped by whilst at the pier, a great place to stop for some shade on a hot day. There is a beautiful carousel that we watched while we sat and rested our tired legs. I bet the kids would really like it here and it is a nice historical attraction",Marie F
40,Nice place,"This place is great to bring little kids and friends. I wouldn't say it's perfect but it's really good. It also has some history, and they haven't changed it since my first time here.",Palomared
