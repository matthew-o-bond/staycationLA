40,Cataloguing challenges in the New World,"It provides an interesting picture of the challenges of life for immigrants to the New World. Even though of course the emphasis is on the Italian experience, similar was encountered by many immigrant groups.A chronological account of life, from the entry to the country, through such matters as interactions with officialdom and institutions like banks are displayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Gem of a museum,"My wife and I learned of this museum from an article in the newspaper L’Italo-Americano some months ago. So, on a visit to downtown LA, we made a point of stopping by, and we are so happy we did. I won’t repeat the many features that other reviewers have noted, except to emphasize that there’s more to this little museum than first meets the eye. In a few words, the displays do a great job of describing the history of the Italian community in LA.I was raised in Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s and remember going to Olvera Street and learning about settlement of the Pueblo, not to mention eating tacos for the first time and hearing a mariachi band. It is wonderful to see the story of LA broadened by the IAMLA as well as the Chinese-American Museum. It is worth spending several hours in this small part of the downtown and to be reminded of the origins of this great city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hephaistos2
40,Worth the Stop,"This was our second exhibit to this small museum. It is a few steps off Olvera Street so very easy to visit during your visit to El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Park. Use the stairs (wit ha beautiful chandelier above) or the elevator as the museum is on the second floor. There is a large gallery of permanent exhibits on Italian American history, persons, and events. To the side are two smaller rooms with temporary exhibits, art the day we visited. The building itself is historically significant to the Italian-American community. The museum is free with a donation box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,visit and went on tour,"I really liked this museum. It is small and it has been beautifully redone. It is near the oldest buildings in LA.so you can walk to them before or after. China Town is very close if that gives you an idea of which area it is in. The tour was great, I liked the docent she was very enthusiastic! Also they have changing exhibits. You will learn a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonwY4076RI
50,ITALIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM,"Took my son here recently. Never been to a one-floor museum before. Had some interesting art work, and told the tale of Italians in California well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/groverm146
40,Super Cool Location. Needs to Grow.,"I had a hard time rating this one. It felt like a 3, but I have a hard time five anything less than a 4 to a free museum! I mean... it's free! So I'm making a new rule, that unless there is something really bad, I can't give a FREE museum less than 4 stars for just not being extensive enough.The building is awesome! It is a super old building with LOTS of history! It was even an old speakeasy during prohibition upstairs and you can see the door you used to knock on. Right now the museum is essentially one room. it's a beautiful room with some really nice displays... but it really needs to be larger. There is another area that was closed that it looked like they were getting ready to add another exhibit. If they open up that area, then I think that would do wonders for this museum. It just needs more. The staff was super friendly and very eager to give facts about the Italians. One was impressed at my son Rocco's name.While I wouldn't make a day trip to the area JUST for this museum, this area is CERTAINLY worth a day trip! My toddler and I literally visited 6 museums! There are small museums all around here and almost all of them are free! Start your journey with a walk down Olvera Street! Catch the Avila Adobe, maybe have lunch or a snack. Then walk across the way and visit The Chinese American Museum, the Plaza Firehouse Museum and the new Gateway to Nature (which is a nature center full of things for kids to do). Then walk across the street to La Plaza De Culturasy Artes museum. Maybe poke your head into Our Lady of Angeles Church. I'm very Atheist, but this is historic as it's literally what named and started Los Angeles. Then continue down Main street and hit up the American Tropical Historical Museum and end with the Italian American Museum! There are a few other things in there too I think I missed. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Impressive Italian American Museum,"This free-entry museum is an easy walk from Union Station across Alameda Street at the entrance to Olvera Street. It's located in the historic Italian Hall which was built in 1908 serving as a gathering place for the area's Italian community. This Interactive museum features the history and contribution of Italian Americans in SoCal and the nation. We were really impressed with the colorful Sicilian Cart Exhibit which includes two original historic carts. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to take photographs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
40,A largely forgotten chapter of L.A. history,"Tucked around the corner from Olvera Street in Los Angeles, this very informative free-admission museum details the history of Italian-Americans in Los Angeles in particular and Italian-Americans in the U.S. in general. There are images projected on glass walls, display cases with various artifacts including a Grammy from Frank Zappa, interactive touchscreens, photographs and artwork. At first glance, there doesn't appear to be much to check out but on closer inspection, you will find enough to keep you there an easy hour. You leave the museum realizing that this area was much more than just Chinatown and Olvera Street. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandLovinTwosome
40,A must-see for Italian-Americans,"My family came through Ellis Island and briefly lived in the southern US, so a lot of the history, including the horrific discrimination they suffered was all so well documented. The success and triumphs of the Italian immigrants were also captured and highlighted and the Italian Hall in general is a beautiful space. I enjoyed the exhibits very much. The art was just okay (it's subjective). I thought the people working there were very kind, but had no knowledge of the history of that neighborhood in general (which is very rich in history) which I thought was a shame. I left there very moved and was so glad I took the time to go. I respect my family and all of the immigrants who come here in hopes of bettering themselves and being able to provide a better life for their family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thorne4303
40,Interesting slice of Los Angeles history,"We saw the entrance to this museum as we were headed to Olvera Street. There is a mosaic entryway that states ""Italian Hall"" and the museum is upstairs. I was frustrated that photography was not allowed in the museum especially since they do not sell postcards or anything. The museum is free and we learned a lot about Little Italy in Los Angeles in the early 1900s. This museum has great interactive exhibits. Since my dad's family is Italian we will return to show my sister this museum and I will tell my Italian relatives about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnat666
40,Small but Historic,"This museum opened a few weeks before this writing, although its history goes back over 100 years. The Italian Hall was built in 1908 when it was the center of the Italian community. As the Italian community shifted to other parts of town in the 1950, the building fell into disuse. Today it is a new museum with space to grow celebrating some of the Italians who helped develop Los Angeles and celebrities such as Lady Gaga. The museum is on the second floor accessible by elevator or a stair crowned with a beautiful sculptural glass light fixture. The entrance doe not face Olvera Street but is just around the other side on Main Street. Personal photography is not allowed. Admission by donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
