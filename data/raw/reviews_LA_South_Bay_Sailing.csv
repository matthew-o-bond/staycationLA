50,Terrific Experience!,"Staying in the hotel across the street and wanted to take a trip on the oceanWhat a terrific experience! Our Captain, Bryan did an amazing job giving us a smooth sail in choppy waters. He was respectful and my kids loved him. Have never been sailing before but we will be back, great value too. Kudos to Bryan and South Bay Sailing.",USAF78
50,ASA 101 Class,"I completed ASA101 with Captain Mike, Allie, and Andy, all of which were very knowledgeable and friendly. Each had a unique teaching style and approach to sailing, which exposed me to different strategies and sailing conditions. What I valued the most is the dedication of the sailing and the management team in making sure I understand how to navigate the waters instead of just memorizing names for the test. Being on the water is critical for developing the intuition. Highly recommended.",Tatyana D
50,Sunset Sail and Wine,"We originally got a Groupon for this activity to do with a group of friends. However we were able to experience it as a couple and was beyond our expectations. The captain was very informative and gave a smooth ride. We were able to bring our own wine and snacks to enjoy while enjoying the Sunset. We were worried about getting “sea sick” and that never happened with our professional captain. He even allowed us to drive the sail boat for a little which was a great additional experience moment. Would definitely recommend for all families, friends and couples. A great activity for all to enjoy on a nice sunny day.",Two Guyz One World
50,Birthday sail,Second trip. Had a wonderful time.Kevin was a great captain.Our birthday girl sailed much of the time.,ChristopherA239
50,Fun cruising the bay for a few hours!,"Mike our skipper took us on a two hour trip around Santa Monica Bay departing from Redondo Beach Marina. We were all 1st timers to pure sailing (no power). We had great weather, light winds, very relaxing trip. We stayed between Manhattan beach pier and Palos Verdes area. Saw some sea lions on the R10 buoy and a sea lion eating a fish in the open sea. Highly recommend. We brought our own food and drink.Definitely would do again.",Eric C
50,Great Sailing iin Redonbdo Beach,"Our first time sailing with another family. Really enjoyed the experience. Great price, wonderful staff. Would do it again.",Ninon P
50,Pier,Love strolling on the pier and the boardwalk and eating at old tonys the Alaskan king crab is great and the fish is very good,lesleeeanes
50,Sailing adventure,"We decided to try sailing on a random Saturday. What a fun day on the water, we did the first time instructional lesson, we were all given the opportunity to sail the boat, maintain the sail and 3 other jobs (sorry already forgot the technical terms). Beautiful day on the water and our skipper Mike was awesome. Mike was great with the entire crew, explaining everything we need to do to sail a boat and patient and kind.We will be signing up for more lessons, such a cool experience and the company was super easy to work with and responsive to my emails and questions.",Patty D
50,sunset cruise,"i reserved a date, and had to reschedule multiple times. they were extremely accomodating and the sail itself was wonderful. exactly what we all hoped it would be. we even learned some of the basics of sailing and got a chance to sail the boat. i highly recommend sb sailing.",Lois S
50,Great Fun and a Beautiful Relaxing Sail,Had friends in town and decided to head to the pier for a sail. I'd never been sailing with this company -- but we had a wonderful time with our friendly captain and friends. Intimate and leisurely and the perfect way to end the day with a little jaunt out on the water at sunset.,Oceangirl9999
50,Relaxing,"This was a fun, relaxing experience. Our skipper, Sarah, was very friendly and knowledgeable. It turned out to be very educational as she discussed many points about sailing and let us steer the boat. I loved it and would return.",Kim P
50,Basic Sailing Lessons,"Worked w/ Mike and Wes on getting my basic certs for sailing, and worker out beautifully! Had a blasts, feel confident in my sailing abilities, and they are super affordable and hospitable. Not to mention very friendly and patient...wished I could have taken these guys out for a drink. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in learning how to sail, or if just interested in catching some sun on the waves w/ a cold one and good company!",Erick M
40,Great afternoon on the water with Steve!,It was a beautiful day and we were able to bring drinks and snacks onboard. We saw sea lions and dolphins. A good value.,Lori W
40,Sailing on the Harbor,"My husband and I used to sail at least once per month on these boats, and it was wonderful. We always enjoyed it and had a wonderful time. It was expensive overall, but only because private sailing is an expensive sport, not that their fees in particular are expensive. If you want to enjoy the summer, at the harbor, this is an excellent way to spend the day, but be sure not to drink on board, and have experienced sailors piloting the boat, because water and nature are never to be trusted or taken for granted. Another good idea for preparation is to take the US Coast Guard classes.",CoachPiaLyotier
50,Beautiful Sailing on The Water,We had a 1 hour sail on the water. I was beautiful! Our Capitan was wonderful and knowledgeable. It was truly one of the highlights of our trip to California. Thank you South Bay for a wonderful memory!,Mark S
50,Great day of sailing,"Six of us went on a 90 sail off the coast of Redondo Beach. David, our captain did a great job and made our time on board quite enjoyable. Plus, the weather was great. Highly recommend. Lots of dining choices within walking distance.",Chuck Z
50,Friendly and Knowledgeable Crew,"My husband and I took our three grandchildren on a first Sunday of the month sail. We walked up, the kids put on lifejackets, and we stepped on a boat. Everyone was helpful, and the young woman who took us out on the water was friendly and knowledgeable about sailing. She was patient with my husband who always has a lot of questions. We headed out towards Palos Verdes. The sail took about an hour. When we were done sailing, we were invited to a BBQ.If you're in Redondo Beach on the first Sunday of the month, check out South Bay Sailing at the marina. It's a great way to see Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes from the water. I believe we paid $100. It was well worth it.",cherold598
50,Great Time,"We took our family for a 90 minute cruise on our son's birthday and had a wonderful time. RC was our captain and he was great. We happened upon a pod of dolphins and RC got us ""up close and very personal."" We sailed among them for about 10-15 minutes. It was amazing. Also loved watching the seals and seagulls fighting over fish. We used a Groupon but we'd happily have paid full price for such a amazing experience.",Leslie B
50,Great experience at sea,"We were a large party, so got the 40ft boat to go out withThe boat was beautiful, the crew - professional and corteousWe also had a lot of luck that day and had many sightings of whales, dolphins and seals, but I suspect that without the professionalism of Wes and his crew in knowing where to go and how to handle the encounters many of those opportunities would have been missed",Yotam_Givon
50,Grand Adventure,"Top notch, wonderful experience!!! More wind would of been great but that was out of all our controll.... Still we learned a lot and had a grand time!!! Thank you",Ann H
50,Great sail,"In laws were in town and we wanted something fun to do. The boat was very nice and although there was very little wind, we had a great tour around Redondo Beach. Got a great deal on Groupon. $65 for one hour. Very well worth it. The boat could have used a motor though, just in case the wind died.",Lynda P
50,"Great team, friendly, fun, and helpful!","I utilized South Bay Sailing for a team building activity recently, and it was a blast! We chartered two sail boats for 90 minutes to see the gorgeous South Bay, leaving out of Redondo Beach Marina. The crew was very professional and friendly, and taught us a few things about sailing. Five out of five, will definitely be recommending this to friends and family!",Daniel K
50,"Excellent captain, gorgeous scenery and a great value!","I purchased a 90 minute sale on Groupon and was pleasantly surprised by the professional captain, the cleanliness of the boat, and the overall amazing experience at such a great value. I highly recommend South Bay sailing as their staff and captains have all been first class.",Sevilla2013
50,Great trip enjoyed by all,We took out a group aged 87 to 11 and everyone had a great time. We sailed up to Marina del Rey for lunch and back. Wes is a great Captain and Audrey was amazing in helping us organize everything.,ShelleyAnne2014

50,Wonderful Sailing Experience,South Bay Sailing has an amazing team of instructors that make your sailing experience unforgettable. My 14 year old daughter has done 3 sessions of the summer camp and was hooked from the first day. The instructors made learning fun and they could not be more patient with kids. Besides sailing the kids were able to paddleboard and kayak which is another wonderful addition to what South Bay Sailing has to offer. If your sailing in Redondo I highly recommend South Bay Sailing.,Courtney O
40,great experience,"great service from reservations til the end of sail. very accessible parking, right next to the dock. Dave, nice guy! food and booze allowed. expect to get splashed here and there. we'd definitely do it again.",Marie Stephanie B
50,Beyond perfection,"From the moment I contacted them to the moment we returned to the dick it was perfect. They are very knowledgable,kind and patient with all the questions my company from Mississippi had. They left with unforgettable memories and so did I!!!",Azangel777
50,Fun time,Skipper friendly and knowledgeable. Parking $4 cash with validation. Morning sailing is better if you are prone to getting seasick with choppy waters. Food allowed onboard. Gratuity appreciated.,Bmbchll
50,A must while in the area,"We were so fortunate to have a tremendous skipper, Dave, who grew up in the area of Redondo Beach and could explain all the beautiful surroundings out and about for 90 minutes. We had a great sunset to boot.",needtogetaway7
50,Sunday Sailing,"It sure is nice living in SoCal. I went sailing in early October with three friends and it was perfect. We bought a groupon for a 90 minutes byob sailing trip and everything about the experience was perfect. It was very easy to make a reservation, once we got there we were helped immediately and out sailing. Parking is cheap, $2 after validation. We brought our own snacks and beer which were a little hard to enjoy since the water was so choppy. I took two dramamine and I'm glad I did because it was a rough ride and the water was a bit choppy. Also, I would recommend bringing some extra clothes and wear sandals because you can get a bit wet. You won't get soaked but you can get splashed pretty good and end up with wet shorts like my fiance. It was definitely a nice way to spend a pretty sunny sunday!",daschopf
50,Got more then expected well worth the price,"Everyone is friendly and very helpful. David was our captin and he made the experience so great. We caught glimpse of a whale in the far distance, and David did not hesitate to take us in closer to catch the whale up close. So not only did I get a amazing sail, but I got to whale watch too!! I will be doing this again!!",TanicaSeals
50,Awesome Experience,"This is my second time sailing with South Bay Sailing. Audrey was amazing and super friendly. We actually got to see very beautiful sunset while we were sailing. She was very prompt at making our reservation. If you are looking for something different, try sailing!",CHill101010
50,Fantastic!,"Wonderful, we went with Audrey and had an amazing time! Smooth sailing and great company. Audrey was super knowledgeable about sailing and made us feel very comfortable (all of us had never been on a sailboat before, so this was an adventure). The weather was perfect! Very professional staff.",Jen C
50,Good fun,"I definitely recommend this place. Although my body didn't enjoy the ride and I became sea sick, the experience was still great. Great place to go!",brettwatts0620
50,Amazing,This is my second time doing it. Y just perfect service on time and the sunset the best time. I had a great time on my bday . Thank you again,Mónica A
50,A little day tripper,"What a wonderful experience we all had. We took the kiddos on a sailboat ride and they had a blast. Our captain Audrey was fabulous and very accommodating. It was time for lunch so we were able to bring lunch and enjoyed a picnic aboard the sailboat. Audrey was ready with answers as the kids ask questions one behind the other. It was a beautiful day and relaxing sail. The kids enjoyed going thru the harbor area and looking at the boats. Our afternoon was complete with smiles on their faces, wind in their hair and splash request.",Sbible
50,Two hour pleasure trip,"We wanted a relaxing sailing trip. It was nice and easy to book. That morning we showed up at the marina, signed a release and we were off. Mike was knowledgable about the craft and sailing. He was informative, pleasant, and professional. It was a beautiful day, smooth sailing, we enjoyed the landscape and various animals like the sea lions.",tina v
30,Choppy,The BYOB sail tour was ok. We've been on different sailboats and have been able to sail out and relax in the ocean but this was a little different. We sailed at fast pace/speed the whole entire ride with no breaks to actually relax and chill. The day was very windy so going at high speed on a small sailboat was veryyyyyy choppy and a few of us felt sick. The 'captain' was very nice and friendly and made us feel comfortable but if i had to give advice I would say to go out halfway maybe and slow down so people can actually enjoy their time and get their bearings. We brought some wine and beer and snacks and weren't really able to enjoy them as most of the time the boat was so tipped to one side and we were rocking and hitting the waves the whole time.,Martyna D
50,Highly Recommended - One of Our Favorite Beach Activities!,"What a great way to see LA's scenic beaches & harbors! South Bay Sailing provides a fantastic experience. They are safe, friendly, reliable, & professional. I've used them for individual and group sails on numerous occasions and brought my friends & family who've all loved sailing with them. As others mentioned, they offer very affordable rates, safe atmosphere, & a fun day out on the water. For the last two years, I joined their 4th of July 90-minute sailing special + dockside barbecue. My first year I brought my boyfriend & we had such a great time that we returned this last year with a group of eight friends. Over the weekend, we availed of their Groupon BYOB Sunset Sail. Our sail time coincided with the Jimmy Buffet concert in Hermosa Beach and our skipper (Captain Mike!) made sure we sailed by to hear the music & see the event. Very cool! South Bay Sailing is great about incorporating requests and creating the perfect sailing experience. Finally, their location right next to the Redondo Beach pier is great for pre- or post- sail dinner, drinks, entertainment, etc. Also, big thanks to Audrey in administration and Captain Mike for making every booking seamless. Looking forward to the next time!",lorified
50,"So much fun, we loved it!","We booked a 90 min BYOB cruise and from start to finish, including the initial booking process, it was such a great experience! Our skipper, Camille, was knowledgeable and personable, answering our many questions about sailing. We had a wonderful time out on the water and can't wait to go out again! We have already told friends about gow much fun we had.",Danipoli23
50,Great time sailing,"We did the 90 minute sailing lesson for two on their J80 which is an 8 meter sailboat. Had a great time and our instructor Dave was nice. We also went to the Sunday bbq which is held the first Sunday of every month and that was great too. We got to sail on the J80 and Farr40 which is a high performance 40 ft racing sailboat. Definitely recommend this outfit for anyone looking to get out on the water or take lessons to gain an ASA Sailing certification. Once you are certified you can rent the J80's as well, or you can always go out on a charter sail where they captain the boat and you just enjoy the ride.",Joel S
50,First time sailing,"My Dad was visiting from Missouri, neither of us had been out on a sailboat, was kind of nervous, but it was fabulous! Great price, friendly service, had a wonderful time. Highly recommend.",sandeebch
50,Perfect.,"The customer service, the sail, everything was perfect. We were late for our trip and they patiently waited for us.",J W
40,Discovery Sailing,Emma is awesome. Very knowledgeable for such a young lady. I will highly recommend this trip to all my friends.,Alfonso_G914
50,Fun!,"Had a great time with family. Love the quiet journey sailing allows, no loud motor or bothersome fumes. Just the boat, wind, and company to enjoy the relaxing ride. Our skipper was Emma and was very friendly.Highly recommend it!",Rudel S
