40,A Great Message,I'll admit I usually purchase cheap massages that are okay but my boyfriend gifted me this massage for Christmas and it was amazing. My masseuse was wonderful and she put me totally at ease and the entire time I was relaxed and enjoying it. I like massages that I can feel. If they're too soft it feels like nothing to me so she was the perfect balance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annelytical
