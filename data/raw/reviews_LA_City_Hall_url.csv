40,Observation Deck,"Go during business hours for an exclusive view of LA from up high. It's free and about 200 feet up. You can get a unique view of the East Side of Downtown. I know it's not as high as the observation deck of the US Bank, but that thing costs like 40 dollars. Anyways, it's an easy thing to do if you have the day off and are in downtown for some reason.",Joshadachi

One thing that is missing are the homeless people sleeping on its steps in the middle of the night.",Creeping_Death_LA

50,THE VIEW IS AWESOME,"If you are in DTLA, walk to the City Hall and take the time to see all of the past mayors of the city. Their portraits are near the top level. Also, the 3rd floor has magnificent ceilings and architecture. The observation deck sees all the areas for miles on a clear day. You can see the baseball stadium, train station, the skyscrapers and they are labeled so you know what you're seeing. Definitely a great place to visit. Sadly, there are many homeless encampments in the area. Across the street see the lovely branches on a post of Los Angeles's sister cities around the world.As you exit look for the Olympic torch and the lovely art outside the building with the history of the city.",Hildmat

Completed in 1928 it held the record for the city’s highest building for many years.It was fascinating to learn that sand from each of California’s 58 states was used in some of the building material.During our LA visit we saw it most days and on each occasion it appeared spectacular, gleaming and attractive.",permia

The best view of the building is from the promenade at Grand Park.However, the real attraction are the views from the 27th floor observatory. It's free, but you need to go through security and get an LAPD Visitor's Pass. Once up top you can walk around the entire outer side and see the city from all angles.

50,Great Views for Free,"City Hall is an iconic building in Los Angeles. The overlook on the 3rd level is beautiful, but the open observation deck on the 27th floor is well worth it as you can walk outside and have a 360 degree view of the city. Little Tokyo is a couple blocks east, while Olvera Street (origins of the city) is to the north. The famed Broad Art museum is a few blocks west, so you can spend a full day that won’t cost too much. There is a homeless problem as with other big cities, so just stay clear and be vigilant. Stay west of Los Angeles Street. Anything east gets a little dicey and the heart of skid row is near 5th and San Pedro.",WillysWorld
50,Great Observation Deck on the 27th Floor with views of the City of LA,"There are many interesting aspects of Los Angeles City Hall, but the best experience is the Observation Deck located on the 27th Floor of the City Hall Tower. From there, you can experience the great views from all four sides. It may not be as high as the new skyscapers in the main part of downtown LA to the southwest, but the view is still magnificent. On a clear day, you can look north and see Dodger Stadium, and the majestic San Gabriel Mountain. Looking east towards the Los Angeles River, you can see towards the San Gabriel Valley. Looking south you see downtown and downs towards the Pacific Ocean. Looking west, you have a view of Grand Park and the LA Civic Center towards the Music Center and the LA Department of Water & Power Building, which is a landmark building. Best of all, it's free. You just need to go through security and take a couple of elevators up to the 26th floor and walk up to the 27th floor. It is open during business hours.",geotech522

50,FREE views of the city,"If you're anything like my friend and I, and you just don't feel like paying at least $25 for entrance at the OUE Skyspace, then Los Angeles City Hall is perfect for you. About a 10 minute walk from The Broad, LA City Hall offers beautiful views of downtown Los Angeles. And the best part? It's free. Now I know there are quite a few places in LA where you can enjoy beautifully unobstructed AND free views of LA; however, if you're ever around, LA City Hall is worth a visit.First things first: keep in mind that entrance for the observation deck is on Main Street. Once you enter the building, you'll have to get a visitor's pass (quick and easy) and then take an elevator to the 22nd floor, ad then another one to the 27th floor.

And no stairs to climb! Great. Thanks City Hall.,MaddoDB
50,Beautiful Architecture and Great Views!,I haven't had the chance to visit the observation deck of this really cool Art Deco building before since it's only open while I'm at work so I took some paid time off for the holidays and decided to finally check this out. The entrance is on Main Street where you go through a metal detector and get a visitor sticker letting the guard know you're going to the observation deck. You go through two elevators to get to the top and walk up a set of stairs that takes you to this large room with doors on the side; from there you can get multiple views of Downtown to enjoy!I was able to see all the way towards the Hollywood Sign and Griffith Observatory so the smog wasn't too bad out there today. When you're done checking out the views you can visit the third floor which has the main rotunda and some amazing Roman/Byzantine style architecture. There were holiday decorations including a menorah and Christmas tree at the time I visited so that was nice. I definitely recommend a visit here if you get the chance!,Colby S

Best of all, it's free!",Victor N

Almost demolished after the Northridge Earthquake, the building was retrofitted instead. For many decades, it was the tallest building in downtown L.A. If you have time, walk through the lobby area of the building and check out the Observation Deck in City Hall, which gives you a 360 degree view of downtown L.A. from the 27th story.

40,"Beautiful building, great views","If, like us, you are a fan of imposing public buildings designed in the Art Deco style containing lots of inspiring quotes about civic duty and the higher aspirations of the body politic, I recommend a visit to Los Angeles City Hall. During normal business hours the public is welcome to come in and after passing through security and receiving a visitor's badge you can view the rotunda, which is impressive and beautifully tiled; take an elevator to the third floor, which has lovely interior architecture and houses a rotating display of gifts given to the city from various foreign entities and dignitaries; and finally take two elevators and a flight of steps to the observation deck on the 28th floor. This affords you a 360-degree view of the City of Angels from an unusual viewpoint, with helpful signage so you can identify what you're seeing. The room at the top of the building (from which you access the deck) is also impressive, with tall windows on all sides and the aforementioned inspirational quotes on all four walls. It appears to be used for public or private ceremonies; the day we visited, they had just finished an investiture ceremony for newly minted civil engineers. Especially since it's all free, this visit is well worth the hour or so it takes to see it all.",Stefaniya

The observation deck is open Monday - Friday during regular business hours and there is no admission. It is a little confusing finding the entrance because visitors can only enter on Main Street. One needs a photo ID to enter and then first take an express elevator to the 22nd floor. On the 22nd floor take another elevator the 26th floor. When you reach the 26th floor walk up one flight where it is marked the Mayor Tom Bradley Room",springpa
50,Best Bang for the Buck,Don’t miss this. There is an observation deck with great views of the city.

50,Great views and architecture,"Take the express elevator to the 22nd floor, then the next elevator to the 26th for incredible 36* views of LA with legend boards to identify the landmarks. Then descend to the 3rd floor to admire the ceiling and chandelier before you go.",rdef2015
50,A 'Must See' place in Los angeles,It's a beautiful building and a place that everyone living in or visiting Los Angeles should see. The interior architecture is fascinating and a (free) trip to the observation deck will give you a great view of LA,Pat B
40,"Think LA, Think City Hall",If a movie or TV show wants you to know that a scene is in LA then they'll show the City Hall. I didn't actually know you could go in the place but we visited on a Saturday morning and it didn't look open. Nevertheless there were lots of photo opportunities from all angles (and from far off before we got here).There was a small grassy area at one side which might be nice at some times but was full of homeless on this Saturday.,newspapertaxi
50,The best view in LA,I was happy to discover this free spot during my trip. All you need to do is registrer at the main desk and take the elevator up to the 22nd floor. Then take a second elevator to the 26th and voilà you can admire a 360 view of LA!,Pascale A
50,Hanging out with Joe Friday,"It's completely free, great views of Los Angeles, and offers many opportunities for photography. For those old enough to remember the Dragnet tv programs this is the building featured at the opening of each show. This is why my husband and I wanted to come here. You'll want to be sure to bring your camera for the views from the 27th floor and for taking silly photos of one another in the Mayor Tom Bradley Room. We highly recommend this attraction.",Ellen24019
40,LA As Seen On TV,"For everyone who has seen the LA on countless TV shows and in movies, checking out first hand is a must. Totally worth a visit and it is close to the Grand Central Market. Worthwhile.",coachee1313
40,Classic LA Historic Landmark,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles when City Hall was the tallest building in downtown. I finally went to see it as a tourist.The park around City Hall has huge trees with massive trunks. The lobby isn't very impressive, but the security to get inside is.Tip: Don't bring anything remotely considered a weapon (including small pocket knives) or they will be confiscated.The observation deck is simply excellent. It is free, somewhat confining, but offers panoramic views in all directions. It is worth going to City Hall just to see the observation deck. If you are anywhere near City Hall, I highly recommend stopping in.",Mohsman
40,An L.A. icon,"Because it wasn't a perfectly clear day, we decided to take the advise of others and go up to the 27th floor observation area for free. Really nice views of the city. The 26th floor has a very nice display of all the photos of all the mayors of L.A. There were no crowds, so we were not battling access to the views with others. We will visit the Oue Skyspace (higher and requires a fee) only on perfectly clear day.",Greg L
40,Simbol of L.A.,"This building, symbol of Los Angeles, dominates the downtown area. It is home of the mayor and definitely in the endless list of things to see in this huge city. Dating back almost 100 years ago, it is worth making a stop and going up to the viewing deck so that you can enjoy seeing the entire downtown area. If you can find the time, and you love good views, enjoy it.",Travelcooking
50,What a view!,"In New York you pay to go up the Rockefeller Centre or Empire State to get the kind of views you can get from the top of LA City Hall for free. 3 different elevators take you to floor 27 where you can walk all the way round to get a 360 degree view out over the city & there are information boards telling you what you are seeing. There's parking at only $1 an hour for the first 2 hours at 101 N Judge Aiso St, CA 90012 which is only a couple of blocks away.",Sarah E
50,An excellent way to have an aerial view of Los Angeles for free,"We had a couple of hours of free time on our whistle stop trip to LA. We wandered up to City Hall from our hotel and spent a great hour viewing the city from the top of the building. The lifts up are very interesting art deco designs. The views were great, despite the low cloud on the day we visited, and it didn't cost us a penny!! I would thoroughly recommend it if you are staying in the Downtown area. Although there are lifts most of the way to the top, the final part to the outside viewing area was up a staircase, so it is not accessible to anyone in a wheelchair.",Alick B
40,Los Angeles from sky view,"The old City Hall was featured in many movies and TV series. The main hall and the observation tower is open for public every working day. To get to the top, visitors need to change the elevators 3 times (the last one is one floor to the observation deck. Visitors can view gifts from different places around the world and to see the work of art at the dome. Up on the observation deck, visitors can walk around to see different sides of Los Angeles from here. On a good day, visitor might witness a shooting of movies or TV series. A must see for out of town and locals.",Prawet J
40,Dragnet,"This old TV show fixture is a worthy stop for an LA visit. Main reason, you get to see how strange the city is layed out and also get to peg a few stops. You can see the Hollywood sign, Chavez Ravine, and the Griffith Observatory. Great photo stop. When it's clear you can see the ocean from the observation deck-it's the only reason to visit!",Robert B
50,Free view of LA,"A nice free way to get a nice panoramic view of LA. Go through security on the Main St side of the building and the the elevator. We walked from the 22nd floor not realizing you can also take the elevator from the 22nd to the 26th floor and walk one flight to the 37th floor. Although it's not the tallest building in LA any more, it still provides great views of the city.",J L
40,Centre of LA,This imposing structure is best viewed from the adjacent parklands. I thoght the building to be quite attractive. We did not go inside as it was a Sunday when we were there but I am told there are good views from an upper floor.,228Kevin
40,Free view of the City of Los Angeles,"After going through a security check you can enter an elevagor with stylish decorations that takes you up to the observation deck. There is a free access to it (unlike other tall buildings in other major cities), which is somehow surprising, but nevertheless good for us visitors. You also get to see the conference room with some interesting quotes about government and democracy, where the mayor keeps his speeches and press conferences.",Ula T
20,There are plenty of places to see the City. This is Boring,"It is City Hall and who cares--it has one thing going for it, you can take an elevator to the top and see a great view of the City. It is free, but you paid to park. You will ask yourself why.Locals never go here. Unless we are attending a protest or have business there, we simply don't go. There is nothing around there that is fun, there is not a great place to eat right near by. What there is an elevator to take you to a look out for the City.Go to Griffith Park for that.",elizabethlascheid
40,Free access to a fantastic view of LA,"After clearing security, you ride the elevator to an upper floor. From there, take a second elevator to the top and walk up one more floor to the observation level where you can go outside for a 360 panorama of downtown Los Angeles. Many buildings and sites are labeled on the maps facing each direction. Definitely worth the elevator ride to see the area. The building itself is featured in many movies too.",rick19348
40,Entrance is on 200 N. Main St.!,"Take photos on the Spring St. side of the building or Grand Park (park right in front of City Hall) but public entrance is on the other side, 200 N. Main St. After you pass security and get your badge, you can go up to the 3rd floor where you can check out the rotunda, City Council, and a few interesting historical artifacts collected by the City. Tours are available, but the time I did tour the building it was a private tour. This building has beautiful architecture and design, also seen on the 4th floor where City Council offices are located if I remember correctly. Take the elevator to the 26th floor, leading you to another smaller elevator that takes you to the top. You can walk around and see portraits of past LA Mayors or take the stairs up to Tom Bradley Tower (or the elevator all the way) and check out the views of downtown and surrounding LA.",adrenalinejunkie007
50,Excellent FREE view of the DTLA skyline,"Free observatory deck that offers an excellent view of the city!A hidden gem of the city, LA City Hall actually offers a great skyview of the city in all directions that goes as far out as Catalina Island on a clear day.It's best to enter through Main Street. You do have to go through metal detectors (think airport) and show a valid ID (e.g., driver's license) per party for record. After that, follow the instruction to take the express elevator up to the 22nd floor and then switch over to another set of elevator that'll take you to the top.I learned a lot about the mayors of the city as their portrait is lined across the hallways with little descriptions of their era and accomplishments. Ever wonder why so many structures are named Tom Bradley in LA? I didn't even know he was a mayor here at one time!Compared to the 1000 plus feet of OUE Skyspace, the less than 460 feet tall city hall may sound unimpressive. But it's a great way to get a great view of the city without shelling out $25 per person.If it wasn't for the limited hours (8AM to 5PM Monday through Friday (no night view!) and occasional unannounced closure due to official events), LA City Hall would be somewhere I visit more regularly to get a great view of the Downtown LA!",SavorLA
50,Best Deal in Town!,"FREE! Yes, really. You do have to have your bag scanned, and get a visitor's badge, but this building is a true Los Angeles treasure. Built in the late 1920s, it contains amazing art nouveau details, in the elevators and particularly in the third floor. Go to the top floor where you can enjoy magnificent views of the city from all four directions. Best time is early morning when the air is likely to be more clear. If you're lucky you can see the San Gabriel mountains and even Catalina Island, plus all the city buildings which are identified from each viewpoint. A really great way to kick off your visit to the city of Los Angeles.",Organistagracia
10,Police with no compassion,"Don't get me wrong, I always write good reviews but I had a horrible experience.I was a backpacker with a huge 70L bag on my pack. Down the very bottom were a pain of clippers and scissors.There was a security check. At first they told me I couldn't get in because if the scissors. But they didn't mention the clippers. They didn't let you take them out in the building so I had to cross a block away to dig all the way down my bag to take the scissors out of my first aid kit. I went back and gave them the scissors but they said they couldn't take any personal belongings. So I went back to the park and hid them in the bushes.I then went back and now they say that there is also a pair of clippers that couldnt let be in.Why they didn't they tell me that the first time round?!I was just fed up at this point and left. To further add there were a bunch of protesters outside the city hall protesting against the recent slaughters of African Americans.",James T
50,Great view for free,"My friend and I were looking for a place to get a Birdseye view of Los Angeles. We had no idea that City Hall has a free observation deck. All you have to do is clear the security check and then elevators up to the top. If it weren't for the smog it would have been perfect. However, I'm not complaining. It was a great time.",Rico H
50,Still a big favourite,"This is a great free place to get a bird's eye view over LA, and is a beauty in itself - so evocative of an earlier era.The first time I saw City Hall was in 1979, whizzing past on the freeway - probably on my way to or from Disneyland I suspect. It seemed landlocked and elusively unobtainable. It also wasn't the 'done thing' to visit Downtown LA - the era of ""there is no there there.""How times have changed. Downtown is a vibrant place to be, and City Hall is a jewel.Go to the public entrance on Spring St, present some photo ID to get a pass. Take the elevator to Floor 22, change to Floor 26. Up some stairs and into the Tom Bradley room (where it seems press conferences may occur), and out the doors onto to balcony for great views.Many Angelinos don't know about this place, and if they did it possibly would be too crowded for enjoyment!",Arncliffegirl

50,Famous downtown building,"Lovely clean white towering building, stealing the landscape of downtown LA. Made famous in loads of TV shows & films, beautiful surroundings and a great shot of its reflection to be seen in the nearby LAPD building.",TeamWard
40,Great Backdrop for Photos,"If you want to visit City Hall for photos, the best day to go is Sunday, when there are far less people around. You won't be able to get inside, though, as it's only open to the public during week days. The best spots for photos are in front of the building and the right side of the building which has trees. Be aware that you may see some transients sleeping on the grounds, but they're harmless and we stayed away from them. There is a new park across the street from City Hall called Grand Park. It's very nice, and has some great perspectives for viewing City Hall as well as other buildings downtown. It is in walking distance to Disney, which is open on Sundays.",cynsha
30,"Beautiful and picturesque, not safe area at night","During the daytime, the park and CH area is great fun and well worth your time. At night, it still looks captivating and lit up for nice pictures...but I recommend avoiding the temptation to stroll for night pictures. There was zero police presence when I walked the area at night, and there were a LOT of questionable activities and sketchy people in the vicinity.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,A fun free activity!!,"This is a really fun thing to do when in downtown LA and it's free! We accidentally came upon this great place whilst spending some time with our grand daughter who was playing in Grand Park (another great free activity for kids).You enter through Main St, go through security and ask for entry to the observation deck. You will need some id then you're given a visitor pass and away you go up to the 26th floor to get some of the best views across LA which are identified through information boards - we really enjoyed our visit and would recommend you give it a go.",Julie J

40,Great service by LA City Administration,"One of the best "" things to do"" in LA for free, no tickets at all. The LAPD manages the entry/security. The top deck view of LA, almost 360 degree is awesome , if you are lucky to have a clear sky day. Photography through the transparent glass/ shield doesn't come out well as the glass/shield was not clean. Overall, a visit worth its time.",YatriForever
50,Great views of the city,"We enjoyed great views of the city from the observation deck (if you have a fear of heights, you can stay close to the back wall). We were blessed with a clear day, able to see some of the beautiful parks, a few of which we decided to walk through after leaving City Hall.",Alicia C
30,Another iconic location..,We visited Union Station the same day that we visited City Hall. The lobby interior is gorgeous. We did not go on a tour but there are docents so I assume that they offer them. We did go up to the top. Great view. Large space which would make a great event place.,IluvHoratio

The history behind the building is pretty cool, and I didn't take it, but from what I hear the guided tour offered is pretty nice.

50,Views From the Mountain to the Sea,"Los Angeles is a big place, and it's impossible to see it all. A quick walk from the Civic Center Metro station (past the LA Times Lobby--another not to be missed stop) is Los Angeles' iconic city hall. Visible from freeways and recognizable from movies and TV, few know that the 28th floor holds an observation tower that allows views of Catalina, the Hollywood sign & Griffith Park Observatory, the Music Center and much more. Visitors will pass through a metal detector and show ID, but it's two elevator rides up (the first one is exquisite) and then a walk up a flight of stairs to the observation deck. For folks from LA, the portraits of the mayors provide a pretty cool history lesson (and a lesson on the history of facial hair trends). The only downside is the deck is only open M-F, 8-5, but for weekday visits, this is not to be missed.",halobb
50,An unusual find,"The exterior of City hall in Los Angeles is probably known to most persons in my generation as the ""Daily Planet Building"" from the original superman TV series in the 1950s. The inside of the building and all of its public spaces are open to the public but unless you have a guided tour you will be missing a lot of information. Docent tours are given for free by a dedicated group of volunteers who are chock full of LA history and will give you tons of useful information about the history and geography of Los Angeles as well as that of City Hall itself. These are scheduled only by going to the website at city hall and then only mornings from 9AM-12 PM. The tours include the public spaces and their histories and in our case we attended a portion of a city council meeting--which are open to the public and invite public comment--and are televised locally. The tour concludes with a visit to the Tom Bradley room on the top of the building and guided 360 degree views of the city from the four directional balconies outside. On a clear day (which we were fortunate enough to have), one can see as far as the channel islands and Catalina island to the west and the entire San Bernadino mountains to the Northeast---considerably more than the Los Angeles Basin. The visit would be worth a hefty admission price but it is free. Little Tokyo and great cuisine as well as the American Japanese Museum and historic and beautiful Union Station are just a few blocks walk away.",Michael K

I could sit there and watch to horizon forever.

40,There is an observation deck! Wow!,"I initially wanted to go inside and view the 3rd floor rotunda that you typically see on TV law and cop shows. The security guard told me about the complimentary observation deck on the 27th floor. Just get a visitors badge; take 2 sets of elevators (one to 22, the other to 26), and you will have a 360 degree view of the city.",chicago90Phoenix
40,Lovely Building with Good Views,"I always like to find towers and buildings which give panorama vistas. Unfortunately Los Angeles has little to offer except for this lovely 1920s building.The view from the 27th floor of downtown L.A. is good although the haze spoilt the more distant parts of the city on the day we visitedThe 3rd floor lobby has some colourful decor with some interesting plaques and furnishings.We arrived via the metro so had no problem with parking - plus, just several blocks from the City Hall are Los Angeles Plaza, Olivera Street, Union Station, etc.",Cowleasow
50,MAGNIFICENT,"Why don’t more people visit this magnificent building? I made a beeline for it on day 1, walking past that other deco masterpiece the old LA Times building. Once you get past the Police check, take a look at the magnificent lobby and dome on level 3. The, head for level 27, where you can walks past portraits of almost every mayor of LA. Head up the stairs to the open observation deck for a magnificent view - if the smog isn’t too bad. It’s free.",seatseeker
50,Excellent view,"Excellent view from the top, despite fog we saw heaps of la. Couldn't quite see the Hollywood sign but that's ok. The mayors address room on the 27th floor was very nice as well. Staff here were very nice.",Openfj0re
50,One of my favourite places in LA,"This free vantage point affords views all over the LA area, from the sea to the Santa Monica mountains, Hollywood and beyond.Make sure to take photo ID with you as you will need to show it to get your pass att he security desk in the lobby. Then take the lift to the top, and then up the stairs to the Tom Bradley room and the outdoor viewing platform.Many Angelinos I spoke to are unaware of the capacity to visit; it is well worth it.",Arncliffegirl

50,Historic Los Angles City Hall,"Growing up in the LA area, I always thought that seeing the City Hall was fun to see. It was the centerpiece of LA until all the big skyscrapers ""grew"" up around it. Even with the area having changed, the City Hall is still impressive as the city government of LA. I have visited the building and have also gone to the viewing platforms.It is one of those 1928 buildings that continues to mean so much to Los Angeles.",mini
50,Stunning views - don't miss!,I missed the tour but went to the viewing platform. Terrific views of Los Angeles. A real treat. Very helpful staff.,bee_w360
40,Used to be tall,"This old beauty used to be the tallest building in town. No longer! But it is still lovely, and still an historic landmark. Go!",CarmichaelVentura
50,Old beautiful deco building,The inside is even more beautiful than the outside. Great old historical building from 1928. Was the tallest building in LA for over 40 years.,MikeMc666
50,Fun and free,"Many buildings with observation decks charge outrageous fees. Fortunately, City Hall is free and definitely worth a quick trip if you're downtown.The views are spectacular--a great complement to views from The Getty or Griffith Observatory.The building itself is a significant piece of architecture. It will take you back to the days of Raymond Chandler.Security was fast and friendly.",SeanMac14
50,"If you love LA, you will die to see this view","it was a beautiful experience, the personal in the building allows you to go to the 27th floor, and from that point the view is terrific!!!you have a 3D view all around! must see, is free!",CristianHP
40,27 th. floor,"Not on every ones must list for Los Angeles I know. We were on a layover at Union Station. Its a short walk to City Hall. There are free tours. However you must get there before 3:00 PM.for the tours. We got there late, so no tour. You can however go up to the 26 th floor to the observation deck on your own. On 26 you can look for the elevator to the 27 th floor for outside views. The elevators themselves are works of art. Take a good look at them. City Hall is well worth the time.Tips. Have your ID ready and you must go thru metal detectors. Bags and peruses get X rayed. Your ID information will be taken down for the record.Enter from North Main St. North Spring St. entrance is for employees only.LAPD are the security for City Hall and are very friendly and helpful.",SINBADNOBLE

50,Great view of LA,"The observation deck in the 27th floor provides a fantastic view of the city, especially the downtown area. The view here has advantages over the view from the Griffith Observatory. An additional plus is that the observation deck is not enclosed by glass or wire mesh fencing so you don't have to take pictures through dirty glass or wire mesh.",vacationmanic
50,A View from the Top,We were directed here by a resident. Fantastic views from the 26th floor. Also wonderful murals and ceilings on one of the lower floors. Took lots of pictures to relive the memory.,Rustfo
20,Don't bother parking to see it,"It's a landmark and a beautiful building with history, but don't bother to park to see it...it's a horrible experience. Parking is expensive and hard to find during working hours. Then one has to walk thru grimy and dirty sidewalks to get to the building. Along the way one will find homeless people begging for money. Many of them deficate right on the sidewalk and one can smell the urine. This is definately a place that the city should clean up.",Rogerdob
30,Fortress Of Solitude,City Hall was the Daily Planet on the George Reeves Superman show. That must be one dull paper. Bureaucracy occupies this 1920's skyscraper. Across the street is L.A. Times headquarters. The clock atop it was a very useful landmark at 3 am.,Roy W
40,Straight out of Superman!,This art deco building stands high over its surrounding buildings.I did not go inside.There is an underground station near by.,Seeburg3Leixfort

50,You just have to stop here!!!,This is a great place to visit. The observation deck in the 27th floor is amazing. When I was there enjoying the view a nice employee of the city hall recommended me to go to the 4th floor and see the collection of the old LA they have on the corridors. Great experience. Also the people there are really polite.,Patti V
20,Lacking Personality,"Once u are there....nothing to see. Not a go to travel destination. Parking sucks, homeless everywhere....trash. begging. Smells like urine outside",hollyseslar

30,Pretty old building,"The lobby area is really quite ornate and nice. It is worth a visit, but don't plan on being ""wowed"".",ExperiencedTravelers
50,Worth a stop for the view,Only found out about this through Trip Advisor and glad I did. After going through security I headed for the observation deck at the top. A fantastic view across the city. I was pretty much the only person there and it's worth making a stop. Will only take you 10 or 15 minutes but I'd definitely recommend it.,SMTID
50,A must see,"Go to the 26th floor, it's a great view of the entire City including the famous Hollywood sign. Plus it's free! After that you can go across the street and check out the Great Park",ladinks
50,Worth a short stop while visiting downtown,"2 free things to see here:After passing basic security measures (metal detector)...a) The rotunda, hall and dome on the 3rd floor: nice architecture and decor.b) The observation deck on the 27th floor.

50,No Longer the Tallest.,"Los Angeles City Hall was built in 1928 and was the tallest building in the city until the 1960, but still stands tall and te northeast end of downtown. Designed by Austin, Martin, and Parkinson, it has elements of Art Deco and Streamline Modern with many classical elements.The rotunda is on the third floor with a large dome above. Also on the third floor are displayed several gifts from sister cities. gifts include a Korean Turtle Ship, the Mikoshi frm Nagoya, and a musical clock.Tours are offered.",Kenneth L
40,Great L.A. architecture,"If you love architecture, or you want to get some fantastic views of Los Angeles, then head to the downtown City Hall. Once you get past the security check at the front door, tell the guard at the sign-in desk that you want to go to the Observation Deck (27th Floor.) He will give you a print-out of the directions to get there, along with your visitors pass. Then, you are free to enjoy the beauty of this building. The Observation deck has never been busy when I have visited, so you can take your time and enjoy the near-360 degree views of the city. After you've had your fill of the views from above, take the elevator to the 3rd floor, and spend some time enjoying the beautiful architecture on the inside of the building. As this is a public building, all of this is free to the public.",stevew11
20,Why?,Are you kidding. Who in their right mind would want to visit LA's City Hall. That would be a terrible waste of time.,mgard11
50,27th floor and 3rd floor,Very cool panorama views of the whole city from the top. Does not get busy at all and I think it's a gem. A bit old and dated but it's definitely worth a visit.,Son N
40,LA Icon,"One of the most recognisable buildings in LA, and deservedly so. Architecurly speaking its beautiful.",LA-JH1
40,Great place for a new visitor to see where things are around downtown,"The views of downtown and beyond from the 27th floor observation deck are impressive and helped us, as first-time visitors and on foot, see where different downtown points of interest were that we wanted to visit. The building is an impressive example of 1920s architecture. Access to the observation deck is free. However, one has to clear security and access is only available during normal weekday business hours. So, plan ahead.",65Rambler
20,dint like it,i guess i am not the sort of person who would enjoy anything like it....was bored here,taniaimran
40,"A ""Must See"" for any LA resident, and should be interesting for tourists as well.","The architecture, the history, the locale, and the interior are all part of what makes downtown LA a fascinating place to explore if you have done your homework on the locale, and have some timeto spend exploring the city at your leisure.",amercorp
40,27th floor Observation deck has unbelievable views!,"I recently did a photography journey through downtown and wandered into City Hall. I asked the guards if there was anything to see and they recommended the 27th floor observation deck. It is open to the public til 5 p.m. Wow, what a treat!! Amazing views of downtown are a photographer's dream and there were plenty to be had from up there. Besides the views, the 3rd floor also has great hallways to photograph and tapestries that line archways in the ceilings. It's definitely worthy of a stop while in downtown!",Caroline L
40,"Great Civic Architecture, and a Great View!","If you're in downtown, it is certainly a must! The achitecture on the 3rd and 4th floors is very cool with intricately laid tiles. The 26th and 27th floors, the top ones, are surreal and the view is great!",Tour15001
