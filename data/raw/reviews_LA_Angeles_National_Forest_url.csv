50,Must See To Believe,"Breathtaking mountain views. Great for ridind, walking, or biking. Many places to pull over and take pictures. Also many spots to just park and take in the views. I would recommend this for couples or general family or group fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revjamesws
40,Great Hike,"We had a family day of hiking on Memorial Day weekend. Since we had lunch appointment that day, we chose a short hike on the Monrovia Canyon trial, part of Angeles Crest National Park. It was just the right length for our hike with just 2 mile path. At the of the end of the trail, there is a refreshing water fall. With the recent rain, the water fall is gushing With water.We were able to park at the entrance of the park since we went early. Otherwise we had to walk at least half a mile to the entrant with street parking. Once enter the park there is about another 1/4 of mile walk before reaching the trail.The trail is a fairly easy hike with just a small hill. I saw a lot of older people hike on this trial. This trail is dog friendly too. We brought our dogs for this hike. For a two hour short hike, this is a highly recommended family activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34regisk
40,If you like to hike ....,"If you enjoy hiking in the outdoors then this is a must do. It has levels for all different types of hikers, beginners and a little more expertise. Bring the right gear and plenty of water. It’s a nature at its best in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L8krfan24
50,Beautiful vistas,We drove through the park and the views were breathtaking. We went as far as the snow line and some ski lifts. Very interesting flora which made for great pictures. Plus a little strange being just above the snow line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moisquared
50,Wonderful Hike even kids can do!,"First of all, the Angeles National Forest is HUGE, covering God knows HOW many thousands of acres, but the road to Chantry Flats is one access point, taking you deep into the crevasses of the San Gabriels. Also, the ""address"" shown here is only for the AC Forest Rangers' Headquarters - right by the Santa Anita exit off the 210. You DO need a day pass (aka parking pass) to use this road & its trails & picnic areas, so you can purchase one at the ranger station, or at REI, a block or 2 south on Santa Anita.So to access the true beauty, you head north up Santa Anita & keep going up the windy ""Chantry Flats Road"" until you find the marked parking lots. (both above & below the main road.) If you like history, you'll want to check out the old Adams Pack Station, off the upper parking lot - the history is pretty cool! Not a bad spot for a picnic lunch either.Now to delve deeply into the forest and in search of the famed Sturtevant Falls, you've got to access that trailhead from the lower parking lot. Be sure to use the restroom - there are none whatsoever on the trail and you'll be out there at least a couple of hours! Some folks call this ""The Hermit House Trail,"" as you'll pass lots of cute little [OLD!] privately owned cabins on the west side of the creek. Some of them do indeed look like ""Hobbit Houses,"" and you'll feel like you're on the film set for Lord of The Rings! I'm pretty sure you can even rent some of them out (Try Air BnB or Home Away perhaps), but looks like you've got to PACK everything IN & everything OUT! (No vehicle access that I know of.)I love this hike 'cause the sound of the creek is so soothing to my urban ears! Seems like you get the creek sound for at least 80% of this hike. You could run the trail (watch out for tree roots) and make it to the Falls in less than an hour, but if you're strolling along, looking for hobbits or trolls, it might take a full hour to reach the falls. Sturtevant Falls is rather impressive for SoCal, plummeting at least 50 - 60 feet into a dark pool of natural water.Be prepared that you'll likely be in good company (or let's hope it's good!) - this is a popular trail, with the creek, the cabins, and the waterfall as highlights for all to enjoy. Lastly, as you'll note when you first start out, you've initially got to descend a long steep paved road, so you'll have make the ascent on your way back! Hopefully, either the lone restroom or more food & water in your car will be incentive enough to pound that pavement back up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TourDuJour
40,Hiking to cliff jump,Positives:This place is beautiful and a prime example of nature. Right in our backyards basically. If you live on the north side of LA then it only takes about 20 minutes to get here.Negatives: inconsiderate people have been leaving there trash on the trails and thrown in the bushes. Total disregard for our beautiful earth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221daniely
50,Worth it,The husband and I rode our motorcycles up through Angeles National Forest on Hwy 2 to the Wrightwood for lunch. It is beautiful. We wondered if the mountains had trees and it sure does. We weren't speeding as I'm a wimp when it comes to curves so it was a leisurely speed limit or +/-5 ride. You do have to watch for falling rock. About 1/2 way through there was a fresh smattering of fist sized rocks for a few miles some in the shade. We made it through and got some awesome pictures. Even so close to LA it was eerily quiet like most other national forests.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstrickland
40,Loved to Death,"I love visiting this forest, and do so every time I visit Los Angeles. However, it is never what I want it to be. The views are scenic, stunning and breath-taking. However, so is the ride. There appears to be no rules and no law enforcement. We were routinely tailgated by show cars and muscle cars who come to the forest to prove how macho they are. Same with motorcyclists. Also these incredibly narrow roads are also filled with bicyclists. NOTE: More power to the bicyclists and motorcyclists who want to come out and enjoy the views. They have every right to be there - and what a way to enjoy it!!! However, the drive is like this: Solid rock on the left side of the road, sheer cliffs and sudden death on the other. You turn a corner and discover ten bicyclists in front of you (sometimes nice and sometimes with an attitude) and behind you, one or two sports cars or motorcycles who are not content with anything less than 20+ mph over the speed limit. Too bad the road is so scenic. There just is not enough room for so many groups to enjoy it all at the same time safely. (Note: Nothing wrong with runners, cyclists, etc, enjoying the road. not at all. However, all it takes is one or two people to make it unpleasant, and scary. With so many people trying to share such tight quarters, you need to cooperate and that is a fantasy.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyDonor
50,Surprisingly lush,"So you come to LA and expect dry semi-desert type environments.  Sure there are mountains, but they are dry and parched, right?  Well not here!  Take the drive to Mt. Wilson Observatory and be amazed at the green landscape.  If you pay the park entrance fee at the Historical Center on the way to Mt. Wilson you can get out and hike around some too.  If not still take the drive and pull off the side of the road for some quick great pictures.  Absolutely wonderful scenic drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregTrav28

30,National Forest - Not a National Park,"I've lived next to the Angeles National Forest and hiked it's trails for many years. On the good side, it is very near to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Glendale, etc. Very convenient for people living in and traveling to Los Angeles County. Also on the good side, its more remote sites are largely unspoiled, untouched wilderness. On the bad side, it's very near to Los Angeles, etc., which means that, in the closer ares, hordes of people with little respect for the wilderness infest its trails and picnic areas, leaving lots of trash and debris, and at night some unlawful activities take place, like drug dealing. I personally know of two murders that have taken place with the bodies dumped in the Angeles National Forest, and I have personally been on a Boy Scout Hike as a scoutmaster where we witnessed some gang-bangers taking pot shots at birds with what looked like their Saturday night specials - of course, they never hit anything other than trees, but I was a bit concerned for my troop.At any event, I still live next to the forest, and I still like it, but be forewarned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDEYES
50,If you have just had enough of LA LA Land,None contrary to the propaganda put out about Los Angeles. It is a huge busy and at time hectic place.(I have lived here for over 60 years now. I still have not seen Movie Star here)So once in a while I just have to get out and see the real world. So as you can guess this is one of my escape places.So if one wants to see what Southern California looked like before the crush hit. Then just get in your car. (Hey its LA what did you expect me to say?) Then head for La Canada on the 210 Freeway and get off on to the Angeles Crest Highway heading north.I promise you you will not be disappointed. Just beware of fire and do not trash the place. As the Rangers can and will either ticket you or arrest you. Smokey is watching you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV

Switzer falls, Mount Wilson Observatory , Charlton Flatts , Chilao, Buckhorn and Grass valley Visitor Center are stops along the way. There is a single restaurant just past Chilao called Newcomb Ranch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV
40,An Actual Waterfall in LA!!!,"The Sturtevant Falls hike is beautiful. Very different from my normal Temescal Canyon hike because it has many types of tress, flowers, butterflies and birds. Best part is the actual waterfall which is unheard of in LA county. It's 3.6 miles roundtrip. If you're in good shape this is an easy hike. A lot of reviews will talk about the last 1/2 mile on the way back which is all uphill. It's a nice little butt workout and will get the heart moving but it was nice because the rest of the hike is pretty much flat. We went in the middle of the afternoon on a week day and the lot had a few spots open. You can also park on the street but no matter what, you MUST have an ""Adventure Pass"" to park. I think you can buy one at the general store near the trailhead but I bought one before at REI. I would do the hike again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dg5318
50,Quick getaway for Peace and Beauty!!,We were here early may 2016; weather was excellent and very thin traffic; its not a forest forest but protected vast area for native flora and fauna; time that we visited there were nice wild flowers in full bloom; birds in full energy and clouds were very low adding more beauty to the place.Plants and trees in some areas are still struggling to grow after forest fire few years ago and we hope this will grow soon.We are so happy that finally we witness the beauty of the peaceful San Gabriel Mt Range that we see everyday in distance.

The drive is a little windy, but if you take your time and pull over at all the scenic stops along the way, it's very nice. It's quiet, you feel like you're above of all the noise of the city (well, you are!). There's many campgrounds to explore and many hiking trails to try out. Be aware of wildlife...you are in the wilderness and it's very possible that you could encounter a snake or a bear...I've encountered both. It's always fun to see some deer grazing, but then there's of course also the coyotes who love to howl. Please be sure NOT to toss out cigarrette butts or matches or anything else....the brush/trees are very, very dry and highly flammable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
40,Hike the trail to Sturtevant Falls,"The trail head is next to the Chantry Flats parking lot in the forest. You get there via the 210 Freeway off the Santa Anita exit and head North, Santa Anita will become Chantry Flats road, drive up to the mountain for about 5 miles and you'll reach the parking lot. go through the white gate on the paved road and go all the way downhill. At the end of the paved road it'll became a dirt trail, you'll pass quite a few cabins off the trail inside the forest, sometimes you'll see the residents on the trail with the mules carrying their groceries, life looks primitive but peaceful there. The falls is at the end of the trail, because of the drought in California, there isn't much water flowing down but still, it's a relaxing downhill hike. Going back to the parking lot is a bit more strenuous because now you're heading uphill. The round-trip hike is about 3 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyChao
50,Beautiful views,Recently drove through part of the Angeles National Forest. Decided to drive the shorter Little Tujunga Canyon road from the Sunland area to the Sand Canyon area near Santa Clarita and CA14. It was a beautiful day and the views along the windy road were spectacular. Only saw three cars during the entire 18 mile drive. Plenty of nice turnouts so you can safely get out and enjoy the views and take breathtaking views of the valley far below. Average speed was about 20mph taking my time to enjoy the views. Finding the start at either end can be a bit tricky but if you do a little research you will find it. There is also a longer highway that goes through Big Tujunga Canyon.

30,What reservoirs?,"We like driving through national forests when we have the opportunity. We drove up into the Angeles National Forest on two occasions while we were staying in Rancho Cucamonga. Both times, we had to turn around at one or more points due to road closures, possibly because of recent fires and current fire dangers. Both the Morris Reservoir and San Gabriel Lake were down significantly, with no trace of water in any of the stream beds near them. The water levels were so far below the tops of the dams that it seems it will take years for them to re-fill. Many people took advantage of the holiday weekend to have picnics - between the roads where they parked and the empty waterways. We could not seem most of them, although there were hundreds of cars parked along some stretches of road and we could occasionally see the tops of tarps and tents. We also saw some people carrying in grills, in the face of signs everywhere saying ""no fires."" We also saw forest rangers and forest fire personnel, so I guess they were keeping an eye on things. I am sure that shade near even an empty river is more appealing in July than hot cement in the city when the temperatures are higher than normal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindajc2013

The site was absolutely lovely, shady, quiet with a little town nearby and lots of options for hiking.Know going into your trip that there is a composting toilet but only a shared spigot for water. So you'll need to plan accordingly. Our site and I would guess many of the others were not super level. I noticed some people had brought a rake and that's advisable. We were duly warned about bears, with the ranger even pointing out the bear's paw print on the dumpster.

50,"Switzer Falls: Cool, cool water!","If you don't mind hopping rocks, walking across logs, and ducking branches to get to the falls, then try Switzer! This hike should be on everyone's bucket list. Located above La Canada on the Angeles Crest Highway (don't forget Adventure Pass), it's an easy drive to the Switzer Truck Trail. Get to trailhead early for premium parking at the BOTTOM of the fire road. Otherwise, it's an UPHILL walk to your car after the hike in the overflow lot!Restrooms and picnic table located near parking lot. Some tips: wear comfortable, sturdy walking shoes; poles optional but useful on stream crossings; hat or visor for sunny days; dress in layers; watch for poison oak; bring water and snacks.Think of this as an upside-down hike. First part is downhill so nice, shady with a number of stream crossings...use poles here for support. Next part is uphill with with some drop-offs and exposed. Last part drops down into a canyon where you'll find a beautiful pool with a waterfall. Once there, relax, take pictures, eat snacks, and enjoy the beauty! This is a popular hike so expect to share the view with fellow hikers. Depending on time at falls, roundtrip approximately 2.5-3 hours.This was a perfect hike for late spring. Some years after heavy rain, water level can get high so stream crossings can turn into river crossings! Check conditions ahead and you won't be disappointed. Switzer Falls is a cool place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
50,Real Nature real close to L.A.,"If you are in L.A., or visiting, you can be hiking and/or skiing in less than an hours drive. This place is a real treasure.You need an ""Adventure Pass"" to park and hike around. They are $5 and available at well marked stops along the ""highway"". No pass needed to just park at a turn-off and enjoy the view.Buckhorn is my favorite campground in the area.Hikes, boldering, streams, shade... there is just a lot to do from this spot. Rangers warned me that this campground and Monte Cristo especially, get loud at night. And advised going to ""Chilao Flats"" for Family camping. But I have stayed here plenty and I like the more secluded aspects of this site. Noise, especially before the 10 o'clock, does not bother us. Low class litterbugs are the biggest turn-off and that is usually not an issue here. The trail-head to numerous destinations is located here and one can even access the PCT from here. When most of the campers leave and all is quite the Bears and Rattlesnakes do come out. As they do live there.No mater how hot the days are, It gets VERY COLD at night! Be prepared!The trails are newly fixed up and the toilette's are new and still very clean. They might stay that way if people stop trying to levitate above the seats and get poop on them. Simply cover the seat with TP, sit down and try to relax! It's camping!The fire missed this spot so one can see what the forest used to look like before the fire cleaned up the dry undergrowth and older trees.Newcombs Ranch restaurant is the only restaurant in the entire forest. And the food reflects the lack of competition. Good place to stop for a beer or to hang out but the food is average at best.If you see a dead rooster hanging upside down surrounded by burnt candles, well that is people practicing Santeria (a Catholic Voodoo mix) and is usually found at the entrance to the forest around the early turn offs. Rangers say ""freedom of religion"" stops them from policing the activity and supposedly there is little chance of being abducted and ritualistically murdered. At least not by the practitioners of Santeria..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat

Started backpacking late Friday afternoon from the gate and arrived at the flats about and an hour forty minutes later. The uphill climb and afternoon sun made for a good work out! The campground offered nice, shady sites with clean restrooms nearby for our scouting group. With nightfall, came the million dollar view of the twinkling lights below....hard to believe we were only minutes from the city! Signs warn of rattlesnakes and should not be taken lightly as we saw a baby rattler camouflaged at the foot of a tree the next day. As far as things to do, you can take a hike up to Mt. Wilson (half our troop), work on a conservation project with the ranger (the other half), or read a book and watch squirrels scamper up and down trees (what I did), it's all good and it's all free!

50,Wilderness near the city,"Amazing beauty can be found in the canyons and mountains of Angeles National Forest, which can be reached in 30 minutes from Downtown LA. Angeles Crest Highway rises to 8000', with walks up to 10,000 foot mountains nearby. Mt. Wilson offers fantastic views of the LA Region, and on a clear day out to Catalina Island. Switzers, 20 minutes outside La Canada, provides a beautiful streamside walk, and a waterfall view, and stays cool even on hot summer days. The trail on the east side of JPL up the Arroyo is terrific. Be sure to purchase a Forest Adventure Pass for parking (available at Sport Chalet in La Canada and elsewhere). The park is laced with fire roads that are perfect for mountain biking, as well as hiking trails and backpacking camps. For overnight camping, drive an hour from La Canada out Angeles Crest.
