40,Beautiful Church,St. Andrew is a traditional old church. It is beautiful and clean inside. I've visited St. Andrew's several times the last few months and look forward to going back. I was disappointed once when I went there on a Friday morning because I cannot find where the Mass was held. Weekday Mass is celebrated at a chapel. You can find the chapel by walking toward the right side of the church up front.,Tennisbums
50,Very Beautiful,"This is an old church and is very much like the ones in Europe. It can't match the huge cathedrals over there, but the artwork throughout is still worth seeing. If you like seeing old churches this is worth a stop. Good street parking & when there is mass the parking lots are open",SDTravelMom

50,Beautiful Church,This church rivals any in the world. Attending a service is very special. A visit to look around will do as well. It is similar to churches in Italy. The acoustics are wonderful should you be lucky enough to hear a choir or organ concert.,newell12017
50,Go inside to look around,"I have not been to a service there. But I have been in several times just to look around. It seems to be always open during the day with someone acting as a host. The pillars are huge and thick and each is of a different color marble. It is a grand, old church!",Andrew H
50,Beautiful!,A warm and friendly congregation in a historical and beautiful church. Tough to focus on the sermon due to the incredible architecture. Save time to wander and look after the Mass.,Laura D

50,Beautiful old Catholic church,"We were encouraged to visit the church by our family who live in Pasadena. It is a beautiful church though we did not attend Mass there since our hotel was not close by. Viewing the beautiful art around the church was challenging because it was dark inside since there was no service going on--still though, a beautiful peaceful place",Susan A

50,Absolutely magnificent,"The window in our Marriott Courtyard room looks out at this Church, and the Square Romanesque style campanile invited us to take a closer look. We walked over there, went inside, and were amazed. This Church is magnificent! There was a wedding going on, so we had to enter through a side door, but from any angle, one cannot help but be awed.The gigantic marble columns, the beautiful murals, gorgeous stained glass windows, and lovely side chapels cause great admiration. No wonder this Church is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful and important in Southern California.Next to the Church, there is a lovely landscaped garden area, called ""Piazza Venezia"". There are tall trees, flowering bushes, two fountains, and many benches. After visiting this Church, we spent a lovely half hour there chatting about it.",NYU62

50,A beautiful Catholic Church with history and a one of a kind interior.,It is worth visiting just to see the columns in the interior. Fr. Paul is the Pastor and he is a great Catholic Priest who is very inviting and accommodating. Make sure you read how the columns were created.,kennylund
40,A landmark in Old Pasadena with a bell tower that's visible for miles.,"St. Andrew's Catholic Church is a Catholic church in Pasadena. Founded in 1886, it is the oldest Catholic parish in Pasadena and one of the oldest in Los Angeles County. Its Romanesque Revival campanile bell tower is visible for miles and is one of the landmarks of Pasadena. The current church, built in 1927, was modeled after the Basilica of St. Sabina in Rome.The current home of St. Andrew's Church, built in 1927 at an estimated cost of US$1,000,000, is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful and important churches in Southern California. The style of architecture, without and within, is that of early Christian churches of the Byzantine era.Inside the church you will find some fine murals. The church commissioned the Italian painter, Carlo Wostry, for the murals and stations of the cross. Wostry had previously painted murals in Trieste, Venice, Paris, and New York, but regarded his works at St. Andrew's to be the ""crowning work"" of his artistic life. He dedicated five years of his life to the interior decoration of St. Andrew's and it really is a sight worth seeing... Beautiful. in 1935, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Wostry's murals at St. Andrew's were ""a revelation to the western art world"" and the best ""in any church in the two Americas!You do not need that long to visit this stunning Pasadena church, probably less than 1 hour, and it is certainly worth taking the time to pay it a visit as it is a memorable attraction both from the outside and within.",Roberts69
