40,Very Nice Park Next To Hyatt-Regency,This Lagoon Park is built in the Japanese style with two Rainbow Bridges connecting small islands. It is a seawater filled pond. Various festivals are held here some free and some come with charges. Cement walkways and bike paths enclose and pass through the park which is about 12 acres. Very easy to get to and walk. There are little paddle boats for rent.,Richard S
