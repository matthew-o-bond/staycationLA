50,Awesome park.,"We hiked here mainly to visit the MASH site which we did. There is a fee to enter the park. I don’t remember how much it was but I didn’t care. We parked at the lot where everyone else was. The signage getting started is a bit confusing. They did have wildfires the last summer so things were kinda out of sorts. We eventually made it to the MAoSH site. It’s a good 3 miles back from the parking lot. You can’t drive back there since the creek flooded and washed everything away , including the bridge. When u come across that half concrete , half WTF did the rest of the bridge go , your on the right path . It was a beautiful SoCal day when we were there. I’d hike around here again ! Beautiful park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericD6111JL
40,Beautiful place for hiking,Stumbled upon this after driving and exploring. A great area to explore for multiple hikes. You can get a map which will show you where to explore various trails. Some areas have bathrooms and picnic tables.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/582vickic
50,We very much enjoyed hiking this beautiful park,"We very much enjoyed hiking this beautiful park amidst the Agoura Hills that have been the backdrop for M*A*S*H, a Planet of the Apes, a Star Trek episode, westerns, and others.With only an after as an appetizer, I'd like to go back and explore more of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDZatSF
50,Great experience,"Camped here for 8 nights in Dec/Jan. Great experience, nice hikes, good climbing, friendly staff. Close to the city and Malibu beach. Good grocery store and other services (coin laundry) nearby. Cool nights, warm days. Sites are large and clean. Bathrooms are cleaned daily. Showers are fine - hot water not always available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabellefY8173TF
50,MASH site as a main magnet,"Visited park on our way to the MASH site. It is good place to relax after spending one day in Universal studios or other LA crowded attraction. Just check weather forecast, have sturdy shoes, take sunscreen and water supplies as there are a some areas without shaded spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
40,Family Camping,"Be sure to double check that the space you want is reserved on reserve America because mine didn't save and they just gave me what ever site was available. I want a camp site furthest away but ended up at Camp site #1. I do have to say it wasn't all that bad.Each afternoon we did experience high winds that died down around 5pm, so be sure to bring heavy duty stakes and extra rope to tie down your tent and pop ups. The creek is close enough to hike to and the pond is about 1.8 mile hike. Be sure to bring river shoes, or heavy duty flip flops as the pond is very rocky and you will be glad you're not barefoot.At the time we went they didn't allow fires in the fire pit but charcoal was ok The way the winds were in the afternoon I could see how it would be a fire danger plus a lot of the area is dry brush and grass.Overall a good camping spot, restrooms nearby and token showers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411

30,Nice enough campground,"We stayed two nights since its been reopened. The rangers weren't particularly friendly. They told us the gates lock at 10 PM and when we explained we were going to a musical in Thousand Oaks and would probably not make it back, they said to park the vehicle at the front entrance and walk in. It is about a mile to the campground--not a fun walk at 11:00 at night. The bathrooms and showers are ok but there are no electrical outlets in any bathrooms and only one bathroom had a mirror. The sites were mostly in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sometravelers

50,If You Are a M.A.S.H. Fan...,"...then this is the place for you. It's a 3 mile hike up and back. The park Rangers will direct you where to start. Dogs are not aloud on hike. It's an easy hike. Pack drinks and snacks. Also, despite what happened two years ago, I still believe its one of the safest places to camp, as all of the Rangers check in their vehicles there when their shift is over. I have yet to confirm that the camp site has reopened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crupi

30,burned,"The park is tame, with simple trails and land hemmed in by highways yet I always liked it for the iconic peaks. Now I wanted to see how the land fares after the cataclysmic fires a little more than a year ago. It was pretty bad. Many of the majestic oaks seem to have made it through although several of the big ones did not make it. The chaparral and shrubs are mostly gone, with many hillsides barren and charred, and others covered by green grass. Erosion is clearly a problem but i saw no obvious signs that the park management is dealing with it. A main bridge was down and unrepaired, so we had to inch across the river over a long tree trunk. Yet they still charge $12 for a couple of hours of parking. I hope the trees and other plants make it theough the year, and that the animals return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaioatey
50,Excellent hike with a nice visitor center,"I’ve hiked here numerous times and love bringing people here to discover the fresh air and beauty of Malibu all with mesmerizing Mountain View’s along the trails. I especially recommend this hike after the rains when it’s extra green. Just be sure to follow the main path and know regular routes may not be open after heavy rains. It’s a lovely hike that’s as hard or as far as you would like it to go... there’s even a little water to dip your feet in... or fall in if you’re clumsy! The incline on certain trails will make it a great workout. It’s also a great place for novice rock climbers with sightings of people with ropes hanging off sides of giant rocks along the hike. I love that there’s clearly marked signs so you can enjoy the different hikes. Theres a must hike trail for MASH fans in case you didn’t know this. For parking, there’s a day fee of $9 for 3 hours or $12 for the day (if you don’t have a California annual adventure pass). You can purchase a day pass at the kiosk in the front entrance or in the parking lot. Make sure to stop by the visitor center that has small trinkets and dried/preserved forest animals. There’s even a children’s activity room in addition to the whole place being a learning center and mini history museum (Planet of the Apes was shot here)Bring cash if you want to purchase anything like t-shirts, pins or rocks. They don’t accept credit cards. I’ve taken small elementary children here who were able to complete the hike to both water pools and off some uphill hikes totaling 5 miles. There’s plenty to keep them happy and active. There’s two unpleasant portable toilets a mile in but that’s all so plan accordingly! P.s.- mountain biking is allowed here but there are many other longer and better trails in my bicycle opinion :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1

50,"Beautiful, Renewing Hike","We spent our morning walking to the Rock Pool and back. It was quite muddy but nothing we couldn't get through. The rains made everything lush and green, very vivid colors. The creek was running clear and cold. I wouldn't consider it a hike but rather a long walk, as the terrain isn't really a challenge at all. There was a geography class from UCLA and parents within children. A mix of all types of people, though not busy. It was a beautiful morning that put our focus back on the Creator giving us sense of renewal and refreshment. I definitely recommend this for anyone that loves nature!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickisix91
30,"Interesting because of the filming that has taken place there but its not ""out in the wild""","First an important update as to overnight camping: It is closed permanent or indefinitely because they cannot be having people stay there at night ""when there is a maniac running loose."" (this is straight from the horses mouth.) I hiked in to the mash site and along both sides of century lake but did not go to the pools that people jump in because the area is basically for the young. A good rule of thumb is the older you are the least you will be impressed and if 50 or over you will not like the fact it is essentially directly connected to Los Angeles.The filming of the Planet of the Apes and Mash is a big plus--but only for that reason. Another thing to consider is that you are pretty much in a small area--essentially one or 2 canyons that are surrounded and interwoven with houses and the wealthy.--This is not an out in nature hike area. The geology and views are good or ok--if you are young and have not seen much. If you are older--have seen alot--and truly been out in nature you will be disappointed that anywhere you go in this area will be screaming teens with ghetto blasters--and that means in the deepest reaches. (this area has been loved to death--and its far too close to one of the wildest most dangerous areas on the planet).. There is free parking along Mulholland drive but I parked in the pay parking area in fear of being broke into. In the pay area your odds of being broke into ARE GREATER--not less. Its a wild and rowdy place unwatched and unmonitored by rangers. (the management is HORRIFIC--and totally broken down.) No wonder people are being killed there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffhome10

We told my husband that we were just going on a hike. Once he saw the signs, he was like, ""WHAT???"" The hike was super special for our family. The hike was fairly easy, but it was about 6 miles round trip. For the MASH lover, the hike is a must. It is really fun to watch MASH and be able to point out the helicopter landing pad and such. Fun, fun, FUN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenrD5278OZ
50,Really fun day hiking,We had a great time on a day hike here - all the way to the old MASH filing site. We passed a number of water holes and people were having tons of fun. It's definitely worth a trip and is relatively simple walk/hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah91302

For $12 plenty of paved parking and restrooms. We hiked to the M.A.S.H. film site. We really enjoyed seeing the site. But the trip in and out of the area was just as good. It's about 5 miles in and out. Beautiful views (small lake, dam, creek, mountains). There are so many trails to enjoy you could spend days here. Wonderful visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenwP7283NK

30,Might depend when you go,"I went on a weekday morning, so there was minimal information available at the park. The trails seem to be well used, but are very poorly marked, and the sign in the parking area was also not clear. That said, it was a nice area, and I did go for a strenuous hike up one of the hills without getting totally lost. Parking was easy and the cold soda machine a welcome sight after 2 hours of hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmandell2018
40,Hiked to the M*A*S*H site,"My family are huge fans of the TV show M*A*S*H and so my husband and I could not take a trip to California without making a trip to see the where the show filmed its outdoor scenes. We had a map in hand and also asked the man in the booth when we drove into the park for any helpful tips getting to the site. With all that we have to say that the trail out the old tv set was not well marked. We were almost ready to give up when we ran into a woman who told us it was about 10 mins further down the path. What fun once we finally got there. They have a few old tattered signs, an old hospital truck, a space you can picnic at where the mess tent once stood and a replica of the city signs that stood outside of the Swamp in the show. It was so much smaller than it looks on TV but we really enjoyed just walking around this space and remembering some of our favorite episodes that were filmed in that very location. It is a long hike and not a super easy one. It was hot the day we went and we were glad we had water. We saw very few people the day we went which we liked. For true M*A*S*H fans I think it is worth the hike and for those that like to hike, it is a gorgeous park. I would go back but I most certainly will be sure to carry a map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myflowergirls2
50,Set of M.A.S.H located a short hike inside the canyon! Only $12.00 to park for the day!,The drive to Malibu Creek State Park is awesome. There are many mountain views and photos to be taken before you arrive. There are many also a lot of different trail heads depending on your skill. Definitely a rock climbers dream location. Many movie scenes have been filmed here. From cowboys to spaceships you can recognize them. Get a early start if you plan on seeing the entire park in one day. It definitely would take 2 days to enjoy the park and see all the places it offers. Great place to soak up the sun in nature. We will be back soon to checkout the lake!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Fun hike in beautiful canyon!,"Our family recently did the 5-mile round trip hike to the M.A.S.H. set location within the park. The hike was pretty easy, but there were a few hills along the way.

Entire hike took about 2.5 hours with stops along the way at a leisurely stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926julien

The bathrooms have showers, but you need to buy tokens, at least 2 tokens which equate 1 dollar, each for 2 min. You will need them both! There are no lights in the showers and in the restrooms, at least most of them are non-functioning. The check-in closes at 10 pm. We arrived 8 min before and were told that we are late, but were let in. However, we got a different site than we booked and paid for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukasKindl

50,Beautiful place to walk or hike,"Surrounded by the mountains with great trails-both easy and difficult. In early morning or close to dusk you'll most likely see deer grazing. You can see some of the Mash site, go to the waterfall, stop by the visitors center, practice rock climbing, rent a campsite or just take a lovely walk. The best deal is to buy the yearly pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueW752
10,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"We booked this campground because it was located near Malibu and Los Angeles. We had originally tried to book at Mugu State Beach or Leo Carrillo but no sites were available. This campground is off the beaten path from the beach. There was still trash on our site when we arrived from the previous campers. There are only a few showers which cannot accommodate the whole campground. In addition the bathrooms were not clean. Although the campsites afford no privacy it appeared to be a quiet little place with families. When we arrived the Ranger checking us in said that we needed to be on site no later than 10 pm as they closed the gate at this time. We were in our tent by 9:30 pm and ready for quiet time. At around 10:15 pm a large group (over 20) young people speaking another language arrived to the campground. They preceded to set up camp putting up numerous tents in the campground area. This went on until well after midnight. I have no idea why the park rangers let them come in after 10 pm, put them in the main campground area where it was quiet with families as opposed to the group campground area and why they didn't tell them to be respectful of the quiet time being observed by the remainder of the campground. Upon us waking up we discovered there were about 6 groups of kids the same size that arrived in the campground. This ruined our experience here and we will not return. Next time we will book early and stay at a campground on the beach, at least if it's noisy I can enjoy the sound of the waves. And one last thought the bees were terrible. Do yourself a favor and choose another campground.Pictures are attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6658SElisat
40,On the way to the MASH site.,"This is a California State Park and facilities are very limited. You pay to park, have a few toilets at the parking area and not much else. You need to bring your own food and drinks and I recommend a hat. There is a rock pool that seems to be suitable for swimming in a pleasant spot, I believe it is the pool Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid jumped into in the movie. The pool is very popular with the young crowd and that's OK, they didn't bite and were quite friendly! We traversed this popular park to reach the MASH filming site, which was quite a walk in. It has had a significant flood recently and some tracks were quite damaged, though passable. I did the walks in basic runners so there is no great need for special equipment. Although our main purpose was to visit the MASH site we found the park to be quite ruggedly beautiful as we walked through. Being in late spring there were wildflowers everywhere. I could believe it would get quite hot in the canyon in high summer, so best be prepared.This park is certainly well worth a visit on its own merit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveaC978TQ
40,Great Historical and Hollywood Hikes,"We stayed at the campground and made a 4-day weekend of it. We have a 25-foot trailer which fit no problem with our truck attached. I believe the max trailer/RV length is 30'. We didn't have to disconnect which was really nice. There are no hookups, but if needed there are bathrooms with showers (I heard were clean but didn't use). Most people that stayed were tent campers. When we arrived we did not receive any maps. Not even a campground map. Maybe because the campground is small with about 60 sites. It is about a half-mile to walk the entire one-way loop. Very spotty cell service (AT&T). Dogs are allowed in the campground and on roads, but not the trails. Which is extremely unfortunate not to be able to take your leashed dogs on any of the hikes. My dog behaves better than some of the inconsiderate people on the trails. If you're energetic enough you can do all the main hiking sites in one day. If you're not camping, park at the second lot passed the ranger station, which is closest to the trail head. There are no fees at the park just parking fees. I believe it is $12 for a day use parking pass or you can pay $3/hour. You can purchase a trail map for $2 at the ranger station or Visitor Center (about .7 miles from trail head). Use the restrooms at the parking lot before you start your hike. There are portable toilets between the Visitor Center and rock pool, but smelled so bad even from a distance. Emergency use only! For first timers, I would start at Visitor Center, then to Rock Pool, then to Century Lake, then to Mash filming location. I did not visit Reagan Ranch or do the Lookout Trail, but seems like you could do in one day. Take plenty of water, hat, sun screen, snacks, etc. Going to the Mash location and back was over 5-miles round trip from our campsite. The Visitor Center was fantastic. Watch the 7-minute movie about a lot of the movies and shows filmed in the park. There's great stuff there for the kids to see and touch! I was hugely disappointed at the Rock Pool area. What could be a beautiful natural beauty is marred by the overflowing trash receptacles, followed by all the trash on the ground. Please take your trash with you if the bins are full! The park needs to do a better job emptying them and/or adding more. Although there are signs for no diving, lots of people were. Also people playing their disruptive loud music here and on the trails was particularly annoying. I like the peacefulness of the park and noises of the birds and animals. Luckily these lazy people don't walk further in the park to mess it all up. Century Lake was pretty and Mash site was interesting. Really great if you're Mash and Planet of the Apes fans. Or if you just like to hike. The day use picnic areas and a lot of the campground could use some sprucing up (weed abatement) and could use some recycling bins for those that want to recycle. Despite most of my negative comments the park is truly a natural beauty and I will be back to explore more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotoJane

50,Easy hiking to M*A*S*H* filming site,"All fans of the show M*A*S*H* should take the hike to the old filming site. We took the Crags Road route in from the main parking area, and we did have to pay a park entrance fee. I understand that there are other routes in where you can park free along the road, but we know that parks need $$$ to survive, so we we happy to pay. It was about 2.5 miles one way on a mostly wide and flat trail. There is one section of moderate incline for several hundred yards, but nothing overly strenuous. The final half mile or so narrows to a rocky path that is shaded and really enjoyable. The site itself has some old vehicles from the show, a shaded picnic area, and explanatory signs posted that will help you place all the elements of the 4077th. Take water with you, because not all of the trail is shaded and it can get quite warm. We took a short detour to the visitor center on the way back, where there were interesting displays about area wildlife, early native Americans, and movie filming in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916

It's a very popular destination and there are a ton of people there. But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the lush arroyos and canyons; the rolling grassy hills and the jagged rock peaks. We didn't plan ahead and so only hiked, but it would also be a great place for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidneyW50

50,Fantastic treasure in greater Los Angeles,I went to the park to see the set for M*A*S*H. The set itself was a great experience as I have seen all of the episodes many times each. There isn't much remaining but it was still worth the 3 mile hike into the site.One side benefit of the visit was that I got to see this wonderful park in the mountains outside of LA. This is truly a great location for peaceful hiking. I was there very early just before sunrise and was the only one there. It was amazing.I highly recommend this as a destination to anyone who wants miles of beautiful trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyhunt
40,A lot of walking but great views,"A lot of walking and very hilly. Difficult to get to some of the places if the creek is high (which, from what I hear, is not often, but it was when we were there). I wish the MASH site was easier to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauragG9235DC
50,Amazing Run at the Sean O'Brien Trail Races,"Coming from Connecticut, we don't get to run in places like this. Even with the rain and the damage it did to the trails, the run was spectacular. The sunrise over the mist when we hit the top of the first climb is something I will never forget. We were treated to a rainbow mid morning a break of clear skies when we head over to the side of the mountain with the Malibu coast in sight.This is not an easy run AT ALL. It's quite challenging even on a dry day. But, the views are definitely worth it. I hope to come back one year (when it's not so wet) and take my kids on a hike there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonw757
50,Variety of Terrain and a great hike to the Mash site,"This is a wonderful place to hike in the Malibu Canyon. If you are afraid of heights, get some one else to drive you up Malibu Canyon road!No one seems to go in the main gate where you have to pay. Park on the road a little farther up and enter the park.We walked to two sites...the Rock Wall and the Mash Site. A little visitors center about a quarter of a mile in and over the bridge to the right can set you on whatever path you want to follow. The Rock Wall is a beautiful spot and a great climb if you are cool with the traverse over the water.The Mash site is about a two mile hike in from the road but really fun to see. You will recognize the cliffs that the helicopter comes in over in the opening sequences as you crest the hill before descending into the valley where the TV show was filmed. There are a few relics from the show and some good photo ops.We hiked in after a lot of rain in the LA area, so it was muddy...but definitely passable. None of the trails we hiked on were difficult, but there are some steep uphill walks.My son, who lives in the area, has visited this park many times to hike and to rock climb. I can certainly understand that and would come back again.There are restaurants, but bring water and some snacks. And a camera! The vistas are gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632carltonh
50,Explore the Visitor Center and all trails!,"Always worth weekend visits! Your parking pass is also good for the ""day"" at any other State Park's, like Malibu Lagoon! Visit the Visitor Center for help on good trails, buy a cool drink, or just to see what wonders can be seen in the Park via the exhibits. Come during the summer and camp. Bring the kids to the summer campfire programs from July through August.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MzTripleM

50,What a Magical Spot,"My husband and I live only a couple of miles from this gem of a park, and have been here multiple times, mostly walking to the Rock Pool. My husband has photographed this spot in every season, as it is constantly changing. It is so tranquil and serene, especially if you go first thing in the morning. It's amazing to have such a special natural resource in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanandjack2015
50,Pit stop but worth it,This was an unexpected gem as we only went to Calabasas cuz we were hoping to see the Kardashians houses :-) to get a chance to come here you need to check out the Malibu Creek. It's pretty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas
40,Nice walk to see the M*A*S*H site!,We met friends to walk here and it turned out the extra bonus was that one trail leads to the filming site for M*A*S*H. Some of the set is still there. Very fun. Apparently this area has been used for several films so there is the Planet of the Apes wall and the cliff that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid jumped off. Very clear and accessible trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsF2082UF
50,"Nice, fairly flat hike",We hiked to the filming site for MASH from the corner of Mulhulland Drive and Las Virgenes. There is a large parking lot on the corner and you can park for free vs. $12 in the lot. The hike is fairly flat and the path is wide and clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchelle1
40,A beautiful park with some nice hiking and points of interest,"Arriving at the park in late Saturday morning in early October the parking lot was wide open for parking. Each parking area had a separate set of restrooms which were very clean and didn't have any offensive odors. After frequenting national park restrooms with mostly pit toilets and smelly surroundings, this was a pleasant surprise. We visited the small visitor center which appears to be an old house that appeared in some of the movies shot in years past on the old Fox Ranch. The visitor center had a nice display of all of the birds, mammals and reptiles found within the confines of the park. It was air conditioned and I believe there were at least 2 docents and possibly a third to answer questions about the park. There was a small gift shop that sold cold drinks in addition to the hiking books as well. We hiked out to the MASH TV show set, a hike of about 2.3 miles. It was fun to see the remains of the vehicles from the TV set and there were some nice informational signs that explained what went on where and there were pictures of scenes from the old show. One very nice feature of the MASH site is several picnic tables near the old jeeps that is covered by camouflage ""netting"" that broke up the sunshine. On the return hike we stopped by Century Lake Dam and Lake. There was plenty of water still in the lake but the water level was clearly much below its maximum. Swimming did seem to be allowed in the lake. The only drawback to the park was the $12 entry fee ($11 for seniors over 62) but I guess that is money that helps keep everything clean and neat in the park. We enjoyed the hike and the MASH site and would recommend this for kids to adults. Not too strenuous or long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnapolisHiker_MD
40,Very Fun Place to Hike,"Great place to hike, but the paths are NOT well-marked. The free map is not too helpful, might be worth it to pay the extra $2 for the detailed map. The terrain is not to tough to walk, but your feet get dirty. Don't go without bringing water. Definitely stop by the Visitors Center and watch the short video about the movies shot on location there. Very cool. It's a beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lori1019
40,Too Dry in September!,"This could've been more scenic, but the drought has taken it's toll on the park. Hot, dry and dusty. Trails are not well marked, and the visitor center is only open on weekends after Labor Day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationers62
40,Decent hike,Relaxing and wild. Only a few sign posts along the way thus make sure to have a good offline map (maps.me is my favourite) if it's your first time. Worth checking out M*A*S*H site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhymes0102
50,A great walk under the shade,A very nice park. Clean and big. A big track mostly shaded which is good during the summer season . It gets very narrow after about two miles but the hike is great. One draw back is that the parking costs usd 12.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555
30,Hiking trails that pass through old filming areas,"You may see some jump into the water by the falls, but don't. The water is waste runoff and is not something you want your skin exposed to. The MASH set is worth the hike, but be sure you're able to hike the distance. This park still gets pretty warm in spite of its proximity to the beach, so bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilief2014
50,Lovely walk,"We went early one morning after breakfastIt was so quiet and peaceful, a lovely walk. A few steps to go down into the woodlands but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mand1970
50,Sunny,Went for a small hike with my boyfriend. We walked past a metal bar. And turned back to realize it was a huge rattle snake. We slowly backed away and watched it go back into the bushes this was at the start of the trail so it kept us really aware for the rest of the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chloed371
40,Found this lovely state park when we decided to explore further....,"We had a day to explore Malibu on our own before meeting our son for dinner and then heading north. We ended up at this lovely state park after deciding to see where ""this road leads"" and coming across the park. We enjoyed walking along the trail to the visitor center and would have continued on to the site of MASH if we had more time. There had been a lot of rain the week before we visited so the creek was high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalRambler
50,Good clean fun,We came to visit friends here and stay the night...So we didn't hike around...but had a great time in one of the camps...the campground was full of famlies so nothing was too private...but everybody behaved nicely...we a hawk swoop down on squirrels...then after he got one...the crowd would chase him...that when on all day...we will be back to explore more in the future...need a break that's close to Lis Angeles...this is a good one...hope that helps...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripbhb
50,"Fireroads, trails, dams, grasslands, rocks....Malibu Creek State park has it all!","More than just mash.Lotsa trails and even campsites.All trails are gentle and you can go short or long. I only came for mash and ended up close to 4 hours just wandering around on the other trails...Lost cabin. lookout point, century dam etc.River rocks, rock climbing, dams, grasslands....Malibu Creek State park has it all.Campsites and parking fees--No worry it supports our [parks (unless you buy a state park pass).There is so much more to this park than just the mash site--come for that and stay for much more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Beautiful place.,We stayed overnight here in the RV for our first night ever in the RV.It was a great site with all the amenities needed including good shower and toilets and sinks.The park itself is very beautiful and perfect for hiking either short or long trails.We wished we had stayed longer at this park it was very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
50,"Beautiful Hike, adaptable to however long you want your day to be.","So somehow, in the 11 years I have lived in LA, I missed this hike. Which is a shame. As it is a lot of fun. It is super adaptable to however long you want to go. From the main parking ($12 cash or check), it is a quick jaunt to the visitor center (open only on weekends) and the rock creek. This is a great place to head if you have strollers or less enthusiastic walkers. You will still get a great bit of the scenery in, and the walk to the creek is quick and has a ton or rocks near the water to sit down and eat some food or just hang out.If you want to go a little further the next closest place will take you to the Century Dam and lake. It is just another mile past the visitor center (different path than the creek). There are picnic tables here, but not much else. If you want to keep going past that side trail that leads you to the dam, you will eventually get to the MASH site. Which is super fascinating and a really fun place for locals and for tourists. Most of the hiking is not too strenuous. If you want to take a few of the side trails (like lookout trail) they will give you a quick elevation gain to burn some extra calories.I, like everyone else, highly recommend extra water and a hat. Also, when you park in the lot, take a picture of the map near the bathrooms so you can know which direction to head in. We could have gone further, but with all the side trails we clocked in about 6.5m and were totally wiped.I loved this place. Whether to swim in the creek and chill, or to head to a more strenuous destination. It has fun history and overall just a BEAUTIFUL location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylskie
40,"Grassland Trail at Malibu State Park, Different hikes, great setting.","My first trip to this park. Off of PCH (Pacific Coast Hwy) onto Malibu Cyn Rd. which turns into Las Virgenes Rd. The entrance to the GRASSLAND TRAIL is marked right on Mullholland Hwy. I Parked on the road and started on the trail. Spring is undoubted the best time. California's drought has hurt the natural beauty of many inland areas. I took the shortest hike, just taking my time and soaking all the views in. A few joggers passed by and some others. I went on a weekday (which is the best) and enjoyed seeing less people. I walked about 3/4 of the trail and then back to Mullholland Hwy, See all the pictures below...and maybe give it a try....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagreek1
40,Great Creek & Mountain Hike ...,"We enjoy coming to hike Malibu Creek Park this time of year before it's too hot and crowded with folks. We usually tie this hike in with a visit to the King Gillette Ranch in the later afternoon. Park near PCH and wander Malibu Lagoon, then head up Malibu Creek. It goes a long way and you want to enjoy Nature and not rush things. Fun! .....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Beautiful place to hike,"My daughter, husband and I hiked to the M*A*S*H site. As I am at least 20-30 years older than most of the people I saw coming and going on the trail, I will say that I would not classify this as an ""easy"" hike for folks my age. Some of the hills to get to the site are fairly steep, and the last portion is narrow and rocky. People with strollers had to turn back at that point. Having said that, wear a hat, bring plenty of water and enjoy the scenery as it is gorgeous. I'd like to visit a different part of the park next time as there is much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/composthappens

50,Terrific place,"This is an amazing place. It feels truly wild - you expect to see Cowboys on the horizon at any minute. We walked to the site for the M.A.S.H. Television show filming, and a helpful couple of volunteer rangers on horses gave us extra information there. The best piece of advice I can give is wear a hat and take plenty of water - it gets very hot in them there hills!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vc2468
50,"Great hike, amazing views and an old MASH film site!",This is one of LA's best parks. It's huge! The hiking is amazing! You can take the easy route of just a few miles or take the backbone trail which can go on for dozens of miles. There's a beautiful lake and a creek. So much to do and see here. You can hike about 2 miles to the old MASH film site and take pictures with the old trucks and such! Have a wonderful time at this awesome LA park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
50,"Easy hikes, pretty destinations","My girlfriend and I are on a mission to collect state park maps and highlighting the trails we do, so this park was on our list. We went on Presidents' Day Monday. It was very hot for a February day. A lot of people were playing in various spots on the creek.There wasn't a whole lot of shade on the trails, but the destinations were gorgeous. We watched some kids cliff diving at the Rock pools. The water was way too cold, but they put on a show. It's a good swimming hole other wise and very easy getting there. Lots of families with small children.If you're in the area, you should check this place out. There are a lot of places to see in this park.I would come back for different trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ersheajr

40,Hike to the MASH set!,"This is a pretty easy ""hike"" to see the spot where the television series MASH filmed it's outside shots. They have left behind several artifacts and photos from the show so it makes it easy to see where this great show was filmed. As far as the hike goes, you'll want sturdy shoes as it is pretty rocky terrain. There is a walking path the entire way and it is mostly flat with only two good inclines. You can reach the site from two different directions. There is free street parking at the path head. There are only porta pots about half way on the trail close to where the visitor center is located. We did the hike before the center opened so I'm not able to comment on it. It's a little over a 5 mile round trip walk but well worth the effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMac511
30,Nice hike to M*A*S*H set!,"As a past fan of the show, M*A*S*H, I truly enjoyed this hike. Despite the drought conditions, there were some lush, green areas along the water making for beautiful photos with the mountains in the background. Came to this park some years back and was a bit dismayed to see how dried up the creek and swimming hole were from the past. Hoping this will turn around. But don't miss the chance to have a nice hike, enjoy the outdoors. The Mash set has a couple old ambulances. Get your steps in, support your State Park, learn about the impact of the drought, seek out the greener view points by the dam, see the Mash set and feel healthy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgomez2468
40,Check out the M*A*S*H set,"We went to Malibu Creek State Park because I was a huge M*A*S*H fan and heard that the old set was there. It's a little tough to find, but once you find Crag Rd (and a place to park--not an easy feat!) it's a nice little hike--about a mile and a half. If you're a fan of M*A*S*H or television history, check this out.There are displays that show how the set was said out, some old vehicles from the show, and the mess tent. It's not an all-day deal, but you can do the whole thing in an hour or two including the hike in and out. Be sure to go beyond the main set to find the old ambulance.My only complaint was that on the hike back, we encountered a snake on the path, not a rattler, but I'm not a big fan of snakes regardless of their toxicity level!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue
50,Nice spot for a walk in the Santa Monica Mountains,"Nice spot for walk in the Santa Monica Mountains in Malibu Creek State parkgrounds with bobcats, coyotes, deer, the local hawks, owls, egrets and big oak trees among a few creeks running through it. Best after a rain to get the best greenscapes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
30,Not impressed!,"I personally didn't find this place amazing, we just went there for a few hours, we didn't camp, but one of the camping areas that we saw didn't have anything extraordinary. The water in the rock pool is dirty (greenish - made me think your can get parasites from there), it was also too small and crowded, I really don't know why many people go there, I rather go to one of the beaches in Malibu. You can also hike there, but again nothing amazing, I would go to Griffith Park instead. I don't discourage you to go, go and visit it yourself maybe you have a different point of view, but as for me I don't think I will be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NFA05
30,DO NOT CAMP HERE!-$40 Rip Off!,"We camped 35 nights this summer, and this was by far the worst maintained place we stayed. There are few choices for camping in the LA area. It is a shame that the state cant do a better job of maintaining this facility, Especially with the ridiculous nightly rate of $40 for a tent site. The drought has left the facility with no grass. Camp sites are barren wastelands of blowing dirt (if it did rain it would be a nightmare). There were not enough dumpsters and trash was overflowing onto the ground. You have no ability to choose your site. All of the sites on one side are on an incline. To the point where it is almost impossible to find somewhere to put your tent. Our picnic table was also on an incline severe enough that you couldnt put a drink down. But it didn't end up mattering because the bees were so bad you couldnt really sit still and eat anyway. The one plus of this place was the camp host. She came around and greeted us when we arrived. And later brought by a snake for the kids to see. BEST camp host of the entire summer! Bathrooms were kept clean, though are dark and there are long lines for the 2 showers. They need to put down some straw at the very least...best would be to install level tent pads at each site. There is so much to do in the area that we didn't even check out the park. I read the water can have high levels of ecoli so be sure to check with the ranger on levels for that day before you swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngmomma
50,"Go EARLY to get great parking, avoid crowds","Go first thing and avoid crowds and have the entire park alone. The park opens at 8 am, and premium parking is available, with no waiting, lines, or crowds.The MASH site is interesting and worth the hike. Note that if arriving early, as suggested, the visitor's center is only open from noon to 4 pm daily.

30,Beautiful nature - OK campground.,"We spent two nights at the campground. Although expensive for the available utilities (hot water for shower is charged), the campground is nice. Most of the sites have scarce shade though.Except a young blond extremely rude and aggressive Ranger, they were very nice. They arranged us to swap our tent site to a more shady one and they reminded us to be more quiet in a courteous manner (we were quite loud until late - sorry neighbors).Besides the campground, we enjoyed the ""Rock Pool"" (lots of cliffs jump) and did some climbing. This is a very beautiful area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zotz34fr

30,Horrible maps but enjoyed the movie connections,"If you looking for a nice, easy and relatively pretty hike, this is a nice park. Don't bother paying for the trail maps as they are posted elsewhere in the park (and you can find them on your phone). But also, they don't help much. I used the GPS on my phone to look at where we were. If you are heading to the MASH filming site, its relatively easy along the road and then a few single file trails towards the end. You can also take two other trails off of it to reach the top of the dam. One lady told me you can swim up there and while it looks pretty I wasn't tempted to go in. But then if you go back down to where the port-a-potties were along the roadway and head towards the river on sort of a rocky path, there is a water hole there where people swim. It will probably take about a half day to complete and better to go in the morning or evening when there is more shade as the sun can be brutal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/czematis

If you want to experience an entirely different topography than the rest of the area offers run, do not walk, to this beautiful park! We entered from the Grassland Trailhead (highly recommend) and were immediately surrounded by gently rolling hills covering in golden vegetation 6' high. Birds were everywhere. The creek which runs through the Park, results in many trees not seen in others areas thriving along its banks. There were cliffs to climb, trails galore and a sense of being transported back in time before so much of the LA area became covered up with hardscapes and people. Thoroughly enjoyed everything about this refuge...bring a picnic and make a day of it if time allows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awatson19

10,No big deal,"Paid $12 to drive through to see what was there. All you can see (from car, at least) is a lot of campsites & dried vegetation. No scenery, facilities, etc. Felt ripped off. We were told we had to pay the $12 b/c there were so many people there. That logic escapes me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dommy2013
50,Hidden Splendor close to LA...site of M.A.S.H. TV show,"This is a great state park right off Malibu Canyon and Mulholland in Calabasas...plenty of great hiking and mountain biking. Historic M.A.S.H. television set is still partially there with some restored items. Rock pool is beautiful area to hike to and see the rock climbers and swim in...be careful jumping off the rocks (very dangerous). Century lake is another pretty hike on the way to M.A.S.H. site. Campground requires advanced reservations and there is a group camp area that can be reserved. Visitors center and museum is small and fun too. There are hikes and bike rides for all levels...depending on your fitness, ability and energy. Beautiful park...worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pheumann01
50,Nice Hiking on a Hot Day,"I spent a few hours hiking in the canyon today, moving from dry conditions to lush, back to dry again, and from open areas to shade to open areas. Some of the creeks were dried right out and others were still glowing.All of these changing conditions kept my interest, even when following the same trail back. I went up to the MASH site and enjoyed the nostalgia of one of my very favourite TV programs. Sometimes the signage was not as clear as it could have been to find the site, but I found it nonetheless. I took many photos, as the windflowers are nicely in bloom with lots of purple, yellow and white blooms. There was a wonderfully smelling patch of sage that was also fun to try to photograph. Some kind of filming going on at one of the creeks near the entrance that had me curious, but I didn't discover what it was for. All and all, a great afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbilmer
50,Easy hike but very pretty,"My husband and I have been trying new hikes each weekend. We visited MASH place this weekend. The flowers are blooming and it is so pretty. Tons of butterflies and birds chirping away. It was so relaxing and pretty. You can wear tennis shoes and shorts, as much of the trail is wide and well paved. There are two small hills to walk up and one area close to the MASH site that is narrow (can't take a stroller through) and rocky. You will find the trail easy to navigate and lots of people. Great for first time hikers or anyone looking for an escape.You can park in the lot for $12.00 for the day. Dogs are not allowed on the trail but in the campground area. Bring your lunch and grill out. What a great place for a picnic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
40,Relaxed and open nature,This place is great for the weekend camper or if you just want to come and spend the day. Its very peaceful and relaxing.

50,M*A*S*H,"Fabulous, easy hike with surprising beauty. As a MASH fan this has been a bucket list wish for a while. Hike about 4 miles round trip into the former film set of the show through lovely trees, around delicate flowers and be impressed with the iconic views you've seen on tv. Stand on the helipad or right at The Swamp signpost and walk around a bit--ropes and sign posts mark where the buildings were.The hike is easy for hikers of all levels but be advised that it is narrow and slightly rocky in places. A trip to Century Lake to sit in the cool shade is lovely too.Absolutely lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Rose_Kansas
40,Great Hike,"My sisters and little nieces ended up in Malibu and since it was such a nice day, we stopped for an hour hike. The trails are nice and wide and clearly marked for easy walking. Very family friendly and you can also take your mountain bike on other trails nearby. We walked through rolling hills and to a prairie with a stream. We stopped at a rest stop where you can buy water/drinks and read about the history of of the state park. A lot of movies were filmed there. Would recommend if you are looking for a non-strenuous walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ticket2Venture

50,Great Hike!,"Beautiful park and a great hike. Pay $12 for parking or park for free on the road outside the Park and walk in. Five miles to the MASH site and takes about 2 hours. A few slight hills, but nothing terrible. Most of the path is wide enough for Park Ranger vehicles. The last mile to the MASH site is narrow and there are rocks to deal with. Not big ones, but they are there.MASH site is fun. A few abandoned vehicles and a replica of the famous direction signpost from the TV Show. The trail is not a loop, so you gotta walk out the way you came in. Lots of other trails which I haven't tried yet. Good for beginners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman

50,Fabulous!!,Beautiful park with plenty of opportunities to enjoy the beauty of the mountains. Even beginners will enjoy the hike. The best part was hiking to the site where M.A.S.H was filmed. Follow well marked signs. It's about a 5 mile hike round trip but so worth it. Also don't pay $12 to park. Parking is available for free along the side road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spidermancowboy

A combination of level, rugged, up hill, down hill, wide trail, narrow trail, with beautiful views and vistas. We did a 5 mile round trip from the parking lot. It had rained heavily last weekend and was starting to green up after a long dry period. Go for it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
50,Love this place!,So peaceful. Lovely place to hike and get out of the city for a bit. Also fun to visit filming locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Beautiful hike,"We took a 3 hour hike through the park today and it was a great time. It was a beautiful day so the sky, rocks and trees were incredible. The birds were out which made it even more interesting.Our docent guide was Dean and he is an expert on the history of the area. It was an easy hike on a groomed trail (most of it was a nice dirt road).We went to the rock pool and watched the rock climbers for a bit. We then stopped at Visitors Center and watched the 7 minute film on clips from the 30+ movies that had been filmed here over the years. Being such a scenic spot, it is no surprise that it is found in lots of Hollywood movies. The visitor center also has displays of the various animals and birds in the area along with info on Chumash Indians which lived here.Being out in the fresh air and getting a bit of exercise was a great way to spend a Saturday morning. Can't wait to go back and hike to other areas of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig-World-Travelle

50,Awesome for MASH fans,My husband is a big time MASH fan. We took the beautiful 2.5 mile hike back the site of the outdoor MASH set. Make sure you watch the opening scenes of a MASH show before you go. You will recognize the scenery when you get there. My husband thought this was AWESOME!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorip849
50,Great camp site ! Great hikes,This is a great place to go for the advanced or beginner camper. They have full bathrooms and showers. They are VERY clean ! Great hiking trails. You must hike to the MASH site. My kids are 8 years old and had no problem doing it and they loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
40,mooi park,"If you like to camp near Los Angeles and you want peace and quite this is the place, It's near Holywood and other interesting places in LA.I have to say the park it's self is also very nice.If we go to Los angeles again we go camping here again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hve2014
50,A must for Planet of the Apes/MASH fans,"This a wonderful stroll, but bring lots of liquid and sun screen for that nutty sun.Parking is over $10 but well worth it to hike right along where Planet of the Apes was filmed along with other movies including a weird 1970s kids TV show called Arc2.The rock pools are a big hangout for teens cliff jumping and playing music, which results in a bit of a messy area, go very early if you want photos sans kids.Ape City was situated at the crossroads of the road for Century Lake, which is not a lake anymore from that vantage point but is near the dam. The hike up the road is the crux of the hike and is flat but rocky after that.The MASH site is well kept up but the historical signs need replacing. Wood stakes are placed where the TV shows tents were. Many picnic tables. BRING WATER!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WelcomeMat
30,Great location; average camping experience,"We camp a lot and this place was just okay. The sites were well-used and I picked up garbage previous campers had left. No grass, just dirt. There were flush toilets, showers and kitchen sinks to use....but the staff were cleaning the facilities starting at 6:00 in the morning, the busiest time for utilizing these places! Despite a burning ban, more than a few campers had fires, which we found very disrespectful. We liked that it wasn't that far from Malibu or freeway 101-accessibility was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christylou60
20,Not Cool!,"This place was horrible. Rude host. Totally clueless ranger staff at kiosk. They have is no trail maps, area guides, or even knew about the swimming hole the website talked about. The swimming hole seems to be spring fed, but is full of bad bacteria...or so the camper with the rash informed us. We wanted to see the MASH tour, but that is through the issuers center which is closed weekdays; we camped tues-thurs. Also, the line the camp posts about no re entry after 10pm and quiet time was bogus. At 11pm a lady in a minivan came asking why we were in a campsite she had reserved? We showed her our handicap placard and our paperwork to appease her and make her stop bothering us, but the intrusion sucked. It was loud and people walked through our campsite freely and used our spigot. We even had items stolen from our campsite. This places sucks. If you need a cheap close campsite for Malibu beaches, use it, but be warned.We had just come from San Onofre State Park, San Nateo campground and it was like night and day. Enough for us to find it hard to believe this was part of the same camp ground chain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mellymel1969

40,Nice hiking for a day trip,Very nice state park that was not overly crowded even on a Memorial Day Weekend. Took the hiking trail to the site where MASH was filmed. A hot day so bring water for the longer hikes. Some people were carrying/dragging coolers to and from the lake (about 45 min walk) and they did not look like they were having fun going up the hill. The main trail to the filming site was well marked but there seemed to be many offshoots to rougher areas that one could explore. It is hilly and there are some vistas with great views. Enjoyable way to spend a day away from the city. There are campgrounds at the park and I can see spending a few days there exploring the park more fully. There are certainly way more hiking trails than we had a chance to see. Saw some people riding mountain bikes on parts of the trails and even some on horses. Great way to get away from the city for a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciaran11
30,Not the best place to put a line,"The location of this park is great. Just 10 minutes driving from US101 and the view is pretty good. The place we went for fishing was the Century Lake. First, you have to take the trail for 1.5 miles before getting to lake. The dam side is noisy with music and people crossing and swimming sometimes so it is not for anglers. There are some places for fishing if you follow the trail further. The lake is not stocked so maybe you'd better try somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saturnhp
30,Got lost!,I was so excited to go cliff jumping in the rock pool but we couldn't find it. I'm from Sacramento and I was really looking forward to going there. We spent a good 2 hours hiking and people were just pointing us in different directions. It was hot and I was really looking forward to swimming. I would love to go back and maybe get some accurate directions. Besides that it's a beautiful park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maccnassskin
50,lovely easy loop trail,Easy hike with spectacular views. If you want more of a challenge there are trails off of the loop that are a bit more strenuous. Go early or late to beat the heat in the summer. Bring a water bottle. Take care around the water people have been injured diving off the rocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Les_Calabasas
50,Hikes for everyone,"Malibu Creek is a beautiful State Park in the Santa Monica mountains. Best seasons to hike are late fall, winter and spring. Summer days can be very hot. This is an old movie site. Many of the movies are listed on a plaque near the little museum. The museum is only open on Saturday and Sunday. The television show M.A.S.H. Was filmed here and is a hiking destination. Wild flower season usually starts in February if we have rain. You can pick up maps and information for the Sant Monica Mountains at the near by King Gillette Ranch. This is a wonderful hiking destination. There is a rock climbing area near the rocky pool. Parking and entrance fees are $12 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
40,Hike to history - enjoy the beauty and few remnants,"I loved the approximately 5 mile hike bit felt the MASH site wasn't makes well. And understated. I didn't expect Ferris wheels, nor are they there, but a sign, mess hall resting place and a few rusted vehicles don't pay proper tribute for the amount of people taking the trekBeautiful hike. Paths not marked very well for this novice. Gorgeous views, which is the ultimate treat! Having some signs, visuals of paths to different areas, would be helpful.Would do it again but earlier in the day. When the sun went down it was very dark and very chilly. I was warned. Just not a native. Thankfully was with a well traveled hiker who knew the paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEVenturer
50,Beautiful views! A great break from the city.,"I enjoyed a beautiful morning at Malibu Creek last weekend. The trails are well marked and the map (totally worth $2!) was so helpful in navigating the area. I started out on Crags Road to the M*A*S*H site - an easy 2.3 mile stroll through wooded areas. This was definitely the most heavily traveled section. I then backtracked and crossed over to hike toward to Reagan Ranch. I was expecting a still-standing estate but was very disappointed when I learned it was just an old barn! Still, it was fun to see the land that Reagan loved so much and spoke of in his book. Everyone was very friendly and the bikers and horseback riders were very respectful on the trails. I didn't go into the visitor center - the hours were pretty limited. Overall, a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
50,MASH AND A MILLION OTHER FILMS!,"Malibu Creek State Park is one of those wonders that you really have to want to enjoy! It takes some open-eyed driving, some hard walking and some perseverance and faith that a mountain lion, coyote or rattler won't come after you. In short, know how to walk in the wild and be careful and you will LOVE this place! First of all, to get there, you either come from the west, from the Pacific Coast Highway on Malibu Canyon Road, by Pepperdine University, or from the east off the 101 at Los Virgenes Road in Calabasas. Either way is scenic, the drive from the west through tall canyons and from the east, through beautiful meadows and foot hills. Part of the old Paramount Movie Ranch, it has now been reclaimed by the foliage, but still you will recognize parts of it from many movies and TV shoes, especially Westerns. The parking lot as you enter was, among other films, the scene of Elvis Presley's cabin in his first film, ""Love Me Tender"". As you walk along the creek, you will note that this has been in so many westerns you can't count them all. Across the little bridge is a maintenance shed that has photos of many of the films and TV shows filmed here, although it is rarely opened. Then, just past the bridge, you get off the path and walk over scree and rocks to the Rock Pool, the scene of so many films, such as ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Tarzan"", etc. But the jewel of this park's crown is the location where both the film and TV show ""MASH"" was filmed. Now, you have to know where to find it and it takes some work to get there, and you MUST be aware of your surroundings around you, since there is loose rock on the trail, trees and branches strewn across it, and rattlers, mountain lions and coyotes lurking about, none of which want to have anything to do with you if they can help it, but be wary just the same. You will go up a dirt trail, the main trail, which has been the scene of too many epic films to list here (see IMDB).You will go past Century Lake - keep going. You will eventually see a small bridge off to your left; cross it. There are 2 trails, one to your left and an overgrown one to your right that you have to look hard to find. That is the right one. Years ago, to discourage bike riders to go to the site, the trail was allowed to get grown over and the service road covered over with foliage. There is a small running creek to your right. You will think, ""NO way"" is there anything here on this trail! Be of stout heart as about 30-45 minutes into the trail, it clears into a valley and to your left, you will see where the hill where the chopper pad was, with some of the steps still there, and straight ahead of you, you will see a rusted out jeep, the only remnants of the filming, as the rest was destroyed by wildfire years ago. As you look up from the valley, you will see the familiar peaks to your right and also recognize this as where Elvis had his last gunfight in ""Love Me Tender"", in the rocks above. I caution you - it is not easy to get there and does not seem a likely place to have a trail - and like all California State Parks, you need to be wary of the other inhabitants of the Park, either four-legged, or slithering in the brush. Practice good woodmanship - and bring someone with you. I have always gone solo, and when I hear rustling in the bushes, it is an unsettling feeling, but I have come out alright each time, having to yell at the occasional coyote standing in the middle of the trail, and jumping gingerly over a snake or two, sunning itself in the middle of the path. Make plenty of noise so the others know that a human is coming and will do their best to get out of your way. The park is a masterpiece and if you are a nature of film fan, you'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonphil
40,Biking to the set of M*A*S*H,"Had a great adventure biking to the set of the classic TV hit, M*A*S*H. It was 14 miles round trip and it was way cooler than I had expected.

50,Gorgeous Scenery,"I am not really into movies, but I have heard that several movies and TV shows have been filmed here. As I was driving towards the park they were filming what looked like an Aston Martin Commercial on the road. Park has stunning views, if you hike or mountain bike the backbone trail from Malibu Canyon road, it climbs roughly 2400 feet in 6 miles, super strenuous, but fun for me. You can start it with about a half mile of singletrack that turns into the fire road and continues to climb from there. Nice views of Malibu as well as the pacific, next time I want to be here when the sun sets!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinjaJeff
50,brief report Malibu Stat3e Park,"Haven t been here for awhile. Good for level mountainbiking. You can see rocks where Planet Apes filmed and where Swiss Family Robinson filmed with Linda Hunt. She was young . You can see Jeep from Mash. that was a 70 show ,don t know if anyone under 30 would remember. You can fish in Century Lake. Go in early spring. I think they even have camping there go to Santa Monica Mountains website. Close to SF valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayakPhil
50,Simply beautiful,"You can't believe that such a beautiful wilderness area exists so close to LA. The drive on Mulholland from Las Virgenes Rd. toward Cornell is incredible too.The parking at the Park is a little pricey. Some people park on the corner of Las Virgenes and Mulholland and walk in to save the parking cost. But, be careful and hide valuables. There seems to be lots of car break-ins there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbabbington
50,Malibu Creek State Park is A-OK,"The scenery is really nice. But the creek is at the bottom of a little canyon. So you can't really see the water unless you scale down these really steep dirt cliffs, which you can tell a lot of people have been doing. Good for horses and bikes. Dogs are supposed to be on a leash. Tons of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackbettyblog
40,Hike to MASH site,Nice short fairly easy hike out to the MASH site where the famous TV show was filmed. Make sure you take lots of water and wear sunscreen as theres not alot of shade. Trails were easy to follow with adequate signage. The hike is very quiet and peaceful and had few fellow hikers on the trail. The parking fee to get into the park was steep. There are bathroom facilities and picnic tables. While in the area take a trip over to the Parmount ranch to see the old western town used in Dr Quinn Medicine woman and then go to King Gillete Ranch and maybe you'll see some of the Biggest loser contestants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/me1300n
50,Great Hike!,"I'm reluctant to share since I don't want the place to get crowded. This is a great hike and a great place to wander. There's an area where people swim and rock climb towards the bottom of the hill and another, large pond at the top of the dam. It's perfect in the summer (as long as you don't mind algae). Bring your walking shoes and a picnic!Parking is $12 or you can park on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freejinn
50,Awesome Place to Camp,"I really liked this state park for camping. There was enough space between the camp site for a little privacy. The rangers were incredibly friendly and helpful. The facilities were clean and well maintained. The park is full of wildlife, deer are everywhere. It's close enough to L.A that the commute to the city and the tourist attractions was pretty easy. It's also the location of the M.A.S.H site, an easy hour and half hike to the set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieb251
50,Peaceful,"I went hiking with my husband and a friend at Malibu Creek State Park on a recent trip to California. My husband and I love M.A.S.H. so we wanted to check out the old set, which is in the park. The park is gorgeous. Moderate hike with marked trails. We hiked about 7 miles total. There happened to be a lot of cloud cover that morning so it didn't get hot until we were nearly finished. Found a beautiful swimming spot, but we weren't prepared for a dip, so we just rested there for a few minutes. The M.A.S.H. set was pretty cool. The areas of the set are marked out with rope so you can see where the various tents and buildings were. Part of the mess tent is still up, along with some of the vehicles that were left. Right outside Santa Monica and easy to locate. It's a peaceful place to escape the busy life in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AudKat
50,Wonderful hike!,"Spent the day in the park hiking on two trails: Century Lake and Rock Pool. Neither hike to too strenuous, some uphill, but nothing major. Rock Pool is a gathering of ""swimmers"" that like to jump off of rock formations into the water...if you dare....not exactly fresh water....stagnate on the pools edges. Century Lake is an oasis after walking up hill. It is very refreshing and filled with lilly pads. Resembles more of a pond than a lake. The park was once Century's back lot to multiple films...check out the visitor center to see the short video. Better yet, hike to the area they filmed M.A.S.H. Great gem tucked in hills of Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0001DogzRule
50,Great Place for Hiking,Easy hiking trails. Nice by the lake. Stay away from the dam. Have always enjoyed hiking here in the Santa Monica mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agoura53
40,A wild place to camp,"Stayed in the park one night, the scenery is amazing and their was quite a lot of wildlife around (quite disturbing when you can hear coyotes fighting in the middle of the night). Quite basic amenities, make sure you visit the toilets before dark as the light didn't work for me! We had the sheriff and another patrol car come and do a drive through in the evening, I didn't know whether to be re-assured or worried by this fact.All in all quite a basic site as expected but worth it for the location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761RobW
30,Expensive park with some neat sights,"We camped in their campground which was expensive for what you got. It was a massive field and the dumpsters were full the entire stay (3 days) the sights however were great. The MASH sight was really cool and the hikes were very scenic. If you want a day trip go here, but don't camp here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoliSciGuy24
50,Mini-Yosemite,"Malibu Creek State Park is truly extraordinary. There are many different and varied hiking trails. You can take a fairly easy trail that takes you by the M*A*S*H* show set. There are trails that take you to waterfalls, a lake/reservoir, and beautiful rock formations. I highly recommend this park. It is a California gem. The only negative for me is that dogs aren't allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roa5980

50,Great Hiking,"Great place to hike! Bring plenty of water, as it gets very hot along the trail...and good hiking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bldchick
40,Not much shade in the campground,"This area is beautiful for sure and there is lots to do. But if you are camping, just be aware that there is very little shade if you are tent camping. Some spots are great but it's first come, first served. Luckily we found a spot between two trees to block morning and afternoon sun. But during the day, it would have been a scorcher if we stayed around there. Everything else was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ackHouston
50,Magnificent natural beauty!,"The park land are almost 8,000 acres, including a recently added King Gillette Ranch, across the road from the main park. Yes, it's the man who invented and manufactured the disposable razor. His home was designed in the 1920's by famed architect Wallace Neff.The majority of the park's lands were donated by Bob Hope and later purchased were from Paramount and 20th Century Fox movie ranches, where filming dated back to the 1930s with three Tarzan movies and more recently, both the feature film and the TV series of M*A*S*H*. Other famous films include Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Towering Inferno and many more.The park offers bird watching, hiking, camping, mountain biking, rock climbing, swimming, picnicking and camping. Some of the better known trees include Coast Live Oak, California Sycamore and California Black Walnut.There's something for everyone here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Fun,Malibu Creek is a great place for half day hiking and day hiking and is great for kids. The creek is great for swimming in! There's also a reservoir another 15-20 minutes (maybe) that is good for swimming and less crowded. One of my favorite things here is the rock climbing! And also the MASH site where there are still remnants and replicas of from the set of MASH!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahD359
40,Swimming Hole Hike,"A short walk of ~30mins from the parking lot and you're in a valley of rocks creating a beautiful swimming hole. With water depths ranging from 2' to 12' deep, the people you see jumping off cliffs and boulders are sure having fun.Pack a picnic lunch, some water, sandals, and a towel for a great summer time activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F454QYpaulg
50,Greak Place To Hike!,"Take a stroll long the riparian Oaks and visit Rock Pool or the old Mash set, for a bit of Hollywood in the Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MobileNomad
20,Perhaps not a place for old farts,"Was impressed with all the reviews that I read about this Park. The California people must be extremely adventurous, in good physical condition, and absolutely fearless.Others might see a very dangerous adventure through rattlesnake country, wild animals with rabies, and about as much fun is going through an Army obstacle course under fire.Pay your money and take your choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSwedishBeaver
50,Always a great hike,Lots of paths and well marked. casual as well as more intense if you look for those trails. Very close to where I stay and just a scenic park to relax or look for an intense hike. A great getaway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbord1
50,GORGEOUS,"I am the kind of hiker that likes to take the little overgrown, not so traveled trails and this park has SOOOO MANYYYY. From waterfalls, to lakes, to rocks to climb, cliffs to look out over, this park has it all. Picnic tables for families, and even a nice little equestrian center if you are into that. I highly recommend this place for any kind of outdoors fun you are looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Ashley7Boo7
50,MUST SEE,"If I had to go to one place in Los Angeles, it would be to the Malibu Lagoon. I love nature and the uniqueness of this estuary. You will see beautiful white egrets, pelicans, sea gulls, terns and native fauna. It's quiet and a great way to end a busy day. The beach is full of local surfers nearby, making for a nice picnic spot. Nearby there are lovely Malibu shops and you must stop at GROMS for ice cream. The Malibu Library nearby also offers a quiet spot to read or do research or what not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaidsylvia
50,"Hiking, Rock Climbing, Swimming & Picnic-ing!","Had an incredible time hiking, rock climbing, swimming and picnic-ing here. An absolutely beautiful place :) And it's where they filmed the classic Planet of the Apes and M.A.S.H.!

40,Hike Through a Movie Ranch,There isn't much left today of the sets from countless 2oth Century Fox productions shot here. You might recognize some locations from the first Planet of the Apes movie and sometimes docents set out signs labeling where the tents for the MASH TV series were set up. What there is are miles of scenic hike trails through beautiful California chaparral and oaks. It is park of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and surrounded by many other parks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
20,Too expensive!,"We have an rv and were looking for a place to stay near Malibu. By the time we figured up the cost of the space, the extra car and the dog, the cost was prohibitive. Plus the spaces were very small. Could not fit a larger sized motor home in most of the spaces. It was a beautiful location, just much too expensive for a state park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222KatherineS
50,Wonderful park,"Great place to walk your dog and/or take a hike. Weekdays are less crowded than weekends. It is quiet and beautiful, especially in the spring when all the trees are in bloom and the smells are divine:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaF790
50,Lovely hike and MASH site,"On this visit to LA, I really wanted to hike to the site where MASH was filmed. It was an easy hike with only one long hill, that I remember. It was less than 5 miles round trip and fairly well marked. There were a couple places we came to and wondered which way to go. Taking the most logical choice and checking with other hikers, we chose the right way each time. We were rewarded with an easily recognizable location. The site was marked with signs showing where the various ""tents"" from the show had been during filming. The OR/Post OP/ offices were roped off to give you an idea of the set. Things were much closer than they appeared in the show. We climbed the hill to the helicopter pad. This was a lot of fun if you are a MASH fan. Before the hike we stopped at the nearby visitor center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to get our directions and map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShurleyUSA
40,Great Spot but you have to pay,A great hike into the Santa Monica Mountains. Depending on the time of the year you can chill in the pool. Depending on your rock climbing/bouldering skills you can get to the spots away from the rest. The steep hill sides are fun to explore too. Watch out for the poison oak.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZachR899

50,check out the backbone trail,"The backbone trail takes you to awesome views- the sea to the left and mountains to the right. I liked it a lot!Don't forget to deposit the $10 in the box at the parking lot, though! It will make the parking fee higher by $62.50 ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEE239

50,"Great Hike, Except the mud....",This is a great hike to the M*A*S*H site. Beware of muddy trails. We passed some bikers that could not complete the trail because of mud. Excellent movie location at the end. Superb scenery!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troym960
50,"Hiking, Views, Climbing, Sunshine","Situated above the Pacific Ocean between Malibu to the west and Agoura Hills to the east, this park offers excellent trails for all levels, plus a wall made famous by Planet of the Apes for those interested in climbing or rappelling. Best time to go is in the spring, winter, or fall, as the summer does get very hot. Although this is ""Malibu Creek"", the temperature in this park is often 10+ degrees warmer than Malibu by the shore. So don't worry if it's chilly and overcast by the ocean, just drive up to this park and you'll enjoy California's warmth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jami674
50,A gen in LA,"Malibu Creek is a fantastic area. It could seem like civilazation is far away, but it's pretty close. Hikes from short to intense, mountain biking. About 2.5 mile hike to where they filmed MASH. Great rock formations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uphill01
50,Spectacular Nature so close to LA,"Deserves to be listed as an attraction close to Malibu, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Hollywood, Pacific Palisades, etc. But because tripadvisor puts it as an attraction in Calabasas, it is very hard for travelers to find, if blindly searching for something to do near those other areas. I mean, seriously, who's going to be staying in Thousand Oaks and know to search for attractions in Calabasas????Okay, now that my grumble is out of the way, I want to praise the staff of this park for being so friendly, welcoming, and taking such good care of the trails. I want to thank all the visitors we met while also hiking the trails and admiring the autumn colors, good weather, MASH set, visitor center, picnic areas, rock pools, Century Lake, etc. Everyone takes a lot of care to put their litter in the bear-proof bins, says hello as you pass them, etc etc.It's a large expanse of beauty, with hikes for all abilities, full of breathtaking vistas (rock formations, hills, lakes, streams, etc) and good mix of shade and open. Great visitor's centre! They've got animal displays, interpretive leaflets to take for free, historic info. There's even a short video of SOME of the dozens of films shot there.A great activity for a solo traveler in a meditative mood or a group who want to get a fix of nature in LA's vast concrete jungle. BYO water and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrugalMillionaire
50,One of my favorite camping spots.,"Everything's great about Malibu Creek. The hiking, the mountains, the ocean, you cannot go wrong. And it's so close to home. The hike to the M*A*S*H set is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233LindaC
30,Very Hot in Summer with almost no shade.,This is a rather remote park that is close to Los Angeles. Great Bike Path but very little shade and very hot in the summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinp176
40,Great for groups!,"My family and I recently enjoyed this campground with a group from our church. We stayed in individual campsites the first night and then moved to the group campground for the following two nights. The individual campsites were ok. The problem there were the hornets, which attacked several campers. Other than that, this was a great place. The group site is nice because is away from all the other campsites. It has three structures with two showers each as well as bathrooms. It also has outdoor sinks which were rather convenient for cooking a washing hands. The showers, by the way, have hot water. A plus! Nothing like camping and actually being able to feel clean. The only down side is that the parking is a little ways from the actual camping site. That means you have to haul your stuff, uphill...to the camping site. But once you are settle it is pretty nice. We got to see deer in the early morning and evening. The campground is spacious and great for the kids to run around. The place to set the tents is shaded and flat enough. We would definitely go back there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peacemomma
50,One of my very favorite places in SoCal...,"Definitely be sure to get the map that includes all the trails, including those in the area that are outside the park. I love this place so much I moved to Calabasas, after spending a winter hiking the trails. The Goat Buttes are breathtaking, especially in the morning and evening, or when the marine layer covers them in mist. The campground is expensive, so you may want to sleep elsewhere and come for the day. I have an annual day pass--it's worth it! These are small mountains, but lovely. Be sure to read up on the history of the park. This place is a miracle of modern conservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VoyagerLosAngeles
50,peace & quiet,"...In LA? Absolutely. In Malibu State Park it feels like you are in a far away woodsy oasis, the only interruptions are the horse riders trotting around which only make it that much more inviting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiek884

50,Need to Get Away?,Malibu Creek State Park is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of LA. A short drive and the big city is all but forgotten! There is a great swimming hole and tons of great (and easy) hiking to be had. Swing by the The Old Place for lunch and it's a day worth bragging about on Monday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198SteveS

50,Great Place to Hike,"This is a beautiful piece of chaparral scenery with a stream and lake and plenty of good trails. It has plenty of flat areas for easy walking and some steeper trails to get a good workout as well as a rock-climbing area. See the Matilija Poppies bloom in May and June. If you are adventurous, hike the 14 mile loop through the park and back through Tapia Park. Part of the hike will include beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuckPass

50,Childhood memories,I grew up down the street from this park and have been a million times. Despite that I always enjoy the nature and seem to always find some surprise undiscovered beauty. It can get busy and it can get hot so I would recommend going very early. If it's been a nice rainy season you'll find lovely streams and ponds to cool off in or just to let the sound calm you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero
50,A Piece of Hollywood History,"My wife and I went here early in the morning to do a trail run back to the MASH site. Weather was great, and the scenery was beautiful. We also stopped to visit several locations from the 1968 Planet of the Apes.Tip: If you get there early enough, you can park outside the park and not have to pay the $12 parking fee. Good parking available near the intersection of Mulholland and Las Virgenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpacraig
20,Did not rate looked quite dirty,We stopped for about 10 minutes and were really disapointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christophergiles
10,Review of camp ground,"I just spent 2 days camping there. We camped at spot #7. It's right across from the Host of the campground. I do not recommend this spot or #9 this spot had VERY uneven ground. If you have a pup tent you'd be ok.(Annoying) I can't tell you how many times I heard the rangers tell kids to get off their bikes because they were not wearing a helmet This being said bring your childs bike helmet if they are going to ride around on their bikes.Personally we thought camp # 61,62 were the best. More privacy and the best views. We were meeting up friends and that's why we camped there. But we really didn't like the camp ground. There are to many camp spots jammed in. So many people. Very little shade. HOT! The camp spots are VERY close to the road that everyone drives around to get to their spot. We had to constantly watch the road while our toddler was exploring. (stressful)There were some families that camped in the inner circle (look at a map) they were able to set up t ball and other games. But I heard that the inner circle was for RV's. Check to see if this is true.The bathroom were clean when we arrived on Friday. I don't think they were maintained over the weekend. Bring TP. I would call this urban camping.Also depending on the fire conditions you may not be able to have a fire. We were there(medium threat code yellow) and they said charcoal fires were ok. This included Duraflame logs in the fire pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malleyoh
50,Ideal for MASH fans,"It's about a 5 mile round-trip, easy hike to the site where the MASH TV show filmed outdoor scenes. It's a nice hike for anyone who likes the outdoors, but it's special for MASH fans, and we are avid ones. It was a thrill to be right at the location where they filmed. There's a small shed with a photo display, ropes marking off the main tent locations, a replica of the camp signpost, a couple old vehicles, and a few signs explaining things.Now when we watch reruns of the show, it's fun to see areas we recognize.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuffaloJim
50,Friday night date night,"My husband and I drive through the park every friday evening before we go to dinner concidering this drive the best part of our ""date night"" we went last Friday night and was told we needed to pay $12.00 for a 10 minute drive.We have done this drive for years and are so disappointed ,I can understand if we were going in hiking but only a drive for 10 min drive ,why?????

50,the perfect place to go relax and explore!,"I had, I can say the best experience of my life here at Malibu state creek, when I talk about experience I mean actual value for money and things to do and very very memorable.We visited first just to walk up to the MASH site, which was a wonderful walk, we decided we would book in the following weekend and enjoy camping there. Its rare to find nice rangers, I mean polite and down to earth, but that is what we found here.we chose a good spot, just over from the shower block, set up the tent and started the bbq. the air was clear and clean, and the smell of the trees amazing.camping is always great, but here, its amazing you really feel safety.Following day, went for the walk up to the mash site again, on the way back dropped by the museum there.. very interesting. There is something in the air there.. everyone seems to be relaxed!About the mash site... if you are an avid mash fan, its easy to spot many of the places used in the series, the site itself has been almost totally abandoned, with only the Helipad left as something clearly identifiable. There is a burnt out and rusted jeep, which is fun for fotos (if you are mash fan, you will know this jeep) and there is an ambulance half burried in the shrub.From the Heli pad, you can you see more, the walk or trek to the site is most interesting, its not too difficult, but make sure you wear good footwear, we saw one family who had to turn back as they were wearing slippers, and you really cannot walk there with slippers.Take a good camera and take bottles of water. I think the walk took us about an hour and half.. but its worth it.if you like the outdoors,,,, then.. go for it!... you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cathaycaptain
50,First visit to Malibu Creek State Park and it won't be our last,We spent 4 wonderful nights at the campground just last week! It was great! The campground is clean and the camp host was so sweet! She came by to every new camper to introduce herself and check if we had any questions. The showers and bathrooms were cleaned daily (8:00AM) like clock-work. For the most part it was very quiet through out the day and evening. There was a family reunion group that showed up on Friday for the weekend that got kind of loud but I'm sure that is not the norm. The camp sights are first come first served after you have a reservation. I wish you could reserve specific sites because some are small and would not be suitable for more than a small family. The rangers were very nice about letting you move if the site didn't suit your needs. I must say they were the nicest set of rangers I have ever encountered at a state park. Sometimes they are on a power trip and are not very friendly but these people were awesome!! We can't wait to go back again next year!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casunlover1
50,We go every year!,"I love, love, love this campground. It is always clean, the people are nice, and it is only 10 minutes away from the beach.Our family goes every year and each year we see something new. The campground is not too big and not too small. The bathrooms and showers are unbelievable clean. The staff is always nice and helpful.The Rock Pool is a good hike for those with small kids but the water itself can sometimes be dirty so if you plan to go in the pool make sure you don't open your mouth. The hike up to Century Lake is not a good idea for kids who need to be carried but it is a great hike. People rock climb, jump from rocks into the rock pool, hike, bike, and just have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsguevara
40,Ok place for a 4 Night camping trip,"We arrived at the campsite on a Wed at around 2:30 and check in is at 2:00 first come first serve (even if you have reservation) . There was no ranger when we drove in so we were not sure what to do at first so we decided just to pick a spot. The camp grounds is oval shaped with sites on the outside of the main road and sites in the middle. The middle campsites have very little shade if any. The outside campgrounds have trees but it is also very limited. We found that the the right side of the campground is inundated with poison ivy, but those were the only campsites available with a little bit of shade. The bathrooms and showers are very clean and we noticed they were washed out at least twice during our stay and restocked with toilet paper every other day. There is a camp host that was in site #8 who was very nice (her name was Beverly I believe), she was very helpful and came around once in awhile to see if everything was ok. We seen a lot of deer, at close range too, squirrels which are everywhere and gophers which have created homes in every single campsite. Probably the worst part of the trip were the bees that came every time we opened the cooler !! I'm exaggerating, but it did seem like there were always bees. We enjoyed ourselves overall though and the area is very beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swan94577
50,See the M*A*S*H filming site and more.,"Malibu Creek State Park has photogenic mountains, lakes, pools, and creeks, and is one of my favorite parks in the Los Angeles area. The original Planet of the Apes movie and the TV show MASH both filmed scenes there.The hike to the MASH filming site is about 5 miles round-trip. A short detour from the MASH site hike leads to Rock Pool, where Planet of the Apes scenes were filmed.There is a map of the MASH site hike that includes the detour to Rock Pool at mydreamcametrue.com/MASH",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4amazingadventures
40,Mountain view and parking,"I visited Malibu Creek Park on Easter Sunday. This is my first time to the park. Since I have read reviews and learned the parking fee is $12 per car. I go by myself and for one person , the parking is a bit too steep. However, since i read plenty of reviews before my first visit. I am aware of the possibility of free parking. When I arrive early on the morning, instead of driving into the parking lot. I find a spot at Mulholland hwy. There is a short cut into the park.The canyon views are gorgeous. But wear sturdy sneaker since the dirt road is full of stones.It's a good work out and you sweat a lot. I did find the creek and try to meditate there. No spot since it's people everywhere. Finally, I got a picnic table under the tree and I composed a letter under the shade. Overall, good park but be prepared for long walks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Truth03
40,A great place if you want to stay close to Los Angeles,"Nice Campsite, Nice trails, a little busy once you go into the park.The water is not pristine at all actually I would not fish or swim in it.Overall a good experience and I would go back ,especially if it was spontaneous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gfronti
50,Fantastic! Best place to camp with an RV in LA!,"We sort of chanced upon this place during our week in LA.

Had so much fun swimming and watching people jump from tremendous heights into the water. Very easy ,short, and beautiful hike.Tons of bees today...un-bee-lievable amounts. Someone left a liter of open soda in the bushes, so the bees went crazy and flooded the whole area.My only wish is that people would throw their trash away. There are lots of trash cans around. I personally carry all of my trash out with me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZFamily4
40,Malibu Creek Campground - Nice Place,"We stayed two nights March 2010 in a 24 ft RV. Some of the sites look pretty small, but backing in, we were surprised just how many big sized RVs actually fit. There was a spot for at least the one big rig we saw there (first site just as you pull in), but I'm doubting they would've fit elsewhere. There was a community water spicket every couple of sites or so. I know people filled up their tanks, but I'm sure you are not actually allowed to stay connected. There's a dump station on the way out. The sites are clean, open, and on pavement, surrounded by wild grass. Ours was fairly level, others looked pretty sloped. The website clearly said NO campfires, but I guess their policy is that you actually can have a small fire if the fire danger is low. You just won't know what the danger is until you arrive. Same with your campsite, you are assigned a site when you arrive, even if you reserved a specific site. We had #59 and it was very nice; we thought, one of the nicest for the time of year. Backed amongst the hills would've otherwise been the nicest, but it created too much shade for the cold weather that we had that weekend.Before we even got out of our RV, we had already seen three deer so that was pretty cool. We continued to see them grazing in the various meadows and the people next to us also saw a pack of coyotes by our sites. There are tons of trails to take all right from the campground. The most notable trail probably being the one to Rock Pool. It's right across the bridge from the Nature/Visitor's Center (which I believe is only open at noon on Sat, Sun), which was a good spot to visit and learn about the area and even watch a little video on the film (and M*A*S*H) history. BTW, the walk/bikeride to both of those locations was a leisurely stroll along a fireroad. The Pool itself was nice to look at, but no one was swimming in it from what we saw...much too cold...and a little yucky/murky looking for our taste. Also a FYI, if you are on your way to Rock Pool and you start ascending up a little hill and making a few turns, you've past the trail to the Rock Pool, but if you continue on you'll find Century Lake. (We had to get off our bikes and walk it; not actual bicyclists, just people who like to ride bikes sometimes.) The trail is off to the left just as the ascent seizes and the trail just reads ""No Bikes Allowed"". Follow that down a nice shaded path about 200 feet. There were a group of guys there that said they were fishing for Talapia. (For the Rock Pool, there was a sign/marker that said ""Rock Pool"" and when we went it, the sign was just a few feet from an outhouse in an opening along the creek, again, opposite side of the Nature Center (which looks like a white house). Lots of good rock climbing back there and also a good amount of people, but certainly worth visiting if you happen to be in the area. Although, if I was traveling through from another area, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to see it. (We made the trip from RIverside; about 1 1/2 hrs away. Three hours in traffic. Ugh!) There are lots of other gorgeous areas in the Los Angeles and San Bernardino Mountains that aren't as heavily visited. The true beauty of this one, in my opinion, is the fact that it SUCH an oasis amongst the sprawling Los Angeles metropolis. For that, it is a very special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolYH
50,This is MY backyard....,"I moved to the area recently, and I have fallen in love with this park. Some hikes are easy, but with a little creativity they can become challenging. You can visit the Rock Pool (made famous by the original Planet of the Apes), Century Lake, and even the former M*A*S*H TV series location. Be sure to stop by the Visitor Center--the staff there are friendly and informative. There is aninteresting history surrounding the place and worth a day (or two) to explore.But always remember--treat the area and its wildlife with respect, because it is my backyard after all..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacob_Fargon

Watch out for Rattle snakes, we saw a Hawk drop one that it had killed. Pretty cool stiff for 20 mins outside the city of LA! anyway afterwards head though the mountains turn right on the OCH go about a 1 Mile and have dinner at Malibu seafood! Malibus best kept secret, well not really the line is always out the door, but fresh seafood, at fair prices right across from undeveloped beach in Malibu! cant be beat, and if the season is right stop at one of the road side fruit stands for some of the best Cherries and strawberries California has to offer!
