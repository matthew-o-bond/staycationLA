50,Fun brewery with free trivia,We had fun on a night of trivia at our table tasting the beer. He's a fellow Ohioan too. Wish the exterior was a little better lit but inside was friendly. Big wood tables.,jennybucks1
50,"excellent beer, relaxed atmosphere","Modern warehouse industrial ambiance. Staff knows beer, but the selection at this moment is somewhat limited. A greater depth of beer styles would make Lincoln perfect. Nonetheless, it's still excellent.Basically empty on a Wednesday evening. At 9:30 p.m. when my Uber driver picked me up he asked “Is this a private place or is it open to the public?” That’s how dead it is!“Liberator”- an Imperial IPA that goes down easy, perhaps too easy. Good depth, lots of IBUs, overall smooth and great.“Subtle Smirk” – nice, balanced IPA with some fruity notes. Wasn’t in a mood to capture details. So my apologies for the abbreviated descriptions. But I was impressed with the quality of the beer.Overall cleanliness: above averageBathroom cleanliness: average",utfiero
50,Best brewery in Burbank!,"I love going to this place! I come here a couple times a month. If you are in Burbank, you need to stop by. Good beer and great staff. Mike is awesome. He welcomes my dog and is very accommodating. I have brought kids here since it is usually kids friendly. You can go here and walk to the Burbank airport in 30 minutes to board a plane; vice versa.",NickMcNally
40,Great family owned business,"Although a little difficult to locate (a picture of the front of the business will accompany review). Mike was awesome. Gave some great touristy advise. As far as the beer goes, the 1861 lager (5.0 ABV) is a nice crisp lighter beer. Although not an IPA guy, my buddy like the Wrestler (7.0 ABV). If we were staying in the area I would come back. Very family oriented. Way to go Mike!",crpaul
40,Neat Taproom,"This is a neat taproom. The spacious interior provides ample seating mostly in the form of large picnic style tables. We visited late on a Thursday night, so we had a table to ourselves. There are various activities like darts, cornhole, and board games available. The overall vibe and decor is fantastic.More importantly, they have a solid beer selection. We went with a taster flight plus a few extra to get a good representation of their offerings. I particularly enjoyed their Subtle Smurk IPA. The rest were pretty good but nothing outstanding, to be perfectly honest. It all depends on personal taste of course.The service was friendly and helpful. For instance, when I ordered their Anytime Fiesta, which is a spiced up version of their red ale, the bartender also gave me a little of the original beer for comparison (the Rail Splitter).It was definitely a great way to end our evening and a worthwhile visit if you're in the area.",thedlr
50,Great beer served in a welcoming atmosphere,My wife and I love Lincoln Beer Company. We'll often choose either Lincoln on a weekend night and the Brewyard in the same evening. It depends on the food trucks. With that said the Brewyard and Lincoln Beer Company are quite different. The Brewyard is more laid back while the Beer Company is a more happening place. A bit loud at times and very welcoming to families (a real bonus) the Lincoln Beer Company is a great place to enjoy a beer and a meal from a changing list of mostly reliable food trucks. We'll definitely be back.,Mark J
