30,Pretty view,"Pretty view, quiet spot, historic; if you're close its a nice stop but I wouldn't go out of my way. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliviafataevents
30,"Off the beaten path by breaking the law, so be aware","This is a pretty cool spot and definitely off the beaten path. I came here with a friend of mine after running around San Pedro, so this was a bonus point afterwards. It's definitely cool to check out and fun to see some of the graffiti. Understand however that you are breaking the law and trespassing. And the journey over here can be a little risky and potentially dangerous. It's all depending on you and your personal fitness. If you're a clumsy, unbalanced person with bad equilibrium, think twice about it. You may fall over and tumble down to the bottom and die. Not the worse way to go out because at least you'll be in the ocean and apart of the life cycle. If you can avoid all that, it's a neat little area that awaits you. And no matter where you decide to sit and chill out, you will get an amazing view of the city.On average most people will not get caught and will be totally fine entering and returning from the Sunken City. However, cops sometimes will be waiting near the entrance trying to bust people, so yeah, take precaution. Either way, very cool place and perfect view of the ocean and Catalina Islands.NOTE: I was hearing stuff from locals that they the city is thinking of making this place a tourist attraction at some point. Again, that's at SOME POINT so who knows how long that will take. So yeah, just go visit while you're in the area. It's a great spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanBigBossMan
50,Exciting adventure,The way to get into this area would make anyone weary but it was definitely worth breaking the rules for once. We went on a weekday at 5pm and other than some skateboarders the area was completely empty. It turned out to be a great place to learn a little history and get some very cool pictures. This is considered trespassing which had my husband known he wouldâ€™ve never allowed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindarplusfour
10,Don't Go here,The police patrol this area and it is off limits to everyone....Go here if you want to see the inside of the jail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mainzer
20,Probably not worth the risk,"I was visiting the area for a couple of hours and a friend suggested that we visit Sunken City. I'd never been there and knew nothing about it so sure, why not?! After scaling a fence and a short scramble down a steep trail I saw a lot of graffiti. Definitely fun and colorful! I was mildly shocked by the amount of trash laying around (broken beer bottles, spray paint canisters, cigarette butts).The houses that fell into the ocean when this cliff gave way is interesting history but one visit was definitely enough. After reading other reviews I'm very happy that we didn't run into any police officers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMA032
40,Amazing!,It's amazing to see what's now left of this area where homes starting sinking and sliding into the ocean...one car see the remnants of streets and of foundations. It is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS to walk around in the area. We could see many people had wiggled thru the fence to explore the place. I am sure if they are careful where they walk (don't walk to the edge!) the danger is quite less. Artistic graffiti has been painted onto many of the slabs of concrete. They tell me that it is hard to get over the fence but apparently there is a place where the iron bars have been pulled apart wide enough for people to squeeze thru!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
30,"Like the story, but nothing to be seen","It was not assessable to the city, all fenced due to the safety reason. If you have to get closer, there was a small trail to walk along the fence. Other than some ruins, nothing was left. Greenland, playground nearby were good for picnic, to spend a half day relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monrabdog
10,Dangerous and Illegal,"This might seem like an interesting attraction, but people have died here. People regularly fall off of the cliff, and die, or are seriously injured. One person was recently impaled on a fence. It's actually illegal to go here, and the cops have cracked down on any trespassers. People have been cited, and they are CHECKING FOR WARRANTS! If you value your life and your valuables, you'd be advised to avoid this place. Criminals do prey upon people visiting here. If you cannot pass up the spectacular ocean views, there is a park next door which is legal to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleneh2018
10,Sunken City is Super Dangerous and it is Illegal to go there.,"I live about 5 minutes from Sunken City. There is a lot of crime there, the cliffs are totally unstable and dangerous and the LAPD is really cracking down on people being there. On April 22, 2018 the LAPD and Park Rangers did a crackdown that resulted in 89 citations for trespassing, 2 arrests for misdemeanor warrants and 1 arrest for a felony warrant. They plan to continue these sweeps. Misdemeanor trespassing carries penalties of up to six months in county jail and/or a fine of up to $1,000.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryEllenTravels
20,Beware..Cops!,"I had never been to Sunken City, and didn't know it was considered trespassing either. There were a bunch of other people already inside, and going inside when I came. Other people had also recommended that I check it out, so I did. It was pretty cool to see all the remains and graffiti.However, when we were returning to the park, there was a cop waiting with a camera, and he didn't give us a chance to explain our case, as a couple of the people in my group were from out of state. We all got misdemeanor trespassing tickets and have to go to court in a month. You can risk it, but be cautious because the cop told me that there will be a task force on the rise for Sunken City, and I wouldn't want other people to get tickets just for looking at the historic views of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtj006
30,Trespassing Charge - Cops Might Be Getting More Aggressive?,"My husband and I and lots of his friends have gone to Sunken City probably eight times in the past two years. We always love it and there are always lots of people there as well. This time, however, my husband and his friends all received trespassing misdemeanors. There was a cop waiting right on the other side of the fence you have to climb under to get there.We know it's trespassing to go there, but it was still a surprise since there are always people there and we've never had a problem. The cops got lots of other people the same day as well. Anyway, just leaving a review to say watch out - the cops might be getting more aggressive about Sunken City trespassers, or else they were just super unlucky with what time they went. It was daytime on a Saturday. We don't know what the penalty is yet - he has a court date in a few weeks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmd317
50,WOW,We parked at Point Fermin Park & fortunately saw some people hop the concrete fence & shimmy under the barrier to walk out to the cliff.The views were incredible!WARNING: Many people have been severely hurt & died climbing down the cliff.Wear hiking shoes. Be careful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlWatt
50,Around town adventure awaits you,"How daring are you? Ready to ignore the signs that say no trespassing? If so then keep going and find your way on in. This is an adventure, but it's pretty neat to say you did it and to see it.Once you find your entry point, whether it's shimming through the pried open fence or going under the fence and crawling on the cliff side you're in for a treat! There are two parts to the city. I'll call it the city side and the ocean front side. :-)On the city cliff side there are different rocks filled with urban graffiti art. The art is pretty creative. The thing that chaps my hide is the artist leave a lot of graffiti cans around. We appreciate the art, but take your trash with you please. (guess it 's better than tossing it in the ocean) The graffiti cans chaps my hide!I went one time and was chicken to venture. But then I went with my boyfriend and we went down the path to the beach together. It was ahhhmazing. It took thought to make it down and even more strategic moves to make it back up.The views plus the ambiance make a nice date, getaway from reality, photo op, or just a cool adventure.The city has a history, I won't bore you with all the specifics but once upon a time this cliff side had homes overlooking the ocean. Interested in the history, just take a browse online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux
50,This was really cool,The cool part is graffiti and that you can walk around and see the ocean. The ocean is down low so you are on a cliff of sorts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8814NQmichelleb
50,Cool little spot,"So, it is technically trespassing to enter here, but there were tons of people already inside when we got there. Safety in numbers. Easy to get to and get around in. Nice views over the water. Very cool to see the pavement all torn up and at different levels. I especially liked the places you could see the old pipes or train tracks that were exposed.The grafitti wasn't spectacular when we were there, but it is constantly changing. Yes, there is a ton of broken glass, bottles, remnants of fires, paint cans, etc. I wouldn't take a dog there unless you were pretty careful where they walked.Definitely worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valzebub
50,Get off the beaten path! The Earth fell into the Ocean!,"I am so thankful that i researched enough to come up on this hidden treasure. You can literally stand at the end of the road and see where it once went, but now it is turned on its side, sunk into the ocean. just amazing. I talked to a lady there who said a developer in the 20s got started and within 9 years, this land had fallen into the ocean! A MUST see for non-Cali natives!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/388janish
50,Awesome to the MAX,This location is freaking awesome go ahead and give it a chance there is lots of graffiti though please don't be offended part of the road did fall into the ocean back in the day that's how it got its title sunken city it's definitely a local hot spot in San Pedro free of chargeCheck it out!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
50,Awesome,Such a neat place to visit to look at all the graffiti everywhere but beware it is marked off limits but you can actually climb under the fence (with lots other people) and walk all around the area. You really need to be careful because there are cliffs there but it is something to see. Looks like the city just dropped down and stayed there - you can still see the roads!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyMalibu
50,Awesome,"This place was pretty cool, a friend of mine, my 3 year old (because he goes on adventures with me), and myself had a good time. I wouldn't recommend small children going down here it's pretty dangerous. It was my first time going so it was very nerve wrecking lolOther than that if you're feeling adventurous JUST DO IT!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cece-MD
50,Lands End,This is a great place to visit. Not really a park but the only people I've seen hassled by the cops had it coming. Be mindful that you are on a cliff. Flip flops can get you hurt. Be careful going around the fence. If you go in to Point Fermin Park DO NOT go over the wall because there's nothing but a 200 foot drop to the rocks below. If your careful and prepared its a great place to spend a hot L.A. day. Top it off with a beer and a burger at Walkers Cafe in the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915kellyo
40,Fun Place to Visit,"This place has been on my list of places to visit for sometime now. Finally 9/28/16 we got to visit this place.If you do a little research online prior to visiting this place you'll read that you can be fined for visiting this place. That may be true, but the day we visited there were probably a dozen other people there. So apparently it's not enforced much, if at all.We visited during a weekday and there were other couples and families out doing the same thing. We felt very safe. I was a little worried about the area after reading about it online. But once there all apprehensions vanished. I don't know what it would be like after dark but I assume if you were with a small group you'd be fine.It was definitely a interesting place and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb
50,For the Love of Trespassing,"You know when you have to trespass to a spot, you're in for a treat.Sunken City is easily found on google maps or an Instagram search. There's a park with parking spots to the West of the landmark (facing the ocean) and housing behind it. We parked in the neighborhood and walked about 100 steps to a fence with a bent bar (can't miss it). It looks pretty small but if you finagle yourself just right, you should be able to shimmy through it. Probably up to 250 or so lbs.The views of the ocean are just incredible. Million dollar views if you're down in the Eastern direction about 20 miles, but here it's free. There is a pretty flat mesa with some graffiti on what's left of cement blocks and chunks of concrete, but down and to the left is the real site you came to see.A whole field of busted up concrete, sunken streets, and sidewalks are incredible in themselves, and the graffiti art that covers them is a whole other visually appealing treat. There are several spots where you can trek down the dirt hill (wear shoes) to cross each broken piece and take in the scenery.The place is littered with trash, unfortunately. I wish that people who brought their paint and bottles would also take them out, but hey. I'm actually quite surprised that the city leaves this place as is, since usually anything like this is typically heavily patrolled and mandated. So the fact that you can see a disaster zone turned into graffiti land is pretty amazing.Loved it. So totally unique and interesting a spot to hang out for a couple hours and take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyethesky
30,SAN PEDRO SUNKEN CITY,"Enter if you dare, the city is fenced and marked no trespassing by you can find holes in the fence if you want in. Other than the graffiti there is not much to see other than chunks of concrete left over from the foundations before the land slide. There was a lot of druggies when I was last there and it was a little scary.It is interesting but I do not think it is worth the risk to go back.You need good hiking boots and some heavy gloves if you are not used to negotiating chain link fences and walking on some cliff side trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,An Adventure,"It's illegal to enter this place. You can enter underneath the fence by the park or climb over the fence by the mini skate park. Go to the park side! It's way easier. This natural landslide happened in 1929 so now there's really not alot to look at. It's more like a hiking trip. Up and down the side of the mountain. Also, please note they still have accidental deaths that occur there because of people taking risks or just plain falling and hitting your head. BE CAREFUL. Still had fun. Lots of artists tagging and creating on the bare rocks. Beautiful view. If you explore as much as we did come on comfortable clothes and be prepared to walk away dusty and dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deharo70
40,one of a kind,"It's very interesting to see how our community has changes due to natural movement of the earth. This place shows an area of California that was destroyed due to the earth moving. It is close to the public but semi-visible from the gate.Locals hop the fence and climb a few rocks to get a closer look. There is a lot of beautiful street art to see on the road pieces that remain but also a lot of broken glass and trash. There were a lot of people ""breaking the law"" when we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raaychilll
50,Outside of the box,"This is a cool site. You do have to explore a bit to find the entrance. Another post shows what it looks like. Once in, hike down and walk the paths this way you truly see the graffiti art. In addition you get some awesome views of the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillL2667
50,Unknown treasure for most of the people,"Went there, walked around and enjoyed to see this sunken city. There's now lots of graffiti and stuff, but it makes it only more beautiful. Just keep it the way it is :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwaynario
50,"Find it, worth it!",This place is AWESOME &If you can find this it will be worth your time!Find a gap in the fence :)This is not for the tame of heart. Use extreme caution while there!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecompgalKim
10,Entering this area is trespassing and is against the law.,"To Whom it May Concern, I am a police officer with the LAPD Harbor Division, which includes San Pedro. Currently the area known as ""Sunken City"" is closed to the public; there is a perimeter fence and no trespassing signs posted to illustrate this fact. We recently did a sweep of the area and cited a large number of people for trespassing. Everyone cited will have to appear in court before and judge and will be facing penalties of up to 6 months in jail or a $1,000.00 fine. Make no mistake about it, if you are caught trespassing in Sunken City by Law Enforcement, you will be cited and or arrested and will then be facing a similar consequence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harbors2015
50,Awesome view and great photo op location,"Is so worth it, the guilty feeling of trespassing soon disappear after seeing the beautiful view. You have to jump the fence, crawl under the gate, it's do-able, exercise caution when climbing steep unleveled paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fentyk
50,"Gated, but accessible","This was pretty awesome! It looks completely gated, but you can get in, just be careful. On Carolina street, follow a path to the left to the middle of the gates and there will be an opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yahtsy
40,cool little adventure,"easy to get to. try not to wear white bottoms because you will have to crawl under a fence. also, shoes are a good idea... i wore white shorts AND sandals...... i was not prepared but was still able to explore without any problems. and my shorts didn't even get dirty, surprisingly. not many people here when i was visiting but, some kids decided to paintball in the area. it didn't bother me much but i had to wait for them to finish, which didn't take long, so that i could explore some more. worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
40,Till the landslide brought me down,"For one thing, the entire ""Sunken City"" of San Pedro is closed off by a high fence and multiple signs that say: DO NOT TRESPASS. However, look beyond the fence and you'll see people milling about the ruins, sitting and admiring the breathtaking ocean view, or even tagging the old rubble.To enter, head to Point Fermin Park and go towards Walker's Cafe. Go to the fence, that blocks off the Sunken City, and look to your right. There will be a huge hole that somebody dug allowing access into the area. Worry not, there are people that enter the supposed-forbidden area all the time. Alternatively, on the corner of Shepard St and Bluff Place, one can also jump over the fence into the area.Now, to the actual Sunken City...All the rubble that you see are actual parts of roads/sidewalks that sank in the 1930's. Ocean rifts caused the roads to collapse and float out into the ocean. There's a street called Paseo Del Mar and the sunken roads are/were part of this street. Paseo still exists today, but it's interesting to think that a part of this road actually collapsed.For people a fear of heights, I wouldn't recommend this place. The bluff is pretty high up and the trek down into the actual broken streets is pretty steep. However, there are just absolutely marvelous views of the Pacific Ocean, especially on a clear, gorgeous sunny LA day. It's worth walking along the path; it's probably about 1/4"" of a mile in length. However, do maintain caution as the roads are at various degrees which lead to steep climbs. Admire the graffiti the taggers have claimed.The Sunken City is just a really neat part of LA and even more interesting to know why it sunk. Highly recommended especially to those that like to venture off the beaten path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_glbetrkkr_
