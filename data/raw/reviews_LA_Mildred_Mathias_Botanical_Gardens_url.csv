50,"Well organized, and beautiful","If you wish to relax and enjoy nature, take the day off to wonder about these beautiful gardens. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xanthosm2018
30,Charming but small,This is a lovely garden on the edge of UCLA but not a tremendous diversity if you are looking for a unique botanical garden experience. We drove 30 minutes to explore and were done walking the paths in the same amount of time. Would only go if staying nearby to UCLA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradinmn
50,A Cool Oasis For a Hot Summer Day,"Although this was not a hot Summer day this garden can be a cool oasis later on this year. The koi in the meandering stream is a plus as well as the turtles basking in the sun by the stream. The trails are so numerous it takes a bit of memory to know if you previously took the one you're on before. The many varieties of plant life make it even more enjoyable. There are docent-led tours available and educational programs available, but our self led tours based on the large map on the sign at the bottom trail was a good one. The only thing missing were flowering plants. Perhaps today was not the best period for that. Having just visited the Flower Fields in Carlsbad last month maybe spoiled it for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,Spectacular,"Expecting little from a botanical garden, I was blown away at the diversity. Five minutes, no, only two minutes into the garden you are no longer in a urban, congested area. Plenty of trails to walk and elevation changes are gradual. The temperature change is noticeable from top to bottom. Never have I experienced such a drastic change in foliage from the pond area with an almost rain forest feel from the desert landscape only 100 yards or less away. The trees are majestic, the plants mature, most are identified with markers, the trails are well defined,IT""S FREE.I parked in E lot across the street, $12 all day, $6 for two hours, $9 for 3 or 4 hours.The lot is next to the Dental school",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mel1150
50,Hidden Treasure,"Amid UCLA grounds you will find this heaven of peace in Los Angeles, surrounded by trees and plants. Walking around these you will discover a stream and a few benched to relax",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19marieclaire49
40,"Turtles, koi fish and flowers, oh my!",Pink powderpuffs tickled my fancy as I entered the garden today. Workers seemed to be preparing an area with a polished globestone that they covered with a tarp before leaving—I’m curious to see the completed display. Pictures will do better than my words to deliver the atmosphere of this pretty place on UCLA campus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanneM51
40,Gem in the middle of UCLA campus,"The Mildred Mathias Botanical Gardens is located right on UCLA Campus with no fanfare entrance. I ran into it from walking from my hotel in Westwood Village to a conference on Campus. All three entrances have small signs but once you get in there it is a beautiful place to be. Plenty of shade and places to sit to enjoy the plants and flowers. If you are in Westwood area or in UCLA, it is worth your time to step in to take a break and enjoy nature. The main entrance is on Tiverton Ave. in front of the School of Dentistry. Just need to repeat it, small and beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,Botanical Garden @ UCLA,"This is a nice botanical garden set off from the city, so that once you are in it, you are no longer aware you are in an urban area. It is a good place to relax. It is named after a professor of botany at UCLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howards50
50,A place to relax and enjoy a variety of nature,"To kill some waiting time in between appointments at UCLA I visited the botanic garden.The trails bring you into an oasis of nature.At certain spots you are amidst so many ""green"" that cover all the buildings around you.Where possible they have little id cards at the trees or plants, explaining the name and where it is originates from.The little water part contains a large amount of turtles and some fish.A nice retreat from busy Westwood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arno0571
50,A Haven In The City,"I visit the Mildred Mathias Botanical Gardens during my lunch hour a lot. It's an oasis in the midst of the city. Once you walk inside, you will feel like you are in a mini wooded area. I love the choices of trails that will lead you into different sections of the garden. It's fun to look at the turtles and fish that inhabit the little creek that is located in the garden too, and there's a copious amount of benches that are sprinkled all through the park where you can relax in the shade and absorb the nature that surrounds you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterflyedna
50,Peaceful place to walk near the W Hotel,We were attending a wedding in Los Angeles and were staying at the W Hotel. Our room was not ready so we walked over to the lovely and peaceful botanic garden on the UCLA campus. I enjoyed seeing the large bamboo plants and especially the succulents section in the sun. It was a perfect place to recharge before the wedding. The trails were clearly marked and there were lots of entrances. Go if you're ever in Westwood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7590MLdanielo
50,An undiscovered gem,"I have talked to many LA natives who had no idea that this verdant sanctuary is across from the W Hotel on Hilgard at LeConte (near the heart of Westwood). The varieties of plants and flowers are amazing -- and there are even cozy benches for meditation. If you are looking for solitude in the city, this is your place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munrubin
40,Calm oasis,"If you're in need of a recharge this place is great for that.We walked here after visiting the Hammer Museum. Grabbed a patch of grass for a rest, watched the turtles and fish in the ponds, and strolled through the paths. It's a small spot of land that provides a sense of calm during a day of being a tourist in L.A.I would visit if you're in the area, but not something to travel to specifically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ms67ca
50,Peaceful getaway in the middle of city streets,I was surprised that such a quiet spot existed lol It was so pretty although I was disappointed at the lack of butterflies :( It still was a nice retreat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smomojenkins
50,"oasis of peaceful calm, with turles, benches, a stream in a gorgeous small botanical garden. If at UCLA, visit here.","The botanical gardens in the southeast corner of UCLA near the medical center is a 7 acre free tropical nd sub-tropical garden within which are sitting areas, lots of turtles and a small waterfall in the stream, and a small amphitheater. Several trails meander, but it is small enough that one can simply wander and still find one of the several exits. A stroll for an hour is peaceful. Kids will likely love the turtles and koi ponds. Students would find a peaceful place to study, with wi-fi access. A few blocks from Westwood Village there is easy access easily from the walkway next to the temporary fence where there is current UCLA construction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerSFBayarea
50,Botanical garden,"Very nice and quiet place for weekend walking! A lot of turtles and squirrels! Good for couples, or if you prefer to be alone, and also good for baby stroller)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255karinas
40,Interesting trees,"Nice, mixed-terrain short walk but no handicapped access that I saw. Many interesting and exotic plants and a murky little stream and pond with dozens of turtles in and around it. We were walking with my son whose dog was on a leash. He loved this walk and sniffed out a few squirrels...the dog, not my son. It was peaceful even among the construction going on next door and there are two busy streets that intersect on its perimeter. The garden is fenced and not always open. Lovely walk to take with a friend or by yourself. There are benches by the pond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonM373
40,Practically Perfect Botanical Garden,"The MMBG is the Goldilocks of botanical gardens, it is not too big, not too small, not to deserty, not too tropical, etc. It has a little bit of everything for everyone. The best part is it is free! I've even taken several groups of elementary school students there. The children can roam free and and never beyond ear or eye shot. There are several arid regions, native areas, tropical areas, a pond, groves and a small forest. There are docent led tours that can be arranged in advance. Be forewarned, there are no restroom facilities unless you exit the gardens and enter one of the nearby university buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
40,"Compact, quiet, relaxing","Besides being a peaceful oasis in the busy city and bustling UCLA campus, we were fascinated by the turtles we saw swimming in the little creek and sunning on its banks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KriksPicks
50,Welcome greenery in the city,"Download a map and self-guided tour from the website and go for a stroll. Not just beautiful flowers but also a lot of unusual and interesting plants and trees, like two very tall Australian eucalyptus that are obviously very happy as they have turned into towers in just 40 years. Personally, I find botanical gardens boring pretty quickly and just tag along for my wife. But this was definitely a worthwhile experience that held my interest.You may be able to escape the gouging parking fees on the UCLA campus by parking at a meter ($1/hr) on Hilgard or Le Conte. There is an entrance about where those two streets meet.While the city noise is apparent at the edges, much of the garden is at a lower level and thus well-shielded. We saw a few students and a professor sitting on benches near the stream and we actually whispered as we walked by so as not to disturb their reading.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
40,Oasis in the city,"The Mildred Mathias Botanical Gardens adjacent to UCLA is a lovely little oasis for a stroll if you are staying in the area of Westwood Village or have business at UCLA. I loved the entire area around Westwood Village with its vintage movie theatres, great little shops, pubs and restaurants. Didn't have that hang-dog student feel that so many student areas tend to have. The gardens were established in the late 1920, when it was probably a lot quieter in the area than it is now. The garden is run by the botany department at UCLA and each plant or tree is marked with its name. It was a pleasant pre-dinner walk in a coold green atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxlad47y
40,"A Restful, If Not Quiet, Oasis In Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES CA - It's easy to describe the Mathias Botanical Garden, on the southeast side of the UCLA campus in Los Angeles, as restful. It's another thing entirely to try and call it ""quiet.""The garden, established in 1929, is in the heart of the city, and sounds of the metropolis invade from every side. Cars honk, breaks squeal, truck exhausts bellow and belch. They are accompanied by the daily murmur of surrounding student life: walkers and runners, friendly conversations, and cell phone monologues.Mildred E. Mathias, for whom the garden was named in 1979, was a pioneer in ethnopharmacology, the science of discovering new medicines derived from rain forest plants. Not surprisingly, the 7-acre garden is a diverse one with species of all kinds and from many geographies. On any given day visitors will find volunteers armed with rakes, shovels and other tools, carefully tending the plants and keeping its many paths well groomed.Something seems to always be blooming in the garden, and that was the case during an early April 2014 visit. But the spring season is primarily a time for new, green growth, and that was in greatest evidence during a trail walk then.Because the garden is supervised by UCLA's Botany Department (the botany building is nearby, and houses the garden offices), walking through it is as much an educational as a natural experience.Each plant and tree variety is labeled for easily identification and study. In some areas students have created experimental growing areas. One section of the garden is devoted to a backyard wildlife habitat, so amateurs can duplicate their own piece of environmental heaven at home. An amphitheater called ""The Nest"" is used for outdoor programming.The trails are interspersed with plenty of seating, both free-standing and built into retaining walls. Tables are available for game players, and comfortable chairs and benches for readers. Some of the trails, which follow a stream and lead to a small waterfall, are wheelchair-accessible.Wildlife is found in the garden too. Coy and turtles inhabit the stream. UCLA online information also indicates squirrels fill the garden's wooded areas, but don't feed them, it cautions. ""The squirrels are aggressive and they bite,"" it warns.If You Go ...Mildred E.

40,Great stroll,"This garden has a beautiful setting and provides a nice stroll. I like how it's wild and you can just explore the many different directions and paths. It's great for plant lovers, or to just sit in one of the many benches (and even the arena and picnic tables) to read or have lunch. I went on a weekend so it was really quiet, which I enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/typome
