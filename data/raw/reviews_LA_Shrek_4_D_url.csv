50,So cool,This fun motion simulation ride is a cool ride literally and figuratively. On a hot July day it's a pleasure to go into a nice cool air conditioned theater to enjoy this ride. The ride itself is fun for all ages as you ride along with the characters from Shrek and Kung Fu Panda.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity

40,Bring out you inner ogre,"This is a 3D theater with moving seats, wind, water and mist that make it the 4D experience. After walking through Lord Farquaad's dungeon you enter the theater where you will join Shrek, donkey and dragon as they rescue Princess Fiona from the ghost of Lord Farquaad. Tons of action and a great 4D thrill. For those that don't want all the motion the seats at the back of the theater do not move.Must do when in Universal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
