40,Nice relaxing massage,"My Mother's Day gift was a visit to this spa. Good massage. I don't like filling in all the paperwork, but . . . The therapist was nice and concentrated on what I requested. And, she didn't talk too much, which many massage therapists often do. I am there for quiet relaxation. What I liked about this Massage Envy location is that they didn't push you to buy any packages etc. Most Massage Envy locations do push that. So I give them a ""Thumbs Up"" for realizing their patrons can decide what they want for themselves without being given the sales pitch. I would recommend this spa!",Barbara P
