10,A non-traditional Christmas Eve Service,"I have known about the Mt. Olive Lutheran Church for many years but never attended a service there. I really like the building and it is in the neighborhood where I live. On the inside is a giant pipe organ I was hoping to hear. What I heard was a very, very non-traditional Christmas Service which featured a horrible view of what it must have been like for Mary. I wish now that I would have walked out when I heard the direction it was going. I was not willing to partake of their communion and I have no plans on ever returning to that church.",Mitchel N
40,Charming SM Church ...,"I drive by often and decided to stop in for a visit, and glad that I did. Often see lots of kids from the attached preschool. Church is in the heart of Santa Monica, easy access & easy to find. Architecture is modern, done very nicely. Noted to have multiple events, programs and outreach. Nice pleasant visit. ...",David B L
50,FREE Live Jazz and Classical Music Performances - Weekends,"Driving by one day I noticed a banner for monthly ""Vespers Jazz"". Just a few minutes from where I live and being a fan of live music, I decided to check this out. I was beyond pleasantly surprised. Free parking, a church sanctuary turned into a cozy jazz performing space with decent acoustics, and a performance by an excellent jazz group with a terrific lead singer! I discovered they were offering a classical woodwind performance with well-known performers the following Sunday afternoon which I also attended. Another great live music outing. They appear to offer monthly live jazz and classical music events on late Sunday afternoons. For both SM locals and tourists to Santa Monica, this is a lovely venue with easy access i.e. using the Blue Bus #8 or parking in their large free lot. What a great way to end the week on a musical note.",SMGalNewDiscoveries
