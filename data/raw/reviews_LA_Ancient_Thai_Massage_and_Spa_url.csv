50,Great place to de-stress,"I love going to this place when I’m in the area and have been going here for years. There’s a first time price of $35 and it’s normally $40. They take credit card but there’s a fee for using it so I’d just use cash, especially so that you can tip your masseuse. They give you tea and oat crackers after the massage, and you pay when you’re finished with that. I had Mona as my therapist and she was wonderful. She knew how to work out my sore muscles and made sure to ask what my pressure preference was at the start of my one-Hour massage. If it’s your first time, know that you will have to take off your clothes (except underwear) and will need to put on the shirt and shorts provided to you. There are hooks for you to hang your bag. It’s dimly lit and peaceful although you can also faintly here people coming into the waiting area. Be sure to communicate with my masseuse about what aches and whether or not they’re providing a good pressure level. I go with medium pressure; the hard level is not for the faint of heart. Overall, great value and great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanellesua
