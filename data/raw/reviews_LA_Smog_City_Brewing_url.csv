50,"Great beer, beat place",My boyfriend and I went here for a beer before heading out to Malibu for dinner - it was great! Their beer selection was just what we were looking for. Floret was a flowery delight. Highly recommend !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolyntevans
50,Great Beer! Awesome Vibe! Terrific Staff!,"Really great brewery! We sat at the bar and the staff was terrific! Although my husband was clear what he wanted to order, I wasn’t. One of the staffers helped me pick the perfect beer for me!Atmosphere is dog and family friendly. We noted two large parties who had brought in their own food/cake for personal celebrations. Outdoor area looked very inviting, but it was a bit chilly for us last night.Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharrongeg
30,"Sour-heavy, but a few good alternates!","I took a flight that included a few sours/sourish (Kumquat; Rabbit; and Peach), but wasn’t really a fan. However, I really enjoyed the From LA Wit Love, Saber-Toothed Squirrel, and Smog City IPA. Perhaps a good place for sour fans, but if you’re not a fan, you may still find a few tasty options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDispatch
50,Great Brewery with friendly staff and even better beers!,"This is small brewery located in Torrance. The tasting room is fun and the staff will help you fin date perfect beer for your taste. You have the option of drinking in the tasting room or outside deck, or buying bottle and cans to go. I would recommend doing both!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDEMT6
50,Great Patio and Great Beers,We went here for my birthday and the staff was very helpful and accommodating. There was a great selection of beers and a wonderful barbeque caterer there besides. It was a little hard to find as there was no sign out near the driveway but once inside there was plenty to absorb. It's certainly worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billyjoe52
40,Quick stop for Beers!,I've been to Smog City a few times but on a recent trip to California we made a stop for a few quick beers before a flight leaving out of LAX. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had extended a nice size patio out in the front of their building. Staff as always was friendly and helpful & the beers were tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbiefitz
50,Craft brewing in Torrance? Absolutely!,"What a find! Welcoming, dog & kid friendly, wide selection of beers on tap, flights or full glasses & the beer is excellent. My friends did a flight that ranged from ipa to sour to pale ale. My full glass of coffee porter was perfect! A bit off the beaten path, but well worth the drive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auntkid
30,Cool brewery but beer is just ok,I had to check out this brewery as it showed up on multiple lists for best craft breweries in LA. I like the setting and atmosphere. The tasting room and brewing area is all one big room that flows. It's not a large tasting room and it was totally packed when i went.I first tried the coffee stout which would have been better if the coffee flavour wasn't so strong. Next I had the malton brown which was just ok. I was disappointed in the beer. I guess I'm a beer snob.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matticus01
40,Friendly Brewery,There is a good variety for very ones beer taste buds. Friendly serves that is laid back atmosphere. Nice place to relax and enjoy some beers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiay851
50,Fantastic beer,Beer is fresh and they always have a great selection. We usually take a growler. The place is clean an staff are friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorar894
40,"Good beer, chill vibe","Got stuck with a 10hr layover at LAX so we decided to check out some breweries. We ordered a flight of five (Little Bo Pils, Sabre Toothed Squirrel, High Five, The Nothing and The British Are Coming). Brandon was super helpful, he suggested beers and other places to check out. Sabre Toothed Squirrel was definitely my favorite, it was the best of an amber and an ipa...not too hoppy for those who aren't IPA drinkers and smooth like an amber. So glad we stopped here first! My boyfriend's favorite was the nothing, roasty but the chocolate wasn't over powering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashley32905
50,Went to pick up a bomber and got to try a couple flights that they don't bottle.,"There's no food here, so it's a good idea to bring your own. Mellow vibe, an open garage in a warehouse invites you into the brewery, where there is a bar with tables set up to ply yourself full of goodness. The sours here were a welcome surprise. If you are in the area during the evening, stop by and taste the difference that fresh makes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298justinp
40,Great space,the inside of this brewery is nicely set up. They have a bunch of beers on tap and have flights so you can sample. We went on a Saturday night and they had a food truck set up outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
50,Best of the best,"This is the only brewery where I can blindly pick any beer on the menu and never be disappointed. I'm not a porter person at all, but the Coffee Porter is epic. The Sabre-Toothed Squirrel is also a must-try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2356WPrickr
50,Best of the Craft Breweries,From the beginning Smog City has produced some of the best craft beers in the exploding South Bay craft beer scene. The tasting room is a great place to drink and laugh with new people. All are welcomed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L4155MSdavidf
50,Best in Town,"Smog City produces great beer, but that's only half of the reason that I enjoy visiting the brewery. If you've been there, you know that the staff is without equal. It's the most friendly and knowledgeable staff around, and the real reason I stop by regularly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonoCoronado
50,Best brewery,"Always friendly place. Beer is great - and Porter is always releasing new brews so never bored. Festivals""are well intended. Here many times - love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCRutherford
50,Best brewery in CA,I've lived in the area since before any of the current breweries existed. I love craft beer and enjoy trying new things and CA has a lot of beer to try. smog City is my favorite brewery in CA. The beer is amazing and they make a wide variety of styles (all really well). The people there are friendly and welcoming and love talking about their craft and the local community. The regulars there are equally as friendly. It's a relaxing place to be on a weeknight after work or on the weekends when you wanna grab a beer with friends. Can't express my love for this place more. Cheers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cornsnake23
50,Awesome beers!,By far the best beers we had during our visit last year. Every beer we had was on point and great. Highly recommend a stop here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeWinAustin
40,Smog City is great!,"Visited Smog City for the first time, and their beer was great. They brew a wide range of styles so anyone can find something they like, and everything is very good. Atmosphere is just ok and nothing that exciting, but the beer more than make sup for it. Go visit when in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakea88
50,Unexpected Surprise Brewery,"Another recommendation from another local brewery. I believe that this is relatively new of a brewery, but am not sure. It's a very industrial area, so when I was driving there, I thought I was in the wrong place. Once found though, it was a great experience.The decor of the taproom was really cool and eclectic. The regular beers were interesting and I really like the variety of wild/sour beers available. It's also a good place to meet locals to find out other breweries to visit. This was a hard to find gem and I really recommend the trip out to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbuford04
50,Excellent Brews! Great experience!,"We stopped by at dinnertime on a weeknight to meet up with some friends that were visiting the LA area. The place was pretty packed, but not so packed that we couldn't find a spot to sit. There are seats at the bar, and several tables. No problem accommodating our group of 6. We got a flight of all the beers/brews for the table to taste, and then everyone got their own drinks. This was a really fun introduction to all of the different selection. Seriously, this is good tasting beer. But also, it was a relaxed atmosphere. You never felt rushed (maybe because it wasn't a weekend). I would go back, and even re-taste because the change up their selections. The area is very industrial, which seems appropriate since they do the brewing there. And it seems like it would be easy to miss, but GPS takes you right there, and the building is well marked on Del Amo with the address. Also, they do not serve any kind of food, but you can get food delivered while you are there. Two people had pizzas delivered to their tables. And truthfully, with EAT24, you can get any kind of food that you want to eat with the beer, so that is a pretty cool aspect. It's also a fun experience as an outing, but just as fun as a regular bar atmosphere. Next time we will do a brewery ""tour.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/161judis
50,"Great beer, fun industrial vibe","Visiting LA from St Louis. Stopped by with wife and adult daughter, on a Tuesday late afternoon to grab a beer before heading out to dinner. Wanted to see how LA compares to the STL beer scene. Located in an industrial park, no sign in sight but GPS got us there. Great group of folks, relaxed atmosphere. Not a great deal of seating, maybe 30 total, tables, stools, chairs and a couple couches, all in the open air brewery space. Friendly staff. We had Sabre Toothed Squirrel Amber Ale, Coffee Porter, and Peach Paper Airplane, plus samplers of Smoked Lager, Double Chocolate Stout, Belgian Quad, and Spitin & Cussin Sour Brown with Cherries - oh boy, not for everyone but was a hit for me. All in all, a wide selection of great beers - Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926davidp926
30,Needs to mature,"We had heard some good things about Smog City so we stopped by. Entering is not too terribly user friendly in terms of where or how to order. Ended up waiting a while on a bartender who was having an overly long personal conversation with another customer only to be told the line was around the corner. Not off to a good start with customer service.Not all of the beers on the menu were available. Hey, how about using the eraser since it is a chalk board to remove those that are not available?We tried both Chip Shot and Little Bo Pils and rated both a solid 2. We just didn't get a good vibe off the place and decided to head out and sample some others in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nprvl
