50,Absolute must for film buffs,"One of Cecil B. Demille's first studios and film sites is now a museum with everything anyone would ever want to see or know about the history of the film industry in Hollywood. Movie made here was the silent picture The Squaw Man. Lots of props, photos and all that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
50,Old Hollywood treasure!,"If you're an old Hollywood movie fan then this is a must see! This barn, which was once owned by Jesse Laskey and Cecil B. Demille, played a very important role in the early days of the Hollywood movie industry. The museum has some fantastic exhibits and staff that clearly have a love for their job. This museum is a little out of the way, up towards the Hollywood Bowl, so it can easily be missed. It is a little gem that I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
30,Interesting Building,"This museum has been on my ""to do"" list for several years, and I finally went to it on the first weekend in October, 2016.We were greeted by a man who gave us a brief description of the building and pointed us to the collection. I regret to report, that the collection is not large and that it is scattered and a bit musty. There was no evidence that anything about the place has been spruced up in a long, time.The building is very near the part of Hollywood Boulevard that draws hordes of tourists. If you are in the area, you might enjoy taking a look at the building (there is lots of parking). There is a good description of the building in Wikipedia, and there is nothing of architectural interest on the interior of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonderfulworld
50,Historically significant venue - great displays and staff!!,"We visited on 11th September this year and found the building to be a wonderful reminder of old Hollywood.The building itself is of historical significance as although it was moved some time ago from a different part of L.A., the first feature length movie filmed in Hollywood 'The Squaw Man' was made here by Cecil B DeMille.There were some incredible original movie props to be seen in the museum. We also saw some great photographs and film footage including that of 'The Squaw Man.'.The staff were superb, knowledgable and gave us more of an insight than we had expected into the history of the museum whilst also offering us further suggestions for our stay in L.A.!We left here feeling very glad we had stopped by and would recommend this venue for any one interested in the Hollywood movie system's early days and those that contributed greatly towards it.A must see venue for visitors and residents. Thank you for your hospitality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imogian
50,History!,"I put this museum on my short list of must-sees when we attended a film festival because of its significance in film history. As it turned out, they had an event there - presentation and book signing! So, we saw the collection, learned about classic costume designers and had a nice little reception with refreshments. It was ideal for our first evening of the festival. It's a small museum, so even if you just carve out an hour, walk over from Hollywood. It's well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anntravelsalot
50,Origins of Hollywood,"Just a ten minute walk or so from Hollywood /Highland station, and the tourist mayhem of Hollywood Boulevard, in a quiet corner of the Hollywood Bowl parking lot. This is the barn used for the making of Hollywood's first feature film, 1913's The Squaw Man, at It's fourth location, where it's been restored to house Cecil B Demilles original office, while giving a fascinating glimpse into the world of very early film making. Well worth the visit for anyone with a serious interest in the very beginning of Hollywood. It also has a small shop with quite a few interesting books on Hollywood's history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wot2c
10,Not open!,Was not open when we were there February 2015 and looked abandoned. May have re-opened - suggest you call first to check.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,Hollywood History,The Museum just reopened. This is the building where Cecil B. DeMille made his first movie in Hollywood. The building has been moved from its original location and has been restored. It contains his office with some of his furniture and shoes. There is an exhibit of memorabilia from Universal Studios. Universal was the first studio to have tours open to the public. There is parking in front of the museum but sometimes the parking lot is used for events at the Hollywood Bowl.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charles6346
50,"Small but oozes history, a great way to spend a few hours. A must for film history buffs.",This small museum that was the actual barn building used for Cecil B DeMille's first studio. His office is preserved in one of the ante rooms. The barn is chocked full of memorabilia and silent short films from the birth of Hollywood.The museum is at the foot of the Hollywood Hills near the Hollywood Bowl and Griffith Park surrounded by avocado trees. It's easy to miss since the small building it is set back in one of the Hollywood Bowl parking lots.The museum is closed now for renovation. When it reopens don't miss the chance to immerse yourself in Hollywood history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFGoDan
50,The most historic building in Hollywood is also a Museum,"If you've ever wanted to see items from Charlie Chaplin's movie studio, Cecil B DeMille's The Ten Commandments, props, costumes and other artifacts from Hollywood's Golden era, this is the place. The museum building is actually the first home of what would be later called Paramount Studios. The Barn was the home base for Hollywood's first feature length motion picture and it has a rich history all its own,This is a must see for any classic film fan. It's so inexpensive to enter and all the proceeds benefit the Museum. Becoming a member is so easy and costs so little. You must see the building that would become the Paramount Studio Gym. Its restoration is an amazing story in itself. Located across the street from the Hollywood Bowl, this attraction is never too crowded and has a charming gift shop with some rare and wonderful items.Don't miss this treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keatie
50,Fascinating and very welcoming,"This is a great antidote to the circus that is Hollywood and Highland. It is small, and very interesting, in the original barn (which has moved three times) that the first studio was set up in by Cecil B de Mille.The docents and volunteers were very informative and there is a small but good book shop.Plans are underway to recreate an outdoor sound stage. That will add even more to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Don't Miss This!,"A wonderful little museum dedicated to the birth of ""Hollywood."" I always say that you have to know where you came from to truly appreciate where you are, and if you are a movie fan of any caliber this is a ""must see."" Cecil B. DeMille's office!! You can feel the energy! This is an all volunteer run museum, and these folks really know their film/Hollywood history! They have limited hours so check the website before venturing out. Well worth the reasonable $7 admission fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milhanf
40,Excellent,"This little museum is a little off the main tourist path but well worth a visit. Limited hours so check the website before you go. Building was Cecil B. DeMille's original office from the time he made his first Hollywood movie until he died soon after finishing ""The Ten Commandments"" 40+ years later. Some of the exhibits are permanent, so come and go. The day we visited was just after a temporary exhibit had left so a little empty.The real gem is the docent who was willing to talk for hours explaining the history of movie making in Hollywood. Using a few old photos for visual clues, he made history come alive. It was a joy talking with him and asking a few questions to keep the information coming. A real treat to find someone who loves what they do and is willing to share their knowledge with anyone who asks.The $7 admission fee is about right given the limited exhibition space. Parking is free, book store is small, didn't see anything unusual or rare to buy. A fifteen minute walk (up hill) on Highland Ave. from the corner of Hollywood & Highland and the Dolby Theater/Chinese Theater complex. Across the street from the Hollywood Bowl which also has a small museum. Worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110AlR
50,small but mighty,I did not expect much as it is a small barn like structure on the side of the road. It was great and so informative. Where the first full length feature film was created. The docent/guide was very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barcodeVegas
50,What a Treat,"Hollywood History - all in one place. Visit Cecil B. Demille's first office, great exhibits, videos of vintage Hollywood, artifacts from the silent era, knowledgeable staff, great display on Julia Adams presently on display, wonderful videos, free parking, modest entry fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wff5
50,A MUST see for film buffs. It all started at 'The Barn'.,"It's where 'Hollywood' as we know it began. By walking into the Hollywood Heritage Museum, your walking directly into the original office and studio of Cecil B. Demille, one of Hollywood's film pioneers. Wonderful exhibits, oversized photos, vintage ephemera, film props, camera's, projectors all from the silent era. They have videos, and much to see, explore and learn. Also a wonderful book and gift shop. Highly recommended. Just a 10 minute stroll up the street from the more famous Chinese Theater and across the street from the Hollywood Bowl, which also has a great little museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greenbot
50,Definitely worth a visit!,"If you’re interested in the history of Hollywood film-making from its earliest days, this very interesting little museum is a must-see! Don't let the simplistic exterior fool you: this museum manages to pack a lot of great material into a small space. It’s a fairly easy walk from Hollywood Blvd. or the Hollywood & Highland parking garage (but also has its own free parking lot). The structure is the actual barn used by Cecil B. DeMille and co. as the ""studio"" for Hollywood's first feature film, ""The Squaw Man"" (1914). DeMille's office is recreated as it appeared back then, and the remaining permanent exhibits include a variety of rare and fascinating items (particularly noteworthy are the various silent-era movie cameras), even a Rudolph Valentino tribute area. As of this writing (June 2012), an additional wealth of historical memorabilia is on loan from Paramount Studios to commemorate that studio's centennial (DeMille, Jesse Lasky, and Sam Goldwyn later merged their Lasky Film Co. with Paramount). The entry rates are very reasonable, the hours have been extended beyond the previous weekends-only, and the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. There is also a good book/gift shop that contains excellent merchandise. Very much enjoyed the Hollywood Heritage Museum, and will stop by again the next time I’m in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly3
50,Hidden gem well worth seeking out,"I visited this museum twice in 2008, once earlier in the year on a golf trip with some mates and more recently just prior to Christmas with my family. The museum is on Highland opposite the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl and whilst its a little off the track from the main tourist drawcards on Hollywood Boulevarde it is well worth seeking out if you are interested in visiting a ""non-commercial"" Hollywood attraction and finding out about the early days of movie making in the USA.The museum is housed in an old barn that served as Hollywood's first studio and was used by Cecille B De Mille and Jesse B Lasky's in the ""The Squaw Man"", the first feature length motion picture. There is a very good 15 min introductory film that operates on a continous loop showcasing the history of the USA movie industry and plenty of exhibits, props and film making equipment from a bygone cinema era. De Mille's original desk, chair and other personal items are displayed in an office set up as it was in his day.The Museum is only open on weekends from 11am to 4pm and is manned by volunteers all of whom have a great interest in the movie industry and are passionate about preserving the heritage of movie making. There is plenty of free parking and the entry cost is minimal (it cost our family of five just $14). There is also a good library of related books most of which are available for sale. Our eldest son who has a keen interest in scriptwriting picked up 4 or 5 script books at a fraction of the cost he would have had to pay elsewhere.This is a great alternative to the many seedy vistas of present day Hollywood Boulevarde and one that all movie lovers particulary those with an appreciation of history should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jogeba
