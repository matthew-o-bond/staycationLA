50,Go on .... find 77 and show your age!!,You just have to visit this spot if you are of a certain age ..... and I'll bet you won't be able to resist humming the theme tune and clicking your fingers. Don't worry we've all done it!!,Normski49
30,Memory Marker,"If you were a fan of the '77 Sunset Strip' TV show, you may want to see where the opening credits were shot, and the program supposedly took place. Nothing original is still there (Dino's Restaurant, located next door, is long gone), but the gap between the buildings where the parking entrance was is still preserved between the existing buildings. There is a small marker in the sidewalk comforting the site. Interesting to see how much the area has changed today by re-watching the beginning of one of the old shows. If you never saw the show, you'll wonder what the fuss is all about.",Jim T
40,One those things I always wanted to see.,For me it was a nostalgic stroll as each name I recognised conjured up a memory or two.The only minor disappointment is that some of the vacant stars are cracked or damaged. In my opinion these should be replaced.If in LA this is must do activity. Enjoy!!,Sewin54
30,Stopped to see the plaque on tour,Only interesting thing about the Sunset Strip during the day is to stop by where they filmed the famous tv show of the same name. Kind of cool.,Chinapjs
50,Like the TV Show,"Just like the Television Show, this is where it happened. This brings back the good old days. A great memory.",ARTHUR W
30,A touch of TV nostalgia,"OK, if you go to Sunset Strip, look for the plaque and see where it is. We saw it as we walked along the Strip. (We were staying a short walk away.) But really I'm not sure why anyone would bother - just for nostalgia, maybe, or the fun of seeing it.",DRCsydney
30,Glad that they have preserved the site,"I have often wondered where the TV show was filmed. Because after all, there is no such place as 77 Sunset Strip. Now it is preserved, as the photo shows in the sidewalk.",Karen R
40,Interesting . .,If you can remember 77 Sunset Strip TV series then you must be as old as me. This isn't really very much to go and see but if you are walking along W Sunset Blvd at that point it is a bit of interesting nostalgia.,Kruger C
50,Take the LA Touriusts here,If you are old enough to remember the show then is is worth visiting. You can share reruns with your guests then go.,BigdogAZ2014
40,Bustling,"It was very busy on the day we visited, but we still had a good time. I enjoyed every bit of Sunset Boulevard.",Karen S
40,Small Plaque,"I remember watching the TV show 77 Sunset Strip in the 60's as a child and the theme song stuck in my mind, so when staying in West Hollywood I had to go searching for it. I did a google search and once I knew where it was I went looking and found it easily. The plaque is small but easily readable.",Ivan C
30,Sampled this on an escorted tour.,It's got to be experienced if you are in LA. Nice to sample some of the nostalgia from the old TV program. There is not a lot to see though and OK if included in an all round trip and not dedicated to seeing 77 Sunset Strip. There's a bit of controversy as to whether it really existed anyway.,Ken W
50,A Must Photo Taking Spot,On Sunset and a part of TV history.See the marker and gaze at where 77 Sunset Strip was located.Make it a part of your visit here.George Vreeland Hill,George Vreeland Hill
10,Nothing here,We walked by this a couple of times and didn't even notice that it was a recognized site. This side of La Cienga isn't all that interesting.,Don T
20,Nothing to see,Stopped here as thee seemed a lot of tourist activity - didn't know what it was but nothing to see and not worth a destination drive.,RonWamberal
10,Disappointed,"I thought that there would be something there but sadly nothing. I do remember 77 Sunset Strip which was on UK TV in the 60s. Took us a while to even find the place, but a dear little old lady gave us the location.",stelondon
20,honeymoon,I was abit disappointed coming here though it would be better then it was tbh won't be going here again,Kellypartridge
30,No big deal,"It's good to go through it if your ember the tv series also if you take the red line you get all sorts of really great information on you head phones , you can pop of the bus catch a drink of a meal somewhere along and then pop back on again , shame these buses stop so early about 5.30 as then you could pop back in an evening when it would be a bit more livelier cause this are not cheap in LA and the traffic is getting like bangkok",Marilyn B
10,Nothing to see here,"Does anyone even remember 77 Sunset Strip anymore? With the new mega construction at La Cienege, the small marker on the sidewalk is now gone.",JohnRyan724
50,Hollywood Dreams,Typical Hollywood lots of tourists. It is interesting and fun to walk imaging the film industry of the old times,MrsMarcoux
30,star in my eyes lol,"came with friends on a coach trip loved seeing the names and the theatre . Lots of people dress up as different characters and had picture's with them for a small price , went up and down looking at all the names of the stars was warned to watch your pockets and bags but had fgun",acaHampshireUk
30,"77 sunset Strip - Los Angeles, Ca","If you are ""young enough"" to remember the TV series, you can appreciate the memories.Unfortunately, the building is no longer there, only a marker indicating where it stood.Busy traffic area but close to lots of other attractions and restaurants on the coast.",DaisyS01
40,A walk down memory Lane,"We stayed at the W to be close to the various must visit places such as the Sunset Strip, walking distance to a few other ikons as well.",Gaile1958
10,Once upon a time,"Once upon a time, a long ago t.v. show was NOT filmed here. What a pointless ""attraction!"" Spend your time elsewhere and better!",CarmichaelVentura
30,Okay,All that remains is the foothpath with a memorial saying what it is. The building has been knocked down. Good for a photo,snake43
30,tv memories,the site of this tv home has a dedication in the pavement where it stood. The site is under construction and has fencing around it but the pavement dedication looks set to stay :) It is approximately 150 metres down the street from the Grafton Hotel on Sunset.,Melanie W
50,77 Sunset Strip Filming Site,"Great for the few of us ol' timers that remember the show. Our tour guide pointed out the old filming location and showed us the spot in the sidewalk that has a plaque to remember the show. Our guide from Glitterati Tours also showed us old photos on an iPad that included the ""Then & Now,"" of a the classic TV filming location.",Leecy O
40,The Famous Strip,"Cookie, Cookie, lend me your comb. Yes, I'm old enough to remember that TV show. Got a chance to see where Cookie actually did comb his hair back....What ever happened to Cookie?",mama030
30,77 Sunset Haas Moved,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Hollywood where the motto is "" Out of sight, out of mind."" So, 77 Sunset left with Dean Martin. I love Dean, but there too much competition. Things have changed. Want some action? Go to Venice, San Mo or ManHerDondo Beaches. Better yet stay in Hollywood and throw 20 crisp one dollar bills on a crowded sidewalk. Kodak moment.",alldaymusick
40,If you liked the series .....,"We sort of stumbled on the site ... were just thinking where 77 Sunset Strip was filmed. Outside of the Actors Guild (now closed down) we saw the plaques in the ground.Well, not much to see there - but for afficionados, a place to visit!",spikey2
