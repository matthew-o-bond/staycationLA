40,Soul stirring testimony to the human story of Los Angeles,"Founded in 2012, the Museum of Social Justice collection has documents, photographs, artefacts that tell an impactful story about the human side of the founding of Los Angeles - and that story is told humanely - with sensitivity, empathy and affection.The museum also captures the work of the founders of the United Methodist Church, the work done by its community center and how it helped to improve the living conditions of not just the poor Mexican population it was founded to serve, but also of the many immigrants who lived around the plaza.The educational center of the Museum continues with the Churchâ€™s century old legacy of bringing socio-economic and health equality through non-sectarian outreach services, spreading knowledge and fostering empowerment.The Museum is located in the United Methodist Church at the intersection of the Old Plaza and Olvera Street. Admission to the museum is free of charge.Note: The photographs that are part of this review are of panels that were on display when we visited the museum - these panels may have since changed if they were part of a temporary exhibition.The museum offers soul stirring testimony to the human story of Los Angeles - an education in itself. A visit here is a real eye-opener and it is a pity that so very few people seem to find it worth their while to come to this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Inspiring Gem - Underground!,"What a delight to discover this treasure in the basement of the United Methodist Church adjacent to Olvera Street. The photo/story feature on homelessness in LA was provocative and moving: stunning fotos, compelling stories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieStoneybrook
40,Interesting Free Museum Next to Our Lady Queen of Angeles,"December 31, 2016 - Upon exiting Our Lady Queen of Angeles Catholic Church, we discovered the free museum, Museum of Social Justice. It is in the basement of the church and one could easily miss the entrance, if not paying attention.Once descending the stairs, you find yourself among many well presented black and white photos, clothing exhibits, and more. It is very educational to stop and read each narrative and to see some of the clothing from the early 1900s. Although all the photos and exhibits were interesting, one photo caught my attention. It is a photo showing the first Latino friendly water fountain from the early 1900s. At that time, Latinos were not allowed to drink from water fountains in Los Angeles. I include a picture of the fountain and a picture of the actual water fountain that is located in the adjacent Lady of Queens Church.While we were visiting the museum, a college student was stationed at a table near the back and she answered many of our questions and offered additional information about the museum.If you are in the area, I recommend taking less than an hour to visit the Museum of Social Justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryH9905
40,Hard to Find,"This is not easy to find, but make the effort. The entrance is on the Plaza at El Pueblo de Los Angles Historic Park, but you enter through a obscure door on the corner of the Plaza and Olvera Street and walk down a flight of stairs to the basement of the Plaza Methodist Church. The museum is a single open space with exhibits around the walls and some cases toward the center. On the day that I visited, the exhibit was on Katherine Higgins who established Goodwill of Southern California. Photography is not allowed, admission by donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
