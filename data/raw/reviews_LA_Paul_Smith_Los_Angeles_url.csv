40,PINK WALL INSTA HOT SPOT,"The famous Pink Wall (until it gets painted over) is well known for instagrammers everywhere. Arrive mid-morning to get your shot and go across the road for brunch. You can walk around this whole area and find murals, so definitely worth half a day to explore!NO PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS ALLOWED AT THIS WALL. You will be asked to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaniaCherie
50,Good photo op,"Came here for the insta shot! You can spot it easily as thereâ€™s a ton of girls having a photo shoot, lol. Out in the open and does the job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/usnwalker
30,you would not believe the lineup for this pale,just to take a picture at a pink wall there is security flocks of people - of course we are part of the tourists waiting for this experience as well but it goes to show you what social media can do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zachrosen17
30,Is Pink your Color?,Pink is everyone's color - especially when you visit Paul Smith's designer outlet in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people turn up every day just to have their photo taken in front of the pink wall - must be a millennial thing because I personally just don't get it. Didn't stop me doing however and I also had a browse through the great fashion by one of England's best designers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamw267
50,No clue what this was but my kids loved it,"During our trip in LA, my daughter says all I want to do is see the Pink Wall. No clue what that was. We found it and it's the Paul Smith store who has this pink wall where kids take pictures in front of it. It's apparently a huge Instagram thing. This ""wall"" was packed with teenagers and younger adults snapping pics in front of it. Ended up being a pretty cool experience. I'd say it's a must see in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDad84
