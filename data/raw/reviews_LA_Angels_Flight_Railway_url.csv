50,Angels Flight shortest railway in the world,"Angels Flight™ Railway is one of Los Angeles' most enduring landmarks. Constructed and opened in 1901, it carried passengers up and down the steep slope between downtown and the top of Bunker Hill, then a fashionable residential district.Billed as the ""shortest railway in the world,"" the funicular has two cars, Olivet and Sinai, connected to the same cable and counterbalancing one another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874
50,Essential ride for the train tragic,"If you enjoy rail journeys, this is a must. It is the shortest trip in the world, being 298 feet in its entirety. The funicular takes you from South Hill up to South Olive and for $2 fare, you get a souvenir ticket. Even my bride, a longtime sufferer of my train travels, was impressed. If you time it right, getting the rear seats provides for great photo opportunities. Treat yourself!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meikant
50,Rider,"The fare for Angel's Flight is only $1, $2 for a round trip ticket. Keep in mind that it's a low cost ride, the people who run Angels flight would like to see low denominations of $1 $5 or even $10 bills as $20 Bills drain their available change. Plan on the $1 bills first to keep them happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9730EOdavec
40,Small train,"Nice ride on an historical railway. From the Central market you can get uphill in a few minutes. For 2$ you can go up and down, it's a nice break if you are around visiting downtown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yenyok
40,Fun experience on this historic funicular!,It was so much fun to experience this iconic funicular that took us down to the Grand Central Market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crunch6
50,A couple minutes of Fun,"Maybe it's because of nostalgic, remembering as a teenager after church in the evening going downtown and taken Angels Flight round trip. In those days at the top of the Flight all there was were a lot of older homes. Today there are modern office building and apartments. It is still fun joining the tourist and take a roundtrip up and down Angels Flight. Remember you can eat across the street at Grand Central Market where there are over a dozen eateries. On a warm day take your food up the Flight and eat at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormKeith

50,A darling and vintage experience,Angles Flight has great historical value and we get to live that today! If you took Metrolink trains to L.A. you can get a half price ticket on Angels Flight simply by showing your ticket. The best time to do this is in the evening. There will be few people and it's lit up so that it's like walking into an old fashioned dream as you step into the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jezebelthewombat
40,"For a Cost of One Dollar, Why Not!","Angels Flight is a funicular type railway that takes you from the Grand Central Market (across the street) up the hill approximately 300 feet, to California Plaza. California plaza is located at the foot of 2 major high-rises in downtown Los Angeles with several others close by.The cost each way is $1 and is very convenient for the many high-rise building workers to quickly get to / from the Grand Central Market for lunch. The railway itself has had a long history of incident’s and a fatality through its many on and off years of operation. We rode up one way and walked down the 181 steps from the top to the bottom. It was entertaining for the $1 one-way cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs
40,A fun break in the day!,"It was a great break in a busy day of sight seeing. The price of $1 each way was worth keeping this little piece of history going. It was nice to see that in this day of modern technology, people enjoying the simpler things in life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686allenk
30,"Functional, not particularly Exciting","When I grew up we called trains like this a funicular (which are designed to ascend steep inclines. In Valparaiso Chile, they call these elevators and were used a lot in the old days to transport the workers up the steep slopes of the city. Here in LA, the funicular allowed the wealthy to avoid taking stairs up or down the steep hill many of them had houses. The Grand Central Market was deliberately placed at the bottom of the hill so it could be accessed by these same wealthy folks. As rides go it is short and not particularly thrilling, but it is history and the hill (at least going up) is steep so provides a cheap alternative to walking.If you like this review please ‘like’ it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbushman2017
50,Fun way to get to the top . . .,We walked the steps down to Grand Central Market and had lunch. Then we took the railway back up. It costs a dollar (you pay as you exit) and was a fun ride. Beats climbing all of those steps after eating! The wait was just a matter of minutes -- but it was January 2.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317KathyM
50,Take just a few minutes for some fun!,"Angels Flight is a very short but useful railroad traveling up a steep hillside in downtown Los Angeles. The view from the top is great, and it's actually quite a convenience for getting up or down the hill. It costs a dollar unless you have a transit card known as a TAP card, in which case it's a whole 50 cents. Bargain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LomitaBarry
40,A nice ride but Short,"It’s a historical landmark that loses a bit after its 100 year existence. The ride is short, but the cost invites one to take the round trip up/down the hill ($2 round trip or $1 if using Metro card). Kids would like it and the entire experience can be completed in probably 30 minutes. It’s convenient as the metro stop (red/purple) is right across the street on the corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrdhist
30,Just a touristy thing to do,Quaint little 2 minute ride up one block and then you can come back down the same way. $1 per person each way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevA738

50,La La Land icon,"Angels Flight Railway wasn't in operation on out last visit to holiday but since La La Land its re-opened, thankfully, a short trip up and down and its a winner and possibly the cheapest thing to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard

40,Quick but fun ride,"My wife and I rode this three times (Down, Up, Down) last week on our first tourist visit to Los Angeles. Most people would probably stop with one, but it was cold, the cars were uncrowded, the ride is cheap, and we wanted more photos -- and it was just fun! I'm sure the ticket clerk was laughing to see us three times.It's a very short ride -- readers of the Bosch novel (or viewers of the TV show) may be surprised by just how short it feels.Helpful if you're out for food, too; Grand Central Market is right by the foot of the railway, and both Little Tokyo and Chinatown are short walks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothylZ543EK
50,Short but Fun,"Angels Flight bills itself as ""the world's shortest railway."" And indeed, it is quick - lasting about a minute or so. San Francisco's Cable Cars are roughly from the same era, so Angels Flight will give you a fun, similar feeling - but with a much shorter duration. Once you get to the top, there's not much to do, other than look at the station for a minute or so and then go back down. Not sure if it is worth making a trip to all by itself - but in conjunction with Grand Central Market (right across the street) and the Bradbury Building - a very worthwhile trip for the three sites - especially if you are a history or railway buff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamj942
40,"Very nice, particularly if you are a fan of Michael Connelly, or you just don't want to walk up that hill !","I am a big fan of Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly's LA police detective. If you've read ""Angel's Flight"", you'll know why I tracked this site down, as well as the Grand Central Market, the Bradbury building and also the big wall mural with Anthony Quinn.All that aside, I actually ended up using this short tram ride for the correct reason. I had just finished dinner at the Grand Central Market and I didn't relish having to walk back up that hill. The Angel's Flight was just the ticket (literally).It costs $1 each way, but only 50 cents if you have an LA Metro TAP card, which I did. VERY worth the 50 cents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerK1932
40,Angels Flight,Interesting historically. Very short. $1 per trip. Difficult to park near there. Difficult to get my 92 year old Mother with walker on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryrY549GV
50,Charming,"Everything about what is mooted as the shortest railway ride in the world is charming. Up and down the two carriages, endearingly named Olivet and Sinai, are almost on a continuous loop.Costing $1 each way, on the ascent journey one pays on alighting at the terminus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Adorable,"A quick, inexpensive experience. My co-worker and I rode this after getting ice cream at the Grand Central Market. We just hopped on and it took us to the top of the hill. We paid $1.00 each for the really cool ride and then walked back to our hotel. It is short, but you gotta do it at least once!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpyderWitch
40,This was on our bucket list,As avid readers of the novels of Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch detective series of books on our bucket list was Angels Flight which not only is one of the author’s novels but the location for the TV episodes which were made from the book. It is a very short ride on the historic railway and it is a $1 in each direction. The trip was enjoyable and there were good photo opportunities at this location which is situated directly across from the Central Market which is a must visit location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reacher33
50,Well worth a few minutes!,"Not only is this a fun railroad but very handy. It runs every few minutes, so you don't have to wait long. The hill is steep, so the ride is appreciated! The cars themselves feel like you have stepped back in time. The view from the top is great by the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3718TTbarryw
50,Up & Up like the Coldplay Song,"So much to do and see in LA. My friend Dixie and I enjoyed a relaxing Sunday and caught this quick ride on a historic railway featured in many Hollywood series and movies.

40,A quick & inexpensive way to experience history,"Since it was off peak (in the 9 P.M. hr. before close) there were no lines at all! Had never really been to much of downtown but glad this attraction reopened. The ride itself only clocked in at 67 seconds but is something to be done by anyone who is a fan of old rail cars. At the bottom is Grand Central Market where there is a variety of places to grab a bite. This particular night there were only a few riders: on the way down a local couple who were very friendly & on the return trip families from Germany & India who I was able to give directions to despite myself being ~3,000 miles from home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/locke869
50,I was in it by myself - open til 10pm! only $1; you can by with credit card,I was walking by this attraction and I wasn't sure if I should get on it.It cost only $1 but I did not have cash on me (at all). I couldn't even ask anyone if I can pay by cash since on the bottom of the ride there is no cashier or there is no one inside the car to advise. So I took a chance I got into the car. It was a short ride on my own but it was fun! On the top there was a cashier and I was able to pay for my ride with a credit card!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
50,"cool ride, good view, nice mall at the top",$1 each way. Parking at the bottom was $10. We went to the grand central market first. Nice mall and garden to see once you get to the top after riding the little train.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ac333333

40,Really-what's not to love about a funky little Funicular?! Short and sweet.,"Ok, I love trains...there its out! Would I travel a great distance to ride the Angels Flight? Probably not, but since we were walking back to our hotel from dinner, you bet I would spend my $0.50 each way! Even though there are like at least 2 signs, some people (my husband!) asked if it is the same price each way! (The gal had a good laugh, said she is asked that question more times than any other.)..back to the ride-it takes only a few minutes, but it is total train history. Shorter than the funicular in Pittsburgh, but just as much fun! At 9 pm, no waiting either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineV88
40,GREAT PIECE OF L.A. HISTORY ON A HISTORIC TRAIN RIDE,It is great that Angles Flight is running again and taking passengers for a ride on the shortest train ride in the USA. It only costs $1.00 per person each way (seniors is $.50) a bargen for a piece of history. The ride is equivalent to the cable cars in San Francisco for nistalga. There are pay parking lots all over and the Grand Central Market across the street to have lunch and see another land mark. We had a great half day adventure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg

50,Short journey into the past!,"Short journey into the past! Better stated it is the only remaining part of the vibrant Bunker Hill neighborhood that was demolished to make way for the multi story high rises, offices and apartments. Some point to the Broad and the Disney Hall as benefits of the redevelopment of Bunker Hill. Others discuss the architectural heritage of the Victorian homes that once graced Bunker Hill.Ride Angels Flight, just a short journey. Nearby is the Grand Central Market, Million Dollar Theater and the Bradbury Building. All provide a view, with the proper dose of imagination, of the neighborhood that once surrounded Bunker Hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Looks cute,You can see the whole incline and the two cute orange cars at once. Then it’s just one of those things where they charge you good money to avoid a modest flight of stairs. The people who got on were even held up for a while such that I walked to the top faster than them. There’s a hill at the top that looks like a good place to relax and watch L.A. but it was fenced off and there was graffiti saying “save our knoll”. Disgraceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,As iconic as ever but more rickety,"Took out-of-towners, it was fun as usual. We were very disappointed that the park at the top did not have the dancing water display as usual. Not sure why.Of course we went across the street to the Grand Central market. It has become soooo gentrified, it is now just a collection of various eateries. High priced and highly ""concept"". Took a pass. The ""old"" days were far more fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oma664

50,Short but sweet piece of history!,"Totally worth the $1 to ride one way. Having rode this as a child with my father, it was extra sweet to ride it again as an adult with my mother. It was just as I remembered. Located just across from the Grand Central Market, you can board and pay at the top of the hill. It’s only about a 30 second ride but you can’t help but feel a bit of nostalgia as you glance out the windows. If you only wish to ride one way, there are stairs that run alongside the railway. My suggestion is to spend some time at the top, the view is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Cute bit of history to help you up the hill,"Happened upon this funky funicular after walking through Grand Central Market.

50,La La Loved it.,"Saw this on a site of best things to do in LA. It was close to the Broad musuem and brough us right to our next stop - The Grand Central Market. It's bright orange car and angled design is fun! For a dollar, it's worth taking a ride on this. I heard it was in the movie Lala Land. Now I have to watch the movie, lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8357YIsharont
40,Puts a silly smile on your face in thirty seconds!,"The whimsically named Angel’s Flight in Downtown LA is a vintage gem, a beloved LA landmark – a major draw for tourists, an essential LA experience. It’s a narrow gauge (2feet 6inches) funicular – that is, a cable railway built on an inclined surface.Having opened on New Year’s Eve 1901, Angel’s Flight is a centenarian that has carried millions up and down the steep side of Bunker Hill, between Hill Street and Grand Avenue. In fact, it was estimated that by the 1950s, it had carried over a 100 million passengers!A century ago, Broadway was the principal commercial and entertainment district of LA. Bunker Hill with its stately Victorian mansions was one of the very upmarket neighbourhoods of LA. The area’s elite residents apparently rode down on Angel’s Flight to shop for their groceries in Grand Central Market’s open-air arcade. The well heeled Bunker Hill residents paid a penny a ride in those days!After starting with its original owner Col. Eddy in 1901, ownership of Angel’s Flight has changed many times. The Angel’s Flight Railway Foundation, a private non-profit, became its seventh owner in 1996. In 2017, the Foundation chose the Angel’s Flight Development Company to operate and maintain it for the next thirty years in exchange for a share of its revenue.Despite being a major attraction, Angel’s Flight went into forced closure in 1969 as the surrounding area went into intensive commercialization, euphemistically termed “urban renewal”, which translates to residential mansions being demolished to make way for skyscrapers on Bunker Hill!Angel Flight’s two coaches, Olivet and Sinai, were warehoused and the railway was non-operational for almost the next three decades, until it finally reopened in 1996, half a block away from its original site.In 2001, Angel’s Flight suffered its only fatality till date when Sinai broke loose near the top of the hill and plummeted hitting Olivet on its way down. A vacationing tourist was killed and seven others were injured. That led to the railway being closed for the next 9 years. Operation was again halted in 2011, and after a derailment in 2013, shut down altogether.Finally, after being restored to its 1900’s glory, Angel’s Flight reopened on Labor Day, August 31, 2017 – Olivet and Sinai are back to gliding smoothly up and downhill. You can now ride it up to The Broad on Grand Avenue or ride it down to Grand Central MarketAngel Flight’s top station is at California Plaza on South Grand Avenue, and the lower station is at South Hill Street across from Grand Central Market. Its two cars, Sinai and Olivet are connected by a shared cable and run in unison in opposite directions on Bunker Hill, passing each other in the middle section. The cars are painted a shocking bright orange with black trim. The insides of the cars are done in gleaming wood and brass.The trip today is just 298 feet (315 feet when it commenced operations) and lasts a mere thirty seconds. However, Angel’s Flight has a definite claim to fame – it has carried more passengers per mile than any railway anywhere in the world – that makes it not only the shortest in length but also the most travelled on.A 153-step stairway is a new addition to the hillside – you can walk uphill or downhill, but why would you do that when Angel’s Flight is so much more fun! Apart from the joys of dining at Grand Central Market, the terrace at California Plaza gives you some of the most amazing, beautiful views of LA.Angel’s Flight has starred in the movies – more than a hundred if you please! Most recently, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shared a ride and a kiss in one of its cars in the 2016 movie La La Land (the railway was actually closed to the public at that time!). It has also been in many TV shows from Perry Mason to The Biggest Loser.Angel’s Flight is open 365 days a year from 6.45am until 10pm. The fare is $1 each way - 50 cents if you use your Metro TAP card with stored value (tap your valid TAP Card on the validator located at the Angel’s Flight Station house ticket window to be granted the discount). You can also purchase a souvenir round-trip ticket for $2 that you can take with you. You can do a one way or a round trip.Angel’s Flight was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1962 and found a well-deserved place in the National Register of Historic Places in the year 2000.Apart from taking you up and downhill nice and easy, what Angel’s Flight does best is it puts a silly smile on your face in thirty seconds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,If You're In The Area Def Visit,I wouldn't go out of my way to visit but if you're downtown it's worth it to take a short ride and a little trip back in time. The ride runs pretty regularly when in operation and lasts a few minutes. You pay up at the top and it costs just $1 (50 cents if you have a Metro card.) Interesting to think about a time when this was the best option to get up to the top of the hill where some nice Victorian homes used to stand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms

Well over 100 years old but not as long as sister systems in eastern cities, it has been recently refurbished. Sadly though it has had a couple of prolific accidents over the past couple of decades. If in the area(just outside the Pershing Square Metro stop) or having lunch at Geand Central Market, stop by to watch or ride. Or you could walk the adjacent 175+ steps that parallel it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/070816wh
40,"It’s an experience, it’s cheap, and it beats walking up steps","Basically just a trolley ride, maybe 3 minutes long at the most, up a steep hillside (so it’s a funicular railway) in downtown LA. Lower terminal of the rail line is located directly across the street from the Grand Central Market. The trolley is absolutely not handicap accessible.All things considered it’s not overly exciting, just mildly interesting. At the very least it’s something to do and say that you’ve done it. And it beats walking up the steps to get to the top of the hill.It’s really cheap too; as of Jan 2019 its only $1 each way (pay only at the top). If you buy the roundtrip ticket for $2 you get a special “commemorative” ticket (if you’re into things like that). Or if you want a real bargain, use your TAP card (LA metro card) and get 50 cents of your one way fare.If you chose not to ride you can still take some pictures/videos of the trolley doing its thing. The bright orange paint of the gate/ticket building combined with the old-timey looking rail car make for interesting pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markv399

30,Quirky,Visited for the ride this week just to say we did it while walking back to hotel from Grand Central Market. Ride takes couple of mins max but the information at the top makes it quite interesting. Ride is $1.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeWotton
40,For $1: A Short fun ride up and/or down a steep hill,"Some say it's the shortest train ride in the world. What it is is a cute way to go up a very steep hill. There are museums, restaurants and other sights on top and at the bottom. Nice view as the train is going. Kids love it too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
50,The Worlds Shortest Railway,"Angel's Flight has a long and interesting history. It has moved from its original location, been forgotten for a long time, and started again in fits and starts. Hopefully that is all behind it now and is set for a long short run. The railway is actually a funicular, with one car counterbalancing the other. The train will take you from Hill Street up to Grand. Beyond being a fun ride on its own, there is plenty to see top and bottom. At the bottom end there is Grand Central Market, which is rapidly losing its food merchants and being replaced by all kinds of restaurants. A trip through it will lead you to the Bradbury Building with its incredible atrium. At the top end, you have both the Broad Museum and MOCA, along with the Colburn School and Disney Hall. Your best bet is to tie your visit to Angels Flight with a stop at places both top and bottom. You can take the Metro Red or Purple Lines to Pershing Square, so you don't even need to worry about parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,"Cute, short ride on a piece of LA history","I am going to go ahead and set some expectations for you.This is a tiny little train that takes you up a very short, very steep hill. You can get on at the bottom, and then pay your $1 when you get to the top. If you start at the top, you pay before you board. If you purchase a round trip, you get a very cute little ticket that makes for a nice memento.As a resident of San Francisco, I walk up hills this steep all the time, so never really thought to try the train, but I finally did on this last trip, and I was completely charmed by it. We rode it to the top, enjoyed the lovely view, and then rode it back down. I rode it again a couple days later when I needed to get back down the hill, and still loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImekaSF
40,Short but sweet!,"This has to be one of the shortest ""railways"" in the US, if not the world. Very quaint rail car originally constructed to serve the residents of downtown L.A,, especially the Bunker Hill area. The attraction takes you up Bunker Hill (California Plaza, South Grand Avenue) or down to South Hill Street, across from the Grand Central Market. If you don't like stairs or hills, Angel's Flight is for you! The Railway is open daily, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including holidays, from 6:45 in the morning until 10:00 at night. Fares is $1.00 each way, and you may purchase a souvenir round-trip ticket for $2.00 to take a piece of history home with you.

40,Escape the noise and busy streets in LA...Worth your while,"This is a piece of LA history that is back in service again. Quite fascinating and a great break away from the noise and ""grey"" of the LA streets. At the top is what I would call an oasis, as it is quiet, clean, beautiful lawn and plants all encircled by an office building, Starbucks (nice store), and a few other shops. The difference from down below on the street and at the top of the railway, is really astounding. The price is $2.00, I believe, one way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hattie748
50,Don't miss this on your LA trip,I wasn't sure exactly what we were being told but when I saw the rail car going up the incline I understood. There is a elevation change in LA that I was unaware of and this rail car makes it simple to transition over the 400 steps.The cost is a $1 but the winner is you and it gives you the opportunity to enjoy the short ride instead of being exhausted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneq998
50,Take a trip back in time :),"Wonderful, classic attraction that has been around off and on for many decades. Originally utilized as a vital route to transport folks up Bunker Hill, today, it's a delightful 2 minute ride on an olde tyme funicular.

Walking along I spied something ORANGE and I thought--Is that the Angels Flight?!? I thought it wasn't running anymore.It saved us(like a true angel) and we got to feel like we were falling in love in LA LA LAND!A true gem-50 cents if you have a TAP card or otherwise one dollar.Worth it either way!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyw992
50,Don't be tempted by the foo foo food at the top.,"We made the big mistake of eating at the plaza at the top of this wonderful,cute historic railway.

Because the area has many other interesting things to see, it is easy to stop by for a quick picture and a ride for under 2 bucks.Make sure you also walk through the nearby Grand Central Market and Bradbury Building👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWebLA
50,A Charming Piece of LA History!,"I have walked by the world's shortest railway before but I never actually rode it until today! It's been around since 1901 and it's a very charming little trolley similar to those you'd find in San Francisco only in the middle of DTLA. It's been on and off over the years but demand for the funicular railway has increased ever since La La Land featured it briefly in the movie.Even though the ride is short, Bunker Hill is pretty steep so if you want to save some energy on your way over to Walt Disney Concert Hall or The Broad Museum, this is actually quite handy in getting you to the top.Prices one-way are $1, 50 cents I believe if you have the LA Metro Tap card, so if you have any spare change in your pocket, you can't go wrong with experiencing this little piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Really fun couple of minutes. And it's only a buck each way!,"My two friends and I ventured on this with bellies full of tacos and beer from Grand Central Market across the street. (It also happened to take us up to nearly the back door of our hotel.) It was a little hot sitting in the train car while we were waiting for it to start its ascent, but it was well worth it. Also did I mention it's $1 each way? So it's definitely worth it. It made for a really fun moment and looked amazing on my Instagram story. Though, I imagine it'd be extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) for someone to enjoy if you had to worry about a stroller or limited mobility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethLilly
50,Great Ride and Functional,"We took the Angels Flight Railway after visiting the MOCA Museum as we went to the Central Market for lunch. It was an enjoyable and functional ride between Hill Street and Grand Avenue on Bunker Hill. It is a 117-year-old funicular that is the world's shortest railway, 298 feet.

Down on Hill St. you'll find an entrance to Pershing Square Metro station and the historic Grand Central Market while up top is California Square where the summer series of free Grand Performances are held in a spectacular outdoor setting. also up top is the Museum of Contemporary Art.

40,Angels Flight RaIlway,I saw this in one of the episodes from Bosch on Netflix's and wondered where it was located in Los Angeles. It was neat and unusual for L.A. experience but the ride is very short and you really do not see much by going to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fparr
40,Entertaining & picturesque $1.00 ride,"Very similar to the funicular ride I took in Budapest a month earlier. The Angels funicular was built in 1901 and has a length of 91 metres (298 feet). The Budapest Castle Hill Funicular originally opened in 1870 and has a length of 95 metres (312 feet). Both funicular railways run with two counter-balanced cars, going in opposite directions. A sign says that it is the shortest railway in the world. The Angels Flight Railway is unique in the way the two cars pass each other, and for the majority of the track length, share a common rail, i.e., other than the mid-way portion where they pass each other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
40,Good fun,This great little railway saves the steep walk up the hill. It only costs 50cents each way with a Metro Card and is good fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5824GPjasons
50,What a hoot!!!,I have long wanted to ride on Angeles Flight RR but it was either closed or under repair. During one of our Friday night visits to the Broad and Grand Central Market we noticed the flight was open! It's the best dollar you'll ever spend for the shortest trip ever! Here's an insiders tip: If you're combing a Broad/GCM trip save yourself the trouble of walking up/down the hill and take the train. You won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
30,World's Shortest Railway from 1901,"Yes, it has some L.A history, built in 1901 it was the world's shortest railway. Its famous for movies like Muppets and La La Land. Now you can ride it for $1 each way and it will take you up bunker hill and boy avoiding those steep stairs with all the urine and homeless is a real treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Lots of fun for a buck,"What a super cool thing to do for a buck, 2 bucks round trip. If you have a Metro card, it's half of that. Would I brave driving to downtown Los Angeles just for this? No way! But since we were going to Grand Central Market, it's right across Hill Street. The view isn't spectacular, it jerks and jostles, and it takes you about a block. You can also take the stairs one way or the other. You just climb on at the bottom, ride up, and pay at the top. You can walk around at the top, or like we did, just pay again and ride down. Main thing is that it's rooted in the history of Los Angeles, and it's just plain fun. Unfortunately, this is not wheelchair nor stroller accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
50,Amazing little train,This is the shortest railroad in the world. It’s a steep incline that takes about 2 minuets to ride up. Cost is a dollar each way.

The car/tram appears to be beautifully restored and definitely has an old school charm - the short ride also felt “traditional”.I understand that the flight is thought by many to be nothing more than a tourist attraction now although it does connect roads and bypasses stairs!The fair was a bargain and we loved the experience.If you are in the area - give it a go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
50,"This FUNICULAR is a ""main character"" in season 3 of the ""Bosch"" TV series. Not to be missed!","We visited the Angel's Flight Railway funicular on Father's Day 2018. It was a Sunday so very light number of visitors. Having seen the new ""Bosch"" series of season 3 we had to go and see the ""scene of the crime"" for this new season. Built in 1901 the funicular is reminiscent of the SF cable cars but runs only 300 feet up or down the hill in Los Angeles. Great little adventure that only costs $1.00 toll each direction. Also, be sure to visit the GREAT food court across Hill street at the bottom of this Angel's Flight track ... NOT to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronwao

I took it both ways (up and down). It's located on Hill St. right across from Grand Central Market. It would be especially good for seniors or young children who have hard time climbing up hundreds of steps of stairways.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treebeard2005
30,Best way to get uphill,"A bit of yesteryear - with yesterday's prices! Usually $1.00 per ride, but only 50c with a Metro pass. Inside you can see that the carriage is on multiple levels, like a staircase, to ensure comfort as you go up the steep hill. It's an interesting experience, and most useful for climbing up the hill. Accessed from Grand Central Market. If you do one, you probably should do the other!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie

If there is no queue then you probably spent $1 on worse things in your life.The ride is short, bumpy and noisy with lots of squeaking from the cable and wheels but it’s part of a fun experience while you’re exploring down town.

Seriously, it takes you up a short ride between Hill Street and Grand Avenue on Bunker Hill. It's been open since 1901 and has given more than 100 million rides! It's fun and charming and I've never seen or ridden anything like it. Keep a buck in your back pocket and take a quick ride! It's a charmer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
40,A fun little side trip if you are in LA,"I saw Angels Flight in movies and on TV and just had to see it for myself. It’s like taking a step back in history. The cars have beautiful rich wood interiors. The train is very narrow, the seat face each other (see photo). Angels Flight is the world’s shortness railroad. It’s $2 for a round trip ride and worth the money. We entered on Hill Street across from the Grand Central Market. We boarded, rode a few minutes and disembarked at the station where you paid. At the top is the beautiful California Plaza with water feature and seating surrounded by skyscrapers.Tips: Buy food at the Grand Central Market and enjoy it in California Plaza.

When we did get there in 2014 we went by Angels Flight but it was closed. Yesterday we were back in LA and got to ride. It was well worth the $2 each (2 of us round trip) and it was fun. Yes, it was a short ride, but where else in the US can you do this and for this little bit of money. I am so glad we went, and now we can move on to another silly, fun thing to do. Kids would love this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karylynp

At the top of Angels Flight then there were old old houses today there are tall office buildings, apartments and condominiums.

Central to many of LA's tourist sites, this unique ride takes you on a short flight up the hill where you get some beautiful views of the city and it puts you across the street from the Walt Disney concert hall where you can tour another piece of history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4509PPtimf
50,52 seconds of pure history,This short rail road is a historical gem that dates to 1901.... Take the short ride for a dollar... Why not,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donh941
50,298 feet rail ride!,"Ever wonder about Angel's Flight and the point of it today?Well, it rained buckets on Tuesday, 01/09 (sadly also caused mudslides in SB) and we had a visit planned to The Broad! And since the Kusama's Infinity Room (yes it's open again!) wasn't quite ready for us, we opted for lunch at Grand Central Market. Angel's Flight is the best way to get to the Market in the rain! It's a straight shot from the Omni.I suppose you don't need a rainy day to enjoy the funicular railway!Stay tuned for a review of my go-to organic eatery (Sar-Sari) in the GCM!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/little_traveller
40,One for the La La Land fans!,"It's back open! It's such a little gem in the middle of Downtown skyscrapers and concrete - you can't miss the little orange trains going up and down.Once you reach the top, you pay for your ride and it was only a few dollars. The ride is very quick and once you reach the top there is a plaza with a starbucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx

50,A quirky and historic ride up Bunker Hill,"The Angels Flight Railway is operating again and it's worth splurging the $1.00 to ride up (or down) the steep hill. The railcar is spectacularly restored and riding in it gives you a sense of what it must have been like in the early 1900s when the wealthy would take the train to the top of Bunker Hill where fabulous Victorian-era mansions were located (of course, they're all long gone). The train car is driverless - simply climb in and ride to the top - payment is made at the top of the hill. The railway has appeared in many movies including most recently in La La Land. The bottom of the railway is right by the Central Market - a great place to grab a bite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
40,History in the midst of DTLA,"[Oct 23, 2017] on my previous visit to LA (October 2016) the Railway was closed, so I was thrilled to see it had reopened earlier in 2017. I’d run past the lower gatehouse (S Hill St) on Saturday and vowed to return. On Monday I returned and caught a ride down from the hilltop (S Olive St) to breakfast at Grand Central Market.I waited a few minutes (I was the only passenger on “Olivet”, one of the two cars. “Sinai” is the other) before boarding. Pay the lady a buck (a commemorative souvenir paper ticket can be purchased for a little more, watch your head & step when you board. Enjoy a rattling ride down the hill, maybe 90 seconds?I’m a history lover, so it’s great to see this colorful bit of the past so nicely preserved in the midst of a busy, modern city. I could imagine the riders a century ago riding this from their homes to the markets and businesses.Check it off the list —- my third funicular/incline ride (Johnstown, PA & Dubuque, IA were the others). Cool experience - definitely worth $1.00!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msubulldog25
30,no big deal,"I've lived in Los Angeles almost all my life, and heard about Angels Flight; it had always been out of service. Well, as we were walking back after the Broad, Angels Flight was working. It was fine, but don't go out of your way for this; only if you are in the vicinity",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flow0310
50,"A very quick trip down memory lane, all the way to the market","I was excited when I heard that Angels Flight had reopened, and I couldn't wait to climb aboard. I did it twice, first, early in the morning with a friend, then later in a crowded car with our respective daughters. It is quick, cheap ($1 a person), and very quaint. Added bonus: At the bottom of the tramway stands the LA market, where you can feast to your heart's content.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129sylvies
50,Another one of the bucket list.,"I basically grew up in Los Angeles, I always wanted to ride this for most of my life, but for many various reasons, I couldn't do it. Ride closures, schedules ect. Now I was in town and decided to finally ride it. To be honest, it really wasn't much, but because of the history and being one of the shortest rail ways in the world, I had to do it. Not to mention on my bucket list. I wasn't disappointed on this sunny Sunday morning. Grand central market, just opened and Angles flight was already up and running. I couldn't resist. When riding up to the top, a very nice view of the surrounding area. I recommend this ride for all, especially have you have little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esethebomb
50,Cute.,Every time we have came here it's been closed but heard from a friend that it's now open. So I had to check it out. It's $1 per ride each way and last less than I would say 2 1/2 minutes. Something to do and it's cute and cheap. So why not ?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshaneel
30,Nice,Until this past August I didn't know the train even moved. I thought it just sat there. It was great to see though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidson168

30,"Fun, unique short ride","Angels flight is a small cable car railway running up one block on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles. It is a fun, cheap attraction, and only cost a buck.The cars are quaint, with their seats at an angle to the floor (which is highly sloped), so you are sitting flat.Lots of people take the train to avoid hiking up the hill from Hill Street to Olive. There are stairs next to the tracks if you want a workout!This attraction has been closed for several years but is now open! (September 2017)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeK100
30,Angels Flight Railway,"I wanted to visit this place due to it being made famous by one of my favourite authors,Michael Connelly. It has recently been refurbished and was only a couple of blocks from my hotel. It has been restored to it's former glory and looks really well considering it's age and it still works. Worth viewing if you are in the Broadway/Downtown area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawkmatthews
50,Small touristy ride,"In spite of his very short touristy ride, it is still worth it, not only because it's just $2 roundtrip with souvenir ticket (or $1 oneway), but also it's a historic ride itself. The skyscrapers on top of the ride is a sight to behold and take pictures of, while the Grand Central Market below is a good place to eat or drink something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
30,"closed again, should reopen shortly","OK so we get there and it goes about two clocks but it closed do to severe heat. Its pretty and I am sure its great when it is running, it goes about two blocks. It took them two years to rebuild it and glad they did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misonix
40,Short ride connecting museums with restaurants,We walked from the Broad museum to an Italian restaurant down the hill. Rather than walking back up the steep hill we discovered this railway which I would've described as A funicular. For one dollar one-way we had a fun ride up the hill discovered a railway built over one hundred years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lubran
50,It's running! Angel's Flight is back.,"We took the Metro downtown to the Pershing Square Station and went straight to Angel's Flight. We heard it had just restarted service after being out of service for quite a while. The cars had a fresh coat of paint and looked absolutely glorious and it was a joy to see the twin railway cars on the funicular run up and down the short incline of LA's Bunker Hill from Hill Street up to Olive Street and back. The cost is now $1 per ride; with a Metro Tap Card, the cost is 50 cents. Although it is reportedly the world's shortest railway, it was nevertheless wonderful to sit in the wooden seats that are terraced in the cars to match the slope of the hill's incline. Wonderful experience and it was a thrill for our 2 year old grandson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Such a special means of transportation.,"I couldn't believe my luck as I was ambling through Downtown LA & noticed that this was open! I'd seen this in La La Land when Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling hopped out of the railways & really wanted to experience this myself. The price was very cheap ($1 for 1 way?) and the ride was definitely worth every penny. Great views from the top, and the ride up the hill was so special. A MUST-SEE if in Downtown!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie_ScottJ
40,Iconic,"We made a detour to see this, as it had been mentioned in Michael Connelly books. Loved seeing it. You can't ride on it at the moment, but reopening is planned for Labour Day 2017.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
40,mildly interesting - i would like to see it working,"kind of an interesting history - 1901 to 1969 it was working, then down for something like 20 years, then a grand reopening, and now its being refurbished yet again. its interesting to see the rail cars are built at an angle to match the track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arizona-mark
40,Coolest transportation in LA,"Angel's Flight is a type of conveyance called a ""Funicular Railway"", meaning a short railway that climbs a steep hill. The ride is short, cheap and well worth the diversion. At the bottom-end you will find the Central Market for good food. At the top a great view and a nearby art museum. Take a ride on one of the shortest railways in California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmoran2017
20,Not currently running,Unfortunately currently not working so you just get to see a static train car. Shame really as looks quite unique. I don't think there are plans to reopen anytime soon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andyuk100
40,An unexpected find in downtown LA,"Unfortunately the trains were out of commission at the time of my visit. But I still found it interesting just to have seen them. It's an intriguing item to find in a location that is mostly dominated by skyscrapers. Though I did not travel on the trains, I wanted to write this review just because I find it noteworthy, and also to leave the picture I took. What I find interesting about the design is that the middle rail is shared by both the left and right trains with the exception of halfway down the track so the trains can pass each other. Also good to know is that at the bottom of the tracks, across the street, you can find Grand Central Market, which is worth a short visit in its own right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rainier23
30,Great historic iconic for selfie,The goal of this cable car is to transport people from Hill Street and Grand Central Market up the hill to the financial district of Los Angeles. Currently it is not working but it is worth a picture just for keep. Get out of the Grand Central Market at Hill Street entrance and you will see this good view across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ

30,Cable cars not working,"Historic landmark of Los Angeles. It cost $0.50 cents to go up from the Grand Central Market. After an accident a few years back, the cable cars have not been in operation. You can still gain access to Cal Plaza by walking up a flight of stairs that smells like a public toilet. Once you reach the top, there is a nice water fountain and rest area for lunch at Cal Plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869lawrencec
30,CLOSED (except for the long - long! - stairway) at least as of 8/14/16,"CLOSED (except for the long stairway along the side) as of our visit on 8/14/16.Forget your stair-climber, this is a workout. 153 steps... Not only do you get to avoid the loiterers of dubious character that keep you from pausing on each platform on the way up (it's an incentive to keep moving), but you do get to relax at the summit in the nice Water Court at California Plaza. There's entertainment on several stages there during the summer mostly, but nothing was going on the Sunday afternoon that we made the trek.It's a great little piece of history you should (maybe) visit if you're in the area with time to kill - and can put up with the urban blight. What used to be a nice park at the bottom and running all the way along one side to the top is a disgrace. I agree with another reviewer - it's a shame the city can't seem to find the money to get this back on track.(I also posted this on Y elp - hope that's ok...)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11PaulB
30,Interesting to Funicular Enthusiasts,It’s closed so you can no longer ride the funicular but it’s being maintained and may be open again someday. Right now all you can do is take pictures and walk up the (stinky) stairway to the (closed) ticket office. It was still really cool to see in person since it's been in so many old movies (Kiss Me Deadly!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabriellaa169
30,Nostalgic Vintage Downtown attraction,"Read about this nostalgic vintage attraction and went to the site of Angels Flight Railway on 27 May 2016 morning which was a 15 minute walk from our hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the iconic funicular system seems to be no longer operational or shut down for maintenance and there was nobody around to answer our queries about the same. It served as a link to Bunker Hill residents uphill to downtown street and was known to be popular to tourists alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArindamG517
40,shame,"This is great example of vertical railway that reopened here for couple years after being a forgotten piece of LA and Bunker Hill past! Great to ride Flight to top and this should be taken over by historical society to preserve for future generations.

20,"Sorry Folks, Train Ride is Closed.","While it is certainly an icon of the city, it is also shuttered due to safety hazards. Although, in all honesty, don't feel like your trip is ruined because of it. The ride up is rickety, loud and brief. While it once likely gave you a spectacular view of the city, all you would get now is largely the front view of a cement block. Do yourself a favor, your health a favor and walk up the stairs next to it. Same view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
40,Fallen Angels,"Dating from 1901, and originally located a couple of blocks further north. An important but apparently neglected piece of LA history.

Just five minutes walk from Pershing Square Metro station, but no sign of it reopening as of December 2015.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wot2c
40,My What it could have Been ...,"I've ridden the Angel's Flight numerous times over the years and enjoyed the Victoriana of this neat little LA funicular railroad, when it was running - it wasn't operating when we last walked by unfortunately. This could be / should be a marquee LA attraction, if it only was working safely! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,The Little Engines That Could!,"This funicular railway was built in 1901, originally located a half-block,away. It extends 298 feet from the Grand Central Market of Los Angeles up Bunker Hill to the financial district. It is called the shortest railway in the world, and travels up a 33-degree grade. It is now closed, but we had a chance to ride it in 2010. It begins at the lower level on a single track, and about midway expands to a double track so that the cars (named Sinai and Olivet) can pass one another. The interiors of the cars are quintessentially Victorian and have no restraints or other comfort features on the wooden seats. The fare used to be 50-cents, but no one knows what the fare will be when - or if - it will reopen. There are nearby restaurants top and bottom, and plenty of parking. It was quite a ride, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
20,A Once Grand Ride,"Having ridden one of the last car rides up and down Bunker Hill to and from Grand Central Market decades ago before the grand mansions fell to the wrecker's ball and the entire hill was leveled, this simply was more like a short Disneyland ride than the once historical thrill it was.Nice try Los Angeles, but you committed municipal vandalism by destroying an important remnant of your historical culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards
40,Iconic Funicular Railway,"In the heart of LA's business district this iconic funicular railway is a great place to take the kids or to enjoy a bit of the history of the city. At 50 cents For a return trip, this must be the cheapest entertainment in the whole city. There are stairs to the side if you fancy a bit of exercise or just want a good photo opportunity.At the bottom just across the street is the Grand Central Markets, if you fancy trying some ethnic food or at the top you can enjoy a coffee and wander through the financial district.The 2 passenger cars have been beautifully maintained with staggered seating, unfortunately the train was closed for repairs on our last visit but hopefully will be open again soon. A must for kids, train enthusiasts, historians or (Michael Connelly) book worms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philippedubock

20,Nothing to see here,"The ""shortest train ride"" in the world is out of commission since September 2013 with no plans to be continued in the near future.

40,Where Angels Fly!,"Angels Flight is located across Grand Central Market and is a slice of LA history. It is said to be the world's shortest incorporated railway. It was built in 1901 by Colonel J.W. Eddy, lawyer, engineer and friend of President Abraham Lincoln and is a landmark, 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge[3] funicular railway in the Bunker Hill district of Downtown Los Angeles, California. It has two funicular cars: Sinai and Olivet. As one car ascended, the other descended, carried down by gravity. The counterbalanced cars, controlled by cables, travelled at 33 percent grade for 315 feet. It has carried more passengers per mile than any other railway in the world. The cost per ride used to be just 50 cents. After a fatal accident in 2001, it took 9 years to commence operations in 2010 but unfortunately, it was closed when we visited. We had to climb a steep flight of steps alongside the lift between California Plaza and Hill Street so make sure to wear sensible shoes. Lovely garden and nice views from the top. It’s appeared in quite a few films over the years. The movie ‘Unbreakable ‘ by M. Night Shyamalan, starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, was filmed here. Michael Connelly has written a crime thriller called “Angels Flight” about a dead lawyer found inside one of the cars of the Angels Flight Railway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
30,Great piece of history but out of action,This purports to be the shortest incorporated railway in the world but isn't open because it hasn't passed the required tickets to operate since 2013.

It is a short ride to the top, and costs 50 cents for a one way ride. It is a cute quaint trolley car, and at the top is a nice garden area. It saved us a long walk around, and was a bit of fun. Good picture opportunity as well. An unexpected surprise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fezzie1

A little nerve-racking because I did read about the ""incident"" that prompted its closure a couple of years back. Acceleration, gravity!No, really, the ""shortest railway in the world"" is a fun and historical .25$ ride. You can pay individual times or buy a book with five rides for 1$.Location?

It's not often that you get to experience a little bit of ""moving history"", and it was fun to imagine the houses that once topped the hill.

40,Short but sweet ride,"This railroad is a short ride (about 3 minutes) but is it fun. You are on the center of L.A. so you have a great view from the top. Park at the parking lot across the street from the bottom of the track ($8.00) and afterwards you can eat great Mexican food from the restaurant that is next to the parking lot. The restaurant is a ""hole in the wall"" but don't be afraid. The food is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huskerlaw
50,Short and sweet but worth the time!,It's only 50 cents to ride this cute little rail car up or down the hill. You can feel the history once you step inside the car. It's super cute and a great part of L.A.'s history :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cya-bya
40,Fun excursion to live a little history,"The Angels Flight Railway is a fun little attraction that provides a unique history of the ""City of Angels"" transportation system back in the day. The ride is very short as mentioned before, however when you take in everything it makes it enjoyable. The ride costs 50 cents (25 cents with a metro ticket) one way so it will not set you back financially.The railway is the shortest one in the world (or at least what they say, but is likely accurate) and was historically used by those well off who would have their staff bring up items purchased in town up the steep hill. There are two cars that run simultaneously and are automated. You pay at the top once you exit the car. Once at the top there is an overlook that on a clear day offers a nice view. You can either ride back down or take the stairs when you are done.I would recommend taking the trip on the railway. The railway itself is near Little Tokyo, the Japanese-American National Museum and other attractions so it is not really out of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wbullseye

50,Part of Los Angeles History,"Though it essentially goes nowhere, Angels Flight is part of Los Angeles history.

We used to shine shoes back then at the Grand Central Market for 10 cents a shine,with tips we would make 5 dollars some Saturdays.I was only ten years old then and now I am 61 years old. It was great showing my grandson where I grew up. We lived in the Figgaroa apts on 3rd and Figgaroa. Back then it was cheap to live. We used to go to the day old bakery right next to the Grand Central Market and but twenty packs of cupcakes for 1 dollar. You could buy two pieces of bubble gum for 1 penny. A candy bar was huge, not like today and they only cost a nickle. The street cars were still running back then. I do remember that there was a new blender in a window and it sold for $800.00 dollars. wow you can get one today for 12 to 25 dollars.

It took many years but finally it came back to lavish celebrations. Soon after it closed after and accident but is running again. The cost is small, the ride is short, but very historic and fun.

It was put away in cold storage, and then after redevelopment, put back up near the original site.The ride is not a thrill ride and the views on top are OK but nothing spectacular...it is enjoyable only because of it's history.

It is kinda neat taking a trolley that has been used since 1903. Has a little bit of a historic feel to it. Unfortunately, since I had done some research on it, the ride gives a little bit of uneasiness. It does shift and shimmy around a little bit as you head up the hill. So given the history of it, made me slightly uneasy. But it was kinda neat to say I took it and it is useful especially when staying at the Omni, as it gets you to California Plaza which is a short walk to the 3rd Floor entrance to the Omni.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9215RIrobt

Great for photography: The actual cars/rail - due to their color, look, and environment, make great subjects for photographythe ascending cars take you near Angels Knoll which offers great shots to take pictures from, and taking a picture of yourself while riding in the railcar always makes for a great Facebook picture.I'd like to make a point on the great city planning here.

50,Charming Very Short Funicular,"This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Angels Flight is a very short and very old funicular railway which takes you from the Grand Central Market of old downtown to the new downtown along Grand Avenue. MOCA, the Colburn School and Disney Hall are nearby. The California Plaza hosts an ambitious schedule of concerts and performances throughout the summer. There is a lovely courtyard across the street at the entrance to the market.The railroad was in storage for almost 25 years before returning in the late 90's. I used to live across the street and used it all the time. The hike up the hill is not for the faint-hearted. Alas, the adjacent park, Angels Knoll, is not too well maintained. It is too bad, because it is a lovely site.Unfortunately, the trains crashed in 2001 (they changed the original design). The railroad is still not back in operation. The latest date for its return is spring 2006. Once the railroad is running again, this will improve the experience for tourists. I do recommend getting out of your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HitchKennedy
10,pointless little pile of rust,"One of the amusing things about L.A. ""attractions"" is the hyperbole. So many times I've been told ""you have to see fill-in-the-blank, it's incredible!"" and when you actually see it, it's a pile of junk. This is a classic example of that. The Angel's Flight is a very small little beat-up ""railway"" consisting of an old arched entrance and some rusty tracks that go up a block or two. There is absolutely no reason to ever go even a block out of your way to see this and indeed if you aren't really paying attention you'll easily drive right by it without noticing it. Definitely can miss this unless you have some particular interest in L.A. historical transit matters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldwave
