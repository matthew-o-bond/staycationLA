50,Service Here is Truly a Treat,"I was with a small group from Lifepoint Church (Fredericksburg, VA) attending a week-long ""vision trip"" to the Dream Center, and we were fortunate enough to attend Thursday evening service at Angelus Temple. Let me tell you... I absolutely love my church, and it's extremely rare that I actually feel comfortable attending service anywhere else... but, service here was extraordinary and I truly felt right at home. From the moment we walked in, everyone was friendly, helpful, and excited to be there. Watching the students rock out to worship up near the stage was awesome, and I really, really love the fact that this entire place revolves around broken lives that He has resurrected. God's presence is evident within every inch of this building and it's a privilege to witness that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimZ_13
