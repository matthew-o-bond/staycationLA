50,Unforgettable Experience!,"When in LA you definitely need to visit this beautiful and unique place. So creative, educative and fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annageva7
40,SAMSKARA,"This immersive 360 review was a psychedelic fantasy. It included sights, sounds, smells in an ambiance or art, music and virtual reality. It is a journey perhaps best suited to the residents of Los Angeles; one intended to reach into your soul -- on its life journey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway776206
40,"Fun, eastern oriented art experience currently","Although in the less glamorous part of town, this is easy to find if you are driving and has some street parking around. It’s a little expensive but you could spend 2 hours here if you take your time to absorb everything that’s going on.Series of domes with different media content, take your time, sit down where there are seats because it’s usually to let you soak up a multimedia exhibit. The main dome for the 20 minute movie has lots of space and is comfortable. The current movie has great visuals that can be a bit overwhelming for some and has a few darker themes.The VR exhibit was fun, when we were there is was quiet so we got on quickly and paid return visits to it.The gift shop is (as tradition dictates) a rip off; $4 for a small bottle of tepid water. I’d love to hear from a gift shop director what the economics of this are...do enough people buy at inflated prices that the fact that some people choose not to be gouged doesn’t matter?Anyway, if you are in DTLA looking for a distraction, this is cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504
50,So good,This place is perfect for a date night! Reminds me of a small festival experience like EDC but minus the music unless you come to a weekend event. Maybe more like a burning man!!If you want to enjoy the whole thing in its depth come early on during the weekdays because it will be packed on the weekend and parking can be crazy but wow my boyfriend loved it and we will come back soon....We liked the movie so much you stayed to watch it three times LOL ! Oh and vegan food options!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmylife2015
50,New impressions,OMG!!!Was in LA for the weekend for work and was looking for fun things to do in the area and just randomly stumbled upon this place!! When do you normally just see giant domes lying around LA!?Lol had to come see what the deal was and wow! Packed with trippy/psychedelic art if you’re into that kind of stuff and the ending movie was incredible.Almost had to take a break because it was so intense!!! You lay down and get to see this whole 360 thing as if you’re there live in action. Craziness!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliannazzy
50,The Samskara movie was jaw dropping!,SUPER MIND BLOWING SPOT! Got the chance to come check out this new art exhibition and I have NO regrets! My buddy came for the Hendrix experience and I was pissed I didn't get the chance to come! The movie was WOW. How can they even think of these things?! Can't wait to rock out to their next events. Is there a way to get a membership to this place??? Would love to come over and over again to different events and bring some friends. They would love it here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q377TL
50,AWESOME!!!,"I was walking around the area after getting a couple drinks with my girlfriends at Angel City and we ran into these giant domes that you cannot miss. We got curious so we walked up to ask what they were and ended up in this immersive gallery that has a virtual reality dome. We might have came on a good night because it was extremely busy and tons of vegan food vendors on site. We loved the mirror room, awesome for selfies!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenvE8235FN
50,Wisdome,Stopped by on a Friday night because I read about this place in a Forbes article last week. I have lived in LA my whole life and have visited almost all exhibits in the area and this one is just by far one of the coolest. Went with some buddies of mine from San Diego then cruised around to a couple breweries and bars in the area. Great location and also discounts for students if you have an ID!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aacookie31
