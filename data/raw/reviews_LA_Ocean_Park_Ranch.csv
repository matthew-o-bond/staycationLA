50,AWESOME Riding Experience,"My husband Cory, loves to ride horses and found this wonderful team to do it with. Today we drove 62 miles to reach one of their trails in Granada Hills and the day was simply wonderful. I rode Kasey K and Cory rode Cody. Both Dawn and Mike was excellent guides and within minutes we both felt very comfortable on these beautiful animals. We are looking forward to more rides at some of their other trails. Thank you so much for an awesome experience!",legacyrunner17
50,A Fabulous Morning Horseback Ride,"We had a FABULOUS time last Saturday morning riding with Dawn & Mike. Kasey K and Cody are sweet and beautiful horses and we had a great time. We have been looking for a facility to visit regularly, and have decided Ocean Park Ranch is the one! Will definitely do it again when we have some free time. Would like to try the three hour ride. Maybe see if they have an English saddle available. You Dawn, Mike, Kasey, & Cody.",WendilynEmrys
50,Best Horseback Riding Experience,"This place offers private horseback riding excursions. We tried the hour long one in the Valley and it was great. Dawn was incredibly outgoing and accommodating to our needs. They helped us mount, explained how to steer the horses, and then gave us about 10 minutes in a closed of rink to get squinted. Then, when we were on the trailer, they gave us plenty of space and allowed us to feel like we were there by ourselves. But they also answered questions when called upon and were great guides. We will definitely ride with them again and even do the 3 hour excursion. The best part was that it was just myself and my friend. No other groups anywhere near. What a great feeling.",Oleg R
