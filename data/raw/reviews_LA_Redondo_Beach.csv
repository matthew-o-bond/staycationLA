But the bike path is nice to walk, rollerblade and ride bikes. Beautiful sunsets!",The Adventure Buddies
50,Lovely enclave,Los Angeles is just very large so it was good to focus our visit in a defined area. We enjoyed casual walking around and shopping as well as some incredible food. It is very clean and the people are very friendly. A few locals even stopped and asked if we needed help. Delightful.,Marilyn A
50,GREAT WALK,We did a quick walk on the beach prior to flying out of LAX. We were staying at the Crowne Plaza. The neighborhood is upscale and we felt very safe walking the beach. We left Minnesota when it was -9 degrees and wish we could have walked the beach a few more times before returning to Minnesota.,LuvToTravel0899
40,THE Premiere Hotel in Redondo Beach,"FIrst visit to Redondo Beach and chose the Shade based on a recommendation. If an authentic SoCal/beach feel is what you're looking for, then you've found the right place. I chose an upper room with marina view. King size, memory foam bed with a separate sitting area. Two flat screen TVs. The rooms are VERY spacious and well-appointed. Modern/contemporary decor and LARGE bathroom. The soaking tub on the balcony was a great touch as well. Extremely attentive and efficient staff. Angela at the front desk was a pleasure, and made every effort to ensure my stay was topnotch. Shade is my go-to hotel for all visits to the South Bay..",HOV1173

50,So worth your time!,"It is so worth your time even if we're talking about 30 minutes. I was fortunate enough that I had all the time that I needed to walk in the unusually warm surf and I even found (almost) whole sand dollars! It felt as though I had been blessed with these treasured finds! If you ever find yourself near there, treat yourself to these magnificent place.",Esther9777
50,Best pier in Southern California,"Of all the piers, I think this is the best one. It's not one long strip into the ocean like the others. It's shaped differently to where you feel like you're walking through a park. They have so many food places too. Other ones may have one or two. If I were to recommend a pier for a visitor to go to, this would be it. Probably Santa Monica Pier after.",TerryK
40,Lovely and Clean,"The infrastructure surrounding is somewhat off-putting, but the beach is clean, safe, and well serviced.",sinderella66

40,Redondo Pier for Lunch,"Redondo Beach is probably the best area along the coast to visit and hang out for lunch. The Beach is the same as any along the Coast as they're all pretty much the same Beach, but Redondo is my pick, for casual bars, interesting shops, not so upmarket as Hermosa or touristy as Venice Beach. Will always be my choice of location along the coast to stop off for lunch and a beer.",Eugene H
30,Crowded place on the weekend,Very much a locals hangout on the weekend. Places next to the pier are impossible to get. Either travel way south to the end of on Redondo Beach or a little north to Hermosa Beach.,lovestoroam78
50,Very Good Family Beach,This was a very good place to visit and we will definitely return to this beach in the future. We obtained rental bikes from this location and everywhere we went there were activities for us to participate in. Manhattan Beach did not have any bike rental establishments.,kansas_traveler38815

50,Great Mix of People,Redondo Beach was buzzing Friday afternoon. Crowds of people pitched their canopies and beach umbrellas and watched their children frolic in the waves or build sand castles. What could be more American than this? An added feature was a couple of salespeople working the beach crowd with their fresh melon and fruits in a cup or on a stick. The water was not too rough for casual wading and swimming and we spent about 45 minutes going towards the pier and then south towards Palos Verdes Peninsula. They have changing rooms and showers below the Veterans Park on the bluff. WE couldn't have been happier.,Pfitzgerald1946

50,So COOl,Redondo is a very pretty scenery filled beach area. The pier is so cool with all the shops and food. I must have gained 10 lbs but then you can walk all around and its great.

20,Didn't smoke our tyres,"Busy beach with lots of surfers, paddle boarders and kayakers.In the water was probably the best place to be as the rest of the area was full of tacky tourist rubbish.

30,Early morning Visit to Veterans Park,"Stopped by early, around 7am before leaving area. Lots of staff cleaning area and restrooms. Not sure what the tractor was going up and down the beach but had hoped it picked up trash and plastic....It did NOT...Was disappointed in the amount of plastic bottles and wrappers in sand. On my way back from waters edge, picked up an arm load of trash and threw into one of MANY trash and recycling receptacles lining the sidewalk. Otherwise it seems like it would be a good beach to visit when warmer.",675sandy
50,Redondo Beach -An awesome sunset location and a peaceful beach with mix of family and young crowd!!,"It was a awesome evening with a beautiful sunset with the onset of lot of flights going down the sun in the farther view over the beach/pacific ocean is a blessing in disguise.

It is definitely a must visit of you are in south-bay/LA area.",ArunM04
40,"Nice beach, often big waves","When we visited in March, there were no swimmers but plenty of surfers. Although it was not a particularly windy or blustery day, the waves were very big. We walked along the path from the pier for approximately 2 miles. It was very pleasant. The pedestrian path is not particularly wide but enough for two persons. There is also a separate path for cyclists. There are plenty of volleyball courts on the beach.",vincemc
50,Great Place To Stay While Visuting LA,"Southern California is all about the weather. What better place to than at the beach. Easy to get to other parts of LA. But, you should have a car.",friend2friendless
50,Beautiful California beach,"Having lived in the area for 30 years, I'm probably prejudiced, but Redondo Beach is one of my favorite areas! Lovely beach, but more than that the town is a fun place to shop, eat and stay! Great harbor where you can charter boats, or rent a kayak, paddle board or small boat.",lmatteson
30,"Nice Beach, but watch out for the tar!","Bear with me and be prepared if you're going to visit the beach here. We took a quick family trip for spring break. Love the Redondo Beach area. Cute town, public parking convenient for unpacking your gear and hauling it down to the beach. Decent restrooms close by. Rough waves the two different afternoons we visited, but still fun. Would possibly visit again as long as we're prepared for the tar. The first day we went, our daughter ended up with this black, extremely sticky goop on her feet and shoes that was hard to clean off. We didn't think much of it until the next day we went to the beach again and my husband and I suffered the same fate! I was at the edge of the sand by the walkway trying to get the tar off (or at least make it less sticky) by rubbing sand into my foot. An older gentleman walking by paused and talked with us, and asked ""you're not from here, are you?"" Haha. He could tell by the way we were trying to get the tar off our feet, ultimately making a mess of our hands too. Following his instructions, we used some baby wipes we had in the car with limited success (but enough for us to at least get in the car) and drove right to a drug store to get acetone nail polish remover. It did the trick and took the remaining tar off our skin and shoes. Whew! We'd learned our lesson though, and went to other nearby beaches (without the tar issue) during the remainder of our stay.",Brad-Angel S
40,Loved the beach,"Lots of sun and warmth, we visited from Northern Michigan in February. Not a lot of locals were out and probably thought we were strange for being so excited about the beach sand, sun and how warm it was, almost 72 degrees. Most locals we saw had long sleeves or sweaters on.",Kevin C

40,"Nice views, pretty harbor","It’s a pretty view. Sheltered harbor, many boats, big and small. Row of restaurants and a hotel or two. Sea Level restaurant, Bluewater Grill and Baleen kitchen are all good. The place has a serene factor. Worth dropping in for a peek.",CTPreview

50,HIDDEN LA TREASURE,Redondo Beach is not one of those names that jumps out at travelers. It should. The waterfront area is just beautiful and the boardwalk and arcade are engaging and interesting. This is a great little town that is walking friendly and easy to traverse.,Tom Proietti
50,Sunday morning biking,I think this is where the serious runners and surfers go. There were some serious looking athletes here. There was an outdoor church having a service in the beach when I cruised by. Beautiful. Great bike path.,Roni1107

The pier nearby for eating and drinking as well as Riviera Village with it's shops and restaurants.",Tpart2
40,Very Relaxing!,"This is a must place to visit if you are in Los Angeles area. The beach is so pristine with its blue waves and white clean sands.

The stretch of beach was not as expansive like Venice, which was a plus to us. It had more of a family type atmosphere and even though it was well populated, it didn't seem over crowded. There were restrooms close by and the proximity to the pier was nice so we could visit restaurants and shops when the sun became overwhelming. Fun day at the beach.",BuenaVidaVacations

30,pay for parking even at night,Parked in a lot just south of the pier parking structure and were lucky that someone else was pulling out. Payment is required in the meters even at night. Walked down a flight of stairs to get to the walk/bike path that parallels the ocean. Then walked over to the pier area. Didn't have to take the flight of stairs back up to the parking lot because there is an upper path that leads to it. There are two paths that parallel the ocean. Went over Labor Day weekend during a heatwave. It was hot and humid even here. There were still people on the beach sand in the dark. Some were in the water.

Good food, tshirt shops, and some nich jewelry, clothing stores.",Judpma012
50,A state beach offering many paths of enjoyment,"There are many ways to enjoy Redondo State Beach. You can park at the Pier (at the end of Torrance Blvd.) for a few dollar, then stroll along the pier, sample foods from any of the eateries, take photos, enjoy the architectural decor. Or you can go to Rivera Village, park (there are meters but a few blocks north of Avenue I, on Catalina Avenue, you can find free parking for one or two hours). In addition to restaurants, there are boutique shops, even a popular coffee house. The esplanade along the shoreline offers walking, benches to view the scene, and ramps to walk down to the strand. The weather is usually nice. Sometimes you will see surfers. Sometimes, you will see dolphins romping near the shoreline. And then there are pelicans. What fun and it doesn't cost much, unless you want to dine and even then there are many options.",tapbelle

50,1st highlight of 15-day US trip,"The 1st morning of our 15-day trip to the US, we strolled from our (Best Western Plus) hotel to Redondo Beach: wow!Iconic California beach, but almost deserted, early October. Beautiful.2 hours strolling on the sand, Frisbee & photos.Plenty of gentle access from the cliff-top. Lots of cafes, bars and restaurants up there too.We only had time to walk about 1/3 of the Beach, but we loved it.(In fact the sand was spookily similar to the beach in Bournemouth, our home town in England.This is a relaxed alternative to the bustle of LA, which is why we chose to stay here on our 1st night in the States. Redondo Beach: we love it!",Johnfrisbee
40,I could live here,Because this beach is below the street is is busy but rarely crowded. it is peaceful and they do a great job cleaning up the beach every morning. dolphins regularly and whales seasonally.

50,Got to love Redondo!,"When you think of California and the whole surfing scene, Redondo Beach is and has always been a front runner. I grew up going these So. Cal beaches and Redondo has always been a favorite. Now I had a chance to take my daughter and her friend. They loved it there! Park in the Pier Parking. It's a lot cheaper.",bdy328

50,"Clean, easily accessible beach","Spent a couple of days surfing at Redondo State Beach. Had never been here before, but found it to be very clean, and easy to access from many close by parking lots. They clean the beach every night, so the sand was nice and clean each morning. Also a nice walking/biking path that follows the beach for miles.",JimJ3333
30,Pretty part of the south bay,"The Redondo State Beach is one part of the continuous beach extending from Malibu almost to San Pedro. Many areas of soft sand and ocean front offer good spots for swimming, sun bathing or just enjoying being near the ocean.",buffalojim67
40,"A beautiful beach, watch for dolphins!","Love this beach! The sand is nice, there are often dolphins and sometimes whales or seals. The only problem with this beach is that some of the beach crew who drive along the beach are kind of obnoxious about people getting in their way. Even though there is plenty of room for everybody, some of them insist on other people clearing a big path for them because apparently they can't deviate even a few steps off of their original course, which means a few seconds of extra drive time.",georgeaD9887KR
50,Great place to watch the sunset,"You can see all the way out to Malibu on the one side, and Palos Verdes on the other. Like all other beach areas in LA, parking can be a problem on weekends, although if you get there by 9AM or after 3PM you should be able to find something. My favorite beach in LA.",wel51x
50,Great Sunsets!!,The Esplanade in Redondo has a vast beach and is beautiful! Some come to exercise- (run the stairs!) others to relax and enjoy the sea. You can usually see dolphins swimming in the water. The fall Sunsets are epic!!,Emg90277
50,Clean!!,Beach is amazing. it is clean as are the bathrooms. Lots of sea life if you look close enough. We saw sting rays and schools of fish. Just down in the harbor there are seals. You can rent kayaks and get close.,Valerie

30,Narrow Beach with Paid Parking,"I ride past this beach quite often as it parallels a nice bike path from PV to Marina Del Rey. The beach is nice, but as I said it is not very deep from pavement to waters edge. Therefore, it can get quite crowded. Is is also sad that the city charges you to park in the lot/structure.",Steve Z

50,Redondo Beach Review,"This is a very clean and safe beach with very capable lifeguards on duty seasonally. Great place to bring the kids to get them used to the water , particularity during summer months when the wave aren't very big. There is a parking lot above, fee required ,but makes things convenient when unloading & loading little ones and beach stuff. Free parking nearby is tough. During the summer months there is a Perry's out door restaurant at the very south end of the bike path. Great place for breakfast , lunch and early dinner while sitting in the sand. Oh and great coffee too. ENJOY",gtomkiewicz
50,A wonderful place to Walk and Enjoy Sunsets,"What a lovely Beach. Easy access. Parking is always available. And it is a wonderful place to take a brisk or relaxing walk. There are walking paths down below, near the sand, or up above on the Esplanade. Great biking / skating paths as well. This is a true Hidden TREASURE!!",melodykulsic
40,Nice Beach,"We live on this beach. If you are from overseas, you will love it. Pretty clean sand. Water not too rough usually. Pier nearby with food and little stores. Summer days can be busy.

40,"Great location, clean beach",Stayed at the portifino and visited this beach. Close to the pier and plenty of shops. Waves were small and great for families,Lorax1971
50,Clean water and one of the best views in the world,"Seriously, on a clear day you can see Malibu and Palos Verdes with all the green trees and beautiful houses with red roofs - relaxing. The multi-use path is never packed, but you can find people using it almost all times of the night for exercise. The waves are rarely dangerous, but still a blast for the kids. We could always use more volleyball courts, so we don't have to stress about getting down there first, but in most places the sand is great and clean.",TorranceTroy
50,Fourth of July was a blast!!,"We got there at 9am on the Fourth of July so it was crowded. Parking was 30 bucks so we were not too excited about that but hey it was a holiday. There were so many families out and everyone was happy, lively and having a great time. We had a hard time putting up our gazebo and some friendly beach goers gave us a helping hand. It was a family outing and all the kids had a superb time. It was all worth it as we made some great family memories. ❤️",MommyOnAFunMission
50,Stroll through Redondo Beach,"After a good breakfast in The Original Pancake House, I enjoyed a walk along Redondo Beach to help digest my breakfast. This was a perfect way to help get over my breakfast since the weather was perfect - not hot, windy and cool. I enjoyed the sites and the people were very friendly. Sitting in one of the benches and just staring out in the ocean was a perfect feel. You can see the Pacific Coast Highway. The view was perfect and serene.",Gablopez33

20,Didn't smoke our tyres,"Busy beach with a few surfers, paddle boarders and kayakers.In the water was probably the best place to be as the rest of the area was full of tacky tourist rubbish. Slot machines and naff gift shops, definitely not somewhere I would ever want to visit again!Go down the road to Manhattan or Hermosa beach for a nicer experience!",D P
20,In need of a good cleaning,"There are parts of this beach that are just fine. We spent a fair amount of time here for a few family events that were preplanned. As lifelong east-coasters, and having been to these local beaches many years ago, the level of pollution and trash on the beach was pretty alarming. There are plenty of trash receptacles on the beach, I believe most of what we saw actually washed onto the beach from somewhere else. It was really kind of sad. We spent time on Hermosa Beach during this trip as well and it was much much cleaner. I'd say go here if you are close and have no means to get to other locations.",Jason C
40,Lovely family beach,This beach has a great cycle lane and walking section. Plenty of space on the beach. Also plenty of volleyball nets.,Rowsh

40,Nice SoCal Beach!,"Redondo Beach has a large expanse of beach area. It is bordered by a wide bike and exercise path. It is easily accessible with a large parking area. We visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The beach and ocean were beautiful and not too crowded. Unfortunately it was very windy and the water was chilly, so only the brave ventured into the water! The rest of us huddled under towels for warmth, built sandcastles or played games! The Redondo Beach Pier, souvenir shops and numerous restaurants make a visit to Redondo Beach memorable.",MKTBE

40,Classic LA beach,"Like all the beaches along this stretch of coastline one can safely walk for miles and miles taking in the beach scenes, piers, surfers, boating, fishing and of course, beach volleyball enthusiasts. There are many restaurants to visit, hotels to stay at and the coastline to enjoy by car, bicycle, walking, rollerblading or skateboarding. Many choices and plenty opportunities to people watch.

40,"Fun beach to visit with your family, especially during the summer","Redondo Beach is a nice place to boogie board, body surf, tan, build sand castles, and play in the sand. I take my niece there every summer when the lifeguards are present. The lifeguards are nice and helpful, the weather is great, and the water sports are perfect for a family outing. Later, when you are ready leave the beach and get something to eat, you might want to head to the pier for seafood to cap off a perfect summer day.",lauraemikoelsaa
50,Redondo Beach,The pier itself is quiet pretty and goes out a bit. The end of the pier has a small ocean exhibit which is worth a view . Otherwise always worth a walk .,mweaver1127
50,Nice place to stroll,"You can either walk along the sand, or a well marked pedestrian path or ride on the bike path. The pier is also a good option. Wi-Fi service here is terrible, so you likely won't be able to look at the internet. Parking garage is easy to pay. If you park near the beach, bring quarters.",Carmyn26

40,One Of The Good Beaches In Southbay,"Redondo Beach made my list of top beaches in SoCal simply because of the scenery and all around vibe. I have found that it can be extremely windy here and the waves are huge! If I was a surfer I guess this would be a good spot! I come here on Sundays every so often to just hang out and relax while enjoying a good happy hour. Just like any other beach in SoCal you can expect a heavy crowd. Timing is everything so you just have to find out what works best for you. I personally like the times around 3pm-4pm for arriving so that I can catch a good sunset! I like the fact that the parking here is reasonable and you can pay in advance. As far as the actual water and beach itself I have never been IN because of how dirty it can be. The oil issue has been one for a while now and it's incredibly hard to get off of your close if you happen to get it on yourself. Overall the beaches in Southbay are my favorite because it seems less ""tourist trapish"" more locals then anything for the most part..",BugattiBoi88
40,"Clean, accessible",We enjoyed some time here and it was quite lovely. There is a bike trail that goes from Palos Verses to Santa Monica. The beach is clean and family friendly.,mdgipsy
40,Nice place to be if you are in the area,"Perfect base for water sports, exploring the marina and relaxing at the beach. This beach is nice if you don't want to go to crowded areas like Santa Monica and Venice. I would say this is the perfect place to relax if you want to take a break of the hectic LA area and tourist hot spots",Luís G
50,The view to live by.,"Not that I want a million people flocking to ""my beach"" for summer, but it is worth a stop. I grew up here. The water displays whales, dolphins, sea birds and seals in abundance during the summer and fall. Clean beaches, an active doggie park, and two perfect miles of sidewalk to stroll overlooking the beach and view of Rolling Hills to the south, and the Redondo Pier to the north. Lots of good food and fun distractions within 3 miles.",busterose

At the pier lots of place for eating (good restaurants, fast food, fresh fish cooked on site, etc), buying souvenirs, enjoy ice cream, and more. Good spot for spending an entire day at the beach or for a nice walk, bike ride no matter the weather. If you like taking pics and watching sunset, definitely go there! Parking on site, not very expensive, or park along the streets for free.",AdaAlessandra
40,Marvelous view,"We went here one time with one of my friends to have a nice chat while eating our 'to go' lunch.The day was beautiful and the soft breeze gently touched our sun kissed faces.If you want to 'unwind' and enjoy the view or just walk your dog, this is the place to be.

50,"Calm, peaceful and community beach",Redondo Beach is a nice weekend getaway family Beach. You can play in water when temperatures are sane.You can see a lot of families with young kids and toddlers enjoying the beach. Birds on the shore make it a good photo site.There are quite a few runners and there is a very good long cycling track as well.

The Rivera village is there to and has great shopping and food and bar selections. Somewhat up scale, but also has a inexpensive chooses, Pizza, Hawaiian, Mexican and a trader Joes. Some people only come for the Pier which is a full selection option also. I looked at the photos and thought not much needed to be added as far as the beach views. Nice town and easy to drive up to PV for cliffs views and a country drive. Check it out. Great sunset location.",Alan S Torrance

40,We parked a bit North,"We were new to the area and found the beach. We traveled North and found we could park on the road at no cost. The parking lots charge you normally as well as there are meters normally along the road. So going a bit North prior to heading into the housing area, was smart. The beach had a rescue worker on duty. The beach had a few boarders. The beach was pretty clean. It was worth the time spent. There are bathrooms and an outdoor shower on this beach as well. We walked the beach and enjoyed the sunset.",ronaldf244
40,Excellent pathway!,"If you like biking, walking, skateboarding and / or rollerblading, this beach is the beginning of a long pathway system that will take you many hours to finish. The path is flat and well marked so you know what to do.We were able to bike and watch the surfers as we travelled along. There are public restrooms along the way too.Great way to spend a day, morning or afternoon!",Kim H
50,Beautiful walk on the strand,"After having a great lunch, I decided to take a walk on the strand. I came across bathrooms, which were very clean.

40,Nice beach,"I still prefer Manhattan or Hermosa to Redondo, but you have the pier. The little park nearby offers BBQ grills if you want. Be careful riding your bike starting at the pier.

50,Sun and surf,Spent the day walking up and down the beach in beautiful sunny California weather. Had some pizza and frozen yogurt on the pier while watching the surf.

A nice bike path will also take you all the way to Malibu (if you have that kind of stamina) but you get the idea. The South Bay and the Esplanade in Redondo Beach are a great asset to the City and is somewhat of a hidden gem.",Andrea D

40,Know Where to Go,"Redondo Beach, California is a moderate beach city of approximately 65,000+ people. The beach itself is terrific, situated north of the Redondo Beach Pier. While there is beach space on the north side of the pier, the real gem of this stretch of beach is located further north, north of Topaz Street. The beach goers found along the Esplanade is a much nicer group, clean, mostly locals who show care and consideration for the beach, picking up their trash and generally leaving the beach as they found it. The section of beach just north of the pier or adjacent to it is usually packed, mostly by folks from outside the city, and that section of beach is often left strewn with trash and discarded/broken items that were brought to the beach and people simply didn't pick up. Go further north.....get away from the crowds and enjoy the sun, sand and surf.",CD1970

I love Redondo on the weekdays, its like my own private beach. Very local, and not touristy at all. Not a lot of shopping, but I don't go to the beach to shop. there are a few pubs and bars on the beach so it's a great place to grab a mimosa, rent a kayak or stand up paddle board and not have to deal with the tourism Manhattan beach or Santa Monica attract.",KnarikBrewster

50,Our favorite PCH beach!,"We traveled the PCH, the one, from San Francisco to Redondo Beach for a week. We stayed our second to last night before going back to LA to fly home at the Redondo Inn and Suites. We had to walk only 3 blocks to get the ocean. I noticed there was plenty of parking in the neighbor hood for anyone to park. There was a wide walking path that went on for miles. We sat for hours and watched them play volleyball, swim and run the path. The beach was very wide and all was clean. I could see bath/shower houses for people to use. I would have to say of all the beaches we stopped at this was my favorite as far as cleanliness and atmosphere. The sunset was beautiful and the people, mostly from the apartments/homes around the area were very friendly. I have been home for a month and I dream about living at Redondo Beach!!!",tocman

50,Hidden Gem,This is a beautiful beach! We had the beach practically to ourselves. The bathrooms were a little broken down but still usable. There are showers too. You can surf the waves. Not far from restaurants and bars. Parking wasn't a problem. We parked on D Street. I didn't see anything that made it handicapped accessible. The ramps and staircase are quite steep.,optomdoc
50,Beautiful Beach!,"We stayed less than a block from this beautiful gem of a beach. Every opportunity we had, we went down to the beach just to chill and enjoy the waves crashing.

30,Cali state beach,We parked and walked the beach and to the pier. We ate teriyaki chicken bowls at one of the places at the pier. I liked some of the other beaches better.

50,Fun beach nice sand!,We took our family here in hopes of being able to just play and sunbathe. It is a good beach don't get me wrong but with our little 8 year olds we had to keep an eye on them with the undertow. You can still play in the water but have to keep an eye out. There were quite a few people. It is beautiful but I was hoping for a quieter less busy beach to just hang and enjoy the sun. Still a good time and beautiful scenery. A lot of sailboats in the distance.,Stephaniest3
40,Redondo's Beach is Great,"Redondo means round in Spanish, and it's Beach is rounded as it meets the ocean. It is a great place to lay in the sun, play volleyball, sand soccer, or even catch some waves. Most of the year the waves are small, but Winter swells can be large and fun. It can hold up to about a four foot swell, before it becomes walled out, but Topaz jetty will catch large Northwest swells for a big drop, and sometimes even barrrles, while the Saphire side of the jetty can, at the same time, be small and rideable. Avenue A through C are generally quite surfable, but Ave I is often walled up and unrideable. At Torrance Blvd.,, and the beach, is the horseshoe pier. Plenty of fishing and tasty restaurants. When my cousins come to visit, we always take a long bike ride from the end of the bike path, in Torrance, to the end of the strand, in Manhattan Beach. It can be crowded and slow, but so what, it's a ride at the beach.",easky
50,Vacation,"We live in the Inland Empire. Every year we escape to Redondo Beach as as family or for a romantic getaway.

All in all - a fine way to spend an afternoon if your in love, out of love, alone or with your entire family - at some point just close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the waves hitting the beaches.

The past couple of years when I went back to visit, Redondo Beach was pretty dirty and the water was brown. It appears a lot of effort has been put in to clean it up.

50,Romantic beach getaway,"Wow! We just love Redondo Beach. We can't say enough good things about it. I think it's our absolutely fave beach in the LA area. Do check it out. The pier is interesting, you can fish there, and they even provide fishing poles right off the railing of the deck - smart idea! You can shop in the many boutique shops at the pier. You can rent a tandem bicycle (a bicycle built for two) which we just loved. The best part? Take a deep breath and inhale that salty Pacific Ocean air. Ahh.",Brenda E
40,Nice beach,Came here on the first weekend of June. It was a gloomy day but still packed. Parking was a problem. The beach itself is narrow but long and right next to the pier.

There a grass area to set a blanket and chairs.,Nicole M

40,A good beach for the family and has parking T,"I am a local. This beach is good for out of towners who need parking. You will have to do some walking back up the hill to your car. So if you have people who can't walk far this is not the beach for you. It has bathrooms, lifeguards, the Redondo Beach Pier is not far so you can buy food etc.. but it does get extremely crowded in the summer. So go early if you want a parking spot and a spot on the beach. I've been to many beaches all over the world and this one is pretty good. the waves are usually manageable for swimming. Not much surfing goes on right here. But you will see trash and oil on the beach and in the water. Please take your garbage with you or put in the trash cans. And the closer you swim to the pier the dirtier it seems just FYI if you plan to swim go further South of the Pier.",JuliK222
30,Not the worst beach...,It had sand and water which meet the criteria of a beach but as we played we began to noticed there was yucky sticky stuff on the bottoms of our feet (oil maybe?).

The water around the pier was nasty but at the beach itself it was clean. The beach itself was nice & clean. I come to the beach as often as I can when visiting LA. Pedestrians need to watch out for the bicyclists they will run you over.,ConnieL1950

40,Please Do Not Share,"Please do not share this little South Bay secret.Stretching from the Redondo Beach Pier to Riviera on the south the beach has a great bike/walking path along the beach. An upper, street level, walk allows a great view of activities on the beach, opportunities to watch bottlenose dolphins playing in the surf next to surfers, pelicans diving for food and I have been told an occasional whale sighting.Once you get about two blocks south of the pier the weekend crowds disappear and you can enjoy the walk. Weekdays is pretty much locals and very lightly used.There are a few bathrooms along the way but don't expect Hilton quality. After all they are beach restrooms.So, please don't share this little secret place. Let's just keep it for the few of us that enjoy the lack of crowds and the beautiful view.Sunset viewing from the upper walk are spectacular.",Mike S

It is usually not too packed like Manhattan beach and you can see the dolphins and whales from the distance. Parking nearby will cost you money, but we enjoy the walk so we never mind parking a bit further away. It's a very safe walk. You can take beautiful endless pictures of the ocean and the Palos Verdes bluff. On a clear day, you can see Catalina from the distance. If you love a romantic sunset date on the beach, I would highly recommend this place. Bring a sweater because sometimes, it can get pretty chilly.",Xoxo

50,THIS IS MY HOME,"I have lived at this beach for almost 40 years. During that time I've seen lots of improvements, including the rebuilding of the horseshoe after the fire in the late '80s and the addition and upgrading of restaurants. So I'm sure that I'm prejudiced. But there's no denying that here is some of the best weather in the world. The temperature generally is in the 60s and 70s May through July and then in August the temperature runs in the mid seventies to low 80s. Winter is mild, 50s and 60s. Now, some people prefer warmer weather but I like it cool. So this is the place for me.But, aside from the weather there is excellent, diverse cuisine that is either within walking distance, at the Pier, or just a few minutes drive. And I love to eat, especially the good stuff. Golf - some of the best in the States are right here at Los Verdes, a course that's about 20 minutes from the Pier. It is on the Palos Verdes hill overlooking the Catalina Channel with180 degree views from Long Beach to Ventura. Then there's a 21 mile bike path from the Pier to Santa Monica. That's one way. On the bike path you pass through all the beach cities plus Playa Del Rey, Venice and Santa Monica with all of their restaurants and shops.The beach at the Pier is one of the best. It's in the protected area of Santa Monica Bay with gentle surf, gently sloping bottom and great sand beach for just kicking back. Of course there are the beach volleyball tournaments at nearby Hermosa and Manhattan Beaches. For those so inclined fishing from the Pier is allowed. Plus there are commercial boats that will take you out for 1/2 or full day of fishing.Traffic isn't a problem since you're never going very far to a restaurant, supermarket or shop.There's ample public parking at the Pier. And the fee is quite reasonable.This is Heaven on earth. But like I said, this is home and I'm prejudiced.",LHANN2013

50,"Great place to relax, run or walk","Spend a few days close to this beach and I really liked running in the late afternoon or evening. Although the beach is not as well known as the other ones more South and North of here it is a very nice, well maintained beach with a great trail next to it that is used for running, biking, walking etc. Great place to spend a few hours. There are plenty of lifeguard stations, restrooms etc. and the beach is kept very clean. Paid parking and the long stroll to the pier for food is about the only two ""bad"" things I can see for this beach.",DdeKerf

50,Better than most,"Very clean beach. Almost no trash and hardly much seaweed, either. It was nearly empty about 9am on a Friday. The sand is slightly more coarse than Santa Monica, but still pleasant to walk on. The coarseness also contributed to clearer water, I believe. Plenty of medium-size waves. The pier was fun to walk around, too.",crusadercc

50,A Peaceful Place to Visit alongside a Major City,"I have lived in Redondo Beach for 40 years just a few blocks away from Torrance Blvd and the Esplanade (actually, the tow street never intersect. Esplanade starts just south of the crossing of Torrance Blvd with Catalina Avenue.Anyway, Redondo Beach is one of the best kept secrets in the Los Angeles Area. It has full ocean access on the Western Side, with a pier, hotels, restaurants, walkways along the Pacific Ocean going South from Torrance Blvd heading towards the beautiful hills of Palos Verdes with Malaga Cove shining from above.One of the few beachfront communities with a street called the Esplanade (not an alley) bordering the ocean. A walkway alongside of the street gives panoramic views from Mailbu, through Santa Monica to the hills of Palos Verdes.

The whole beach is more for the residents of the area than the tourists who come out, but there was almost no one. We had our own private bit of the beach and it was nice to walk around.

Speaking of parking, there's $.25 meter parking and parking lots but they're only at the south end that adjoins RAT Beach (Redondo at Torrance). It's got plenty of bathrooms, not so much food so bring your own. That said there's a sausage cart that's amazing at about Avenue I, the main intersection and a couple of burger shacks in about 2 miles. Everybody refers to location (like for where you are on the sand or where the good surfing is) by the Avenue that intersects the Esplanade (the street that is elevated above the beach.Redondo Beach is almost at the end of the beach bike path, so you can do a great 20-30 mile ride from Santa Monica to Torrance Beach one way and it's very fun. And we also use the streets for cycling. The Esplanade has a bike lane that goes all the way to Redondo Pier. You can continue towards Santa Monica on streets if that's your thing. Either way, there are lots of piers and pier plazas to stop at on the way up the coast to grab a bite to eat or a brewski.

50,Family vacation and surf lessons. It was great.,"The beach was wonderful, and not crowded when we were there. The family took surf lessons and had a terrific time learning the sport.",Colleen B
30,Crowded by pier but wonderful away from the crowds!,Tents and tents and tents are pitched every weekend close to the parking at the pier. It's crowded and annoying to be honest. Go south away from the pier and street park by the avenues...lovely beaches and wonderful local crowd. And no tents!,sportspup
20,Just ok,"Redondo gets more fog than a lot of other beaches in Cali. compared to other beaches in CA it's just ok. I live here and there really isn't anything to be excited about, other beach communities are more, fun or quaint or just have a community feel. Redondo really doesn't offer any of those. It's unfortunate, but it just doesn't rank well.",CVR360
50,Redondo Beach Paradise,"The beaches of Redondo are a wonderful place for family, sun and fun. I also firmly believe that Redondo Beach property values are on the rise and will continue to rise with the development of the new Hotel Shade that will be coming soon! As a Redondo resident for many years, and a Redondo Real Estate Specialist, You can't beat our beaches!",Alison C
50,Great place to walk and breath the sea air,I walk this beach regularly and love it. It's smaller then the beaches to the north and can hold it's own as far as a crowd especially on weekends. All ages visit this beach from locally to abroad. It's equipped with the facilities needed and relatively descent for being close to the ever salty air rushing thru and rusting all in it's path. Be courteous to the bikers and the roller skaters on the path. Bring your volley ball and your team or just relax in the sand by the ocean's edge listening to the crashing waves.,BlueWaterFun
40,Family activity,"Just stumbled on this place as we had never heard of it before and had booked into a hotel nearby for a couple of days in LA before going home. Well it was a great find with loads to see and do, from the seals in the marina to the 20mile plus bike track along the beach ( which I highly recommend for a family activity) - couldn't say enough good things about the place, restaurants, cafe, bar all here and in a great relaxed atmosphere -will go again.",Finni66
30,Beach with Good Public Access,"We were staying in Hermosa Beach and decided to check out Redondo Beach and the pier.The beach in this area is not as wide as in Hermosa. The strand (paved walking, bike path) runs along the beach in this area. However, if you would like to go further north to see the communities of Hermosa or Manhattan on bike along the strand, you will have about a mile of riding in the street.Unlike it's two sister beaches to the north (Hermosa and Manhattan) this area of the strand contains many large hotel or apartment like buildings with several stories. Hermosa and Manhattan both contain mostly residential style housing along the strand.The access to the beach has a steep slope to walk down (I believe stairs were provided) the area is not flat. The beach itself didn't seem impressive and was a bit on the crowded side compared to Hermosa Beach. On the plus side you did have a better view of the waves crashing on the beach. The atmosphere seemed to lean towards a touristy location.",CoastalDreamer70
40,"Clean, populated, good patrols","Redondo beach is clean, with good life guard stations, bathrooms, and police patrol. The water was a bit churned up the day we were there. It was windy, but lots of kids and adults playing in he waves. Looked like it was good for swimming, though I didn't go in. There were lots of trash cans and the boardwalk spans the length of the beach with designated bike and pedestrian lanes. No food was sold directly n the beach, but we brought our own. We had a great day!",Jodie D
50,Great Beach!,"This is a lovely beach, well maintained, good number of life guards, restrooms and permanent volley ball nets set up. For a relaxing day at the beach it can't be beat.",Kevin
50,Sun sand and California cool,"Redondo is a very beautiful beach and it has all that people look for in a beach resort. It is extremely clean and well cared for, it is huge (as far as the eye can see) the ocean is cold but is very relaxing and has dolphins regularly passing through. The area is very accessible to lovely shops, restaurants, etc without imposing on the seafront area which is on a human scale with cyle paths and seating areas above the beach where you can just sit and take the views and sea air. A beautiful and invigorating place which is a joy to visit.",fodenman48
40,Thrill & Chill,The shops and restaurants seems perfect for the beach and locals. The ocean was a bit too chilly still for swimming.,Kim R

50,FABULOUS walking Beach,"The Redondo Beach is fantastic for walking, sunbathing, and people watching. The ocean is close to the strand, the sand is soft and clean, and there is a walking and bike path for those who don’t want to get their feet sandy. The sound of the waves, the seagulls, surfers, and sweet salt air help you feel relaxed and happy. If I lived here, I’d be walking, rollerblading, or biking every day. I even witnessed a class of about 30 moms pushing baby strollers exercising on the beach. This is a terrific place, very tranquil, safe, and beautiful.",StarLady99
40,OK beach,"Big waves during our visit, saw quite many dolphins. There are many showers along the beach. I didn't like the seaweed.",Appelin

50,Good Beach to Run Along,I stayed at a hotel near the beach recently and thoroughly enjoyed waking up in the morning and running along the bike path. The beach was clean and the run was spectacular with the waves crashing and watching the surfers catch their waves. Would definately return.,SCCam94
30,Coarse Sand but Easy parking,The best thing about this beach is it is right next to the Redondo Pier with all of their shops and food places and lots of parking. Downside is the sand is rather coarse and the water deepens rather quickly.,kevin p

40,"Sun, sand and decent parking","I love Redondo Beach because it is so accessible. Even on crowded summer days there is parking- if not along the beach or in the lots, in the nearby neighborhood. The bike path is wonderful- to ride, walk or people watch. The water is clean enough, and the seagulls and occasional dolphins will keep your camera busy. And if you listen, you can hear seal barking from the breakwaters outside the pier. Aaarr, aaarr....",Sandrinaav

50,The Beach at Redondo Beach is a county beach not a state beach....,"All the reviews being equal, a point of clarification: The sandy beach at Redondo Beach is a county beach not a state beach. Also one might be interested in knowing that the beach front called Redondo Beach does does not stretch all the way to Palos Verdes. Part of what most visitor thinks is Redondo Beach beach is actual another LA county beach named Torrence Beach that parallels the city of Torrence. The picture of the bicycle ramp leading down to the beach is of the only north landing ramp along the stretch between the Redondo Beach Pier and Palos Verdes it is well with in Torrence Beach.",Chas90501
40,Wide and clean,"Wide and clean (as i may have hinted in the title). Plenty of space to lay out; a protected backdrop from the noise of the road. Decent for some frisbee or a swim if you brave enough. Or simply relax, get some rays, maybe read a book, listen to some tunes. Also it is a nice walk along the beach. We parked at the far north end by the marina. Have no idea if there was better/different parking. Bring a lunch and you have a whole day there mapped out.",Antony T
