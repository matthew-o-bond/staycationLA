40,Picturesque Location!,This is located in the very large Angels Gate Park with panoramic views of the Pacific and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. A great spot to fly a kite and enjoy a picnic lunch!,olinmom
40,Amazing Views,I have visited here several times with my wife and kids. It is a wide open space with an amazing overview of the Long Beach/San Pedro area and a sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean. There is a pretty strong and consistent wind off the ocean in this park so be mindful of that if you are planning a picnic.,Isaac B
40,My escape from the City,My sister had her wedding photos taken here a while back. We decided to drop by and its still gorgeous. The view is breathtaking and there is a park nearby if you feel like taking a stroll or exercise. It's a bit colder in the winter time because you are surrounded by the ocean. So bring a sweater to be comfortable. It is very clean and a great place to relax from a busy week/escape from the city. Definitely a great for a nice picnic out.,Xoxo
30,plan on being windblown,"very nice view from the top of the hill, once you get there. The bell is a very interesting monument and a great photo op.",fmattship
50,Korean Bell and More,"Great park to hike around, see the historical monuments, and take the kids. There is so much to see and do here, or just do nothing. Great view of the ocean.",OCinnamon
50,"Majestic views, great hiking and walking trails","High above the community of San Pedro and the Los Angeles Harbor lies this incredible natural retreat! Picnic areas, hiking trails and scenic views provide a variety of activity options. You can also get a great workout if you park at the bottom of the hill and hike all the way up.",Jonaleen A
30,NOT where the Korean Bell is,"Beautiful little park with fantastic views and a small playground. There's also a small nature center. But a few reviews suggest that the Korean Bell is here, and it isn't. It's about a 10 minute drive away. I think the confusion lies in this being the ""friendship"" center, and the other being the ""friendship bell"". Not the same.",kristin s
50,Most amazing view,"I was hesitant about providing a review of this park not because it's not awesome, but because it is. You always hate to share your favorite spots with others fearing they will suddenly be congested and crazy. This has become one of our absolute favorite SoCal spots. Climb the hill and on a clear day see to Catalina Island, all of the LA Port, as far south as Huntington Beach and then all the way to downtown LA. There are a few benches at the top where you can just sit and take in the view. Ample parking and not too crowded. Do watch out for snakes when hiking.",chgo919
40,Korean bell,We visited the Korean bell donated to America by South Korea to celebrate their independence. The whole parkland area is situated on the coast not far from. San Pedro and is a beautiful spot for a stroll.The bell is housed in an ornate Korean style open building like a Pagoda and looks amazing. Well worth a visit .i,LES H
50,You can see for miles on at this park,"Friendship park sits on top of a big hill you can see LA, The harbor ships, the ocean view, All while spending time having fun with your family.",marge m
50,Amazing view the the city,I personally love this location and tend to enjoy it once and while but for the most part a quick break down it has a baseball field and several trails to pick from. Anything from a Dog walk to a hike with friends or if your a Artist you can set up shop and just paint the view..Give this location a chance and you wont be disappointed,Peter M
30,great view and bell is impressive thats about it,Dont expect much here except seeing the bell which is pretty impressive and the structure it resides under. View is fantastic. Other that that there isnt much here,bill C
50,Favorite walking spot,"I come here often to pray and walk and feel like I am away from the noise and crowds of the city. Find free Public Parking to the right as you go up the drive off W 9th Street, follow the road around past the picnic area (with views of San Pedro, Long Beach and beyond) and the restrooms to a steep hill. Directly past the restrooms is a nice green hill and large tree to sit and see downtown LA on a clear day. The first part is steep, but after that first bit, t's quite easy. Has been set up for wheelchair access, and if the gate is opened, handicapped access to drive up that steep hill! At the top of the hill is a bench to sit and see both Catalina Island and downtown LA from the same spot. I've walked the loop of trails and you can make it stretch to a mile if you're creative. Recently they have added a shaded viewing spot and some signs about endangered animals native to the peninsula.",spice2life
