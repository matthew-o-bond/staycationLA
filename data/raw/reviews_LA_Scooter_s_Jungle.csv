50,I wish I could've stayed longer!,Scooter's Jungle is a place where new friends are made and old friends become new best friends! Friendships are forged in the fire of a trampoline.,e-miller-000
40,Come for a party - not really for open play. It's too small!,"Came here for a party for the first time but my kids have come several times before. This was a very clean space and it was air conditioned on a hot day. Lots of purell stations for the kids. I paid $2 for a much needed cup of coffee. They had many cute gifts and items for purchase. The party spaces are small, in my opinion, but the kids didn't seem to mind. The party coordinators did a fair job. They're very young and this was evidenced by their lack of attention to detail and conversations that were ensuing when we arrived and departed (nothing really inappropriate but still not really professional). The party was over 2.5 hours which is a nice long party. Would I come here for open play? I'm really not sure - it didn't seem big enough compared to other places in the area.",msjr_01
40,Fun place for a birthday party,"We have had 2 birthday parties at Scooter's Jungle. My son enjoyed both greatly. Lots of activities, fun staff, friendly. Time flies",DVader8
40,Grandkids had fun,My grandkids loved this place. We were there for toddler time. We were visitng the grandkids along with 3 of my other grandkids and only the ones from Indiana could go in. because it was toddler time. My grandaughter who was 8 was disapointed but watched the other kids have fun. It was a pretty awesome place to go because it was so hot outside. Glad we went.,Brenda W
50,Kid Fun,Looking for a place to let your children or grandchildren burn off a lot of stored up energy? This is one place to consider. Check their website for open play dates and times. They have very reasonable charges. There is staff supervising the whole time so kick back in the play area read or just observe the fun.,WMSCV
