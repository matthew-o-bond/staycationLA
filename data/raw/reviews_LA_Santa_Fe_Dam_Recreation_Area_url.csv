40,Quick Visit,I have been notching off a list of places I wanted to visit in person (basically my travel bucket list). I liked this park but I think $10 was too much unless I just missed a few locations in the park.,Aaron W
50,Scenic View,"This offers a scrnic view of Azusa mountains üèî. Good place for party, kids activities, jogging running. This is all lush green. Its a dam arean so has water too. Kids can see ducks , birds which is fun for them.",Aseem S
50,Busy park,We've been to this park and there are always parties and fairs happening. The park looks well maintained.,sruthp
40,Very pretty park. So big!,"Great park with lots of things to do, from fishing and paddle boating to family BBQ. Renaissance Faire is here from March to May which is also a lot of fun. Remember that the speed limit is 15 mph in the park!",chiquens
50,$10 Parking,"I jog and bike ride at night after 6 and park on the street for free. Otherwise parking is free. This place is great for a anytime run, jog or bike ride along the trails. Below there is a park and a lake that's open to the public for camping, bar b q or just to hang out. I love this place.",A8018LAjamesc
40,90th birthday celebration,This was a nice shady park. Lots of grown trees. Open space and enough room for lots of people. Very clean and well kept.,Catherine H
10,Warning - Moonlight Fishing,"Santa Fe Dam host a popular event every last Friday of the month. Night fishing, camping, bum fires and family fun. All nice and good. 16 years and younger enter free. $10 adults. You need to have a fishing license as well.Why the warning? Tonight event was different than all previous fishing nights. When we arrive at the exit gate around 2am the gates were closed and there was a long line of cars waiting to exit.The website indicates entrance is from 6 pm to 10 am and that you can leave at anytime during the night.I called the park ranger and they told me the Lifeguards had locked the gate and were not going to open them until 6am. They would only open the gate in case of an emergency. The problem is that this is not stated in their website and when you enter no one was told anything about this change.I called the ranger office last month and and they told me I could leave anytime. The last month we left at 3am and the gate was open.Me and about 10 other vehicles called the ranger and we were all told we could not leave until 6am. We even told them were where young children in some of the cars, but it didn't seem to matter.Once we told them we would call 911 and the Sheriff, we were told the life guards were going to come to the gate.The people from the first car had been there for over an hour waiting. Finally over 45 minutes later (for us) the life guards showed up with a really bad attitude and without a word of explanation, opened the gate and all the cars were allowed to leave. But they locked the door again.Please make sure you call ahead of time to ask if they will be locking the door in the future and plan your park exit accordingly.",lxjuarez
10,Renaissance Faire,"A total rip off! $10 to park....no big deal, kinda expected that. Super crowed (can't see why). Entry into the faire near $30 each and aside from a few child type backyard games, everything costs additional money. Basically you pay to walk around in the dirt with not much to see but people dressed in underwhelming costumes they got from Goodwill or the neighbors trash, vendors selling over priced crap they made and a food court with equally crappy over priced food. Don't waste your time or your money! Go somewhere fun for lunch instead. What a racquet! Spent $10 to park, near $60 to get in and left 30 minutes later. 5 stars for the friendly entry gate and ticket employees tho.",Cherie H
50,Ren faire,"Always a good day at the faire. Prices getting high though. $10 to park, $29 per person to get in, $10-15 a drink, and food is outrageous for portions. Great entertainment, but they need to get hotel package back for those of us who come from far for this event.",cherispear
40,Home to the Renn Faire and more,This is a nice place to just chill-out with friends and family or even by yourself. Beware of the geese because sometimes geese can be aggressive though I haven't been hassled by them at Santa Fe Dam Rec Area...not yet that is.I found this place because the Renaissance Faire is located there for 6 weekends and is the primary draw for me & my family. Whether you come to picnic or get in the water or go to the amazing Renn. Faire this place is perfect...ENJOY!,Vin S
40,Good on a hot day,"Nice local wide life. Good tree selection for shade or photos. Fun place for a BBQ. I would recommend bringing bread to feed the ducks, or a kite toys to keep busy with. Swimming is always an option.",Hanna J
40,Great family location,"So much to do!, Great for picnics, then the bike trails, fishing and even hiking areas. There is a small water park type area for the kids too!",TrojanmanB
50,Love This place,Love to come here to relax. Fun for everyone with 2 and 4 legs. Rennaisance Faire once a year too. Paddleboats. Great photo ops.,Laura W
50,Family Fishing Trip,Always a great place for a morning outing. Managed to land 3 Catfish and just enjoyed the outside adventure. Will be back next year for another round üòÉ,David D
50,An unexpected treat.,"This park is a jewel in the city! It is hidden behind a dam, tucked away from busy city scene. If you are not looking for it, you wouldn't know it is here. Once you turn in, the area opens up and the lake, the green grass, and the mountain are in sight. It is beautiful. This park also has two playgrounds, one for smaller children, and one for bigger kids. The picnic table and BBQ stoves are scattered around the grassy area, a horde of geese (about 70 of them!) waddle around. People are walking their dog, biking, running, and children are playing. If you want to get away from the horrible traffic and enjoy a moment of peace and beautiful sunset, you will not be disappointed here.",Tracy w
50,Pleasant surprise,"Our visit was to the Dam was very enjoyable the park is clean and it""s safe for my kids. We had a great time with our family",Martha S
50,Renaissance faire in the park,It's been over 7 years since I attended a Faire at this location. I recall the first year it moved from Devore. It was small and not what I and many other Faire goers were used too. They have done a fine job of expanding and encompassing what this great park has to offer.,Markimbrooks
50,Excellent Picnic Sopt,I love this place..so many trees a very good environment... look for the sunset.. a perfect place for a picnic,Kosh2010
40,Very Nice Recreation Park,"Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area is a clean and well-maintained park. There are entrance fees but for seniors it is only US$5.00. We went on a Friday because the Renaissance Faire is held on Saturdays and Sundays. The park is good for family picnics, biking, boating and swimming (when it is allowed) and birdwatching. The restrooms are clean and there is ample parking.",Cynthia K
50,"Nice Park for Biking, Boating, Fishing, Swimming, and Picnics -and more - Sante Fe Dam Recreation Area","We returned for another delightful trip to Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area. This is a very nice and large park. There are places to ride bikes. There is the wonderful lake. One can go fishing, boating, and swimming. There are lots of picnic tables; we have enjoyed picnics here as well as leisurely days here with family and friends.There is playgrounds and a water feature park for the children (check hours as not the same as for the larger park).There is a day use fee and the entrance station is manned. There is lots of parking once in the park. One can drive to several different parking areas.What is also nice is the panoramic views of the San Gabriel Mountains one can see from the park.",mini
30,Crowded on Renaissance Faire Days,"The dam is a looping three mile long structure that is intended to catch flash flood waters from the San Gabriel Mountains and strain out the muddy sediments. At other times it shelters a couple of modest sized lakes. The recreation area contained within the horns of the dam can be jammed on some weekends when events like the Renaissance Faire are scheduled. We found the parking to be well regulated and signposted so that locating the car afterwards was not too burdensome. One wonders how the geese and other wildlife fare during these hectic occasions? The elevated route across the top of the dam is well traveled by cyclists, joggers and walker and affords distant views of the mountains but would likely be uncomfortably hot during summer.",Taughboyne
50,Great huge recreational area.,"Amazing views of the beautiful San Gabriel Mountains and wonderful open, well kept and managed park. So dog friendly which is what brings us here....our rescue loves the birdlife, gophers, squirrels ,ducks, geese and all the wildlife here.... We take the circuit hike around the lake in the back wilderness areas ....the fisherman perch around their spots casting their lines.....and it's just so picturesque in the undeveloped areas. great exercise. All the facilities work..all the vending machines, boat and bicycle hire. Of course there's the ubiquitous bird dropping everywhere, and between the geese and duck population....you'd be well advised against rolling around on the grass without ground cover",kiwilelei
30,Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area,"Good place to start a bicycle ride (on paved trail and road) up the mountain. Picnic areas are pleasant, but not spectacular. Area can be very hot and smoggy in summer.",Mark W
50,Great spot,I grew up going to Santa Fe Dam and now I take my dogs there to walk and people watch. The only bad thing is on holidays you can't even get in. I love to ride my bike there too on the back trails.,BrandieY1
10,Poop dam,"I used to visit This place as a little girl every weekend in the summer and twenty years ago it was very nice. We recently went as I took my little ones and I was amazed to see how awful it has become. The water looked green, there was poop everywhere! It was one of the most disgusting places if not the worse place I've ever been to. Dirty, smelly, and not worth ten bucks!",Rich M
40,"Nice Place for a Picnic and Fishing, Playing Cards as Well","We have enjoyed going here for family reunion type picnics. We enjoy playing cards, fishing, and of course picnics. Its also a very good park for walks. Nice place.",mini
40,Nice area for Exercising,"Large lake area, many picnic sites, plenty of fishing, nice dog walking or hiking area. Walk, run or bike along top of damn for 3 miles or so. Get there before 7 a.m. or they charge $6 per vehicle.",Miles H
40,A hidden escape,"This place is not visible from Arrow HWy but is accessible from it. Save ten bucks by parking on Arrow and walking up to it. There is a nature center with live snakes, a nature trail, playgrounds, workout place for adults, lots of ducks and geese, boats and bikes to rent, and you can even go fishing or in for a dip. Plenty of room for fun. Beware of summer or holiday weekends and the Ren Faire, when things can get horrifically crowded.",caltravelgal
30,A place to go,"The lake is quite large, you can take your boat out and have a picnic, bbq, a walk with your dog or just a hike. The Renaissance Fair is held here in April. It is a place close to home and sometimes seems overcrowded, but overall its nice.",Christina M
30,"A Hidden Retreat, Among the City Sprawl ....","I visited in the middle of the week, and there were a few busloads of school children accessing the park grounds during my visit, so not sure how big the crowds can become. The park seemed quiet during the day, there are buggy bikes for rental , and food for purchase on the week-ends . The man- made lake offers a nice back drop for a picnic or plain family outing. You can save yourself the parking fee by parking on the street, just outside the main entrance, and walking into the park, but most of the walk is uphill.",sacyyl
30,Not sure its safe at night,"We have visited this place several times mostly early morning for a hike with the dogs. Early on its great, in the evening on the weekends I'm not sure, there are gangs of youths drinking etc. I'm not sure its a place you'd want to be after dark.",Steve L
30,A LOT of people like this place...,"...so there are A LOT of people at this place. Parking is $10 and they say it's for all day and you can come and go except they close the entrance so it only true in theory. There are bathrooms but that's it you have to bring EVERYTHING else you need with you. Get there early because there are A LOT of people coming.The trails are nice for walking if you leave from the nature center. The wetland area is as good as can be expected in the city but the conservancy that runs it takes the plant and animal diversity seriously so you will find many examples of native flora and fauna. The bike path is safe and well maintained too.Now the only thing I LOVED about this area is the splash park. The (reasonable) fee and the height restriction (it's for children, adults are only allowed in to supervise) keep out the rowdies and it's super clean. The sessions run an hour and a half each which is perfect for people under four feet tall.",Snoopydance
40,"Eh, it's okay.","I went last week and it was okay. There's a lot of ducks and geese, operantly there's a lot of snakes. A lot of people go to the lake brcause there's no sharks. It's really hot and there's not a lot of shade or trees. The food there is pricey, for example an ice cream there is 4 bucks.",Yzabelle A
40,"Biking, etc.",Used to regularly bike there and will probably do so again soon. Annual Renaissance Faire location too. I often see people fishing and enjoying a picnic or birthday party. A good time for all!,tinkmommy
40,Nice area with good water activities....or you can just hang out,"This gem is hidden from view but is a great retreat. Ten bucks to park for the whole day, unless you want to bike or hike up the hill. Great for bicycle enthusiasts, fishing, boating, walking. You can walk the interpretive trail, see live snakes in the nature center, have a picnic, work out in the fitness zone, take the kids to the playgrounds, watch the geese and ducks, or rent a paddleboat, kayak, or surrey or other land vehicle from Wheel Fun Rentals. They are only open on weekends and holidays during the off season but the dam is open year round. Snack bar available too. Bathrooms are decent but usually have no soap and no seat covers.",A Tripadvisor Member
