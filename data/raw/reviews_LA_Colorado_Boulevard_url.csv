Get your t-shirts, hats, sweatshirts or souvenirs on this site because they are not available the day of the parade. We sat in the stands on Colorado Blvd. nearer the end of the parade. If we do it again would purchase tickets for the beginning. That way you can see the pre-parade entertainment.

30,It depends on the section...,"Colorado Blvd in Pasadena has morphed several times over the decades ... it's been most of the Rose Parade route forever and is also called Historic Route 66. While it is the gateway to many fabulous Pasadena destinations to the north and south,in and of itself it's just a street.The western end, (Old Pasadena) is a busy shopping and dining area, with lots of historic preservation sites plus the wonderful Norton Simon Museum mixed in. Its latest personality seems to be focusing on design-related businesses - decor, furnishings, etc. It's pk, but most things of interest in this area are off the Blvd.Moving east you get to the City Hall and Paseo area, with lots more shopping, dining and historically interesting buildings nearby.Further east, in the Playhouse District (near the intersection of Lake Ave.) and anchored by Vromans Books, there are some okay restaurants and shops.But once you cross Lake, you are in a boring and sometimes seedy part of town all the way to the eastern end near Rosemead Blvd. Not much to see or do, and certainly no place to stroll. There are businesses, motels, eateries, offices, bars, strip malls ... just like in any city. Except for Pasadena City College, there's no ""there"" there.Virtually all of Colorado Blvd has problems with vagrancy and other social ills. And always pay attention to parking restrictions ... enforcement is vigorous.Colorado Blvd. is just the main E/W surface street through a really diverse and interesting city.

It is not a particularly beautiful street although it does pass through Old Pasadena. For me the main highlight is Vroman's Bookstore near Lake Avenue. This is one of the few independent bookstores remaining in the greater Los Angeles area. You pay full freight there and discounts are infrequent.

Among this display of shopping extravaganza you will also find excellent restaurants, coffee outlets, bars and ice-cream parlors from all parts of the world. On the way up to more midtown Pasadena the stores and dining facilities become a little more mainstream and towards the other end you will find the larger everyday use stores and simpeler dining places ... but all very conveniently located on the boulevard.

Could not believe the hundreds of people shuffling along.The street is well lit, and the stores and restaurants are very welcoming. There's Pottery Barn, Crate 'n Barrel, Sephora, Eileen Fisher to name a few. We saw many people carrying bags, so it definitely is a shopping street, not just for browsing.

30,Colorado Boulevard,"Colorado Boulevard is a commercial street that runs many miles through several cites. The part that runs through Pasadena is known for being the venue of the Rose Parade, but other events are staged throughout the year. For information, a visitor can pick up a copy of the ""Pasadena Weekly"", a free tabloid available at the doorstep of many establishments on the Boulevard.Most of the buildings along the route are of little architectural or historic interest. For a movie fan, I can recommend the Laemle7 theater, which shows award-winning American and foreign films. Vroman's is a famous bookstore where you can attend readings by visiting authors almost every day. On West Colorado Blvd you will find Old Town, very popular with the young crowd, full of trendy shops and restaurants that stay open in the evening. Near the corner with Orange Grove Ave is the Norton Simon museum, one of several small museums in Pasadena that are worth a visit. At the far west end of the Pasadena portion of the boulevard there is a historic bridge over the arroyo but you may need directions to find the turnoff..",MARGARET L
40,Outdoor seating Alleys,"I came here after work to hangout. I suggest you park in a garage if you are thinking about being there for more than 2 hours--it's not worth getting a ticket over and garages can be as cheap as 5 dollars. Once there walk. Explore the alleys there will be restaurants, coffee shops, or pubs!!! Once the sun sets head down to the major cross walk and watch the masses attempt to reach to the other side of the street: some may be stumbling others maybe confused as to which way to go. Its worth going with a group but I'm sure you can join in other groups if flying solo. Cheers!",Kenny L

50,Parade Beautiful--Work on Floats--Watch Sharp Seating Tickets,"We stayed in Burbank - about 35 minutes to get into Pasadena and parked at 4:00am. Easy to get to Parade Route as all highway. Recommend buying parking pass and finding your seats the day before.Don't know if you attended yet but one company Sharp Seating has a monopoly on all seats. We attended Jan 2015. We purchased our tickets 6 months in advance (Section 150 on S. Orange St) We got there and read this is the ""formation area"" and wouldn't see all participants. AND, the eats were were blocked by trees (15-25' tall with leaves), street poles, and palm trees with only 20' between each.. We were furious. Drove to Sharp's office and they reluctantly exchanged them (at $19 restocking fee per ticket) for seats on the Highway Overpass (Section 235) with NOTHING blocking the view, great sun on the entire float for good photography. Section 240 is better as sun is at your back. If you get to seat by 7:15, you'll be fine. You should look at stands and Google, some bleachers on the route are blocked by buildings flanking them meaning you can only see floats when they are directly in front. Nearly all had trees and lamp posts in front of them. This parade is 5.5 miles long so there are lots of spots to camp out on the street overnight if you'd like. However, it was 30 degrees the night before. We found purchasing the parking pass $40 was helpful, just be sure to park by the exit. Lots of port-of-potties around too. Also, the bleacher seats are super tight so you are crammed in. Some of the bleachers look like they go up 60 rows, others just 5 rows. They are aluminum which means a cold bum, and the $10 seat pads at the float building site were much thicker and nicer than those sold for $15 at the parade itself.Would highly recommend working on the floats. We volunteered with Paradiso but also check out Fiesta Parade Floats, and Phoenix Floats. SIgn up online for a 4 hour shift. We ended up staying 10 hours we loved it so much. You really get to appreciate the floats up close. Lots of tasks so can sit or stand or climb. Paradiso was great if you wanted to change tasks or locations and they were a delight to work with. Both floats Zappos.com and Singpoli won awards too! The floats are view-able later that day and 2-3 days after for $10 in some parking lot. They are pieces of work. We opted not to do the football game but that's within walking distance.",SayCheese

30,Rose Bowl Parade-and Game,"To view parade best to buy seats online in advance for one of the seats in the raised bleachers with sun at one's back. Was surprised to see locals who brought BBQ's, heaters, and ice chests (leaving their mess behind) and must have been camping out to 'save' their space.Also surprised at massive amount of Christian proselytizing on the parade root before and after the parade. And the bull horned 'brim and firestone' proselytizing while waiting to board the 'free' shuttles to the Rose Bowl game. Captive audience I guess. Oh, and Go Ducks!",Susan_H_68_12

40,"New Years Day Rose Parade Route, Old Pasadena and More","If one watches the Rose Parade on New Years day, one might note when they the parade route turns right off the first street they start on. That is Colorado Blvd. It is the most lively area of Los Angeles area on New Years Eve and New Years Day. People get there early and camp out over night to see the parade. We have driven down Colorado Blvd on New Years Eve and its a festive party atmosphere - a bit rowdy at points.The rest of the year it returns from a party scene to just being a major road in the San Gabriel Valley area. It runs from Griffith Park area to Monrovia.We have stayed in Monrovia and there are a variety of restaurants and lodging in the area. If one drives to the mountain areas of Monrovia (especially on garbage pick up day), I have seen lots of bears in this area. They think of those trash cans as picnic baskets going from one to the other. (No - not on Colorado Blvd area, but its the bears is what people have heard the most about when it comes to Monrovia.In Pasadena, we like the Old Town Pasadena portion of Colorado Blvd. We often stay at the Marriott Courtyard - a short walking distance to Colorado Blvd. It is also across the street from the Rose Bowl Shuttle area. As such, our favorite restaurant for late night eats on Colorado Blvd. is the Cheesecake Factory there. On other nights, we choose from one of the other delightful restaurants in the area.

The only walking area would be Old Town which is rife with many shops and restaurants.

40,Lots of Good Restaurants,"Writing a review for Colorado Boulevard is difficult due to the tremendous size of the area covered. I will limit this review to the area I know best - the portion of Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena.From West to East, the first portion of Colorado Boulevard would be in the Old Town Pasadena area. The center of Old Town is really the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Fair Oaks. In this general area there are several good Italian restaurants such as Mi Piace (my favorite), Louise's Trattoria, and Il Fornaio (see my other reviews for these 3). Also there is The Cheescake Factory, 35er (a good dive bar), Barney's Beanery (a good bar with a bad name), 21 Choices (a really popular frozen yogurt place - just look for the long line). Also some drinking and dancing places in this area.If you head east from here (near Marengo Ave) on your right will be BJ's Brewery (good food & good beer) and the Paseo Colorado Mall. Upstairs at Paseo there is the Arclight movie theatre as well as a number of restaurants such as The Yard House (nice sports bar), Porto Alegre (Brazillian churrascaria) and a few more places such as El Cholo (Mexican food). Across the street on the other side of Colorado is Ruth's Chris Steakhouse (haven't been here but heard it is expensive but delicious).A bit further east is Roys Restaurant (near El Molino Ave) which according to this website is the #1 restaurant in Pasadena. Someday, when I find a big bag full of money lying in the street, I will try it.Heading further east (near Lake Ave) is Nine and Nine Thai (really good Thai food), Chilly Mango (also really good Thai food), Indochine (Vietnamese food) and Lovebirds Cafe (sandwiches and bakery items).Obviously with several miles to cover I could not mention every place. You may want to explore this area further.",JohnB00007

30,Too much traffic,"Unlike 3rd street promonade, Colorado Blvd offers not only a shopping experience, but also a bumper to bumper nightmare.",Sonny
30,Rose Parade Route,Not much there other than the best parade in the world every January 1. Buy a reserved seat or get there at noon the day before to reserve a spot.,briano52
40,NICE!!!,"diferent of all LA!!!! nice place, every big stores, don't have only one pharmacy after 10:00 pm... but, it's nice place, nice city, only the Ramada Pasadena... trash!!!!",Jriensen
50,Fun & Great Atmosphere!,"CO Blvd. is always lively! Lots of people, all happy and friendly!! SUCH a great place to shop, nosh, get a glass of wine and enjoy the atmosphere!!",Mitch D
40,Interesting on New Year's Eve!,There are lots of shops/resturants to choose from - but a stroll down here on New Year's Eve is very interesting! Everyone camps out (literally) to wait on the parade. So most shops had boarded up their fronts - but it's worth the experience of walking and seeing all the 'interesting' sights!,JeffandDeeNC
40,Colorado Blvd- Old Pasadena,"This is a pretty happening street. Many choices (and varieties) of restaraunts, shops, and bars.A lot to see and experience.",Joseph V
40,Nice area and nice shops.,"You probably can find anything you want here. There are all kinds of shops: bicycle, clothes, shoes, furniture, etc. and there are great restaurants. A favorite of our is the Cheesecake Factory because they have a huge menu. Nice Italian restaurants too. If you are in the Pasadena area, this is a good stop but be warned, it can get crowded at times so becareful not to go at peak times.",Arden G
40,Good food and shopping,"If you like great places to eat and shop, Colorado Blvd. will not disappoint you. Parking can be a bit hectic, but once you've parked you can easily walk to several great shops and restaurants.",22Patrick
40,All on one street,"For us small town folks, driving in big and unfamiliar cities can be a bit frightening. But, Pasadena was very easy to get around in. Colorado Blvd is one long straight street that goes several miles. There's big stores like Target. There's Walgreens (on a corner, of course!), office supply stores, churches, banks, etc and lots and lots of shops and restaurants. We didn't have time to go to what's called ""Old Pasadena"" which is right in the area too, but heard lots of good comments about it too having lots of restaurants and shops. Pasadena is a beautiful area to be in!",Ruth B
30,It's a road made for cruising,"Try it on a summer night, windows open, and just cruise the Blvd. If it's really crowded it will give you time to people-watch. Lots of good restaurants and fun shopping, if shopping is your thing.",Puttermutt17
40,Spend all day here,"Eat, shop, drink, party all on one street! Need I say more? Definitely spend all day here. Parking sucks but that's anywhere where you can eat, shop, drink, and party all on one street.",nlee1220
40,Historic Cruise Route!,"This is the boulevard immortalized by the surf bands of the 1960s! Only do this drive in the evening! It's just a busy street during the day. The drive, if done correctly (in a 1957 vehicle), starts in Glendale near the old Henry's drive-in and goes across Eagle Rock through Pasadena to Bob's Big Boy by PCC. Lather, rinse, repeat!",jg3arrow
50,It's where they have the Rose Parade,"Nice, fun street. Many restaurants. Nice for walking and people watching. 5 minutes from the Rose Bowl.",Dennis S
50,Stroll and spend,"Colorado Boulevard is enjoyed by parking at the Green Street garage and walking the whole thing, both sides of the street.",Snoopydance
30,Very nice filled with standards.,Not enough arts and crafts stores. I would have liked to find some local artisans showing their wares.,GinnyQuince
30,Full of Life,"This is one busy place. Stay alert , know where your going and you'll enjoy the many hidden treasures through-out the area. Many many restuarants, shopping places.",Boone5269
40,Feeds the shopping addiction,"From the big box chains to the little independent stores (with a couple of cupcake shops thrown in for good measure), this stretch of Pasadena is a shopper's dream (and your wallet's worst nightmare). Parking is pretty plentiful in big lots that are easy to spot, and the walk around the area is beautiful. Fun destination for the consummate shopper!",Phlyjets
50,Great for shopping and dining,"There's Paseo Colorado and Old Pasadena on East Colorado Blvd, and Target on West Colorado Blvd, not to mention other great shops for shopping and dining.",horseandsheep
40,Great shopping!,"Restaurants, pubs and shops, great prices and places to eat. Chalk Festival was a fabulous experience!",bannoutbaby
40,Pasadena's main street,"Just a bit more to the existing reviews. Colorado Blvd is a long street that goes between East Pasdena and goes on to Glendale to the west. It's Pasedena's main street, at least east-west. Has good bus service. Reviewers have mentioned Old Town Pasadena, the trendy and busy heart of Pasadena with shops, restaurants and bars. Three books to the east of Fair Oaks and Colorado is Paseo Colorado, an open air shopping center with more restaurants and shops. Further east are a Target and the wonderful Vroman's bookstore, one of the best around. East of Lake Ave, the street is non-descript, and it keeps going east past Pasadena City College - apart from a couple indie record shops and coffee joints, nothing to recommend it. Plenty of fast food places though - which you will not find many of in Old Town. Go west, toward Glendale is about the same. Don't miss the curved arch bridge that takes Colorado over the Arroyo Seco: cool, especially at night.",bcbg68
50,The part in Old Pasadena is good...the rest is just ordinairy,"Colorado is a long, long boulevard. The part that is fun and interesting is the part that lies in an area called Old Pasadena, between Pasadena Avenue and North Arroyo Parkway. The rest of Colorado Blvd is just a regular collection of various stores...some good and some bad...nothing special to visit or see.Old Town Pasadena is very exciting to walk around...lots of interesting stores and restaurants. I have gone there many times just to window shop because I find the environment to be quite pleasant.Parking is great...the city has provided a few convenient garages where one can park free for several hours. Don't wind up paying for parking at a private lot.",Rogerdob
40,good walking territory,"food, shopping (including lots of little unique stores), people great atmosphere. i could live here.",leslie r
50,"Shopping, Dining, Bakeries So Much to do!",You can spend a few days just walking the street and enjoying the shopping and food!,GolfGuyFL
50,A great place!,"Colorado Boulevard has activity, great places to eat and historic buildings.",TravelingBoomers2
50,Fun Shopping,"Wow, there are so many shops and many different kinds of shops.I think it is better to find a place to park and then spread out from there. Some places give you free parking for 90 minutes, then you have to pay after that.",seaduck777
50,I like it!,"Great atmosphere along Coloroado Blvd. On the West side, you come to Old Town which has great atmosphere on the weekend. If you like crowds, there will be lots of people around and you will find everything there, restaurants, coffee houses, books and all shopping. I go in that area often. Visit and enjoy!",Pilgrim1425
50,Walking up and down Colorado Blvd can keep you enjoyably occupied for a whole day or evening,"This is one of those places you will remember for the wrest of your life. There are so many things to see in the way of different kinds of stores and restaurants that you could keep coming back again and again, and always find something different.Generally, the weather is very pleasant in Pasadena. So walking up and down Pasadena Blvd is a very pleasant experience. There are many different restaurants also where you can eat and enjoy all of the people walking by.The shopping center Paseo Colorado is also a great place to visit.If you wonder the side streets, Union Ave one block north of Colorado, or Green Street one block south of Colorado, you will double the number of restaurants and shops you can explore.I have been visiting Colorado Blvd for 25 years, and I always find something new to see.I hope you get you visit the interesting place real soon.",zip98221
50,Fun to see the parade route,Never having been to Pasadena we were curious. It is lovely with so much to see along Colorado Blvd. It was interesting to be there before the parade seeing the preparations. That is one long parade route. Now when we watch on TV we know what we are seeing.,2onvacaton
40,A lot of options,"The street is busy with cars and there's usually traffic. So it's not like 3rd street Santa Monica where the kids can walk around safely. However, there are a lot of great restaurants and shops. So it's a fun place to go every once in a while.",Parej15
50,Shopping and Eating,"Great resturants and shopping on Colorado Blvd., just West of the Sheraton.",Tommy J
20,If you're driving here at night - the traffic is jammed up!,"Colorado Ave. around Old Town Pasadena is jammed with traffic most of the hours the shops are open. The best way to get around the area, while looking for off-street parking, is to take the one way streets that border Colorado Av.: Green goes east and Union goes west. Fast and easy alternatives!",msirani
30,A Little Bit of Everything,"Pasadena lacks something---maybe it is a sense of itself. Like Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, ""There is no there, there."" Losts of shops, both low and high-end. Good restaurants, like Roy's, and chains, like PF Chang's. The old neighborhoods are charming, and the anticipation of the Rose Parade was much in evidence, but the ""old Town"" is nothing like San Diego's for example, and many of the shops are places like Old Navy which are everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Liked the Norton Simon Museum. Worth the trip.",MossbackCalifornia
20,Not At All Like The Beach Boys Song.,"Riding up and down the boulevard is rather boring. But City College imposes majestically on a complete block. Traffic can back up at times, so it's best to park your car and walk. Some garages allow some free parking time. Check the signs before entering. Paseo Colorado near Old Town is a newer development fronting the street. You can find trendy restaurants and a multiplex here.",Zoom_Gotti
