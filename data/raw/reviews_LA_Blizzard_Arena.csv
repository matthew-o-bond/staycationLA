50,Traveling to OWL's holy place,"if you're enjoy watching OWL, but haven't been there, I strongly recommend to visit Burbank Studio. People are so enthusiastic, and there's always energy, and fun things. it's really different from what you saw on TV.",SeoulMate_Joon
40,Good only if you are interested in video games,"This venue is all about tomorrow. It is an arena of perhaps 1500 seats on NBC studio's lot. Its purpose is to give video game players a place to square off with each other in front of a cheering audience. I never would have thought this would be a viable thing to do, but when my grand kids wanted to go because their favorite game was being played I decided to keep up with the world and take them. I like new things so I tried it. Of course, the video game we saw, Overwatch, is all about teams attacking each other and trying to meet some goal. My review is not about the game or its afffect on those watching or playing it, but the experience. The venue is new. It is well laid out. It is very safe and there is a lot of staff on hand to keep things running smoothly. Being a computer oriented crowd, the ambiance was quite intellectual. All in all, a lot of nice people having a good time watching the contestants use team tactics to blow each other away. Kind of funny actually if you think about it. Anyway, one thing I did not like was the seating. The $20 ticket was good for a night's entertainment 6 hours long lasting over 3 match ups. This is a long time to sit (you do get breaks between games) so as a person 6 feet tall I became quite uncomfortable because the rows are perhaps 6 inches to a foot too close together. I do not think at the prices charged that anyone is making a lot of money on this venue. The money I imagine is made on the sale of the video games. So, Bllizzard, maybe you can loosen up the seating a little. The food sold at the event is very reasonable and the sandwiches we got were healthy. As far as watching the game, everything was perfect. Large screens. Beautiful graphics. Great sound The only problem for me is that I was not quick enough to see most of what was happening. The crowd was intently watching the game cheering at what I guess were appropriate moments. I spent most of 6 hours wondering what was happening. As the night wore on and especially in the last game I began to at least get some of what was happening. Maybe there is a learning curve to this or maybe a person has to start young to play these games. So, I had my experience. Can;\'t say it was on my bucket list, but it was something I can check off forever from my list of things to do. BTW, believe it or not these games are shown live on the internet somewhere. Jimmy Kimmel dissed them and got burned. They are becoming more popular all the time and are even being called a sport. Go figure! TIP: At the end of the show my grand kids wanted to signature of the players. In order to clean up they have those wanting signatures sit in the middle batch of seats. If you want signatures go towards the middle as soon as the game is over and get as close to the stage as you can so you do not have to wait to long. Start on the right hand side of the section and do not sit on the left hand side until you get above the obstruction between the lower section of the two sides. The left had side as you look out from the stage which is obstructed is not in line of signatures. You will see what I mean if you are there and decide to do this.",Robert F
