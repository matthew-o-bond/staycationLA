40,Good selection of merchandise,"As one would expect, this In N' Out Company store carries almost every kind of souvenir. Unfortunately, they did not sell what I wanted. I asked the crew if they carried magnets, but (surprisingly) the answer was no.I could not leave this little store without purchasing something. There were plenty of t-shirts to choose from. Finally decided on a cap. Got it for a fair price so I was happy.Fun fact: this company store is located next to In N' Out University in Baldwin Park. This is where many of their employees are trained (I believe). It is also located very close to where the very first IN N' OUT restaurant was!!",ExpoNationals
