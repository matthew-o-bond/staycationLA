30,Nice cultural exposure,Just a good place to visit once to see china outside of china. Everything from made in china can be found here and authentic chineese food is a good option to try out,Usman M
50,Vibrant colourful district,"Passing through the Dragon Gate we enjoyed the time spent here. Strolling around we made our way to the Central Plaza.Admiring the Chinese styling and decorative features, it was fascinating to learn of the original Chinatown's relocation to make way for Union Station in the 1930s.Numerous eateries beckon and we had a tasty snack in one.",permia
50,Chinatown & Little Tokyo,"We took a Viator tour of these two locations. Our guide, Chris, was excellent. Although Chinatown looks like it could use some maintenance, the buildings, shops, and architecture...and food are worth a visit (highly recommend the Dim Sum at the Golden Dragon). This was the best tour we did in LA. We rode the metro to Little Tokyo where the tour continued. Little Tokyo is more prosperous. If we had had the time there are two museums there that we wished we could have visited. Parking was easy. Plenty of $5 lots in Chinatown.",CowboyJohn
30,not much,we had no problem finding parking. This Chinatown is not as organized or in a section for walking. We ate and then wandered through some shopping spots. The kids had fun shopping. Got some good pictures. I's say just okay.,wineanddine32
40,Nice place to visit,"Nice place to visit, with a nice Seafood restaurant, authentic shops and Chinese atmosphere. Worth to see.",Dewi Erawan
30,Interesting But Gritty,"If you are uncomfortable with gritty areas, don't come here. But if you look past the dirty sidewalks and run down shops, it is a fun experience. It is not like San Francisco. It is a small area and you don't see a bunch of tourists. But walk up through the gateway to the older part and just sit and watch. The area also has some very good restaurants but you have to do your homework to find them.",lynndds
40,Chinese food galore,You won't go hungry walking around this neighborhood north of downtown. This is one of the hubs for the cicLAvia bicycle event held this Sunday and we had a great time exploring the area again. If you ate at a different restaurant each day you would be here for at least a month.,Creeping_Death_LA
50,Exploring,"We went here to explore and to take a look at the location of a music video. We ended up taking pictures, getting food and buying a whole bunch of beautiful rings, twirly parasols and elegant robes. I definitely would visit again, this had to be one of my favorite California locations!",Victoria Hunter
20,Not worth the effort,We walked here from the first hop on hop off bus stop and didn’t find the tourist part. The area we walked around was run down and dirty. We did pass the tourist part on the bus later in the day and it looked better than what we had seen so I guess we were just unlucky,GOgirl

10,Hoped to replicate our visit to Chinatown San Francisco...,"This area could offer so much, but it was like walking through Aliexpress. None of the authenticity that San Francisco offers - the sense of community was not present, just lots of vendors selling cheap rubbish.

10,TRAGIC CONDITION for a colorful piece of Los Angeles cultural & social history,"TRAGIC CONDITION for a colorful piece of Los Angeles cultural & social history ! From what this was in the 1960s-1970s- 1980s- now has devolved into a mess of closed stored, dirty streets unsafe walkways (trip and fall hazards). Most of the original restaurants have closed and are deteriorating. Many of the traditional restaurants and stores are now rented/leased by Millennials that have installed stores that have nothing to do with the Chinatown theme or traditions. Compared to Little Italy in San Diego (a clean fun bright safe and vibrant experience) this could be a cultural pride area but has descended into gross disrepair and an ugly shell of what it was meant to be. We will not return. C&H",ahdiii

40,Bigger Than Expected,"While this Chinatown is much smaller than the enclaves in NY and San Francisco, it’s nice and contains several shops, temples, restaurants and bakeries. Quiet on a weekday. Shopping does become repetitious after a while but we picked up some baked goods and a wind chime. Nice square and architecture. The area borders Olvera Street so it’s easy to to both in one day. Worth an hour or two plus lunch.",Heidi D
30,So So,"I can only compare this to Chinatown in NYC. I was really thinking this would be better but I liked NYC more. I found there was a lot more wares to buy at a cheap price in NYC. This area is quite spread out and much of it doesn’t look much like a Chinatown. There are some areas though that do. We parked in front of a Buddhist Temple that was great. Like everything in LA, be prepared to walk a lot. Parking seemed to be plentiful.",tshep42

40,Changed A lot. Still A Good Visit.,"Much has changed. The traditional plaza is all but dead. Many memories of visiting that section as a kid and experiencing a little of the culture. Now all the action is further down the street at local stores and a shopping plaza or two. Dropped into a couple herb and food shops that were every interesting. Within one of the shopping plazas my girlfriend bought three pair of boots for the price of one pair at a local mall. Did not get any eats except for fresh fruit, but in the past local dinning as always been delicious.",Loren N
50,Great food!,We went as part of our self-made walking tour hoping to find nice chinese restaurant. We ended up in a small eating place with only 5 chairs selling combo meal at $5-6...worth the walk! We got more than what we paid for. Food so yummy...better than what being served in big restaurants.Tip: Parking within this area costs around $5...we did not know...we parked near Central Market which cost us around $20.,madeang
40,Great Shopping!,"Whether your are in the market for alabaster turtles from Pakistan, authentic outfits form Vietnam, jewelry, clothes, toys, shoes, whatever, if it exists, Chinatown has it. In fact, I found the selection of Asian women's fashion better than in Hong Kong or Singapore. And, of course, the food is plentiful and cheap. There are so many restaurants to choose from, you can find anything. including the latest hipster rage of Howlin' Ray's Nashville Fried Chicken, where the lines can stretch for blocks. Go once, go often. Chinatown is always fun.",lollydepaulo
50,Not what I expected,"I believe we should have gone on a week end versus the middle of the week because the towns was quiet. We were fortunate enough to have a few stores open and an honest to God Chinese bakery which we loved. After try the delicate pastries in China on our trip in 2019, we fell in love. They are delicious but not quite as sweet as American pastries. So glad to see this in China town. We also had a delicious fresh food for lunch.The shop that was open had beautiful Chinese art and nic nacs similar to what we saw in China. Owner was pleasant",TravelingRN
30,Chinese Houses & Food,"I visited Chinatown while I was on the hop on hop off tour to Downtown LA. It's an area where Chinese emigrants community has settled in Los Angeles. You will instantly notice the Chinese architecture from the special houses, temples and statutes. Shops selling Chinese goods and specialized restaurants are everywhere.",Osman B

30,"Chinatown was a big disappointment, but the Plum Tree Restaurant was great","We were disappointed by the number of shops that were closed in Chinatown, but did like Realm very much. Realm sells some high end gifts; whereas, many of the other stores focus on souvenirs. We ate at the Plum Tree Restaurant that has reasonably priced, delicious food. Lots of leftovers from our dishes of noodles, sweet and sour pork, and spicy eggplant. The atmosphere is pretty modern and the waitstaff was knowledgeable and accommodating.",joan632015

30,best time to head here is during chinatown summer nights,"In order to help tourism to chinatown during the summer there are events called 'chinatown summer nights"" which take place. At these events there is demonstration cooking, the old chinatown plaza comes alive with bands and food trucks scatterred around.Frankly if you are the type that likes art there are a number of art galleries located in this section of town.Otherwise, if you are interestd in dimsum there are a number of restaurant here that serve this in fact i like to visit abc seafood or cbs seafood since they have a connected deli for takeout",Hoben01

20,A poor experience,"Having heard and read good things about Chinatown it is fair to say we already had some expectations. However, when we arrived in New Chinatown we were met with a disappointing scene. The streets were filled primarily with tourist souvenir shops, the restaurants were mainly closed and the transport links few and far between.Compared to the rest of L.A., this wasn’t worth the trip.",TomNIwona
20,Small and not what I expected,"I had heard that there was lots to do here, but it ended up being very small and disappointing. It was very dirty almost everywhere, the shops did not have anything unique to purchase, and all of the places to eat were very dirty. There was lots of fresh vegetables sold by locals and that is about the only thing to see there. We walked the area and were gone within 15 minutes of parking.",Paige McFarland
30,Small and a bit dreary,"Nothing like SF or NYC Chinatown, really small, mostly tourist shops, you can get better Chinese food in Monterey Park or Alhambra or San Gabriel or Rowland Heights or Arcadia. Plus it gives me the creeps because of the biggest race massacre on the West Coast - of Chinese by LA pillars of society! Good for tourists, I guess.",haohuangpianist

This is a great way to explore Chinatown and its history.The architecture is very interesting, and some of the stores worth checking out. There are also plenty of restaurants, although I didn't try any.Street furniture and decoration help add to the atmosphere. Even the Metro station is designed with a Chinese style.",MeredithAussie

40,Well worth visiting,"It's nowhere as impressive as San Francisco's Chinatown but I think it's worth visiting. There are many good restaurants, markets, and souvenir shops. If you like dim sum you can find it there especially at Ocean Seafood restaurant. If you go on Sundays, be prepared to wait but its worth the effort.

40,Great Cultural Experience in Downtown LA,"Chinatown will always be an iconic and historical part of Los Angeles.This was my daughters first time visiting Chinatown. When I lived in LA, my family always loved coming here to experience the asian cultural aspects, the food and definitely the shopping! Some of the shop owners can get a little annoying with their hard-selling tactics, so be prepared.Indoor and outdoor swap meet like stores.Lots of Chinese architecture built within the designs of the buildings. Even the Bank of America located there!!Seems like there is a Chinatown in every large metropolitan area. If you can find parking, for something to do in Los Angeles, Chinatown is always a great destination. There is both street metered parking and parking lots for a fee.Some parts are definitely in need of renovation but if you want to visit a place to take in a little piece of LA history, then this a great spot to visit!",VictoriaAllen

20,Half of this place is dying.,"A year ago my wife and I visited China Town in San Francisco and we liked there very much. We visited China Town in LA hoping that it would be as good as that in SF. In reality, the place is not as active as in SF. Half of the stores in the area are empty or not much business going on. Number of restaurants and the quality of food were incomparable to those in SF. Totally disappointed, and we said we’d never come back again. Half of this place is dying.",Kanicama22
50,Must Visit L.A.,"This has been one of the places that I have been coming to my entire life. In fact, they still have the wishing-well that I used to throw pennies into when I was a kid.Has Chinatown changed over the years? Not much. Yes, some of the shops have changed but it still remains one of those Los Angeles Tourist Meccas that everyone who lives in the L.A. area ends up at sooner-or-later and the tourists frequent all the time.What to do when you come here? There are tons of those tourist orientated shops full of all that junk that you know your don't need but you can always find that bizarre gift when you really need one. There is also a few restaurants that I would recommend but they are on the streets surrounding the Chinatown Central Plaza and I have done direct reviews for them. But, they are close-by in the area.Throughout the year there are several Chinese-based events that take place in or around Chinatown Central Plaza. Those can be fun and visually stimulating events. For the past few years Chinatown Summer Nights has been a summer event worth checking out that is held in and around Chinatown Central Plaza. In other words, there is always one reason or another to come here.Parking can be a little tricky. There is, of course, street parking and you sometimes can get lucky and find a spot. There are also a few lots around the area but they are small and can be a mess to get in and out of. So, be prepared. It may take you awhile to find a place to park.But, overall this is a true must-see, must-go-to Los Angeles location. I've even shot a few movies here, as have a lot of other people. So yes, it is fun and a visually interesting place to go. Check it out!",Scott S
40,Fun to Explore,"It was a fun walking experience to us. Compared to 20 something years ago, Chinatown has changed a lot. I am surprised to see the change. We parked our car at this new developed residential/commercial plaza. The whole plaza was all decorated with beautiful red lanterns. It is very clean, beautiful, and modern. It's next to the metro station. We strolled around the streets and found it was quite interesting. We also went to the Sam Woo BBQ place to take some of the famous BBQ meats home. We also discovered Chinatown Plaza and appreciate the historical monuments. Please go to the right place to look back on this original Chinatown. There has been lots of effort made throughout the years to improve the area.Recommended.",MandC0218
20,Past it’s prime and trying to revive itself,Past it’s time and trying to revive itself. Each time I walk Chinatown I try to decide if it is improving or continuing to decline.

30,Small street with authentic Chinese restaurants and shopping,"I took a Metro link train the other day to China town, expecting to see a real full neighborhood. However, I found that it's more a commercial street with lot of eateries and shops which sell gift articles and day to day electronic stuff.

However you get here the fun is walking the streets. There are a wide variety of retail shops which inexpensive souvenirs, clothes, caps, etc. there are herb shops, food stores, restaurants, bakery's, jewelry all within a few streets. Some truly unique experiences, look into an herb shop, a live poultry shop where you pick your dinner and its dressed for you, or live fish store. you can graze the Dim Sum outlets and bakeries selecting whatever looks appealing to you.

40,A couple of hours in LA's Chinatown,"Looking for a nice little walking tour? Then, LA's Chinatown is worth a visit, especially if you already have an interest in how Asian communities outside of Asia originated and adapted over time.We were staying in downtown LA and exploring the city on a Metro day pass. Chinatown is just a hop, skip and a jump from downtown and easy to get to by train or bus. It is relatively compact, so easy to cover in just a few hours. It is also close to Little Tokyo, which has it's own appeal, so it would be easy to combine the two if time permits.Like many other inner city ethnic communities, the original population has spread out, leaving a mix of authentic and touristy experiences. The shopping scene is pretty typical of what you'd find in many other Chinese-centric commercial areas, with small storefront and mini-malls offering a range of goods.The food scene is interesting. The better Chinese food is now to be found elsewhere (e.g., the San Gabriel valley) and a number of 'hip' spots have opened, making Chinatown somewhat of a destination for foodies. We saw a couple of spots with lines of literally hundreds of people waiting indeterminately for their chance at take-away upscale fast food. (This was on a Saturday.) We skipped the lines and had a fabulous Thai meal at a place closer to the fringe of the neighborhood.There are a number of interesting architectural highlights, if that is of interest to you. There are a couple of good websites with well thought-out and descriptive walking tours available. I recommend checking them out and picking one (or more) and having it available on your phone to guide you as you explore this neighborhood. But even if you just explore on your own with no preconceived plans or expectations, I think you will enjoy your visit.",AGiLiT
40,Overwhelmingly fun,"Tons of little tourist shops with cheap prices. The Saigon market was huge. Make sure to haggle with the shop owners for a better deal. Tons of little places to eat as well. We ate at the Golden Dragon, you can see my review for them.",Brandi S
50,Chinese hospitality,"Living in San Francisco when I was young, the family would occasionally stop for an hour or two at China Town. It is a perfect place for tourists; bright, colorful, full of sounds, exciting sights, and delicious smells. Our parents knew the perfect restaurants to eat at. Now, whenever II visit SanFran, I try to spend time there. For tourists, it is the best place in town for souveniers. My favorite is getting cans of San Francisco Fog as gag gifts for my friends.",Manay

We were first in downtown LA, and then eating at Phillipe's which is very close, so decided to pay a visit.Nothing special, but many stores selling everything, eateries and a nice temple just after the Dragon's gate. Everything looked soulless, without a charm, vibe,...far below SF or NY. If you're not in the area, not worth the trip.",B1714D

30,Firecracker Festival,I ventured down to participate in the Chinese New Year festivities #firecrackerLA including registering for the 5k walk on Sunday. The festival supports tutoring in local schools with a full slate of weekend entertainment from tai Jo drummers to hula dancers. Our Chinatown is worth a visit if you are in the area or day tripping on the Metro Goldline. It's not as extensively vibrant as San Francisco nor is the food as authentic as what you will find in nearby Monterey Park or Arcadia. A photographer will find plenty of colorful muses in the vintage blinking neon buddhas and fanciful building facades that hark back to another era. Lunch or bread at nearby Homegirl Bakery is worth a visit.,Janeane42

50,My first chinatown experience,"Loved it! Though some may say that Chinatown in LA is not big and authentic enough, I really enjoyed this place. Come visit here after sun goes down and you will see all the lights. It's beautiful! I really felt like going to another country, even though I still was in LA. Also, this is a good place to buy Chinese goods and souvenirs.",Anastasia G
40,Get the feel of China in LA,"Los Angeles Chinatown is located not far from the City Hall and about 15 minutes walk from Union Station. It is not big compare to other major cities such as San Francisco or New York but still has the same characters of ""Chinatown"" as in other cities. It can be access by many bus lines and the Metro yellow line. There are plenty of both Chinese and non-Chinese food available. Many interesting places to see and things to buy. Come to experience China and Chinese culture without leaving the U.S.",Prawet J
50,A trip to the Far East without leaving the U.S.,"there are many reasons to visit LA's chinatown, from the many AUTHENTIC Chineserestaurants, to the newly opened 'trendy ones' like Chego and Pos Pok. But myreason for returning time and time again to Chinatown, is the Ten Red Tea SHoppewhich is the most authentic vendor of tea you will find in all of Los Angeles. Theysell not only tea(s) but boba drinks and other items on their 'tea bar' as well aspackaged teas from allover, not just Chinese: you can find Indian chai which is superbhere or Earl Grey in bags. They also carry tea pots and other accouterments, plus herbs......veyr very authentic",RKZ90027
10,Just not enough...,"China Town in San Francisco & New York seem like you're actually in China, the one here in LA is small and not too much fun...nothing to really see.",DerickG25
40,Wanted to enjoy Chinese food in Chinatown,"The Chinatown area in Los Angeles is sometimes called New Chinatown because part of the original Chinatown was taken for expansion of the transportation system It is still big enough to enjoy a good meal and check out Chinese markets. The Chinese arch is showing its age and needs a little touch up, but there is plenty of architecture in the area to ensure that you know you are in Chinatown. Restaurants abound, including those of a few other Asian cultures. There are a few fresh produce shops so before we had lunch we did a little shopping for some Asian favorites plus some Asian balms that we favor found in the variety stores. We were told most of the Chinese living in this part of town are the impoverished elders. The successful youth and first generation adults are scattered in diverse neighborhoods all over Los Angeles. That may explain the differences between the Chinatown here and those in other large cities. By the way, the Metro Gold line train stops on Broadway in Chinatown so it is easy and economical to get there from various locations in Los Angeles. We had a fun Sunday afternoon.",CyndyandByron
40,Very good Chinese food and stores,"There are many stores selling all kinds of Chinese junk and clothes. There are also many restaurants, some better than others",Jgoldchain
30,Small and Just Ok,"Chinatown Los Angeles is small and was a little boring in terms of shops and things to do here; unlike Chinatown San Francisco. I also didn't feel safe here. There were quite a few homeless walking around. As a solo female traveler, you must always be aware of your surroundings and be super smart about it when traveling alone. Some of the shops even have that 'seedy' feel to it. Whereas, when I walk around Chinatown San Francisco, I feel safer.The fresh fruit stand and fresh fruit juice stand were the only places that were really happening. There were long lines for both stand. Inside of the market reminded me of Chatuchak in Bankok, but a very small scale.I had the hankering for some dim sum and this was the only reason I went. Otherwise, it's really nothing to write home about.",Flamenquera
30,Small but Nice,It is a small area. The stores we went to everyone was very nice. We actually stayed in a hotel in Chinatown and really liked how it was not so busy.,Tcard2013
30,Charm of China,"Walking tour of shops, several restaurants. Typical of most ""Chinatowns"" in the U .S.If you want inexpensive items, this is the place to find them. Vases, bamboo plants, clothing, games, Knick knacks, etc. While this area isn't the most exciting, it does offer a bit of charm if one is in the mood to browse. Close to Downtown so easy to see many attractions.",Rhoda D
30,Mediocre,"We expected the Chinatown in LA to be amazing. Just did not live up to expectations. However, there were decent amount of restaurants to choose from and the prices were very reasonable. Worth a stop if you're nearby.",Gary L
30,Via the Gold Line,"We don't usually go to Chinatown because of the distance and the parking difficulties. Now that we can hop on the Metro Gold Line, it only costs us .35 cents to get there on the weekends (for seniors). That was exactly what we did last Saturday. After getting off the train, we went to the huge plaza which is between Alpine, College, Spring, and Broadway (don't know the name of the plaza). It was like any markets in SE Asia. Hundreds of vendors selling everything you can imagine, cheap! You can try bargaining but I bought three sets of pajamas for $10, which I thought was cheap enough. Sister bought T-shirts for her grandchildren, 6 for $10.I remember when Chinatown was busy and crowded on the weekends years ago, but it was pretty quiet when we were there this time. Most Chinese in the LA area don't go there anymore and it's now mostly people from SE Asia. If you are into shopping for cheap goods, here is the place. It kind of reminded me of the Ladies Market in Hong Kong.",ROCruiser
30,A different Chinatown,"LA chinatown is quite different with other city chinatown that packed into a small area. In LA chinatown is quite big area and there is no center for attraction. You will need to walk along the way to get the feel of a chinatown.There are not many things to see in chinatown, just a few shops and restaurant.",jazarja
40,Chinatown,Quite small in comparison to NYC but very enjoyable. We had a wonderful lunch of dim sum at the Golden Dragon and then enjoyed walking around the sites. We also had fun trying our luck at the wishing well. Many little shops and restaurants. The market was not very impressive and I actually felt a bit claustrophobic but I would recommend visiting when in LA.,punnina65
50,Chinatown!,We decided to stop by China Town after visiting Little Tokyo and Korea Town. China Town was it's own little world. We got lost in a plaza where there had to be hundreds of stores. The people working the stores were always friendly and open to negotiations sometimes! Although be careful if you take photos as you may get reprimanded. lolThis was well worth the stop. You will have to pay a few bucks for parking but the deals to be had are great and lots of awesome spots for souvenirs.,dazyabbey
30,LA Chinatown,The road is wide and the Chinatown Gate lights up a bit at night. Most of the shop closed early here and the place we get our dinner also closed at 8.30pm. Nothing much to see at night. Quite & windy here.,joanadventure
30,Little dodgy but a nice walk,Grand market is best place to walk through. Really quiet on a Saturday but nice to see all the buildings.We (myself female and two female friends) were stalked but a crazy man for three blocks so best not to walk alone.,Tamara S
40,not much too see,"its typical chinatown with gift shops groceries and asian food.parking is a bit difficult and we got lucky to find some secure parking space for $10 for 2hours. we walk around, we went to one restaurant and order a noodle dishes the lady said sold out, we order another dishes and again she said its sold out. so what can he have? she offer something else on their menu, we eat some weird sticky noodles which taste not very nice at all. we walk around the street, found some souvenirs shops, and watching the dragons some kind of the chinese traditions that day, quite entertain. lots of jewellery shop and took pic of some chinese old building which need maintain. compare to other chinatown, this one is a bit disepointed",tassieyasmin
40,Ok,"Short visit, due to the difficulty to find a reliable and affordable parking spot. Visited the shops and restaurants but decided last minute not to eat there. This place look like it will be more fun to visit during nighttime.",Jptravelswithfreedom
30,Interesting but not too much to do,The Saigon market is good for souvenir shopping and getting some cheap clothes but apart from that China town is mainly worth going to for seeing the architecture and trying some authentic cuisine. Comparing other 'Chinatowns' in cities across the world I would say this Chinatown is pretty similar to the real thing in some cases.,jackmoore93
10,Expected so much more!,I took my Daughter and her friend on the train from Orange County to Chinatown and thought it would be a fun day and was very disappointed!!!! The girls were happy for a couple minutes as they were able to take there picture at the spot where a music video was filmed but then we were done! We ended up back at Union Station and took an early train back home. Very disappointed and wished we had gone to the beach instead!!!!,Vicki O
50,Another Los Angeles Must Visit,Chinatown is another destination in LA that I always enjoy visiting. I love the Asian culture and always pick up souvenirs for family and for my classroom. The people who work there are helpful and courteous. I always enjoy our visits. The foods are delicious and I really love the cultural experience. There is paid parking down the street that is reasonably priced. Well worth visiting.,MWB2011
30,It's seen better days,"Apart from some trinket stores and a few food stores carrying traditional Chinese food items, including live fish, Chinatown seems tired and in decline.",rblumer2015
40,Another Chinatown,It's nice for a walk. There're really cool staff to see (and to buy if you want). Just a couple of hours and you'll see it all.,Dieguito
50,Home of the bootlegs,Here you can find a lot of the funny/fail bootlegs and knock offs of various brands of goods and toys. Whenever I'm in L.A. I like coming here to spend the day seeking those out and get Chinese BBQ.,SkyCommander
30,More of a nighttime place.,"It was our friends and my son and me (two adults, two kids) who took a trip out to Chinatown on the metro. It was a really great idea since we didn't have to worry about parking. We got there at about 11 am and there was not much to do. A few stores were open, and as the morning went on, a few others did too. The thing is that it looked a bit desolate, so that's why I think it might be better at night and even better around Chinese New Year, which we are planning on doing. The children still got inexpensive toys and were happy there, making wishes at the fountain. We also visited Phoenix Bakery and had a yummy treat.",Gehisa A
50,A little piece is China in L.A.,"Chinatown is always a fun way to spend the day, especially during lunchtime. It's right next door to Olvera Street and Downtown L.A. so you can kill 3 birds with one stone if you are visiting L.A. The reason I recommend lunchtime is because a lot of restaurants have lunch specials that include soup, rice, and some include fortune cookies, almond cookies, and/or sliced oranges for desert. They are reasonably priced too. After lunch you can wander around the different shops selling a variety of things like Chinese clothing (silk Chinese outfits, Chinese hats, and I love the Chinese shoes. Quite stylish.), household goods (kitchenware, blankets, curtains, etc), and they also sell Chinese Good Luck plants, beautiful porcelain pots for the plants, a long with many other nick nacks. The other thing to see in Chinatown is Chinese architecture in the central square and a Budhist Temple on Alpine St. & Yale St. A good time of the year to go is Chinese New Year in either late January or February where they have parades, dancing dragons, fire crackers, and good sales!",MasPluto2laugh

30,Very average Chinatown,"Been to a few US Chinatown (New York, Chicago, San Fran, Phili etc) ... In term of uniqueness, this one probably is near the bottom of the list . Area is quite large and there's quite some interesting eatery; but it just does NOT have that type of atmosphere nor the variety of food choices common in other US Chinatown. About the only thing that stands out for me is the Thien Hau Temple .. Other than that I give it a pass; especially if you plan (or have been) to go San Francisco Chinatown.",DC_Louisville

But was utterly disappointed upon reaching there.Not much to see around. Small, rundown shops selling made in China trinkets. Very avoidable. Can't even call it a tourist trap. It is totally avoidable.",BhawaniPathania
50,Five Stars for the restaurants you may not know about.,"If you have been to Chinatown in San Francisco, or NY, or even Boston, you are going to think I am insane for giving LA's Chinatown 5 stars, but wait, I have a reason. The food--oh the food.Chinatown is not large, it is maybe 3 blocks. There is also areas on Broadway that are considered part of Chinatown, but most people think of the 3 block area with the Chinatown sign. It is old. It is not well maintained and there is not a lot to see. There are stores that sell trinkets and a few places to eat that are just fine. Parking is not hard, but you will pay for it. So, walk though Chinatown and have fun. It is not open late, but that is okay. You will spend maybe an hour walking around and buying that postcard and then you will be ready for food.The places right in that 3 block area are okay, but that is not where you are going. You are going where the locals go. First stop is Ocean Seafood Restaurant on Hill Street. Just ask a local how to walk there and they will direct you. Their food is great. They have dim sum and it is fantastic. The dim sum is during the day and sometimes lunch. Servers walk around with trays of steaming dumplings and soup and rice and oh my is it great. Now, they charge for each dish so don't go nuts.If you have the time and are around for dinner, you will go to Plum Tree Inn on Broadway, also walking distance from Chinatown (both these really are part of Chinatown, but it is not on the streets with the signs and the stores). Plum is wonderful. The Chinese food is authentic and oh so wonderful. This is a local's place, but like Ocean Sea Food, tourists are welcome always. Get their dumplings and maybe a fresh fish. You will love it.Kids are welcome at both these places and they will love Chinatown--they can run and toss a coin into the Buddha wishing well.So, go there. I am a local and I am telling you it is a blast--the food. And you can use a nice walk anyway.Have fun and as I always say, when in Downtown LA, your wallet is always in your front pocket and no you don't want to buy a watch.",elizabethlascheid
30,Unhealthy Chinatown,"I've been to several Chinatown in US, but LA original chinatown looks depressing. Unlike SF chinatown, their main road is rather long and have lots of stores, but they are not all open by 10 am. While in SF, its already open, welcoming both local and tourists.Parking was easy.Please do not Jaywalk. Use the zebra cross.Food prices are cheaper than SF tho.",j34nn3
30,Good for sightseeing,"If you are looking for a spot to sight see near downtown LA, China town can be fun. It is not a large area as it is really just 2-3 blocks worth of stuff to see and restaurants to try. It is dated and just like most down town areas, some places can be sketchy depending on what time you go. There are shops with teas, kitchen ware, unique items as well as tourist catered shops and places to try. I would be wary of some of the smaller restaurants and be sure to check Yelp for them. We stick to the dim sum dragon restaurant as it is more known. You can see and eat here in a few hours so it does not take up too much time if visiting.",Vee1050
30,A bit depressing,"Everything looks old and there was hardly any people on the street. I found a couple warehouses with f21 and h & m clothes. Super cheap! 1, 3 and 5 bucks!If you go by bus aprox at 6 they start going by less and less. Drive an uber or get a cab.",MrsKaiba
20,Tourists and closed shops,Disappointing tour through an area that might have been exciting a decade or two ago. Tourists looking for something authentic & not finding it. Trinket shops selling kitsch.,RonL40
40,A walk around place,Seen better days as a tourist attraction. Mostly shops with cheap Chinese merchandise. Have to pick out the more authentic shops for Chinese customers. Food options varied from very cheap to very expensive. Liked the take out shops for creating a meal--like a cafeteria style take out. Check out the poultry processing plant for fresh chicken.,StrongMEWoman
20,Not much of a China Town here,"I have seen the Dragons that mark the entrance to China Town on Broadway and Chavez Blvd for many years, and have always wanted to go down the street. Being from the SF Bay area, you see the entrance to China Town and there is some mystery to the whole idea of their being a Town within the Greater SF City.Los Angeles China Town is barely a China Town anymore. The stores and shops are dingy. The colors are faded, buildings need paint. The produce markets use plastic tarps to keep the sun out, and there are hardly any street vendors. I didn't see one nice Chinese food restaurant on my walk down the street. I finally found several when I walked into an enclosed shopping center. The most popular restaurant in there was the Nashville Hot Chicken. Hardly a resounding endorsement for the cuisine.There are no basements or enticing shops with curious and sundries that you see some much of in San Francisco. I wasn't disappointed. I knew that this China Town had bad reviews, but I wanted to see for myself. Now, I have done it, I won't be going back again.",J S
30,dessapointing,"I didn't meet my expectations, very dirty and very small. The mayority of the stores were close and it was very empty, not a lot of people walking. I wont come back, I will rather spend my day going to the walk of fame instead",Lucapeca

20,Boring and uninteresting,"Sorry for all those TA reviewers who seem to like the LA Chinatown but don't count me among them. Everytime I go there I'm reminded how dirty, boring and empty this place is. My most recent trip there involved trying out a new Nashville ""Hot"" chicken sandwich restaurant (Howlin' Ray's) of all things. It's located in the heart of Chinatown and as such is fairly representative of the current state of Chinatown: The good: Many new living spaces and restaurants give this area a real chance at redemption as there are many empty storefronts which can be converted into something worth visiting. The bad: Unless you have a specific reason for being here now don't waste your time!",Mark J
40,One of the world's best Chinatowns,"If you saw the movie ""Chinatown"" with Jack Nicholson, you will be aware the the Los Angeles Chinatown has been around for a long time. The various benevolent associations have their buildings here, but most of the shops are run by Vietnamese. A lot of young people have moved out to the suburbs but it is still a very interesting place. A commuter rail line stops right in Chinatown, so it's easy to get to.",Jeffry b
20,Going down hill!,I remember coming here many time since the 80's and after about 2005 it started going down hill. It wasn't as bustling as it used to be and you have a harder time finding bargains. One thing I really dislike was looking for public restrooms. You really have to buy something or eat at a restaurant in those mini shopping plazas for them to give you a token for the restrooms. The security guards were rude and downright nasty! A female security guard freely entered the men's restroom at will with no respect to the customers! This was at the Far East Plaza by the way (727 N. Broadway). There are still some good restaurants and one can still find bargains but less so than years ago. Try the Dynasty Shopping Center. I'm done with this place!,RainbowCowboy
40,A pleasant atmosphere with good food while enjoying the family!,"Last time I visited Chinatown was back in the late 60s when I lived LA. I was pleasantly surprised to see the same atmosphere that I enjoyed 50 years ago. Walking around the streets and watching so much activity going on in their businesses as well as restaurants and enjoying a delicious ice cream brought back great memories when I used to take my daughters at a very early age. My son and I who accompanied at this time, stopped for lunch at one of their restaurants and enjoyed a great lunch followed by a delicious ice cream and an nice stroll to finish our visit.",Anthony H
40,"Beautiful architecture, crowded streets","I was so excited to be able to finally get to see Chinatown! The architecture of the buildings there were beautiful! Knowing the history of Chinatown and being able to walk the streets, see the buildings in their original state, and then those that were transformed into Chinese architecture was simply amazing for me.For those who do not know the history, the area known as Chinatown was originally known as little Italy because it was the area where Italian immigrants migrated too. Then the smaller area became home to Los Angeles' Chinese population.Please note that if you will be going to Chinatown, be prepared to walk very crowded streets. However, the people I met there were really nice. Should you decide to purchase anything, shop around because you can find great deals if you really look.Wear some good walking shoes, and take the time to walk around and maybe some times just look up! You never know what you will see.",charlottesl
30,Pros and cons compared to others,"I've been to all the main Chinatown areas in the U.S. This one is truly average. Long and narrow, several blocks, it's bigger than most, smaller than NYC and SanFran. Lots of good restaurants, limited but sufficient shopping. Fairly clean is a plus. Entry gate is colorful, especially at night. Streets roll up early, so daytime for shopping, early dinner, night photos would be a good sequence.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,When you are in LA be a Chineese,"Yes, just as my heading says..this is your easy way to experience china when in US. yep there is no great wall nor the gardens...but yes its a one hour walk through shops and kinds that a native chines would feel at home. Great place to be around.",Yoosafinpace

I can only assume not much was opened until after midday. We spent a couple of hours walking around to see the sights and then found a great Chinese/Vietnamese cafe that made great Pho!Parked in car park and paid $5 dollars which would have seen us through the whole day if we were staying that long. However, we found out afterwards there was street parking - you can park where ever you see a meter. But be sure to check timings as the rules are different from the way we park in the UK.",minibubblegum
30,Small Chinatown,"The Chinatown in LA is very small and disappointing - Been to the Chinatown in San F. might make me like the LA one less. But I think it is very small.Also not much going on there during the weekend, I went there on a Saturday around 11am and most stores were closed.",OCDane
30,Losing it's mojo but still fun/worthwhile for visit when in downtown LA,"Sigh...truth is that I had higher expectations. Memories from my childhood were that this was a vibrant Chinatown with a wishing well, etc. Well...it's not anymore. That said it was still fun to walk and see the shops and live seafood store and I did pop into a garden store and get a little fountain that is making me happy as I write this. Have to say we loved the musician dressed like Santa playing a Chinese instrument. I suggest combining this with Olvera Street when in downtown LA. The people were really nice and I know you can get some killer food here but we had already eaten some Mexican so we just stuck to buying a bamboo steamer and the fountain.",AFoolForTravel

Wife and I thought we'd see if we could find some art for the house but unfortunately that was not to be.-Over all, the experience was for the most part very tourist centric. The majority of offerings were cheap trinkets and other garbage. The local offerings such as a grocery store was quite...how can I say this....aromatic? Aside from the obscenely loud radio tuned to static it smelled a bit 'off'. Not in the sense of exotic unfamiliar smells but more in the sense that the fish case had one too many spills into hard to reach areas...smell.-A lot of China Town is what I would consider dirty with a lot of less-than-desirable non-Chinese locals slumming around. Tons of trash peddlers, ""Oh hey, baby turtles suffering in a tiny plastic box filled with water and no place to rest.""....yeah, great.-The only saving grace is the food offerings of which there are just too many to decide on. One trend I did notice was that a lot of dining establishments mysteriously did not have health department ratings posted as required by law...Sort of makes you think twice.-All in all, if you have just one ""Foreign"" Town to visit, I'd head up the way to Little Tokyo and pass on this.",Johnny P

30,San Gabriel now trumps Chinatown for Asian Food - so not as popular as it used to be,"Once upon a time Chinatown was where to go for Asian food in the Los Angeles area. Now with more Asians living in the San Gabriel Valley area, we go there instead for dim sum and Asian lunches and dinners. We did stop by to have dim sum with friends this trip, but in general, Chinatown in Los Angeles is not as much our ""go to"" area as it used to be when I was growing up in the Los Angeles area.It is still fun to go to the area during Chinese New Years time for the parade. There are also other Asian festivals here.",mini

It just seems like in a sort period of time the few remaining businesses will fold up as well....even the dim sum was depressing!!!,Jeff W

40,A fading yet beautiful Queen of LA,"I love Chinatown. It is filled with sights and sounds that you can see no where else. It reminds me a lot of Hong Kong. There are vendors that sell almost everything that you can imagine… Especially a lot of tourist junk! If you have a practical I you can find these things and make them work for you at home or for gifts… In the nicer parts you can actually find some beautiful clothes in some hidden away bazaars that go way back from public view. Be sure not to miss the great food… Most of the establishments have a grade ""B"" rating… Don't let that put you off… It has more to do with cooking style than cleanliness… It is a unique experience that should not be missed… If you can't find the adventure here – you may be lacking some imagination!

I found myself in a shopping mall where 9 of the units were closed down. Not a particular vibrant feel of say Chinatown in London or Bangkok but nevertheless interesting. My highlight was finding the restaurant used in the film Rush Hour with Jackie Chan. Worth a stroll and not far from Union Station which provides a good transport hub and also has the best Art Deco looking restaurant and waiting room. So worth the trip.",Sky051

40,Colourful and viby,"Very colourful and bustling community. A stone's throw from Union Station so easy to get there. The usual touristy souvenirs of course but that is expected.

30,"Good Food, but odd place","now, i've been to some shady places and this takes a slot in the collection. Although it was pretty cool to visit another Chinatown location on the globe it was weirdly quiet, when I say quiet there were quite literally very few people around! maybe the triad were on a major abduction mission (with the exception of me and the gf) who knows! we stopped off in a chinese restaurant for a snack, but the portion sizes we're at banquet level! brill stuff, if your in LA get fed here!",2 Foodies

20,Chinatown in LA,When you have experienced Chinatown in San Francisco the one in LA always comes across as a poor relation. Its a historic area that goes back to the 1860s but its something you can miss if you plan to go to San Francisco.,PrestonGuild
40,Small but fun,"Small by San Francisco standards, but still offers many good restaurants and shops. There are deals to be had in clothing, jewelry, and knick-knacks in the many shops. Closes up rather early so get there before 6PM on weekdays. May be longer summer hours.",desertsage55

This is a location that should not be missed on any visit to LA.my old friends were just great guys and the culture of the people here is just so outstanding.These are some family members going way back that helped found LA in the early days.and they worked hard building the rail system to make our country great.,Barry N
10,One of the worst Chinatowns,"Through our extensive travels, we like to stop and visit the country’s or city’s Chinatown. This has to be one of the smallest and most forgettable stops. It’s not really a Chinatown at all. It has no character. It wasn’t filthy though and that’s the best thing I could say about it. We live in Beijing and thought there would be some kind of decent Chinese food and not at all. Don’t waste your time.",Daniel A

Too bad, but returned to downtown instantly",Sentina S
40,I love this place! Is filled with wonderful memories!,"Chinatown is an acquired taste… For me I have been going there for over 30 years. It is crazy and messy and even has a few unknowns smells to discover… But, the food and the ""attitude"" of the Chinese people and immigrants there is fabulous. You can find all kinds of things there that you want never find anywhere else! It is always changing sea of merchandise and new trendy items. You can find art, cheap junk, artifacts, and so many strange food items that you will be amazed… it is worth the trip and worth walking all the way up and down the main street to try to see it all… There is something there waiting for you that you will remember and talk about for years to come… By the way… Throw a coin in the fountain and your dreams will come true!",daveholden

20,Very authentic,"It was super interesting to drive through, but it is really dirty and crowded, and you just know that if you eat anything there you will regret it. To be honest, I really didn't like the look of the place, even though I have traveled a fair bit in Asia. We had kids with us, and we didn't want them walking around there.It didn't strike me as being friendly towards tourists. More for locals. Put it like that.",Elwood_Seattle

20,Disappointing.,"I visited Chinatown for the first ever and was indeed very disappointed. People were rude , boba sucked , the streets and some restaurants smelled. Out of all those people that we tried to buy from only one man who sold me a kimono was nice. Even when eating at a expensive restaurant were they rude. I was quite upset since they were the way they were and so was my husband , he is Asian himself and couldn't believe they were that way either. Probably wont go back again.",AbigailCheng
30,It was alright,"It's alright if you know your way around, but we didn't and just ended up along the street with little shops full of the same kind of things.

40,Not much to do but good for sightseeing,"If you are traveling to los angeles, china town is a must. Although there is not much to do there are restaurants and a few stores that sell chinese items and spices. If you are feeling adventourous there are restaurants that will cook for you fresh bird or fish.(yes fresh means they kill it before they cook it). Bring cash a lot of places take credit/debit cards but there is a minimum that you have to purchase. Also parking is in lots that charge you flat rates also paid in cash.",Bertha E

40,"First time in a Chinatown, enjoyed the shopping and food.","I've never been to a Chinatown in another city, so I can't compare, but it was fun for a couple hours. Lots of cheap trinkets and souvenirs. I got 5 t-shirts for the kids for $2 each, and a shot class for a couple bucks. There are shoes, clothes, phone cases, bamboo, banzai trees, etc as well. After googling ""best hot and sour soup in los angeles"", one of the results was Yang Chow in Chinatown (I'll review them separately), and we weren't disappointed.Depending how much time you want to spend eating, shopping, and walking, you could spend anywhere from a half-hour to half a day here.",GoingForCoffee

50,Always an Adventure,"If you're looking for inexpensive fun in Los Angeles, this is the spot. Shop, window shop, eat, and maybe even catch a live performance. There's no end to the interesting places to shop...your feet will wear out first. The prices are super reasonable. If you're into plants, they have a great variety right out on the street and often these are types of plants that aren't easy to find in common stores.Snacking and dining are a must. Come hungry. There aren't a whole lot of restaurants compared to other parts of LA, but I've never left hungry or disappointed.There are public restrooms, but you need change to use them. They aren't particularly clean. So if you're wanting a tidy toilet, I suggest going at a restaurant.",thewinsomewench
50,"Chinatown In Los Angeles, California","While in Los Angeles, CA you should visit Chinatown. We were there during the Chinese New Year Festival and it was spectacular. People were everywhere celebrating. Kids were running around with streamers and adults were shooting fireworks. There are unique statues and gardens in the area. If you want authentic Chinese food this is the place. We wanted to try everything and ended up with a table full of food. There are many small shops in the area.

30,"Not a must visit unless for Asian food, groceries, cheaper merchandise","This should be aptly re named Asiantown as these days there are more of other asiatic races in the mix( esp the other entrants of Vietnamese ,Cambodian etc who migrated more recently than the earlier Chinese migrants whom will move the social economic ladder and live n set up elsewhere and also their next generation not continuing their trades.All these said it s a place to get authentic Asian food which should not be limited to fried rice, chow mien,sweet n sour pork, Mongolian bbq beef or Szechuan spicy food or Vietnamese pho etc. you get large servings which would be value for money.Not the best chinatown in North America because of the sprawl ! San Francisco n NYC s chinatown will make the more complete Chinatown because of the crowd, sounds n the smells!! Nevertheless visit if only you have an urge for asian food as the sights , monuments are not all interesting.",Highadventurer
40,Good for food or souvenirs,"We decided to stop here for lunch. It was easy to find parking on street during the week day (but you may find that parking in a lot is less expensive if you plan to stay 2+ hrs). We dined at Yang Chow restaurant which and walked through the shopping ""mall"" where you will find tons of vendors with everything from intimate wear to shoes.

30,Losing it's appeal - more of a film stage,"The china town area itself seems more like a film stage or back lot studio than a functioning ares of commerce. I was there before noon and not much was open... There is a lot more activity down Broadway where you will find many open air markets that ""feel"" more like chinatown used to than the current block of buildings do. The Bruce Lee statue is neat to see though and the hanging lanterns make for some great photos.",TryppAdams
40,Good place to visit,"LA Chinatown is brimming with places to visit, food to eat, etc. My own opinion is that it's slightly touristy but still a good place to visit, unlike New York City's China Town which I believe is a real Chinatown outside China. It was not built for tourists but a home away from homeland.",Astrav

30,Worth a one-time visit,"It is small compared to the big Chinatowns in North America, but I enjoyed walking around for an hour or so. It does have a bit of a dark and rundown feel to it, I wouldn't want to be there after the sun goes down. I avoided the food as I didn't get a good feeling looking at the dining options. There are plenty of similar restaurants in nicer areas (Rosemead, Alhambra) that I would prefer to these. Overall, worth a short visit just for the experience.",bguth11
30,Nothing spectacular,We lived in Los Angeles for over 30 years and never visited China Town before. However now we live in NC and visited LA for the Holidays. Our 15year old was told by a school mate that it was a must go! So he was adamant that we took him. Lot's of shops and restaurants but way too crowded and lot's of traffic considering it was the middle of the week. Off the bucket list... won't be going back.,Martha A

50,A cliche but worth the experience,Many locals have avoided Chinatown to other places like Alhambra and San Gabriel Valley. But Chinatown is going through its resurgence with the old and the new. Don't discount the classics like Master Chef and the newly refurbished Empress Pavilion for dim sum. Or the wild and crazy Starry Kitchen with their amazing tofu balls. Take your time and stroll around and just experience the old and the new.,Glenn Dabatos

Generally, almost always a warm encounter.I browsed the fresh food markets, which is something I love!I love to cook, and if you love to cook from fresh ingredients, the markets offer more than can fit in one recipe!I am a cooking fanatic, so fresh food markets are one of my happy places!

20,Not what I expected,"We ended up here as part of a tour of L.A. and I guess I expected it to be similar to other cities I've been to. But this Chinatown was not as impressive. The best part was the entrance/exit with dragons facing each other across the street. But the rest seemed dirty and ran down. We didn't have any desire to return and explore on our own. However, I'm still glad we went there as part of the tour and can check it off the bucket list.",TNHarleyChick

We would then explore the various stores.Now, we sometimes bypass downtown Chinatown however when we want to go have food and head to one of our favorite dim sum or dinner restaurants in San Gabriel Valley.We have in past years enjoyed seeing Chinese New Years in Los Angeles Chinatown - that is a very good place to enjoy and celebrate the New Years.",mini

50,Always have cash on hand,"There are a lot of knick knack stalls. If you want more bargaining power, have cash on hand. You can shop for blankets, pajamas, men and womens clothing, household items, jewelry and more. Always look around first, and go back to the store to get the best prices.I saw turtles at the very first stall and was quoted 2 for $15.00. I walked around the corner, and was quoted 2 for $5.00. It helps to do a little homework before buying! Restaurants in Chinatown are quite reasonable.",winnil510
10,Felt entirely unwelcome!,"We came here looking for Chinese herbs that I read about in a book by Dr. Henry Lu. We went to Wing Hop Fung, at 5PM and after looking around for 10 minutes, we asked for help and were directed to a back counter, where a woman had been standing. As we came towards her, she left and didn't come back. After 5 minutes, 3 men came out and started sweeping/mopping, but we were ignored. Finally, my husband asked the first lady and she said, ""Oh, they're there."" We waited another 5 minutes and an older distinguished man came out. To every herb on my list, he said no – they did not have it, without elaborating, although I had the common name & the genus and species for every herb. I thanked him and we went upstairs to shop. I was picking out teacups when my husband called me to look at some cookies. As I'm looking, a woman comes out of the back and begins sweeping the floor right in front of me. This is a narrow aisle and I am standing maybe a foot in front of the case, and all of a sudden there's a broom inches from my face (I’m 5’9”). I say, oh I'm sorry and step back quickly, but then I think - wait! she wasn't here before; she's not even doing that good of a job sweeping, and why just in front of me?? As this dawns on me, my husband calls me over to a section of teas and packaged medicines. The aisles are much wider here and as we are picking out tea, a man comes from the other side of the store, pulling this large, flat cart, piled 4' high with empty boxes. There are at least six aisles with no customers on either side of us, but he chooses to pull his wagon by us, requiring that we move completely out of the aisle, so that he can go through. Now I’m finally getting it. Despite our friendliness and good manners, we are purposely being treated with complete rudeness here. Quite frankly, I have never in my life been treated so poorly by store personnel, except once back in the ‘70's at a store in northern Greece, when they realized we were Americans. However, for this to be the behavior of at least 9 employees of a store in America, is really rather appalling! I look thru some medicines, still trying to find the items I came for, and my husband asks a clerk for help. We actually debated about it, as I felt it would be a waste of time, but he still tried. She said she couldn't help him. It was 10 minutes before closing when we checked out. I spent $40 even though my husband didn't want to buy anything from them, but I didn't come all the way from Michigan for nothing! The young cashier smiled at us (the only employee who did) and asked how we liked their store. I was taken aback by the question, as I certainly couldn't say - well, in San Francisco we felt like honored guests in Chinatown, and here we felt like second or third-class citizens(!). I mean it certainly wasn’t true of her, even if everyone else was like that! So I said that this was the only store we’d been to, and the streets seemed wider and busier, than San Francisco. After we left, we considered continuing to shop nearby, but this experience at Wing Hop Fung pretty much soured us on going anywhere else in L.A.'s Chinatown, so we walked back to our car and left.",SLBrown2014
50,First Chinatown I ever went to,"My husband first took me to Chinatown when we were dating. That was about 25 years ago. We have seen it change so much, but it still holds the magic of when I was younger. There is not as many tourist entertainment as there used to be. No dragon beard candy makers, no lion dancers. In fact a lot of shops have closed down. But I still love it. Best place to eat is anywhere were the pigs and ducks hang in the window.",JAZEStopp

40,A blast from the past and awesome food!,"What there is not to love about chinatown! You can find all knick nag, bonsai trees to authentic fruits. It is not quite busy like San Francisco or New York chinatowns since many Chinese business have moved to alhambra and monterey park in the last 2 decades. The Chinatown commerce has been doing a decent job to vamp up the place with Chinatown Summer Nights events during summer, keep the areas clean and safe, night patrols. While there is homeless downtown area by union station, surprisingly we have not found nay homeless in this area even in late nights!The central plaza still hosts many gift shops and restaurants. One block from Central plaza, you may find more restaurants between Ord street and Broadway. If you are in the area, should check out Chego (new korean fusion cuisine), dim sum at Ocean seafood restaurant, lobster dish at JR Bistro, or deserts at Sweet town!The area is definitely in needs of a face lift but it still has its own charms!",kukulimoku

The two of us ordered off the regular menu and had the best garlic stir fry Chinese broccoli we've ever eaten; delicious beef and rice noodles; and tasty chicken with vegetables and wide rice noodles all for under $25-plus we had enough leftovers for another meal. Good service. The special lunch menu before 4pm has great deals.",DeborahandAndy
40,Great food - sparse attractions,"I liked the food and the ambiance of the shops but there were few of them. I purchased two remembrances of when we lived in China. There were some tourist/Chinese goods. Chinatown itself was a shadow of China (of course) and Chinatowns in San Francisco, Seattle and other places.",Loren778899
20,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Asian culture, so I was very excited to visit Chinatown in L.A. This is a small Chinatown with bad food and cheap stores. It has some traditional architecture but is not worth the visit. It looked run down. It could be a nice area for walking but at least they should take care of the painting of the facades, green spaces, in other words, they should invest money here to make fun and vibrant.",Diego
30,Chinese History,This place is again a historic district area that in reality consists of mostly cheap storefronts offering their wares. There are a few good restaurants in the district.The entrance to Chinatown is very impressive with the dragons facing each other. Still the area is something to see if you have a few hours on a sunny day.,pmiller00
30,An hour of LA History,"This bit of LA has an oddly tragic history- the anti-Chinese riots in 1871 by murderous white guys left 19 people dead, and then the whole place was torn down and moved a few blocks north to accommodate Union Station. That said, its a quirky little Chinatown with all the obligatory odors and illegal fireworks and knife shops and some average food. Chinatown a nice walk around Downtown LA if you include Alvera Street and Disney Concert Hall. If you want a more current taste of forward-moving China, head to Arcadia where the new, wealthy immigrants live and pump money into a rip-snorting Chinese expatriate community. Try the Dim Sum.",LATripp
50,Inexpensive and Fun!,"I hadn't been to Chinatown for ages but it's just as I remembered it. The shopping is great and inexpensive and the food (ate at the Golden Dragon) was wonderful. I stuck to the main shopping area on Broadway - there is a little indentation off the road where there are several shops and a wishing well. Great way to spend some time and the items they have for sale are unusual, very authentically Chinese and CHEAP!",portergirlbooks
40,Culturally very interesting,"Unlike some of its namesakes in other Western cities, this really is more than just a concentrated group of Chinese restaurants. This serves LA’s significant Chinese community and has banks, shops, food, restaurants and everything else that you would expect the community to need. It’s not pretty in the usual tourist sense, but it’s real and it’s very interesting. Definitely worth visiting.",MSH-Sussex
20,Really empty,"I found Chinatown to be pretty empty. I could categorize two main groups that were mainly found when i was there. Elderly Chinese people doing their day to day groceries or beggars. My friend noticed that there was a lot more Vietnamese stores popping up. I'm not sure if I went on an off day but I went on Tuesday and was there around 12 and since my rental car was parked there, we went back later. So I found one of the gates to enter into Chinatown but I was looking for another section that I saw in a music video. After much search and wandering, my friend and we found it, which happens to be ""New Chinatown"".So New Chinatown doesn't look that impressive during the day because it only has a few people there and they happen to be tourists. The Bruce Lee statue is also located here. New Chinatown seems like it was built for tourists. Outside seems more like real Chinatown.Since it was close to Chinese New Year, there was a lot of decoration found but other than that, there were some rundown looking restaurants or stores. I ended up having dim sum at Ocean Seafood restaurant. We walked around to see if there were other dim sum places but couldn't really find them. Then I bought egg tarts at a bakery.",Choco_robba
40,"Fun, Cultural, Tasty!","I haven't been here since I was in elementary school and I'm glad I went to it last weekend. The Chinatown plaza is a nice little place with lots of small shops that carried wonderful and unique treasures. Everything from Chinese clothes to toys and gadgets. When you go to the Chinatown plaza, it's as if you stepped back in time- the place has the Chinese architecture mixed with American, and at the same time it looked like they kept it old school. This is not a place that looks modern or that update, so if you are looking for something hip and up beat, this is not the place for you. It does have fun spots to take pictures. We also walked the streets that surrounded the Chinatown plaza, and that was a lot of fun. Since plaza is small, and it doesn't take long to walk the entire plaza, we walked around it too. The streets around the plaza was where we did most of our walking, shopping, and eating. Chinatown is not just the plaza, but the general area surrounding it. We went to Queen's Bakery which has yummy Chinese breads and desserts and Jade Time Gifts where they had cheap priced Chinese things like lanterns, fans, umbrellas, etc. We went there to buy lanterns and an umbrella. We enjoyed walking into the little shops and exploring. We spent a few hours around Chinatown, probably about 3-4 hours.I haven't been here for a while, so it was better then I expected.",alvina k
30,Okay for a hour or two.,We decided to check out china town after stopping in thd area for lunch. After going to San Francisco's china town last spring and then China in the fall. We were a little disappointed in the Los Angelo's china town. It is much smaller than SF. We went in to look for a few special treats that we fell in love with but could not find here. If you have not been to a china town this place would probally be interesting for an hour or two.,lisjor
40,Neat area,Great area to visit and try vendor food. Neat little shops and people very friendly - felt safe compared to some other areas,steve s
30,Not as impressive as SF Chinatown,"Having been to Chinatown in San Francisco, I had quite high expectations of this but it was a bit disappointing. A few shops, a gate, a sign, that's pretty much it. If you dont have a lot of time, try visiting Little Tokyo instead. Sad to say I cannot recommend this.",Marijke J
30,Nothing special,The review is for china town in LA not SF which someone posted below me. Metered parking spots all around. My two teenage daughters were not impressed. There are a lot of shopping booths were you can buy trinkets and teas etc. I would have looked around more but no one in my group wanted to. There is an area towards the back of china town where there is a wishing fountain which is more like a wall with some water trickling down it with bowls marked with good luck titles. There are pretty hanging lanterns hanging across the sky and a small statue of Bruce lee. We took some photos there and left. If you are in LA check it out. If you are coming to visit from out of town skip it.,Miguel O and Maria
50,Maybe the best part of San Francisco!,"I loved this cute part of San Fran. It had a comfy vibe to it. The stores will let you sample treats and oh my, they are delicious! I had a sweet roll with pork in it. If only I could go back, that was the best thing I have ever tasted! Little Italy was nice too!",Marissa I
30,Another old Chinatown,"We paid visit to this Chinatown on our last day with an aim to look for some cheap handicraft items. Within the Chinatown, there is an area like the hawker center where about 100 shops selling all sorts of souvenir, pyjamas, sandles and/or travelling suitcases etc. doing business under the sun (still under cover but not inside a building). When compared to the Chinatown in Vancouver, I found more varieties and cheaper prices. Some people may not like it but as a tourist to LA, it is still a place you can consider if there is no where to go.",Hongkongboy55
40,"what will you pray for, in front of the wishing fountain?","You can arrive here with the Gold Line.Chinatown has got everything you could look for (with cash because most places only accepts cash).There is a nice wishing fountain to throw coins into for peace, lotto, good fortune, etc.Central Plaza contains a statue honoring Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese revolutionary leader who is considered the ""founder of modern China""There are numerous small, specialized grocery stores with soap, cosmetics. toys, clothes, music CDs at low prices.You can drink green tea, hot or frozen everywhere.There are many stores selling ginseng and herbs.Chinatown offers the usual barbecue delicatessens and Cantonese seafood restaurants with very good dim sum.",GdN80100
20,Not impressed,China town in la was very old and dirty and there was nothing here worth looking at.Alot of the buildings looked empty and closed.There are so many places worth visiting in la but this is not one of them!,renee n
30,Unimpressed,"Having been to the Chinatowns in NY, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver and Boston just to name a few; Los Angeles old Chinatown was mediocre. It is small, tight and old. It offers the usual trinkets, souvenirs, 5 for $10 t-shirts in every stall. For the experience, some decent chinese food and browsing like a tourist, it is worth a visit but not a must.",German F
50,Chinatown,"Absolutely love this place. So much to see, the restaurants are incredible. A variety of shops with very reasonable prices.",bobcat4112
40,Might be the old Chinatown....,"but good things are around the corner. Much smaller than Chinatowns of San Francisco and Vancouver, but still some things to see here. Throw pennies at the wishing well and hope for love, fortune and fame or admire the intricate architecture of the storefronts and get a feel for the history and Hollywood ties in the colorful courtyard.This summer, Chinatown celebrated their 75th anniversary as well as marking the 40th anniversary of Bruce Lee's passing....a famous martial artist and actor of the early 70's. A magnificent 7-foot statue of Lee was on display during our visit, but waiting for a permanent home. A fine tribute to a 'young' man who was well-known in the community.Not the hustle and bustle of years ago, but still worth a short walk down memory lane and don't forget to try the dim sum!",Shimadog
30,A fun place to visit,"This is one of the few neighborhoods that really has a centralized location in the square on Hill St. There are plenty of shops that sell similar merchandise, but the flea market is one of the bigger draws as it is one of the best places in the city to find random articles for cheap prices and if you need pet turtles, they sell them around every corner, though watch out for salmonella poisoning as the baby turtles they sell are technically illegal until they grow bigger.While visiting LA, this is one of the required neighborhoods and the area is always improving in small ways such as the Bruce Lee statue that they have recently acquired.Go for lunch, walk the street and go to a few shops and call it a quick, but good afternoon.",The_Roaming_Raven
30,Busy Area,"Liked the bargains you can get, but the parking was a little hard, have pay between $3-$5 for parking.",Jean C
30,Nothing Special,"Like Hollywood Blvd, you see it once and not worth seeing again. All the shops sell the same stuff and they watch you like a hawk. Also, there is the flea market area where peddlers are selling everything you can imagine. If you're into crowds, tight places and like to negotiate for the best deals, this is your place.There are a lot of good places for food up and down Broadway and a couple bakeries that offer unique items. Definitely recommend Yang Chow's as they have some of the best Chinese food I have ever had although a little pricey. There is parking all around for a few bucks and area appears safe.",simbadusty
50,Very attractive area,From the underground station onwards this was such joy to see! We loved the brightly coloured shops & restaurants. The shopkeepers that we encountered were all very helpful and chatty. We bought loads of little gifts to take home while we were here as there was so many attractive and cheap merchandise to be had!,angelenewright
40,Some Interesting Places Here (Especially If You Like the movie Rush Hour),Go to Foo Chow Restaurant. Parts of the movie Rush Hour were filmed here. Eat here then go back home and watch the movie. I also like Pho Palace for good strawberry smoothies. Saigon Marketplace is also an interesting place to see. It is mostly ladies clothing but they do have other items also. There are some food vendors at the entrance. I tried a fried shrimp cake last time. It was greasy but pretty tasty. I will have one again next time.,JohnB00007
30,The most traditional Chinatown,"I was there around 7pm, most of retail stores were closed already except a few restaurants. The community suddenly turned in quiet. However the night in Chinatown was cool. Since not much people walking around, you can take photos along with the landmarks. But the food is okay, taste a bit different from NYC or Chicago. Overall experience is good though. Bt the way, the parking is not complimentary. Also, many homeless people walking around to ask for changes. Just be careful at night when you chill out in Downtown LA.",Mieah C
30,Not like SF's Chinatown,"If you have never been to a US Chinatown and this is your only stop to see one, then go. If you have a chance to go to San Francisco, go to that Chinatown instead. This has been mostly taken over by owners from Taiwan and so has lost a bit of the Canton/Mandarin flavor. Fun still, but not as authentic as I had hoped.",HongKongTania
50,Don't miss Chinatown,Fabulous food and fabulous shopping in Chinatown. Loved it! Everything was so affordable! Arrived at 11am on a Friday and the streets were deserted. By 11:45 they were jam packed. So get there by 11am to get good parking.,GregTerriGrimes

20,"Chinatown LA is Dirty, Run Down, & Uninviting","On a recent Amtrak excursion up and down the West Coast, we had a long layover in LA before we could change trains and return home. Recalling Chinatown SFO, we thought it would be interesting to stay in Chinatown LA. WRONG! There is NO COMPARISON whatsoever. We had an entire day to explore Chinatown, which is near the Amtrak Union Station. Everything was dirty and run down, the goods sold were cheaper than cheap, and the shopkeepers were entirely UNfriendly in almost every establishment that we entered. The dirty streets were still littered with confetti left over from the Chinese New Year and reeked of bad smells. Even the restaurants and bake shops looked remarkably unclean and unappetizing. I thought if we ate anything there we would pay a high price that would likely end our trip in a hospital. All of Chinatown and it's inhabitants seemed to have no vitality whatsoever. It felt like arriving into a Twilight Zone episode. We will likely never go there again and felt lucky we didn't get mugged.",WorldSprinter18
50,If you're looking for a deal...,"This is a great place! You can buy unusual shoes, beautiful dresses and great jewelry at bargain prices! The Golden Dragon is a great place to eat. I am a vegetarian and found a lot of great dishes.The culture of China is brought to life here, with Buddhist temples, friendly people and decor. It is a great place to bring your friends for a fun afternoon. You might learn something.The only drawback is the lack of parking, but you can avoid that if you really want to take the gold line.I got a lot of jade jewelry for very little, and very nice things for my family back east.",princessofmirth

30,worth a stop....,"This was a stop on our Hop-On/Hop-off tour. It's worth a look around. Items in the ""flea market' looking shops were typical inexpensive items but a fun stroll. Merchants are very friendly. The jewelry shops abound and carry some interesting pieces.",lenflady
40,Fun for an Afternoon,"It isn't San Francisco or Beijing, and I have been to both, but it is LA's own Chinatown. Had a wonderful time during Chinese New Year this year. Certainly worth a visit.",Nancy E
40,Fun shopping,"My daughter and I went here on Sunday March 10th.The last time we were here was several years ago.They had some great deals on jewelry near the entrance to Chinatown.Necklaces were $5 and bracelets were $8. We didn't go into many of the shops because it was geared more to ""tourists"".Instead we shopped in the ""alley"" which is like an indoor swap meet with stalls of clothes, shoes, pajamas, plants and purses.Some stalls sell Chinese decorative objects while others sell team sport clothes. You can bargain a little with the shopkeepers.If you wear a shoe size larger than 7 you may have trouble finding your size. We paid $5 to park in a lot on the main street. many of the buildings here were designed by a Hollywood set designer because most of the original buildings are gone.Many movies have filmed here including one of Jackie Chan's.",Default33009
50,"Exciting, Inexpensive, Interesting, FUN","We took a self-guided walking tour of two main streets and a few ""back allay"" shopping areas.Took two hours, although we could easily have stayed longer.Shopping was most exciting. Two grocery/general stores had a great variety of teas, herbs, mushrooms and other food stuffs, as well as tools and kitchen gadgets. Prices were half of what we normally pay.Street vendors sell hats, handbags, clothing and vegetables, both on main streets and on meandering malls. Feels like Hong Kong or Singapore! Great deals. Many nice leather hand bags had no logos so I did not worry about buying Fakes. With a ""What you see is what you get"" mentality, the selection and prices were great.We also stopped at a couple of bakeries for snacks and sweet treats. Delicious, fresh and beautifully decorated.Several stores had giant 20' long banks of drawers of medicinal herbs and such. We did not know enough to take advantage of this, but it was certainly interesting to see.It was a Sunday so there were several areas where musicians were preforming - fun!The entire town was hopping so it felt exciting to walk around.As in any large city, we kept our ""valuables"" close to us. This is the only place in the world I experienced a group ""bump and grab my purse"" some years ago.Some visitors obviously had a tour map in hand, but we found enough to keep us very happy without that.",ExplorerMundi

40,"Crowded, full of colour and smells","I love China Towns and LA\s offers plenty of variety. There are indoor malls crowded with vendors and merchandise that you have to maneuver around to avoid collision.

30,Gallery night-so fun,"Come in the day- come at night. Nothing is quite as quirky charming as this relic of how the LA City council wanted the rest of the population to view the ""fascinating orientals"" that lived in this film-set of playground.(The original Chinatown was demolished to make Union Station and to break the Chinese gangs.)Fun shops, great galleries and Hop Luey 's to wash it all down!",Vacannes

30,Definitely Worth a Visit - Definitely Not What is Used to Be,"No trip to LA would be complete without a trip to China Town and Olivera Street. Fortunately, they are only a few blocks apart allowing you to do them both in one day (or even 1/2 day) I still think a MUST do for visitors. Very interesting historical architecture, tons of souvenir shops, still some fantastic and authentic restaurants to make this very worthwhile. There is also lots of local shops (meat, grocery, medicine, etc.) serving the local Chinese community that are extremely interesting to see from a cultural perspective. Chinatown has grown a little tired though. Much of the immigrant population has spread around SoCal depressing the opportunity for the local business to grow and invest. It just feels like ""it used to be . . ."" Still worth a visit though!!",David K

40,Good place to buy cheap Chinese decorations,"I used to go here often during college years to shop for decorative items because I was on the decoration committee for the Annual Lunar New Year Festival at UCLA. There are many stores selling typical Chinese decorations, indoor plants, charms, dry herbs, Chinese medicine, markets, etc. Street parking is as painful as most of the places you'll encounter near downtown LA proximity. Or there are also paid parking lots if you decide to stay there for long. You'll also find some dim sum restaurants (most of which are so so in taste for me, nothing very outstanding). There are some area that are uncleaned with trash and stinking drainage (though that seems to be normal comparing to other Chinatown locations I've been to: San Francisco, New York, Boston, Sydney, and Singapore). All in all, I would recommend a visit if you live within the distance from it and like to spend a weekend to shop around for random things and/or taste some Chinese food.",Hanley L
30,fun,it was my first time coming to LA. Chinatown was on my list of must sees. my first impression was wow pretty big but so dirty! i felt safe walking the streets no one came up to me asking for money like they do in Chicago. we didn't eat there were kinda turned off by how unclean some of the places looked. i got very excited walking through the shops looking at all the cheap souvenirs and knock offs. the older lady vendors are very pushy and aggressive! i stopped to look at some keychains and she kept trying to get me to buy some other things in her store lol. she told me i give you the good deal no one give you cheap like me lol. i found it very funny and endearing because they kinda remind me of my aunts (i'm asian btw) i wanted to get a lot more stuff but ran out of cash. there aren't that many places there that accepts plastic. i had so much fun and will stop by again the next time I come to LA,Donna K
50,See it with the Naked Eye,"You've no doubt seen LA's Chinatown as a backdrop for at least one scene in many movies, so it's only natural that you head over and see it for yourself. There's a Gold Line lightrail exit (yes, if you stay in Hollywood, you can take the train all the way there) right in the neighborhood, and if you don't like Chinese food, Phillipe's, The Original French Dip location (seriously, it was invented here) is right at Alameda and Ord.",cbucka
50,Interesting to visit,On the weekends it can get busy but sometimes it is like a ghost town. I rated excellent only because it is worth going.

30,Chinatown of the past,"I love to go to Chinatown for a specific restaurant, but otherwise it has little or no flavor such as the Chinatowns of NYC and San Francisco.

So, if you're hitting the area, and up for a generous amount of walking, head on up and look around. (Some of the shops have things you can't find anyplace else around town, at least not easily: Chinese herbs, incenses, furniture and small items, etc.)There is a mid-Chinatown stop on the Gold Line train, just one stop away from Union Station.

40,"Chinatown, Los Angeles","I prefer this place better than the one in new york or san francisco.The long street of broadway is piled up with asian vendors and stores. From Feng shui stuff to plants, to herbal medicines. Authentic chinese food and the bbq pork bun. It's a hit and miss on the bakery but the best I've had is still in san diego.San Diego doesn't have a chinatown.Check it out, bring cash always. They take cards but cash is better.",Thomas A
40,Cool place,Very neat place.lots to do. Enjoyed the current culture that was represented there. Will be going again.,Josco
40,fun place,I think it is great shopping down there. We rode the metro and so did not have to worry about parking. I think some great deals are to be had there.,seaduck777
40,Not what expected but.........,"Not what I had pictured in my head but def worth the look if you have time,I did not have a whole lot but enjoyed what I saw and people were very friendly",IBBETSY_11
40,many restaurants and souvineers,"Fun place to walk around, lot's of places to eat, many stores selling stuff from China, it is on the Metro train line so you don't have to park or navigate the funky streets.",carry_0n_traveler
50,"Absolutely a ""Must See"" destination!","Whenever I'm returning to LA from the east, I try to detour into Chinatown, if only to stop and eat at one of the local authentic Chinese restaruants! Having been raised in the middlewest, and having never traveled to China, this area is the most authentic Asian experience I've ever had.... And not only the restaurants - the shops and stores, and all the city sights will make you think you ARE in the orient!",amercorp
20,who cares?,"It is a slow, work-a-day neighborhood. No energy. Neither amusement park nor yup-scale, the attempt to make it a draw fails, even for its residents.",toughnouggies
30,Ran across this by mistake,I liked this place and ran across it by mistake. We were going to have Dim Sum at a nearby restaurant and ran across this Chinatown. I like trinkets etc that they have. I like to see other cultures etc. I enjoyed it!,eyetacs
30,A Piece of LA,"Come here once in a while to get hard to find items, great bargains or a delicious meal. Overall a fun place to be on a lazy afternoon.",vacay2vacay
50,Really cool,Nice little surprise off of downtown LA. Cool diversion for an hour or two...,Michael-and-Jose
40,The coolest town ever,"Am not much of a shopper BUT this place has a really good deal also let's not forget that The chinese food is incredible, we had a wonderful time and an unforgettable experience.",gregor b

30,Wanted more...,"Not much to it, I though it would be bigger and more exciting. The place doesn't impress.",GeB⚓️
40,Fun authentic food,Worth a day visit... fun shopping ... easy to get to and enjoy,562belmont
40,Can't stay away too long from here...,"Chinatown is filled with great culture and delicious food. There are plenty of shops there! While you're in Chinatown, you must dine at Hop Li Seafood Restaurant and order the Squid with Spicy Salty (it may not sound great, but trust me if you like calamari), pick up desert at Won Kok bakery, and have someone in your party buy you a good luck bamboo plant.",Chinadiggydoll
40,Ni Hao!,"It's a fun place to spend the day. Plenty of things to buy at a low price. Definitely take cash. There's art, food and easy to walk.",Jenacostasp
40,"Touristy, but fun","Almost any restaurant here is good, and it's fun to buy cheap trinkets and cotton shoes in the gift shops. Make it a two-culture day: Plaza de la Reina in the morning, lunch at Phillippe's, then browse Chinatown's shops and stay for drinks and dinner.",Phineas55
30,Interesting place to spend an hour or two...,Make sure to go through the Central marketplace. That's where I took the most pictures as it was the most exciting part of the town. Try a dessert from one of the many little bakery shops located in Chinatown or have some authentic Chinese food. There's some shopping that can be done but most stores will all have the same things so don't expect too much variety.,Caroline L
40,Galleries and Culture,A great departure from the usual Saturday night is visiting galleries in Chinatown,DaizyB
40,We're regulars,"Fun places to explore. Great deals in the alleys and we leave with bags full of food, herbs and clothes. Something for everyone. Dragonfruit is great find here as is herbs and foods not just Chinese.",2remem
40,cultural experience worth doing,It's a great little Los Angeles area to visit for locals or visitors. I took my parents when they were in town and they had a great time. The food is fun to try and interesting if you haven't experienced it before.,Puppetgirldotnet
30,"Fun, but not what I expected...","I expected a busy, noisy bustling tourist area, but the place was pretty ""dead"" the afternoon we went. It was dirtier than I expected (and the one public bathroom we found was horrid), but my teenage DD loved the whole experience. If you are looking for cheap souvenirs, this is definitely the place to go.",FriscoBarbie
40,OK,Not as nice as the ones in NY or SF but still worth the trip.,gotarev
40,An interesting way to spend a sunny afternoon.,"If you want to shop for food to bring home, they've got fresh poultry and seafood (as in ... it is alive when you pick it out). There are many many retail shops. Bamboo plants and live turtles are omnipresent. Lots of places to eat. Ocean Restaurant has great dim sum for lunch.",Lotta S
30,Cool!,It was really interesting and I would have liked to spend more time there but everything shuts down and closes up around 5pm. Food was great and prices were awesome!!,Bickerays
30,"Nice architecture, small area","The buildings made me feel like I was in China. There were little shops that sold chinese items. I wasn't hungry so I didn't eat anything. If you have some time to kill, stop by and grab a bite (maybe the food is good). But if you don't have much time, I would skip it!!! It's not very big at all!!! I still prefer New York's chinatown over anything!! However, the architecture here is MUCH better than New York's chinatown!",lullabystar
50,Have a bite !,What a culture difference ! You have to see it when visiting Los Angeles !,Max W
50,LOVE IT!,"If you like Chinese culture and great shopping, this is the place! Anyone can find something. Prices start at $1 and you can wheel and deal.",rowley848
40,CHINATOWN's RICECAKE(Zongzi): cheap and good,"There is an old grany selling a kind of traditional chinese snack-rice cake (in Chinese: ZongZi) at the side of the chinatown closed to the city center. The rice cake is very good and authentic. Originally from mainland China, I did not have such delicated prepared rice cake before. The rice cake contains some smoked pork, peanuts, egg york, and red bean wrapped with stiky rice. There was no fat in the Zongzi. The peanuts are slightly fried before putting into the cake. So it is really delicious! Have a try when you go to China town next time. It costs only $2.",youwinle
40,Not as bad as some claim.,"It's mind boggling as to why there are so many negative reviews on Chinatown. Sure, it may not be the best Chinatown in the world, but it's far from being the worst. Centered around Broadway betw. College and Bernard, there are enough shops, restaurants, and cafes to make a trip worthwhile. The architect of the buildings along Gin Ling Way evokes the charm of a quaint sothern Chinese village. It is also one of L.A.'s best known landmarks, frequently used as a shooting location for many films and TV shows. In spite of all that, naysayers are always looking for something negative to nit-pick over. My response to the reviewer from Chicago complaining about the streets being dirty and how Chicago Chinatown is a million times better: I've been to Chinatown Chicago, and being located in the notorious southside(murder capital, USA), it's no picnic out there I can tell you. And the individual from San Diego: New York more authentic than L.A.s., I think not. There has always been a Chinese community located wthin the same area in L.A. for more than 100 years. FACT: By comparison, most of present day Manhattan Chinatown wasn't even standing when Disneyland celebrated it's 25th anniversary back in 1980. My verdict for L.A. Chinatown: YES!!!!",IchigoKurosaki
40,Trip down Broadway,"My husband and I enjoyed walking along Broadway; there are a lot of little shops that sell little nic-knacks. One side of Broadway has a lot of restaurants and the other side has fruit vendors, jewelry stores and the smaller retail stores. We tried the restaurant called Hop Woo Seafood Restaurant. We were not pleased with the pork and duck platter, but we had a cod platter with lemon and sesame sauce that was decent. We also tried the dumpling appetizer and it was ok. We wouldn't go back though because the service was very poor.We walked a little further down Broadway and found a nice little shopping center that had a small fountain, perfecting for relaxing. Even further up Broadway is the Phoenix Bakery. The bakery is definitely worth a visit. They are very busy, but delicious Almond Cookies, Sugar Butterflies and Strawberry Cake. They also make very good Mochi Ice-Cream; we tried the green tea and strawberry flavors. I liked both, but my husband only liked the strawberry.I would definitely recommend finding somewhere to park and walking. We paid $4 for all-day parking. (Not bad for LA) Definitely will be going back to the Phoenix Bakery, everything was wonderful and they had great service.",LuisAngie05
50,Enormously Film Noir,"Right, so it doesn't have the beauty of San Francisco's or the cozy fit of London's, but it's got a dark, sexy vibe all it's own - right out of Raymond Chandler and Roman Polanski. Most of the best restaurants (Yang Chow, The Empress) are open lunch through dinner. And some are open all night. Best on a cool weekday afternoon. Walk up Broadway when the Chinese grocer sells fresh fruit. Have lunch. Browse the upper echelons of the art biz in the gallery scene along Chung King Rd. Between there and Gin Ling way you'll find old antique shops and young designer shops. By then the Mountain Bar will be opening; enjoy a strong drink and the chic opium-den decor; there's usually a dj and live painting. If not, the Grand View is a stone's throw away and the jazz is Felliniesque-Goth! Also, there's the Chinatown-based monthly synth party M/R/X-Wolfpak.There’s something about L.A., and Chinatown in particular, that seems to suggest possibilities outside of one’s normal line of thinking.",GeorgyLA
10,yuck!,"We expected something amazing since we'd heard all about LA's big Chinatown and everything. We got there and all we saw were dirty, littered sidewalks and homeless people sleeping on the ground. There were some stores, but they were closed. The whole section of the city just looked run down and not very authentic. We ate at a restaurant off an open-air market...one of the teens became very ill afterwards and we were very close to having to suspend touring for a couple of days.Alright, so we're from Chicago. Our Chinatown is a million times nicer than this one, so if you're looking for a nice Chinatown, your bet is basically any big city but LA. Chicago and NYC. But on your trip to LA, leave Chinatown OUT of the agenda and spend some extra time at the nearby Olvera Street instead.",thetravelin3
20,"Go early, or not worth it...maybe not worth it early.","My wife and I went tonight (on a Friday night at 7:15), and practically every shop was closed. Then we looked around for a place to eat, and we passed about 8 restaurants before we found one with an ""A"" rating. Everywhere else that we saw had a ""B."" Fortunately the metered parking on the street doesn't require feeding after 4pm, so we parked for free. We would have been mad if we'd paid and then everything was closed. This was our first time there. We live here and had never been, and we're probably not going back. Good luck to you if you go.",servant4life
30,"Alright if you want ""fake"" Chinese stuff..","I'd say this is average, having been to several large Chinese communities, Chinatown is much more geared towards the ""tourist"" types than those who want to visit a more authentic Chinese community (which can be found in Cerritos, Alhambra, Rowland Heights etc). That being said, Chinatown LA does have some thing to offer- knick knacks, imitation swords (do not buy stuff here), a market, and a couple of chinese temples.. but I think there are other places in LA that beat this one (such as Hsi Lai temple in Rowland Heights) or a visit to Garvey and Atlantic blvd in Monterey Park.. There is some history associated with this Chinatown, but you have to read it in a book, you won't find it on the street.",SunWukong
50,Take the Gold Line and explore,"For a Chinatown, L.A.' s is pretty well-scrubbed- not a bad thing. I recommend taking the Gold Line trolley to get there. The area is very pedestrian-friendly, with historic restaruants like Phillipe The Original, Ocean Seafood (the best in my opinon) and myriad others to try. There are at least three huge indoor shopping plazas with great bargains on clothing, furniture and tourist knick-knacks. Dynasty Center, The Shops are a couple that come to mind.You are also just a train stop away from magnificent Union Station and Olvera Street. Don't believe the naysayers: L.A. is more rapid-transit friendly than you would think, and these dense downtown districts are best seen on foot. In fact, old downtown was laid out with streetcars in mind, not cars. There are lots of great sights to see.",NicktheAngelino
30,There Are Better Chinatowns,"I've been to the Chinatown in Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle, in addition to the one in L.A. Of the five cities, I like L.A.'s least of all. Chinatown in L.A. is too much like Los Angeles in general----defined by the automobile. The neighborhood is sliced up north-south by wide, busy arterial streets that make you feel, as a pedestrian, that each block is an island separated from the next by a dangerous channel. I have no idea which city's Chinatown has the largest Asian population, the best restaurants or the most shops, but, going strictly by my own subjective sense of what a Chinatown should LOOK like, L.A.'s seemed the least exotic. When I think of a Chinese city, I visualize a metropolis that's a warren, a maze-like grid of crooked, congested, dirty, tenement-lined streets. ( I admit I've never actually been to China, my mental images of the place are all from old Hollywood movies.) In this respect, however, Boston and New York feel more ""authentic"" than L.A. Seattle and San Francisco's Chinatowns may have the same rectilinear layout as L.A.'s, but at least they're not on busy feeder streets leading to and from a freeway.",booradley2
50,Don't miss Chinatown!,"I love Chinatown and go there often. Give yourself an afternoon to wander in and out of the maze of shops. Everyone is friendly and it's a great atmosphere, and kids love it, because if they have $5 in their pocket they can go home with a bunch of treasures. You can get great gifts such as beautiful robes and pajamas for men and women for ridiculous prices. Also, check out the many shops which sell gorgeous and cheap pottery. When you get hungry eat at Yang Chow and be sure to have the slippery shrimp, an LA tradition. If you don't feel like Chinese food, walk two blocks down to Phillipe's, a local landmark since 1908, for a French dip sandwich. All in all a great day trip.",SportsFan59
50,Wonderful!!,"Chinatown was incredible! The shops were amazing and had a lot of weird and nice things to see and buy! There's a nice bakery shop at the very entrance of the main area. Very nice prices on EVERYTHING!! Not to be missed! I will definitely make it a must on my next trip and won't leave it for last like I did, when I had already spent all my vacation money :o(",DCVZLA
50,A Taste of Asia in Downtown Los Angeles,"I live in Los Angeles and always enjoy the atmosphere of China Town. Besides having hundreds of Chinese restaurants from which to choose, there are hundreds of tiny, interesting shops! There are many lovely and unusual gift items imported from China...all at a good price.The main street in Chinatown is Broadway...if you go further North on Broadway, you will find the shops and restaurants have authentic looking Chinese architecture. There are also two large, old wishing well ponds. Oh, for those who love bakeries, Chinatown is full of them!Saigon Plaza is also fun with hundreds of shop vendors located under one large roof (on Broadway).Little Tokyo is more modern than Chinatown, but still interesting. Japanese Village Plaza is an outdoor shopping plaza with Japanese blue tiled roofs and architecture. There are many good Japanese restaurants in Little Tokyo....the Japanese markets are also fun to visit. For those who love Japanese gardens, there are two: one at the New Otani Hotel and one at the Japanese Community Center. If you can only visit one, I recommend the one at the community center.",loveLA
