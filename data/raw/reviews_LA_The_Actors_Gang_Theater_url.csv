50,Something very special,"A “style” of acting so different - sometimes cinematic, sometimes commedia dell’arte with masks, sometimes slapstick comedy, sometimes dealing with the tragic human condition .... always riveting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryeileeno
50,Absolutely Amazing,"My son, twelve, but with the mind of a thirty year old, wife, and myself were blown away! The adaptation was so true to the novel that the stylization of the direction and the actors performances only enhanced Orwell’s themes and messages! The intimacy of the theater and the actors being surrounded by the ever watchful eyes of the audience drove all points home. My family and I say thank you for a wonderful life experience, one that is so poignant and needed now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThisFallenFiction
50,A Gem! Must see!,The 1984’s message being relevant in our times today more than ever. I loved that I finally got to see the beautiful Actors Gang theatre and Tim Robbins live in such an intimate setting to boot! What a rare treat for theatre lovers of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anzulawson
50,Every performance is awesome,I have seen several shows at The Actors' Gang and they have all been terrific. The performers seem to give their all to every performance. I don't know how they do it! 1984 is no exception. The cast is all in and Tim Robbins' performance adds another level of super creepiness to Big Brother even though you hear only his voice in the first half. Love the theater too. Make the effort to check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyr140

50,Best Place ever,"Best actors and plays. Great discovery for my husband and I. Love the space, the location and the people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2726UOannas
50,Powerful message for our times,"Set in the round, with actors supervised and responding to white screens, 1984 packs a wallop. Well directed, and acted. Winston Smith is a believable everyman and the chorus of citizens frequent devolution into simultaneous cacophony is very uncomfortable. An unsettling play; walking out of the theater di not bring relief.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeoffryg
50,"“War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength”","Turn of your Fox News and Netflix and go experience real human emotion with your fellow citizens. Soon it will be illegal. Don’t leave during intermission, the 2nd half heats up and love will be betrayed. Also Andy Dufresne. Big Brother is Watching",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavieMystic88
50,A Venue in the Heart Of Culver City,"A Theater with a heart of Gold, and incredible performances of aspiring actors. All proceeds help students in the Culver City aspire to get a lil taste of professional theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520monicaw
