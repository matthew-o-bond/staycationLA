50,Fun Fun Fun,"The speed zone has been in this area in the last 25 years and served different generation of kids in the area. It outlasted lots of institutions here like the mall dept stores. Well, there are no incidents heard or happened in this area so it is a safe place to visit by families. There are bump cars, speed zone, golf putting for kids and lots of video or interactive games inside.",Ebuc
50,Awesome Experience,This a place to race cars all safe you need to have a driving licence to show before raceing. Its lots of fun and improves your driving ability.,Imran K
30,SpeedZone Los Angeles,"The SpeedZone I give it a average the miniature golf is still fun from time to time,but the Showboat with the Malibu arcades will always reign supreme over this new establishment.The go cart line was way to long maybe SpeedZone needs to remodel like some businesses in the industry.I had fun this place also has american food with music inside from a jukebox.-Anthony",Anthony B
40,Speed Fun at an expense,Went with my kids but both of them due to height restrictions couldn't ride the bigger ones which was more fun speedy and better...... although the younger one enjoyed the small cart but it was not fun for the elder one who was allowed to sit on the men cart next to the driver..... mini golf could be enjoyed with your kids and there is one more ride called as speed zone where the height restrictions are on the lower side...... overall it is a good day to spend but definitely avoid on a holidays as tend to waste time on the queues,Kaptaan
20,Waist of time,"I brought my 10th and 13th girls and the wait in the car race ""Turbo Track"" is so bad. They have more broken down ""go carts"" than the ones in use.Waited about 1 1/2 to ride them.There's mechanics fixing them, but they just jump from car to car and none of the cars get fix. What a disappoinment!!!",Nathalie A
40,Fun place for mini golf and go carts,"This place is fun for family and couples. You have mini golf, an arcade with food, and a choice of go cart tracks. My favorite are the slick track and the eliminator track. The cost can get a little up there if you're not careful because it's a pretty good time. I'm looking forward to taking my husband there. :)",irishsiren32
30,Family fun from out of state family,Took our grandsons there for their bdays. We had lots nd got to see them recording lil woman of LA episode...,Adrienne S
40,summer playground,"Use to be a great place to hang around and play thE different machines where you can exchange your earned points for great gifts, now they just give penny annie gifts, so nit worth playing the machines. The Mini Golf is great and tge race track is awesome though.",Benjamin C
30,Spendy but kids love it,"I took 7 people with me and went with the largest package at around 100 dollars or so. (By the way you need to buy the plastic card for a dollar and there aren't any other options so really it was 101). We took one spin on the turbo track. (Slick track was the only other option everything else was closed.)There weren't very many people in the evening on a weekday but it took maybe at good 30-40 mins or so just to get on. There are 4 lanes of cars to use. But they only used one and they alternated between those in the single driver lanes and those in the multiple person karts. IT basically took forever since we had folks in both lanes. If they just used more than one lane for 3 workers it totally would have been a lot more fun. After just one round we quit and went indoors. Since we had so many young children we asked at the desk if we could buy additional cards and split the remaining cash onto them. She said no. So I became the designated card person and walked around sliding the card for each person. That was fun. As like any other arcade place there were broken machines and refunds needed but that didn't stop the kids from having tons of fun. Games are relatively newer but also cost a fortune. They ranged from 75 cents to 5 bucks. Johnny rockets was also indoors. Nice place, too expensive, save your money and go to mcd's right up the road.",EvaLady
30,Fun to drive,"Place was clean and cars were fun to drive, however, workers are slow. Takes a long time to get through a short line. We bought a package deal to drive course 6 times. We were there from Noon to 5pm and only got to drive 4 times. Finally got tired of waiting and left, gave our 2 other rides to people just coming in door. Cars could be better maintained. On first race, my son's car had trouble keeping running, and I had same problem on our 4th race, which makes the whole race a waste. Many drivers get spun out on turns and need to get pushed back by a worker. This occurs about every 45 seconds on average) And each time it occurs, the race is stopped. I was able to cope with this, but what frustrated me, is instead of the workers staying near these turns that had this problem, is they would run back to the pit. So we waited every time for the worker to run out, push car, then run back, before race was restarted. So much time could have been saved it they had just one worker stay near the one corner that 80% of the wipeouts occurred at. It's not just the driver's of cars that deal with this delay, but everyone standing in line for next races. These are gas engines and had just enough power to make it fun (when they are running properly). However, if I had to do it again, I would go somewhere else where they have electric cars, which are less prone to problems.",Dale T
40,Expensive But Entertaining,"SpeedZone has always been one of my daughter's favorite places, especially with Curry House right down the street. Yes, it is expensive, like a Dave & Buster's with a NASCAR theme, but the games are unique. I have only seen Dead Storm Pirates at a Chuck E. Cheese in Fallbrook, and that is always crowded because it only costs a quarter for each level. At SpeedZone, it is a dollar, which might explain virtually no lines.Outside is where the main attractions are: go-kart tracks, drag racing with nitrous, and a miniature golf course. Each attraction is designed for competition, and you can't help but become excited at the prospect of driving against total strangers.Drag racing is incredibly fun. The only place I know where you can cut loose in a 300 horsepower mini drag racer, complete with Christmas tree countdown. Brutally harsh and loud, but blistering speeds on a short track. Just stomp on the gas and go without worrying about losing control (each car is slotted into the track with a metal channel).Overall, I recommend SpeedZone for hilarious (but expensive) fun!",LeeTrotman
30,"Great racing, poor management","Speedzone has some incredibly fun racing considering the price. The only racing that can better the dragsters, slick track, and grand prix is on a real racetrack which will run you far more than the $7 fee per attraction offered here. The Turbo Track is pretty much your standard go-kart track which is great for beginners, and the mini-golf and arcade are a nice respite from racing. Unfortunately Speedzone LA is plagued with unmotivated employees (for the most part), and a less than savory clientele. The best way to enjoy this attraction is to go on a weekday in the off-season when crowds are light.",Joel B
40,Variety,"Lots of different arcade games, and a good restaurant and mini golf for the kids. My wife loves some of the arcade games and the gifts you exchange from your ticket winnings.",Ben928
40,"Fun,Fun,Fun!",This is a great place to have a great time! But maybe need security at night to keep the riff raff from ruining a good thing.,Joseph G
30,Great as long as you avoid peak times,"We went there for Father's day, really bad idea! During one 3 hour period I got on just 3 rides. The karts and dragsters were plagued with breakdowns and the lack of staff also added to the long wait times. On the plus side, the rides are great, especially the dragsters and the slick track. Next time I go there it'll be during the week.",britladd
30,Love the park.but need of a Security in parking lot!!,"On 6/14/2014 i visit the park around 6:30pm to 11:30 pm and when i got back to my car ""long black ESCALADE "" parked by the race track side faci g the street someone broke in and stoled my back seat n my purse. If someone was there around the same time and saw some thing please contact the park . They are looking into this.People like this really need to get locked up. The police is involved and you will be caught!! I enjoyed the time at the park.but i would be afraid to ever go back. Parking lot security is a MUST! PLEASE HELP ME . ALL MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS WERE IN MY PURSE""LIGHT BROWN TOTE COACH PURSE.. PLEASE HELP ME :( please!!",1nana123
50,Speedzone is the place to go!,I love going here with my friends. It's a lot of fun getting to race friends together at high speed. I can literally stay here all day. I highly recommend this place.,Ka T
40,Great time!,"Great fun racing the cars. I would recommend this location on your visit to City of Industry. The food is normal type fast/fried food, but good nonetheless as you come here for the racing probably not the culinary experience. Go race and have fun!",ckckckckckck
20,Price is too steep.,"This place is pricey for little attraction.might as well just drive an hour or two to get to the bigger amusement/theme parks for the SAME price, that is if you want to be practical.",blahfromcalifornia
