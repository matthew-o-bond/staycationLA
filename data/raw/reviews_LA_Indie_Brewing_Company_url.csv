50,The Ultimate LA experience,"You've got to go here, it is the best kept secret in the Arts district. The staff, vendors, and people that go there are always super friendly and nice. There beers are top-notch with unique combinations you can't find elsewhere. The owners seem to be always present and are super passionate about their beers. One of my favorite things are the vendors they bring in for events and on certain days. The food is always amazing, like these huge pretzels, barbecue ribs, tacos, and coffees. I think this is the best place to experience everything LA has to offer. It's still young and I'm so excited for what it will become for the community. Such a cool spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannabY4995RJ
40,Very Much Worthy!,"While the space is not overwhelming, it does have a great warehouse vibe and a feel of space and peace. Staff were fantastic. But it is the beer that brings you in!........all the beer we tried was fantastic, creative, and unique. This place is moving up on the craft beer scene. You really ought to go check them out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithl304
