50,Very nostalgic,"Me and my partner (both in our 20s) wanted to visit a drive-in theatre for the nostalgia. This long running theatre was great! The film started on time, was a clear picture and we left very happy",remmulp91
50,AWESOME Wish we had these in England!,"We had a fantastic night here at the Paramount Drive in. Great American experience, good snacks, great picture quality and radio sound worked well.Just remember the saying...if the car‚Äôs a rocking, don‚Äôt come knocking!!",Noel A
50,Nostalgic fun at its finest,"My friend from out-of-state came to visit me in LA for the weekend and one of the things on his ""bucket list"" was to see a drive-in movie. I saw that the Paramount Drive-In wasn't terribly far away (and was playing a decent horror movie) so we decided to go on a Friday night.In short, it was amazing! It was so fun and everything was ran very smoothly. The movie started on-time and it was great to see that the drive-in (which has a huge lot) was nearly completely full on a Friday night. The drive-in has ""ridges"" on the parking spaces so that everyone gets an equally elevated view of the screen. We saw a wide variety of people - friends, families, couples - and it was very easy to both enter and leave.Here are some of my big tips/takeaways from my experience at the drive-in:‚óè BRING your own food! There's an old-timey restaurant at the drive-in (it's cute and has '80s arcade games in it) but the food is very overpriced and the menu is limited (a most-likely microwaved cheese pizza and popcorn are the main staples). The attendants don't check your car so as long as you don't have the food in plain sight, you will be fine!‚óè BRING your own portable radio! I bought a cheap one off Amazon the day before and it was a life saver. Paramount plays their movies' audio through FM radio stations, and if you want to avoid keeping your car on and letting the battery run low, a portable radio is a fantastic option.‚óè GET to the drive-in around an hour early (although this somewhat depends on the movie/time). You can't buy tickets in advance/online, and we were seeing a Friday 8:30pm showing of a new horror movie, so we arrived around 7:30pm. It was a perfect time to stake out a spot (we were still, by no means, the first ones there).‚óè BE aware that if you see a ""darkly-lit"" film (these tend to be horror films), it can be a little difficult to see them on the screen just due to lighting. The attendants are very good/transparent about this and told us at the ""gate"" (where you buy tickets); you have the option to turn around if this bothers you. For us, and the rest of the people there, it didn't bother us!",Ciara
50,Teary-eyed,"I was blown away when I learned that this drive-in was still in existence as I was under the impression that there were no drive-ins operating. As a teen I lived fairly close to this drive-in and I remember trips with a car load of teens hiding in the back, going in for free.I took my youngest daughter, who is 21 and had never been to a drive-in, and she was just as excited as I was. On weekends they show three movies, and on weekdays two. There are two screens in the lot, and depending what movies you want to watch you to one or the other. Tickets are $10 per person, which I found to be extremely reasonable.Like another poster wrote, long gone are the days where you had a post and speakers. Now, you tune in from your car radio, but I'm still not sure how that works. I was greatly concern that my car battery was going to die if I did that. Fortunately, there were many movie goers who had set up big speakers and we were able to hear perfectly without having to use our car radio.The best part about this ""new"" experience is that, contrary to years gone by where you watched the movie from within the confines of your car, now you can pull out your chairs and watch the movie under the stars. It was awesome seeing families sitting outside spending quality time. My daughter loved it, I loved it, and we're going back when they show other movies.As of right now they're showing Despicable Me 3, Cars 3, Wonder Woman, and the new Spiderman movie. We watched Despicable Me 3, and were ready to watch Cars 3, but had to leave before it started.We will return.",Nereida
50,That place is awesome!,"I haven't done it but I've seen people grilling thereüòÇ. It's awesome! My kids love it , especially on summer nights! We take our truck and bring blankets and pillows and reverse the truck and just sit on the back and run some extra chairs.",Gomezfamily2003
50,It was awsome,"The place is nearby and it's definately a trip down memory lane. They are organized and the movies play promptly, the concesi√≥n has pizza besides other movie food, and you can also bring your own. You pay per person but it's definately an experience.",Sandra S
40,Movie night,Oh how romantic to sit out and enjoy a movie in the comfort of your own vehicle sounds so cheesy but the truth is its very how can I say homey haha,lissasanrs
40,Memory lane,"The last time I have been to a drive in move I was in my teens. Can't believe there is still one around. Gone is the pole with a speaker that you place next your car window. Just turn the dial of your radio to 90.1 station and you get surround sound. Now, I took my 2 young grandkids and introduced them to this place. They were so excited when I told them we are going to watch a movie but won't have to leave the car. We bought chips and drinks even if the place has it's own restaurant. Yup! They sell real food unlike the regular movie houses. The kids were in their PJs and took their pillows and blankets in the car. There are 2 big screens and each one shows 2 movies one after the other. This is the place to be during hot summer nights. some people brought folding beach chairs and place it infront of their vehicles. Great family outing. We are anticipating another trip to this place..",Maria2628
40,Nostalgia,Had an awesome time watching the jungle book at this drive in theatre. Some of the scenes were a bit dark on the screen which made them difficult to see but apart from that the whole experience was great!,lisalamb6
50,Perfect memory maker...,"Well I had some free time after working all day on a literary project, so decided to catch a late show, but none of the local theatres' viewing times had anything I wanted to see. Enter The Paramount for a fun option. I arrived right before the 2nd show, so poked around the snack bar and video game selection. I was all at once awash in memories of fun childhood trips to both the arcade as well as my beloved fav the institute that is the iconic drive in theatre. What a lasting treasure I hope lasts for generations to come.",TiffMateas
50,Gem of a find!,"I can't freakin believe it! So, my hubby and I were talking about the good ole days and drive in theatres when I decided to look it up. I wanted to see if any still existed in Southern California, as from what I can remember, all had closed down. Sure enough, I stumbled upon this place. It was a short drive there to discover that I would describe as a gem of a find. They have 2 screens. It is $9 each person in the car and they play 2 movies on the weekdays and 3 on the weekends. It is actually clean, safe and great to have a drive in in So Cal again. I highly recommend this place. I will go here any day before going to a regular theatre any more.",LBCSQUID
