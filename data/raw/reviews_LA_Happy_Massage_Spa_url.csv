50,New for Date Night,"Yes, they offer a discount for a good review but I'm not accepting it nor have they asked me to write one.I just tried this new place today and was very pleased. It's very quiet which is a relief from the noisy place I've been going to. I spoiled myself with the full body, one hour and it was very needed and relaxing. My wife and I will definitely put this on our date night list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasoncI6501XN
30,Watch out,"Bought some gift cards for girlfriend for her birthday . Come time to use , said new owner , did not want to honor gift card ! Acted like they did not understand it was their problem and not my girlfriends ! Tried to short her on the card for part of amount and wanted a cash tip , are you serious ? What kind of business are you running ? Girlfriend on massage bed with only a towel , massage girl opened curtain to deal with a male client and did not close curtain . Let this guy stare at her like she was on display . Massage was good , but treatment and how they tried to jip her is unacceptable ! Be aware when you go here !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bunky-68
