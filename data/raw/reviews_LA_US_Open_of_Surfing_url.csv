50,Great event,"Surf, skate and BMX bike competition next to the Huntington Beach Pier. Tons and tons of people attend. The stands and the beach are packed. Parking is tough. The earlier you arrive the better chances of getting parking. Lots of food options nearby with Pacific city close by. Great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davenylas
50,Great Place for anyone,This was one of the best parts of our trip. The waves at high tide are amazing. There were a lot of people but not uncomfortably crowed. Tons of great restaurants and shopping. Very comfortable and safe feeling for families. Crowd was mostly in 20s or 30s. Couldn't believe the surfing! Very fun atmosphere but relaxing at the same time. Some extreme partying at night but quickly taken care of. Note - some girls should NOT wear thong bathing suits!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieanndurkin
50,A Must Visit,"I have been coming to this event for years and I have to say it is the opposite of many events you will go to.Yes there is merch and lots of it to buy.But for the most part this event is all about family, fun and surfing.If you like sitting on a beach with thousands of other people, polite people, getting some sun, listening to banter and some cool tunes then this is for you.And for 2 hours Mr. Van Doren of VANS gives away hotdogs for free!Fun and sun and worth it.Now be warned on the weekends the numbers swell as the final heats wrap and it can be packed.I recommend the week for less crowd and as much fun.As the event progresses through the week more things open up and it does start as early as 7:30am and end as late as 5:30pm so there is time there to come early or late.Best part, has to be the commentary.Today the line of the day was a button own shirt while wearing board shorts is a roll of the dice!The colour commentary is excellent, local and 100% entertaining!You need to get to the Vans US Open of Surfing once in a decade!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8319IAjamesp
