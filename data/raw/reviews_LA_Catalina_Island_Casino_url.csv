50,Excellent tour!,I went along with the group. But wow is a tour worth it of the casino. Amazing history and it‚Äôs really fun to see where some of the LA HIGH LIFE crowd have partied over the years. I believe they have had after Oscar parties here for years! Now there is a bucket list adventure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laneemarie
50,Fun tour and a very cool building,We did a last minute tour here and it was one of the highlights of our day on the island. The building is a must see with a cool theater and ballroom upstairs.

50,"It's not a Casino, it's a Casino","This beautiful building full of US and Catalina history is a theater and a ballroom. We really enjoyed the tour and harbor views from the top. I learned that this is not a place to gamble, the word was Italian for place of entertainment. Who Knew?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlad976
40,Day tour to Catalina Island,"Beautiful island, especially the Casino. My advice is to reach there early in the morning so that you have enough time to explore the interiors, which we did not have time to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weexplorers
50,Fun visit and historical tour,"The ‚Äúcasino‚Äù is really a beautiful historical theater and dance hall, just amazing and worth a quick tour. We had Franky as our guide, he was adorable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mayamrsG
40,Historical amazing property,Feels like ghosts of big band eras are still roaming the ballroom. Fabulous facility that is totally underused.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4SIGHT

50,Great Tour of the Casino,We did the Discover the Casino tour and had a great time seeing the theatre and ballroom. Amazing decor and a great guide in Phil.Would definitely recommend if you have time - 50 minutes in AM or PM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosco1957
40,An Unusual Building,"This building on one end of the bay is not a casino but a cinema and theatre. This has been the focal point of Catalina island since it opened in the late 1920's. This has been the venue of great entertainers, live theatre productions and films. This building having been lovingly restored typifies the Art Deco style and is a glorious reminder of Catalina's past where so many film stars had holiday homes or used to frequently visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GordonW318
40,Amazing Tour,The $20 tour is well worth the price. Amazing architecture and great stories from Frankie from Avalon! The only downside was that they stopped showing movies there just 2 days before our arrival!! I hope they bring them back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366kellim
40,Worth a visit,"This 45-minute tour (""Discover the Casino"") is not cheap at $19.95 plus tax, but the casino is definitely worth a visit. My wife and I enjoyed a tour with Frankie of Avalon. While we thought Frankie was initially too repetitive on the point of taking pictures right away and not wandering away from the group (""We'll leave you, and there's no way out . . .""), he was knowledgeable and humorous. This is a very educational tour, and we learned A LOT. Frankie even provided ballroom dancing lessons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GradingMachine
40,Toured the Casino,"Enjoyed an hour-long tour of the Casino. Learned its history, including who built it and why; the famous people associated with it; and the architectural and acoustical basics about the place. Had a nice view of Avalon Harbor from the top floor. Frankie, our guide, knew enough stories to keep us entertained. Tour was late getting started but Frankie made up for the lost time. Enjoyed the back stage and behind the scenes access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shiredweller50

50,Great behind the Scenes Tour,We went with a small party of 4 behind the scenes of the Catalina Island Casino. It was very interesting to see and hear about the construction and decoration of this iconic building. Paul did a great job showing us around and telling us lots of anecdotes about both the theatre and the dance hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kandi75
50,Cold but worth it,"We visited in the rain and even then it was cool and fun to see. If you aren‚Äôt seeing a movie, and just want to see the casino (no gambling casino), you have to either book a tour in person at the Casino and wait to go inside (all other doors are locked until the tours ends). Or maybe book online in advance. Tour guides can be weird, so be warned. Frankie is eccentric, likes to talk about ‚Äúladies‚Äù and ‚Äúdancing with ladies‚Äù. Other than that, very cool place to see and walk around. The history is very interesting and the architecture just as rich as Hearst castle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GriffinC894
50,Casino,"Don‚Äôt expect to game, this is a wonderful theatre and huge ballroom with wooden floor, and the guide was very interesting and funny. Great moment to discover the history of Catalina Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunow712
50,Amazing Dancefloor,"We took the tour of this casino, which means gathering place in Italian. It had a 1/2 acre dance floor and large theatre. The history of this place and art deco design made it a must-see on Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnniversaryVoyager
50,Don't miss this! The history is amazing.,The highlight of our visit to Catalina Island was the tour of the Casino. Everyone should get a chance to whisper in the theater which is said to have perfect acoustics. Stepping onto the wood floor of the round ballroom almost gives you the shivers thinking about all the people who danced there and bands that played in it. Next time we will do the even longer tour. We loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460crisw
50,Beautiful historical building!,"Beautiful historical building! Loved the basic Casino tour with Tony ""from Avalon"" when we go back will do the ""behind the scenes"" tour to see more of the building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129jeannab

50,behind the scene casino tour,"The behind the scene casino tour was well worth it. So many interesting things your learn and see. It is really amazing - the whole story how it was built, what is was and is used for. The tour guides are so knowledgeable of facts of Catalina. Food tour was first favorite, behiond the scene casino tour was second",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jl4man2019
40,Lobster Trap,Good place for beers & sea food. Clams are delicious. Food is good.Not a complaint but tv‚Äôs could be in better spots. Lots of blocked views by walls that don‚Äôt go to the ceiling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces28564628827
40,Back in Time,"We caught the new Lion King movie in this wonderful theater in the main level of the casino, which was built in 1929. The large 1000+ seat theater was a great venue to view the movie. Experiencing it with a large audience and hearing their reaction made it all the more enjoyable. The murals on the walls are fantastic both inside and outside the theater. We‚Äôre able to walk to the theater from our hotel in the heart of town.This building was built before accessibility for the disabled was important so there are some challenges for those in a wheelchair. For example I did not see any special seating area, although I did not look, and there was a step in the men‚Äôs room which would require assistance for someone in a wheelchair.However, I highly recommend visiting this place on your visit to Catalina. The senior rate for tickets was $13. Not sure of any of the prices or how this would change for other films.My one regret is that we did not take a tour of the upper level of the building, which is the large dance floor area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcc55-sd
50,OUR FRIENDS MADE US GO!,"There was so much beach and fun to experience and we were only there for three days, two nights. We didn't think we wanted to take the Casino tour.....but our friends, JaneO and Bill made us. And we are so glad they did! The gentleman that gave the tour arrived on Catalina Island in 1958 and graduated from high school there. The stories he could tell about the Casino, the big bands, the big names and how he could dance and had all ages on the tour dancing with him. Thank you Catalina for preserving the magnificent building, the art deco tiles, the 22 carat gold embossing and art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohcherryoh
50,impressive,"we didn't have enough time to join a guided tour of the building, but even the exterior of the building promises very interesting landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bestsZagreb
50,Wow! The Casino tour was great!,We got free tickets to see the ‚ÄùDiscover the Casino‚Äù 40 min tour through our Helicopter and Hotel package at the Pavilion Hotel. I‚Äôm SO GLAD WE WENT! We had no idea the history and that the Casino is still in working condition! The lower level is a stunning Movie theatre ( a different movie is shown once a week) and the top is the largest circular Ballroom in the world! Highly recommend this informative tour! You have to see the interiors for yourself and the view from the Ballroom Balcony up 12 stories looking out onto the Avalon Harbor is breathtaking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_TopCow
50,Great visit,Joe - the tour guide- showed us an behind the scene tour at the Casino. Good job. Absolutely worthwhile talking the time to visit this building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svogel-001
50,Do not miss the Catalina Island Casino Tour!,"This tour takes you back to the old days of Catalina Island and her Hollywood guests. The history of the casino is fascinating, with a theater that boasts perfect acoustics and a location that offers gorgeous views of the bay. I learned that the term ""Casino"" means gathering place in Italian, so there was never gambling there. Our guide, Rebecca, was fantastic. Ask for her if you can....and boy, can she sing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessieMom
50,Excellent tour,My husband and I went on this tour having never been. It was so very interesting. Frankie was so much fun. He's been on the island since the 50's so he has a boat load of info to share. He also taught me to ballroom dance in 30 seconds. Lol! We highly recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singingdeb2016
30,Didn't get to go inside...,...but the architecture and history are interesting. Pretty murals at the entry. You can't go inside anymore except when there's an event for which you have a ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caliartist
40,The Casino is not what you think it is....,"As the title says, the Casino is not what you think it is, we thought is was where people went to gamble. According to our guide, not true. there has never been any gambling is the building.If you are going to do a Casino tour, I would recommend the one that is called, Behind the Scenes Tour. Definitely worth the 90 minutes.Lastly, but important was Frankie, our tour guide who was funny and knowledge and kept the tour very informative and light hearted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435seanc
50,4th of July Vacation,"My family rented a home in Avalon, Ca for the week of 4th of July. We were happy to hear playing at the movie theater in the beautiful Casino theater was Spider-Man a new movie that just came out!So nice to view the beautiful art and decor inside.The screen seemed out dated. The quality was not worth the cost of the movie ticket. There were huge imperfections on the screen. Sad to see this. Have been to this theater many times. It was never like this. This was my husband's first time to the island and theater. They made some upgrades to the food and drinks. But the money needs to go to the picture quality. It's a movie theater in a beautiful room. The sound only seemed to come from the front. Sounded strange. Again in this big round room I am sure there is a way to have better surround sound.Tuesday is ""discount"" day, $10 and once we arrived we were told it was cash only. After waiting almost an hour before they let us in I was happy I had the correct amount of cash for five people. No were on their website did it say cash only. No signs posted in their ticket windows either. We walked out the day before to make sure Spider-Man was the movie playing for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyM1990
40,Treasure of Catalina Island,"The Catalina Island Casino was never a gambling hall as we would assume, but a world class ballroom and state-of-the art theatre. The name came from the Italian definition which means gathering place. Our tour guide who grew up on the island and used to dive for clubs in the 50‚Äôs, was lively, passionate and truly engaging. The building is art deco and worth seeing for the interiors and the views from the ballroom. The Casino is used for special events, but I believe they are missing an opportunity to use it and the theatre which the technology for sound was so innovative, the creators of Radio City Music Hall adapted it. Well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdinonno
10,NON-CASINO CASINO,There is no gambling or anything else at this casino. They have occasional shows here. It was a waste of time to walk over to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamn3333
50,Movie fun!,We saw Jumbo at the theater inside the Casino. They have an organist that plays prior to the movie. Very beautiful and a piece of history on the island. You should take a tour of the Casino if you like history....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunloverscatalina
50,Classic,The Casino is an absolute MUST see while in Avalon. Art Deco design and still after all these years a classic. Take the tour. It's memorable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goodness4you

50,Worth your money!,"This was my second time taking the 90 minute tour of the Casino. I went with my boyfriend and we ended up getting the same tour guide I had with my family 2 years ago, Rebecca. You can tell that she loves her job and enjoys every second of it. Such a beautiful building filled with so much history. I would do this tour again in a heartbeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahe_sanders
50,Take the ‚Äúbehind scenes‚Äù tour,"A must see while on Catalina. The theater and ballroom are beyond imagination. Take the ‚ÄúBehind the Scenes‚Äù tour. Tickets are available at the Casino box office, but reserve online if visiting on a weekend to ensure a spot. There is a SCUBA museum on the harbor side of the Casino: very interesting and informative. And in case you are wondering, it is not a Gambling Casino. Look up the meaning of ‚Äòcasino‚Äô in Italian.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomonaAndLyle
50,Twilight Champagne Tour,"Booked the Twilight Tour at the Casino for our last night in Catalina. Started with popcorn and viewing the beautiful theatre, before heading upstairs to the promenade for gorgeous views of the bay and ocean at sunset. Finished in the stunning ballroom with wine, cheese, fruit and dancing to big band videos playing on an enormous screen. Frankie of Avalon (tour guide) was lovely. A lot of fun and our group had all ages, with everyone seeming to enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9893YKlisaw
50,Iconic Structure,We did not have time for the indoor tour but spent some time outside to enjoy the architecture. It is equivalent in height to a thirteen story building and is very beautiful. Next time on the island we will book the formal tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
40,Anniversary cruise,My husband and I were here as one of our port stops of the cruise. We did this tour and this is such a great place that is still in business today. Very detailed art work in the autotorium. We didn‚Äôt get to see the ballroom but hopefully we can go here again to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyY573
40,Catalina Island Tours,"Well organized and well done tours that give you a good overview of Catalina. Some are a bit pricey.Highly recommend the Twilight at the Casino tour. Not only is it interesting with the history but ""Frankie from Avalon"" is a magnificent host and makes guests feel welcome and comfortable. A true gentleman. And he knows that gals yearn to dance so he does his 10 second swing lesson with them and has them floating on clouds in no time. Husbands, boyfriends, and significant others, you will have to step up your game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancb2017
50,Take the Tour!,"The best way to see the Casino is to take the tour... there are three I believe, the standard, the backstage and the nighttime. I took the backstage and thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot about the history of Avalon and was able to take some amazing pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RustyThree
40,A landmark,"A historic building which can be seen from many parts of the island including at sea. It is a casino in name only as it is now a theater, ballroom and tourist spot. Although I didn't have time to take the tour, the building is a one of a kind to see even from the outside.Stunning architecture worth a visit to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,Cool Building with Tons of Character,This is the main landmark for Catalina Island. Cool old historic building with lots of stories to tell. Offer daily tours and even show movies at night sometimes. Worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLars34
50,Beautiful Ballroom,The building is art nuvio in beauty. It can hold up to 500 people for large events. Has a wrap around outside patio. The view is unbelieveable. The movie theater is a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir474199
40,"A casino, but no gambling.","Built by William Wrigley as ""a gathering place"" (casino in Italian) opening in 1929, it is an architectural delight. Take a tour to see the beautiful theater - shows nightly at 7:30 - where the walls are covered in murals depicting early CA in art deco style. If you go on Friday or Saturday night, you can hear music played on the historical Page organ, always ending the mini-concert with ""Avalon"", popularized by Al Jolson. Upstairs is the ballroom, where bands still play as they always have and the huge dance floor has hosted many a gala event. The views from the walk-around balcony are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347carolec
50,Avalon Theater is inside the Catalina Island Casino,We walked around the outside of this eye-catching building while exploring the island. We noticed that there were fliers advertising first run movies at the Avalon Theater. It took me a moment to figure out that the Avalon Theater was inside the Casino. You might want to look up the Avalon Theater on TripAdvisor for better information about the theater itself!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
50,Great art work and an interesting tour.,"This historic structure was built in the 1930‚Äôs and it has been maintained and preserved in excellent condition. We found out the only way to see the movie theater and the artwork is to take a tour, as it is not open to the general public except for movie shows at night and dates when the ship is not in harbor. The tour was very informative and gives one a touch of the island history and the special town this has become. Our tour included one of the first all-electric buses for the island and it rode very comfortably and very quietly. Another option of renting a gasoline golf cart to do a self-tour of the town and immediate island, but you will not be able to tour the Casino unless you take the formal island tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4cents-worth
50,45 minute Casino tour,"I don't often take tours of historic buildings, but this was worth it. Our tour guide, Rebecca, was very knowledgeable and had plenty of stories to add interest (as well as an excellent singing voice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corax1977
50,Magnificent Historical Building Tour,"We booked a 12:45 pm tour and was it ever worth it. We were given wonderful information about the building of this magnificent casino. We found out about the outside entrance murals, ceilings in the foyer, state of the art movie theatre with the organ that still gets played before movies. We sat in the theatre and watched a short filmabout the theatre. We then went upstairs to see the various projectors used over the years. We walked up the large ramps to the top floor to take in the wonderful dance floor. We were thrilled to then go outside on the top floor balcony to take in the great views of Avalon and the bay and island. We had two guides and they did a fantastic job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpatters
50,Behind the scenes casino tour,"Yesterday I visited Catalina Island, I booked the behind the scenes tour (1.25hrs roughly) Joe was our guide of a small group of about 15 people. His knowledge and love of the place was amazing! The way he conducted himself was outstanding and made you want to know more and more with each new part of the casino we explored. Joes knowledge of the artwork and finer details was second to none. I had a wonderful time learning the history of not just the casino but the island and the Wriggly family. An absolute must visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajade08

50,Beauty,What a beautiful place. Worth the trip to get a look into the past. Wrigley really went overboard building this structure. This was part of the island tour we took from our Carnival Cruise Ship. Well worth the price. The theater does not need a P.A. system as the acoustics are perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy6272
50,A beautiful place,A beautiful place and a must see. The building is a fabulous art deco design. The architecture is stunning and unusual. The murals are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passport477074
50,Spectacular edifice,"This grand dame structure has a black walnut interior with gold stars on the ceilinf. Built in 1927, it is the ultimate in luxury.

40,The movie theater and architect of the building was amazing.,It was fun to see a movie in this building. The seats are very close together and not much leg room but the building is wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellem691
50,Beautiful Walk into the Past,"We did not take a tour, but it would probably be a good idea to appreciate the architecture and history of the building. We went into the old, massive movie theater prior to the movie and enjoyed several pieces of music on the 1929 pipe organ. It is definitely worth a walk to this old casino house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retiredandtraveling5
50,Discovery tour,"We had an awesome time touring the casino yesterday. Our guide Steven was super knowledgeable about the casino, the art and era and the history of the casino. It helped that it was like a private tour since it was only me and my wife and we could ask questions and take pictures whenever we wanted. The casino is amazing and has amazing architecture as well as beautiful art work from the 1920‚Äôs era. The theatre in the casino is super cool especially when standing in the very center of the room where it‚Äôs like an echo Chamber. The main floor at the top is a huge dance floor that still has the original wood floors. Great overal tour and highly recommend it. Thanks Steven for an awesome tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142davidh142
40,"Jazz Review at the Casino, Avalon","Saw some poor reviews that is was too loud and could not enjoy it.Here is the secret.

50,New Year's Eve at Avalon's treasure,"We spent another New Year at this gorgeous place....great food, music, service, and decor. Definitely worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaOD
50,Take Frankie‚Äôs tour,"On our previous eight visits to Avalon, we have never been able to line up our schedule with the Casino tour schedule. This time we were lucky twice. We got the tour tickets and we scored ‚ÄúFrankie from Avalon‚Äù as our tour guide. He‚Äôs been living on the island since 1958 and had great stories and knew a lot about the building, the island and the colorful history of both. The theater is mind blowing and Frankie seemed to know everything about the construction and operation of the theater and ballroom. And he‚Äôs a great dancer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanF480
30,Casino is great. Frankie needs help.,"You've got to see the theatre and ballroom if you're in Avalon. But avoid The tour guide named Frankie.Frankie of Avalon is a sweet guy. But he's a horrible guide. Reveals all the spoilers before showing the 10 min video. Extolling his virtues as a swing dancer and dance instructor. Promising to teach any woman to dance in ten seconds and bragging about his dance floor triumphs. He's in his mid-seventies and acts like a lonely egocentric guy for whom tours are a chance to perform, not inform.A worthwhile tour of a place long past its prime by a guide long past his.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTMusings
40,Iconic image of Catalina Island,The most compelling image of Catalina as you pull into the harbor on your vessel is the casino. It's an unusual structure - we didn't go inside but walked around it. Interesting design and fits the unique island that is Catalina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxeFamilyFun
50,Amazing Place,This is a fabulous building. If you don't want to see a show or movie you can pay a minimal fee to go into the theatre and listen to the organ music played before the movie. That was excellent. The theatre has been restored and it is like a walk back in time. Well worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncreid2018

50,Stunning - do the ‚ÄòDiscover the Casino‚Äô tour!!,Not a casino for gambling at all! This most incredibly beautiful building was built in the late 1920s and opened in 1930. Never meant to be a gambling site the word ‚Äòcasino‚Äô means gathering place in Italian. Went on a great 45 minute tour (‚ÄòDiscover the Casino‚Äô) of the highlights of this amazing building. Our guide was great and very knowledgeable. This tour includes the gorgeous ballroom upstairs (which holds the world record for 6200 people dancing!!) and an amazing (you have to see it in person to believe it) theatre downstairs with incredible murals on the sides of this amazing circular building - the largest of its type in the world. Absolutely stunning and very tastefully done. Highly highly recommend! Was a highlight for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaursMelb

You get to see breath taking views.The last stop on the tour was the Catalina Island Casino Ballroom, words cannot describe how BEAUTIFUL this place is and that they show movies here on Friday evenings. I‚Äôd LOVE to sit in that theater to watch a movie and then stroll downtown to enjoy dinner. The water, boats, sunshine and the friendly people that live there make me want visit again. If you have the chance go visit, relax, shop, eat and talk to the shop owners and local people. You will not regret your visit. Bring your camera for some spectacular photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanacoleb

50,The Beautiful Casino That's Not a Casino,"We took a wonderful tour of the Casino; before we came to the island, we thought this iconic building was a gambling establishment based upon the name. Casino means gathering place in Italian, and this dazzling building is just that; the bottom level contains a beautiful art deco movie theater with amazing architecture and lovely hand-painted murals. Interestingly it was created by the same architect that designed the famous Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The upper level contains a grand ballroom that was a gathering place for famous big bands and the upper crust back in the day. You can still see movies in the nearly one hundred year old theater, and there are some nice ocean views from the upper level. Our guide was excellent, and it was wonderful to take a step back in time and learn about the history of this beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanogirl

50,What a iconic landmark!,"This art deco building that was a casino in the roaring 1920s currently has movies at night. However, it's well worth a stroll along the waterfront to view the box office portico with mosaics where you can book a tour of the interior. Also, walk around this structure as you'll find in back a small surfing museum and park benches where you can watch the active bay with Garibaldi fish and divers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Beautiful building and concert on the steps,"We walked around the Casino during the day, it is a beautiful building in a great setting. We went into the theater in the evening.

50,Great place to dive.,"We love Catalina Island to dive at. They provide a dive park at the Casino. There are tanks, wetsuits, snacks there to rent/buy. The first year we came out we didn't know so we brought our own tanks. So much easier renting from the Catalina island Divers.Diving is great. Visibility was awesome this trip, 30-60 ft. We saw a dozen giant black sea Bass, a scorpion fish, and many more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543dawnab

50,An interesting look into the history of Catalina and the glamorous days of Catalina,"The tour includes a look at the movie theatre with old organ used to accompany silent pictures, the old movie projectors, some dressing rooms and the enormous ballroom. The Casino gets its name from the Italian language term casino, meaning a ""gathering place"". There has been no gambling there. In 1929, William Wrigley, Jr. built the lovely building. Movie studio tycoons such as Cecil B. DeMille, Louis B. Mayer, and Samuel Goldwyn frequently came by yacht to the Casino to preview their newest cinema productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly1Esq
50,A unique building back in time that does not have a slot machine,"Despite the title, Casino, it is a 'meeting place' not a gambling place. It is the real deal Art Deco. There is a large movie theatre on the first floor, and the ceiling is fantastic with a 'sky' look to it. Hard to describe, but worth checking out. There are some half-naked mermaids in the tile on the outside of the building, so that might distract your Disney-aged kids, or they might not even notice. I have not been on the upstairs 2nd floor, but told is has a large wooden dance floor. It is a circular building that you will see in almost every photo of Avalon on Catalina Island. And the movies are the most reasonably priced item on the whole island- cheaper than the mainland, and in a great venue. Highly suggested you at least take a tour, or take-in a movie. One of the 3 things that you must do while you're here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnElectron
50,A Step Back in Time,You can almost hear the music of the Big Bands as you enter the Casino. Wonderful art Deco architecture and art work. I highly suggest taking one of the tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianaw580

50,No slots in this beautiful building!,"My husband was interested in the past glory years of this beautiful building. The tour did not disappoint. It is a walking tour, must walk up 7 stories of ramps to get to the top ballroom. The theater is absolutely beautiful and same with the ballroom. If you are looking for some history of Catalina from the Hollywood days, take the tour. I think it ranges around $15.00. I'm glad that we took it for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P656QNjuliec
50,Discover the Casino Tour,We did the 50 minute tour on a Thursday afternoon. Our tour guide was a young guy who was very informative. He knew his information extremely well.

40,Beautiful views along with a bit of history of the island,"We visited on a quiet weekday in July 2018. Two teens and two adults. There's a lot of walking up and down ramps; I believe the guide said it's 10 stories tall. We also got to tour the theatre and hear the acoustics, a little history of the building. The outside panoramic views are worth the walk. Ask for senior citizen or military discounts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F781XHsusanc

10,"The rudest tour guide, EVER","We came upon the casino and saw a tour group leaving the premises. I was curious as I did not see where one could purchase tickets. nor was I sure what this casino was. Well apparently I was not the only one to ever ask a wrong question about the casino because the tour guide started rudely advising me that it was not a gambling casino but a place of gathering. Proceeded to be condescending to me and yelled if I wanted to learn more to buy tickets instead of trying to get free information. I am a firm believer that there is no wrong questions but this man (I cannot call him a gentleman) obviously thought there were wrong questions. We went May 27th and I was so appalled that he would even talk to me like! There were several people around that heard him and even said how rude he was. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I doubt it. Too bad that he was that way. Might have even done the tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCA2012
50,Nice tour. Very interesting history.,"If you go to Avalon, this is the one tourist attraction that is a must-see. The casino (not a gambling casino, but the definition of ""casino"" that means ""gathering place for entertainment"") stands out in Avalon, the most prominent building or feature in the bay. You have to be drawn to it and want to know what it's about.The tour is a great way to find out about this piece of history and the story behind it, get a good look at what's going on inside. It's reasonably priced, about $14 for a 45 minute tour. It's essentially an old movie theater at the bottom (but one of the very first and grandest movie theaters built for the first motion pictures with sound) and a great big ""big band""/ jazz/ swing style ballroom at the top, with a fantastic view of the bay.The entire building was designed with a lot of art deco styles from the jazz era, when it was built. Most of the original art and architecture is preserved wonderfully. The movie theater has an interior dome shaped ceiling designed to perfectly bounce the acoustics so that you can hear clearly from anywhere inside without amplification. They have a very unique old pipe organ in the theater as well, where I believe they occasionally have concerts. The movie theater itself is very much active as well, showing one movie every night.The tour guide does a great job of quickly bringing you up to speed on the history of the place, it's connection with the heyday of L.A. and Hollywood... it's really kind of strange because it's such a relic of a lost time, but yet so well preserved and seemingly untouched that it kind of transports you to another era. Definitely worth $14 and 45 minutes of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6104POcharlesh

50,Frank's tour at the Avalon,"I am a Los Angeles girl and not until today had I seen the inside of the Avalon casino. Breathtaking!! The theater, with Old Hollywood art/curtain/acoustics and twinkling celling stars was a wonderful view of the glamourous days. The ballroom and circular wooden dance floor made me wish I had been born into this world a generation earlier. Frank comes from that perfect elite of tour guides! What luck that we changed on this experience ü§ó.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JungleJt
50,"Come for the movie, marvel at the theater","Prepare to be stunned by the early-20th-century ornateness of the movie theater in this casino. The maritime-themed murals. The intricate lighting, evoking stars in the heavens. Yes, the seats are a stiff throwback and lack modern conveniences like cupholders, but what do you expect when you sit inside a work of art? You may or may not remember the movies you see here, but you will never forget the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690

50,Great behind the scenes tour,"Our tour guide, Rebecca, was entertaining, easy to understand, and knowledgeable about the historic building. The tour explores all of the green rooms, projection rooms, ballroom, and lavish theater built in 1929. She weaves a fascinating story about those times and how the Wrigley family created a vacation destination of Catalina Island. It was like Disneyworld for the 1930s! Highly recommend this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvmal
50,BREATHTAKING,"What a spectacular building inside and outside!

The ‚Äòcinema‚Äô is beautiful, Frankie knows his stuff and is a great tour guide (as well as a lovely gentleman), we had a glass of wine & nibbles in the ballroom and Frankie danced with all the ladies!

50,Gorgeous architecture on a breathtaking Island.,"The Casino on Catalina Island is the ""opera House in Sydney Harbor"" - an icon that everyone recognizes. Beautiful to look at with beautiful views. It's also a theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggleofamily
50,"LOVELY Venue, MUST GO!!","We knew we wanted to go to the Casino for a movie as well as the tour behind the scenes the next day. This place is beautiful & built by William Wrigley the chewing gum magnate. It was the very first talking movie theater in the world. The first visit was at night to see The Black Panther. (WE got tickets from the Avalon Grille for going early to dinner). The acoustics are perfect, we learned about that from the tour we did the next day. They were playing Barry White when we arrived & the ticket taker was a very pleasant fellow who gave us lots of information about the building. The murals on the walls are gorgeous & I love the Venus de Milo on the top near the screen. There is a organ which pipes are covered by ornate grills which is played pre-movie on Friday & Saturday nights. The next day we returned for the tour. Our tour guide is Frankie from Avalon & he's a hoot. You can tell he really enjoys his job & he taught the ladies how to swing, after the tour to the top floor, where the ballroom is. This is a very informative tour which covers all the history as well as the different rooms to see where performers would stay before shows. We also visited the Wrigley suite in the Casino where the Wrigley's would entertain. He gave us lots of information about the walnut wood, the gold leaf, the architect & the painters of the murals. It was a very well planned and informative tour.TIP: If you go to the Catalina Island Museum, which I highly recommend, you get $2.00 off your ticket for the tours of the Casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lexibelle

50,MY LIFETIME,I worked at Catalina Island Casino back in the in the late 90s I did many things there I also worked with a professional team of people where we served many people I worked the Blues Festival the jazz festival multi-million-dollar weddings and saw that people had a great time it changed my life being around people who love people and took care of each other it was part of my lifetime I loved it it was the best job I ever had my entire life I learned a lot about myself and about others doing this in my lifetime helped me know about myself and others and the people that I worked with this job I will never forget in my whole life if you've never experienced anything like this you should it is something you'll never forget I will never forget it as long as I live I would also at Descanso Beach at that time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FREESPIRITEDGYPSYESS
50,A Casino that has no gambling,"The first thing you should know is the Casino is a beautiful building with a theater inside and a ballroom upstairs. The theater is in Art Deco style that features a Wurlitzer ‚ÄúVoice of the Theater‚Äù pipe organ. There are free concerts on Friday and Saturday nights right before the movie starts. The seats are roomy and comfortable and the art work on the ceiling and walls is fantastic. The lobby is paneled in beautiful walnut wood that is virtually knot free and probably worth more than $1,000,000 in today‚Äôs market. The movie is current popular films (we saw Black Panther this past weekend). This is usually a favorite place for us to visit on our trips to the island. The snack bar is less expensive than more modern multiplex theaters but there is only one choice for the film. In addition the film that you go to see is started without 20 minutes of previews of other films. I really like this. There are tours you can take of the building for a fee that give you lots of information about its history and worth doing once. Overall it is almost always on our itinerary when we visit the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksarrett2017
50,Loved the behind the scenes tour!,"This was our first time coming to the island and we‚Äôd heard the casino tour was a must-do. We did the behind the scenes tour and loved it! 90 minutes went by quickly. Rebecca was our fabulous tour guide. She was dynamic, knowledgeable, interesting, ran the tour on time and clearly knew what she was talking about. We learned a lot not only about the fascinating history of the casino, but about the whole island as well. Such fascinating stories! It was easy to imagine what a spectacle it all must have been in its day. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller756288
50,Step back into 20s Art Deco,"Perhaps no other part of the island symbolizes Avalon's interesting history like the Casino - a place that's never housed gambling.I took the 45 minute tour of the Casino and was happy I did. I don't think you can really understand Catalina without knowing something about this beautiful landmark.Built in 1929 for about $2M, by chewing gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr, it holds claim to the first movie theater built specifically for films with sound (""talkies"") which were just taking off at the time. But there's also a magnificent Page organ as well and each weekend there's usually a short organ recital before the usual 7:30 film viewing.The insulation/acoustics are so perfect, movie-goers can't hear the music from the ballroom above them, but every nuance of a film can be heard easily from any seat. Architects of the Radio City Music Hall traveled to Avalon to study the theater's design before building RCMH.On the top floor of the 12-story casino is the world's largest circular-floor ballroom. In it's heyday, the ballroom was host to the best and most popular dance bands and could accommodate up to 3,000 dancers. As with the theater, the acoustics are before their time.Add to all this, art deco architecture, furnishings and original artwork and you really have one of the best preserved examples this genre.Be ready to walk some stairs and ramps. The ramps are necessary to get to the ballroom - Mr. Wrigley used the same concept as the ramps at Wrigley Field in Chicago, as they were more efficient than stairs at moving large crowds.If you're a lover of 20s/30s Americana or just interested in the art and music of the period, this is a must-see facility. It was the center of activity for the island and a technological marvel in architecture and acoustics of its time. Now it's a direct link to an amazing time of growth and prosperity in U.S. history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcpindy
50,A Must See For The Daily Movie!,The Casino has a movie theater with usually only one showing per night (on Friday & Saturday evenings they have an one hour organ playing that should not be missed) The history of the theater is just like taking a step back in time. The theater is very large and ornate. They show first rate movies but only one per week. I wasn't crazy about the movie they had showing at the time but the experience made it worth while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiAnnesInLove
50,History and elegance,"Take the ""insider's tour,"" 90 minutes, to see history - Photos of stars who have appeared there, ""green rooms"" (dressing rooms), a private viewing room, vintage projectors/projection room etc. FASCINATING history delivered by well-versed - and engaging and humorous - docents, and the beauty, artistry and elegance of this wonderful historical building. You can still go to the movies there, and attend dances from time to time plus other events - The venue adds much to these events. On top of that, views from the ballroom level terrace are worth the tour alone. A ""must see"" when in Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsacerdo
50,Beautiful Art Deco treasure,"We signed up for the 11:45 AM tour of the casino and ballroom. Our guide, Frankie from Avalon, was memorable and a gem for knowledge about the island's history, casino's construction and history, and a great ballroom and swing dance teacher. The tour starts outside the Casino and finishes on the upper deck outside the ballroom. The casino theatre is amazing with its red, pink and gold color scheme, elaborate woodwork and plush velvet curtains. The ballroom is enormous! Frankie taught swing to about four women in our group about 30. A fun time! For those with time, there is a combined ticket for the casino and the glass bottom boat. Given the clear water, the boat cruise would have been fun, if only we had the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenB831
50,Quite the landmark and a great tour,The casino is the most prominent visual landmark in Avalon and the behind the scenes tour is well worth it to see the insides of the gorgeous building and learn of its history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapave

50,Unique piece of history,"We had a fabulous tour today with our guide Rebecca. She was knowledgeable and filled with enthusiasm for the building and its history.

50,Iconic Building,"Beautiful architecture and a must see attraction when in Catalina. So much history has happened in this building and when you walk through it you are overcome by its vast greatness. Words can‚Äôt describe its beauty, it is quite a bit of walking but so well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FAA369
50,No gambling here,"This is an absolutely must see! The only way is to take a behind the scenes tour. Ours was about 40 minutes, so I wish it had been at least an hour for the price, but it was still definitely worth! The architecture, art, and history of this place is amazing, and the guy was very informative. Contrary to popular believe, there is no gambling here, but it is rather a gathering place with a Theatre and Grand Ballroom. You can watch a movie every night in the 1929 Theater, the first Theater built for talking films, which also has a beautiful pipe organ. Upstairs, by large ramps, is the magnificent ballroom. It was originally 15,000 ft.¬≤, but after adding some platforms on the sides, it is still a 10,000 square-foot wood floor. They do still have events there and even rent it out for weddings. You can also step out onto the beautiful balcony with great views of the island. Don‚Äôt miss the lovely mermaid mosaic over the ticket booth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7

50,Fabulous Casino Royale,"This grand focal point in the city of Avalon on Catalina Island draws visitors worldwide. The city is a hint of simpler days - with golf carts instead of cars. The casino was built by Wrigley and the name ""casino"" signifies a gathering place - not a gambling venue. The art deco design, murals and opulence of the Casino are captivating. We visited again during the annual JazzTrax jazz festival in October. Perfect time to visit the Casino with many jazz concerts and repeated opportunities to enjoy concerts in the grand ballroom with dancing, food and drinks.The steep ramps to the upper level are difficult for those with mobility concerns. I understand an elevator is on site. This elevator did malfunction causing difficulties for those attending concerts. Of note, children or teens were not at the casino and may not enjoy this venue.History buffs, architects, romantics and jazz aficionados will be wowed by a visit to the casino. Spectacular architecture, romantics walks along the open promenade circling the exterior are enhanced by ocean and Avalon Bay views. At night lights from the mainland are visible. So enchanting and very highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA

50,Old world magic!,"This is truly a special place. The views from above are astounding, the history of the structure is fascinating. I highly recommend the guided ""behind the scene's"" tour.

""casino"" means meeting place.Don't bring young kids, they will be bored.Don't go with anyone who doesn't appreciate this sort of thing.

This gathering place goes back to the 1920s and thru the 1950s had many big bands, hollywood celebs and more. On the dance floor and with the good guide you can imagine yourself at a ball.

40,Nice tour.,"Took the hour long tour. It is a very beautiful building (not the type of casino that has gambling, they explain the real meaning of the word casino on the tour). Good views of the island on top where they stop last and let you take pictures. You sit in the classic theater and watch a short educational movie during the tour and then you sit another time in the ballroom area and the tour guide talks, so you don't have to stand/walk the full hour. There are no stairs, it is all slanted uphill with a rail, which can be easier on the knees than stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebeccora

40,"Movie theater, not gambling casino","While in Avalon, we had to visit the Catalina Island Casino. Since it was my first visit to the island, and I had only heard of the casino, I just assumed it was a gambling casino, but I was wrong. It never was a gambling casino. We didn't have time to take the guided tour, but we did get to see a movie in the historic building. It has a lot of beautiful architecture. They are currently doing some renovating and updating. I am glad we went to the movie, so we could see a little bit of the inside. They show only one movie per week. The city of Avalon closes down very early, so it was about our only option for something to do on the night we were there. It was a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnj98
30,Not a gambling casino,"Did not take the tour as there was not enough time. This is not a gambling casino. They also had a movie theater, with one movie. I think the cost was $15.

The casino was so musty and smelled of mildew that I couldn't stay for more than 30 minutes. When I left I asked if I could give my ticket to someone else since I couldn't stay for the movie and I was told that I could NOT give my ticket to anyone. I ended up throwing my ticket away. If you have breathing problems (asthma, etc) I wouldn't recommend the theater until it gets a deep cleaning. Could see mold/mildew spots on some of the seats. Behind the scenes tour on another day was fabulous - tour guide informative and fun. Just clean the theater!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eflmunday

50,"Gorgeous art deco building, thrilling history","This building is a must-see. Architecturally, the building and its murals are amazing. But the history of it is fascinating too- built specifically to host big-name bands and entertainment coming over from LA and the like. Learn about why Wrigley built this, who frequented it, etc.I took the basic tour - the guide was Rebecca and she brought it alive. She's also an amazing singer so demonstrated the acoustics of the building, which were engineered to be second-to-none (Radio City Music Hall acoustic engineers flew here to study the building so they could replicate it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleK723
50,Fascinating,"We did the Behind the Scene Tour. It was interesting to learn about the history of the building and see the artwork throughout the casino.

50,Full of surprizes.,"My husband and I took the Behind the Scenes 90 min. Tour. We had not expected to do all we did. Frankie was a great tour guide and opened our minds and took us back to the hey day of the Casino. Casino is an Italian word that means ""gathering place,"" so no gambling ever took place here. We had a chance to danceswing in the balroom, actually go on the stage and perform in the huge theater. We went back stage, up stairs down stairs and yes in the ladies chamber room. Great way to enjoy the afernoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugarmillgirl

50,Hollywood Romance,"I have wanted to visit Catalina Island ever since I lived in L.A. in the 1980's, so this was kind of a Bucket List trip. We visited the Casino the afternoon of 6/30/17. I had read about the Wrigley-built dancehall/movie theatre many years ago. It intrigued me. The 1920's and 30's are my favorite era for music and design. We took the basic tour and got to stand on the stage of the theatre and see the dressing rooms and the dance hall. The walking was not as exhausting as I thought it might be after reading all of the warnings they post before you purchase tickets. It is a moderate amount of walking and climbing. (I am 57 and my husband is 61, and we are in just average shape.) I don't think little kids or teens (unless they are theatre-types) would find it very interesting, but for adults who appreciate Art Deco design and historic architecture and the chance to experience how people were entertained 100 years ago, this was a fascinating tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332Gail
50,"Fantastic and Iconic Destination, a Must-See!","This iconic landmark is recognizable all over as Catalina's signature. It is a beautiful building on its own and they offer tours where docents will walk you through the whole place and explain when different levels were built and what they were used for in the past ....and present.At holiday times (like July 4th) they have special events here and you can book tickets to attend these awesome events. Usually including dinner and dancing, they also have a fantastic New Year's Eve party that is said to be wonderful.Films are shown on the first level's restored theatre which boasts an antique restored organ. So many things to do here, it is not to be missed. Make sure it is on your ""to-do"" list! You won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
50,Cannot miss the twighlight tour,"It's not commonly advertised yet--in fact with our first phone call with the company, it wasn't mentioned as a touring item--but ask about it and you will not be sorry.We took the later ferry out of Long Beach that evening--the tour was at 6:15, and it was limited in size. It felt like a private tour of the Casino, after which there was swing dancing to Jazz music and refreshments up in the ballroom, which is only used for balls four times per year.The setting is incredible, the guides are so personable--I cannot give a review that is glowing enough for our experience with this particular tour. You get to see Avalon at sunset from one of its most beautiful buildings in style. This is a must-do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/118johnpaulb
50,Beautiful!,We took a behind the scenes tour. To correct a previous reviewer.... the casino is OPEN for these tours. The movie theater is closed for movie viewing. We got to see the movie theater from the doors. It is beautiful! There are some problems with the ceiling but you can see the organ and the frescoes from the doors. It is just beautiful! You just can't watch a movie from the theater. The tour also takes you up to the dance floor on the top floor and the balcony outside. It's a sight! We loved hearing about the history and thinking about all the people that have danced on that floor (it's the original floor). The tour guide turned on some big band music and allowed people to dance during the tour. The views from the balcony are marvelous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cljd

50,Make this one of your must-see stops!,"We did the Casino Tour that shows you the inside of the building (45 minutes). Rebecca, out guide, was amazing!

40,Amazing entertainment venue,"Don't let the name fool you. It is not a gambling casino. It's an ""entertainment"" venue built in the nineteen teens. Walnut adorns the hallways and entrance the ballroom and theater. The ""light fixture"" in the ballroom is worth a billion dollars according to our tour guide, ""Frankie from Avalon."" He has lived on Avalon since the late 1950s, and has a great knowledge base of Catalina and Avalon. The Casino was built by the Wrigley family, and boasts the largest dance floor (swing dancing) in the world. It has a great art deco architecture, and you almost feel transformed back into the roaring 20s. The theater shows a new-release film every evening at 7:30. The theater was built for a new ""fad"" of talking films. The acoustics in the theater are immeasurable - no microphone needed. If you want a spattering of Avalon culture and history, this is a great tour to learn about the beautiful island of Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubajackie

50,History of Catalina Island in a Capsule,"Before visiting Catalina Island, images of Hollywood celebrities gambling their fortunes away in this ""Casino"" predominated my vision its past history. However, a forty-minute tour of this extraordinary building dispelled all the preconceptions of the island itself and instilled a greater respect for the people responsible for its presence. Among the highlights of this building are:1) The Avalon Theater on the ground floor was the first theater built for the talkies. It has a domed ceiling that has near perfect acoustics that was copied by those who built Radio City in New York.2) The two ramps that lead up to dance hall on the upper floor was designed so that it took very little effort for people to reach an equivalent of eight stories height. This is something that has been copied by sports stadiums.3) The dance floor on the upper floor is also a domed structure with no supporting beams in the center and holds great number of people without fear of structure failure.Without a doubt, if time is limited on a visit to Catalina Island, a visit to the Casino is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arrastape

Which is amazing in that almost everything had to be shipped over from the mainland in the 1920's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,Great place for an evening flick,"This is primarily a movie theater. Movie ( singular ) plays nightly at 730pm.It was a pretty cool experience. Don't expect anything modern. Seats are stiff and don't rock. No cupholders, not much legroom. But it brings back an old fashioned theater ambience. Place gets full, so get there early. 1 snack line which can get pretty long. Stood for 15 min to get a refill on popcorn and soda.Eric, the ticket taker is a nice guy. I think he has about 20 jobs on the island. Every time I go somewhere different, he seems to be working there. Lol.Overall a great experience. Great crown and brought back good memories of seeing movies as a kid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithrN8779PG

The theater has perfect natural sound.

It is now used as a movie theatre and can be rented for private events. Inside the casino there are artifacts displayed from the Casino's heyday and the ballroom has weathered and historical orignial hardwood floors and the views from the balcony outside of the ballroom will leave you breathless. It was quite amazing to consider that I was standing where some of early Hollywood's most elite and revered figures had been before (e.g. Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Cecil De Mille, Clark Gable). The materials used in the construction of the casino are some of the best in the world, art deco in design, and the overall beauty of the theatre is striking. I would recommend a tour of this iconic landmark to anyone who visits the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365carlyt

50,Beautiful property,Not a gambling casino. 80+ year old property. You can just imagine how grand it was back in the he day. They run movies nightly. They play the 1929 pipe organs before the movies on Fridays and Saturdays. They also do weddings and private parties.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UpstateNySimplyme
50,Twilight at the casino was excellent,We did the twilight at the casino tour which is a relatively new tour of the casino. 10/10 would recommend. Frank and Rebecca were just the loveliest of people and we got to tour the entirety of the casino and ballroom. Definitely the best tour my husband and I took on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322sierrab
50,Great Tour and Price,"Considering everything tour on the island is expensive this one is the best deal. Honestly I have never seen anything like the Casino. Very unique! Dont be fooled by the name ""Casino."" It was not one previously. You will have to go on the tour to find out. I would not recommend kids on this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciaw765
50,"Yes, take a Tour","We all have seen the Casino, but does anyone really know the history of it?Well after taking the tour I now know the history and I was amazed!Such a beautiful place and until you are inside and up close you really don't know.Take one of the tours, they aren't that long but you will leave doing all about the Casino!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwchatt33
50,Great experience,"Not only is the Casino an grand structure, it's an ICON! We did the backstage tour with Rebecca and we were very impressed by the history of the building and all of its nostalgia. You really are taken back in time to an era that fancied dancing, music and art. Listening to Rebecca relaying the various ""stars/celebrities"" that walked through the building (although at that time, they weren't popular until later); the dress code for both men and women; and the revolutionary history of how the building was developed and utilized during its time as well as present day. A MUST SEE when visiting the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayDeeElAay
50,Beautiful theater,"The theater is out of this world. Breath taking decoration. The organ concert before the movie was great fun. The silent movie we went to the next day, with orchestration was wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaSue1

30,Movie theatre,Very nicely preserved theater at the base of the casino. This is the first theatre that showed talking movies. They only show 1 movie per month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddixon7
40,""" Historic Casino, Is NOT A Casino ! ""","My wife and I went to the Catalina Island Casino thinking we were going to see a casino. You know where you can play on slot machines, Blackjack tables, and more. But surprise, there is no casino. This historical landmark that dates back to the late 1920's. If you go to Catalina Island you must take the Catalina Island Casino tour. The Casino is actually a theatre, and a ballroom that was frequented by the big bands during that era back in the 20's. The Theatre is still active and upstairs there is a great looking dance floor. They have 2 tours seperate tours you can take. Very interesting to here from the tour guides about the history of the Murals on the walls, and the total historical story about the Casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandslamhomer
50,Historic Casino Building That is Not a Real Casino,First went to the casino theater to see Beauty and the Beast. It was a perfect film to see in this beautifully appointed theater. The next day we took a tour and saw the beauty on the outside of the building as well as the record-setting dance floor upstairs and the inside of the theater. I loved walking around the outside walkway on the second floor next to the dance hall. The views were fabulous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/783BarbaraT
40,A Trip to Early 20th Century,"My husband and I went here to see a movie. What a magnificent theatre! I felt like I had been transported to the 1920's. The murals, the seats, the entrance, the kind staff--it all made for a fun evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaC113
40,Well worth it!,"If you go to Catalina Island you must take the Catalina Island Casino tour. This is not a gambling casino but rather a historical landmark that dates back to the late 1920's. It is a theatre, and a ballroom that was frequented by the big bands during that era. Our tour guide, Frankie, was very good! They have 2 tours but we only had time for one. I wish we had the time to do both to see more of this grand place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yokohamamama
10,Take the tour!,"The casino is beautiful. The Art Deco and woodwork is definitely worth your time to see. We recommend you take the behind the scene tour. We also enjoyed a movie and went early to enjoy the organ music. There is no gambling in this casino, it's more for the arts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyv155
50,"A True ""Meeting Place"" on Catalina","The Casino is truly an architectural must see. The acoustics in the theatre are amazing. The lack of stairs leading to the ballroom are fascinating and an architectural accomplishment, The behind the scenes tours are well froth the time and expense to see exactly what makes this unique attraction amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArchieM198
50,Beautiful inside if you can get in!,"This building houses a large theater that was designed for both silent and talking movies, and the largest ballroom in the world! The theater has amazing Art Deco on the walls!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldeagle46
50,"Beautiful, old school place","Looking forward to going back to take the official tour- we just peeked in very quickly, but it was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehep
50,Movie event,Really cool. We went to the theater to watch a show which was great! The casinos actually now a theater where you can see movies. The theater also has an organ player which was interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001
50,FIRST GO TO THE Catalina Museum-- THEN this is a MUST DO,"MUST DO-- PICK ""BEHIND THE SCENES"" Tour (if you have no mobility problems). Wonderful living history.They offer two tours: 40min. and 70 min. Not clear on their web site the differences--The 40 min. is for those with ADA issues (can't climb stairs, etc.) and it covers less (I'm sure it is good, but less).My 70 min. ""Behind the Scenes"" tour covers all the 40 min. tour area and uses stairs to go into many back-stage rooms, film projection areas, stage manager side-stage showing the 1929 light board (great for those with theatre background) and into the 1100person movie theatre.Then UP 4 stories into the 15000-20000 sq. ft. circular ballroom. Spectacular upon walking in and being transported to the 1930'sMy tour guide, Paul-- was exceptional and with only four of us on the 70min. tour it felt as if I was on a private tour-- he was so generous with his time and spirit. A fellow tour goer covertly gave him a tip afterwards-- I wish I had also thought of it-- he deserved it and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittlePrince1977
50,Amazing absolutely stunning island,"Had such a wonderful time meandering through Avalon and seeing the sights! The history is incredible and it's also where the book, ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" was based on. Great place to vacation to get away from everything. A West Coast Gem!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westcoastgirl76
50,Its a must,"You can't go to catalina and not go to the casion point building - its sacrilegious! We did the behind the scenes tour which was really neat. It went into the history of the wrigley's, the island, and the building and had original movie projection equipment that my VFX husband drooled over. Also, we went to the dance room at the top and I was seriously lusting over the amazing tiffany chandelier there. Def worth a few hours to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchoonhaurai
50,Love Love the the Casino building ...............,"I have taken this tour more times than I count count! REALLY! Do I get tired of it's beauty? NO WAY!!!A MUST SEE!!!! You are transported to days gone by, The Ballroom is my Favorite...........second is the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,Roaring 20's come to life,"The Catalina island town of Avalon is blessed with a history of class embodied in the lush edifice called the Casino. Not a casino at all, (casino means 'meeting place'), this Art Deco masterpiece will take you away to the yesteryear of big bands, ball gowns and tuxedos as you tread the very dance floor where the stars once twirled. Much more than a getaway for the well-heeled, the Casino, built by Wrigley of gum fame, is its magnificent architecture, massive theatre and astonishing organ, whose thousands of pipes still bring soundless films to life if you happen to be there on days when the reels spin and the bellows blow. Don't miss this well-preserved tribute to the glory days of Hollywood. Moderate walking is involved as you ascend to the upper level dance hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhY4616KN
50,Casino,"We enjoyed our tour of the casino very much! I would like to do it again actually, especially at night. The attached museum isn't much though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcaryll
50,dont miss seeing and hearing the theater!,gorgeous theater and you get to go on the upper balcony from which you can see fish and seals in the clear water. It was a marvel to hear the accoustic genius of the theater as well as being a visual treat. $14 adult,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STP95008
50,Always a highlight for me,"This time we only went to the movies and of course walked the area around the casino. The theater is unbelievably beautiful and something you should see. If you can, a tour of the casino is truly worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270Pat_C
40,Evening at the Movies,"Love this nostalgic gem! The Casino is so beautiful and time-treasured! It does have a bit of a musty smell, but I'd rather have that then have them remodel it! I do wish the seats had a little more leg room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FBonesJones
50,So worth the trip,"Wasn't sure about it but it was a highlight for sure. Amazing history and stories by our guide Rebecca. We learned a lot but really enjoyed all that this offered. We did the Behind The Scenes tour and would say, don't skip this on your visit. Hit a couple good hikes in too, Hermit Gulch and airport loop, very good as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/394brucec
50,Behind the scenes tour was excellent,"Our group guide was Rebecca who even sang for us. Her bubbly personality really made this tour a success.Great views and so much history. If not on a cruise ship, go on a non-cruise day so the groups will be smaller. There were only 9 people on our tour which was just about perfect to fit in some of the smaller rooms. I took the last tour of the day and because it was the last tour she took time to let us look around while she circled back to shut off lights behind us (tour lasted about 15 min longer than scheduled) I would highly recommend the Behind the Scenes tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieG4735
50,40th Anniversary Tour,"We took advantage of the Behind the Scenes Casino Tour and were favorably impressed with the knowledge of our guide, Rebecca. While the tour could only go for a little over an hour, it was still worth the investment. I am hoping the Tour can eventually be extended to at least 90 minutes. Our guide had so much information to share and could only cover so much in the time we had. The Casino Tour was definitely one of the highlights of our Anniversary visit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9876GJdans
50,The 1930 movie theatre breat taking,The casino with its self leveling floor and ramps to get up was the greatest. The view out over the harbor was to die for. To think Clark Gable and Carol Lumbard danced the same floor you would be standing on. The movie theatre was so beautiful with its painted walls you do not want to leave. To say this is breathtaking place is an understatement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afriel123
50,Blast from the Past,"We decided to take the ""behind the scene's tour"" of this beautiful landmark. It was well worth the small additional cost. This Art Deco and Mediterranean style building dates back to 1929 when Mr Wrigley had this beautiful $2 million building built in a little over a year. We loved hearing all about the famous people who enjoyed it over the years. The dressing rooms are staged as if it was still 1929. The artwork in the theater looks as new as the day it opened. The ballroom made you want to learn the charleston dance so you could participate in one of the parties they still have today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MychelleF_12
40,my experience by visiting the casino was ok. A needed tour guides will help to understand the history of the island.,A warm welcome from a historian point of view will help the tourists to understand the history of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4313TGmariam
50,Remarkable building,"This place is unusual enough to justify the price of tour, otherwise you can only look at it from the outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparejm
50,Historic site that is the symbol of Catalina Island,"A must visit in Avalon. The 1940's theater on the bottom floor is an American attraction that should be a national treasure. The famous ballroom is on the top floor, which was visited by all the ""big bands"" of the 30's and 40's, and still feature some these days. Go early to the movie to see if the antique organ is being played, what a treat. Take your camera to shoot the unbelievable decor on the ceiling and walls. If you ever want a remembrance of a lifetime, attend the New Years celebration in the ballroom. Casino is a very pleasant oceanside walk from town, romantic to boot. My favorite island on earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tavysandin
50,Worth a look!,"When on Catalina Island definitely take the time to tour this beautiful building. The theater alone is amazing to see, but oh when you get to the top floor there is more in store! There was a nice littled video shown in the theater that told the story of the history of not only the Catalina Casino, but also about Catalina Island itself. As others have mentioned, this buidling was not built or ever used as a gambling casino. Dancing and theater were the attractions. The guide was great and the price was right - $13 per adult. The entire tour took about 45 minutes to an hour. We had a sweet surprise when at the end of the tour an elderly couple started dancing on the ballroom dance floor. When I offered to take their photo they told me it was their honeymoon. So sweet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dixie5
50,Beautiful place,Do not let the name confuse you. It is not a gambling casino. It is a beautiful building with beautiful views. Walking distance from downtown. You can even watch a movie there if you in Catalina for a couple of days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicazyoung
50,Took A Tour of the entire building - wonderful!,Be sure you get to see both theater and ball room. Tour was informative and helps you understand the history of the area.

50,What an amazing building,"We did the behind the scenes tour. The theater is incredible; the black walnut panels in the waiting area are magnificent. you don't see that type of craftsmanship anymore. The theater decor is delightful. Hard to imagine someone painting those walls. The ballroom is likewise magnificent. Art Deco in the best sense and well preserved. A truly enjoyable tour. When I have more time, I will take in a movie at the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtiktinsky
40,Step Back in Time ...,What a beautiful building! And I'm sure if those walls could talk ... Frankie From Avalon is quite a character and very knowledgeable tour guide. We took the 40 minute tour and really enjoyed seeing the movie theater (amazing) and the grand ballroom. It is a short walk from town (plenty of benches along the way if you need to rest or just enjoy the view of the harbor and boats) and well worth the trip. Feel free to swing dance with Frankie - he's got some good moves :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LowProfileTour
50,Very Impressive,"Worth while going to see. Great tour guide. We did both tours. I like the behind the scenes for the best. It is quite warm inside and beautiful. The ballroom that they had for dancing were they had up to 6,000 people on the time is incredible. Acoustics is great the whole Casino. Archer guide actually some choice to demonstrate how their Acoustics worked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanDeCruise
50,Beautiful building - Great History,The presentation and film are amazing...do not miss. The building itself is a sight to behold and the history is so fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doclesley
40,Sometimes it feels like somebody's watching me,"This place is both eerie and beautiful at the same time. The views from the top are amazing but it is quite a walk for anybody who isn't used to walking for very long. When I got to the ballroom it took everything in me not to run to the middle and the ""Sound of Music"" twirl because it is so huge and lovely. The movie theater is beautiful but has a haunted feel. What's worse is going into the bathroom alone and not feeling like you're alone. Don't go to the bathroom alone ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skylarlisa6899
40,Hidden Figures,"Super cool building! The interior is art deco, very retro. Prior to the movie, there is an organist playing on only 1 of 3 in the world. The seats though... not so comfy üòÜ Our rear ends we're glad when the movie was finished. Great movie, btw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hortonmanor09

50,No gambling at this casino,"The Catalina Island Casino houses the first-ever theater for motion pictures with sound plus one of the country's biggest dance floors! The architecture is a marvel and boasts stunning artwork and decorative features throughout the casino, which was never home to gamblers. The ""Discover the Casino"" tour was 40 minutes -- look for the 2-for-1 coupon from local vendors. And check out what's playing in the movie theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneDeLo
50,Movie night at the Catalina Island Casino,"Got to see ""Rogue One"" in the Casino, a historic movie theater (performance arena) with antiques seats (very comfortable).

50,See a movie!,"The live theatre from the 1920's has been renovated and now has a movie screen that shows a first run movie every night at 7:30pm. For an hour starting at 6:30, there is an organist who plays the old organ in the front of the theater. The experience of sitting in the theatre is worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlepepita
50,A must see attraction on the island,"My husband and I visited the island and I found a great package deal which included a walking tour of the casino. It didn't seem that exciting, but thought we would give it a try. I was wrong! The tour was great. Very informative, was great to learn all about the history of the casino and see all of the wonderful decor. It was so pretty inside! We got to see the worlds largest circular dance floor and we even did a little dance on it!! Definitely would recommend this tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TurningPages
50,Behind-the-Scenes tour is best,"Of two casino tours, this one reveals the sensational fine-acoustics movie theatre in true Art Deco design, and the upstairs ballroom, still largest in the world. Best of all, the old projection equipment remains, a cineaste's delight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithD254
50,An Architectural Marvel Worth Visiting,"I highly recommend taking the ""Behind the Scenes Tour"" of the Catalina Island Casino. This beautiful structure was commissioned by Mr. Wrigley (of chewing gum fame) in the 1920's.The tour begins at the front door underneath the beautiful tile mosaics where you meet your guide. Next, in the Lobby your tour guide provides a little bit of history of the building. You will gasp at the beautiful hand carved woodwork and opulent lighting. Continuing with the tour, you're taken through the dressing rooms backstage and onto the actual stage like so many entertainers had done in years gone by.The ground floor of the building is a beautiful movie theatre with the original organ that was used whenever the silent movies played. The ceiling is domed and suspended from above resulting in incredible acoustics. The hand painted murals on the sides of the theatre are in the Art Deco motif that was popular back then.Your tour guide will take you up one level to Mr. Wrigley's private screening room where he would entertain celebrities and dignitaries. It is here too, where you will see the original film projectors and learn about how they operated.Going up another level, you'll reach the famed Ballroom which can hold up to 2,000 people. It is completely round with glass doors that open onto an esplanade where people could go to get a bit of fresh sea air and to cool down after dancing. Imagine a romantic evening on the esplanade. It is here where you will get a very nice view of Avalon.The move theatre shows films every week and the Ballroom has dances at certain times of the year. This iconic building is a true gem and probably the most photographed place in Avalon. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayA427
50,A romantic look at Hollywood's Golden Age,"The ""casino"" was never a gambling house; rather a magnificent historic movie theater - the first designed for talkies - and a circular ballroom holding 3,000 dancers. The casino attracted Hollywood's finest actors & actresses for live performances since it opened in 1928. The art deco, mediterranean & revival architecture is incredible. Note - the cruise lines won't tell you about this tour since they don't sell it; go do Discovery Tours in Avalon; recommend the Behind the Scenes Tour to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeC829
50,Awesome Tour and History,We purchased tickets for the behind the scenes tour on Christmas Eve. The tour guide super and provided alot of great info. The way the building was constructed amazed our group. You could just imagine all the stats that visited and performed going back to the 1920's. Must see tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mkbmb
50,"Truly Fun, Do It","There is a charm about any Island. On Catalina perhaps the most charming thing we did was to take the 70 minute tour of the Casino. Part of what made it so delightful was our tour guide, who introduced himself as ""Frankie from Avalon.""The theater, both in the seats, and when viewed from backstage, is a treat. The materials used in the lobby and the period artwork evoke the elegance of the era when the Casino was built.When on the Queen Mary some people feel this is a ship whose time has passed. Not me, I feel as if I am on the high seas, in a time of elegance and sophistication. The Casino evokes those same feelings. In your mind, you can hear the music of the big bands that played there.Tours are scheduled at particular times, book ahead and be there on time tone admitted with your group.Go, have fun, enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newyorkscreen
50,Amazing back-stage tour,"We took the back-stage tour and visited the beautiful theater, ballroom, balcony, and green rooms. Interesting history and furnishings, many photos, and a glimpse into what it was like to perform there. They were setting up for New Year's Eve in the ballroom, and it looked like they would have a fun time. The casino is a short walk from the main part of town. Balcony offers magnificent views of the harbor and ocean. We wanted to take the 12:45 tour but did not buy tickets ahead. They were full, so we bought tickets for the 3:15 tour. As you walk to and from the casino, notice the lovely tile murals of Avalon history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAwalkers
50,Iconic Building shown on every postcard of the island,"Toured this iconic building inside and out. As you walk in the door, check out the beautiful tile mosaics. The theater on the ground floor is an artist delight with panels of art from the early 1900th century. A beautiful organ also adds to the ambiance. On the second floor is a huge dance floor that feels like you are dancing on air. The view from the balcony alone is worth the cost of the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525rosieg
50,Beautiful historic venue,Loved this venue as a perfect setting for a business event. The 360 balcony made for an incredible backdrop for the island and all its beauty at sunset.

50,What a surprise in store for you,I have been to Catalina many times over the last 17 years. I never toured the inside of the casino building.

50,Fascinating experience,"Our tour was conducted by a charming guy who calls himself ""Frankie of Avalon."" He is witty, well-informed about the history of the Casino, the ballroom, the movie projection room, etc. Great experience. If you have flexibility in your schedule, ask for the tour conducted by ""Frankie of Avalon."" You won't be disappointed. Ladies, he'll even throw in a ""swing"" lesson at no extra cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77
40,Beautiful and iconic site,Catalina can be sleepy at night with kids and seeing a movie at this beautiful theater was just what we needed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathysW330FC

50,Make sure you take a tour and go to the movies,"This is our favorite place to go when we are in Avalon. We always go to the movies, no matter what is playing. On Fri and Sat evenings there is an organ performace prior to the movies. Go early. It is worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XK140NUT
50,"A fascinating pe ice of history, worth seeing",This is an amazing place. Built by the one of the Wrigley brothers in the 1930's it was a huge entertainment draw for years with artists playing the theater and the bog bands playing the ballroom.The theater boasts perfect acoustics and has fabulous lighting.The ballroom boasts a suspended dance floor that accommodate thousands of people.Gambling has not happened there. It's a fabulous history.Stop by! Take the tour. We took the longer tour. There are two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q503AXjohnl
20,Not a Gambling Casino,Most people are disappointed that this is not a gambling Casino. When we were there in early November it was under construction and all the doors were locked at 4PM. So not sure if it was closed for the day or just under construction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycep883
50,Great,The casino is an architect delight. It is very historical. We viewed a movie while on our visit to the island. I also understand that it is haunted. The organ player was very interesting as he played music before the movie began. The walk to the casino was amazing by the shore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001
50,Very interesting especially for art deco lovers,Really glad we took the shorter tour. Wish we had had time for the longer one. Young people be bored,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/All4Peace
40,NOT a gambling casino,"I always assumed the Casino was a gambling attraction to draw people to Catalina. Not so. Casino is an Italian term for 'a gathering place'. The interior is a classical working movie theater and the first theater to show a talking movie. The whole building, inside and out is quite classy. Tours are available for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
40,Casino Walking Tour,"We paid $12 each (seniors price) for the Casino Walking Tour (including $2 off the $5 admission price to the Museum in Metropole Street) and it was unbelievable value for what we were given. We bought our tickets on the pier but you can also buy them at the box office at the Casino itself, We would have liked to do more tours in Avalon but annoyingly the tour times all overlapped. Our guide was the very knowledgeable Joe and the tour was not crowded. We saw the ornate art deco theatre and then walked up the ramps (no stairs) to the wonderful ballroom and terrace. You rally can't come to Avalon and not see the inside of this magnificent edifice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Survey54

40,Beautiful Place,"I just returned from the 30th Anniversary for the Catalina Jazz Festival by JazzTrax. FANTASTIC! ""The Casino"" is no longer used as a casino. In Catalina's hayday (back in the 20'30'40's) the casino was alive and in living color. Today it is used as an event venue and known as the pavilion. Every seat is a good seat. The ceiling is a dome with exquisite art deco. around a revolving chandelier (much like a disco ball, except it wasn't round. It was a sphere.) I did take picture but I""m not computer savvy enough to get them on here. There are large windows and patio doors that open for fresh air (thank goodness for that!). Ventilation is good. There were several bars setup for the event; however, wait staff only worked the elevated cocktail tables that were on the perimeter of the auditorium.. Nice seats but TOTALLY out of my price range ($400 pp and 4 to a table). We had the cheap seats ($129) which is on the main floor and not quite all the way in the back. Even those seats were good seats. You can see the stage straight ahead. I would consider those seats again. The down side of the auditorium is (as told by the sound engineers working the event) the casino is ""the hardest room in the country to record in "" due to the ceiling actually being rather low. .Thus, when one of the performers had the sound a it's maximum it was bouncing off the walls and clashing. I couldn't understand ANYTHING that was being said and very little that was being sung. It was so loud and the sound was clashing so badly I left before the event was over. I've been to many concerts so my hearing is already messed up BUT, the sound was so bad I could not even make out a melody. Ok, the Casnio has 1 - one hundred year old elevator - that broke down the second day. There are extremely steep ramps to walk up to reach the auditorium. It is hard to walk up and just as hard to walk down - particularly if you have mobility issues - I have issues. The staff provided golf carts to get handicapped people up and down. It worked for me. I look forward to going back next year. Loved the event. Loved The Casino.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grouptravellady
50,Great venue for the concert,2nd time to the Jazz Trax Jazz festival. The ballroom is beautiful and an excellent venue to see many of my favorite Smooth Jazz performers. The service for food and drink was slow and they should be selling the bottles of water separate from the bar when it is at full capacity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eha48rochester
50,JazzTrax,This venue was Excellent. The concerts were perfect. The building was clean and well kept. I have recommended it several times since my visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherryj48

50,Never a disappointment,We've visited Catalina several time for the JazzTrax jazz festival which is held in this 1929 Casino Ballroom. It is absolutely beautiful. There is a steep climb to the top but very worth it. The view is magnificent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/903stephanieb
50,Jazz Festival,First visit to the Jazz Trax annual festival. What a beautiful venue! The Art Deco decor in the ballroom was well preserved which added to the ambience. I imagined Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire dancing on the same floor during the ballroom's heyday. Glad the casino remains open for us to enjoy today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2981IEvalerieb
20,Disappointed,"We were visiting Catalina Island as a port day while on the Celebrity Infinity. We had a food tour scheduled at noon but thought we would take a walk up to the casino and do a tour since David had never been there before. Unbeknownst to us, even after going to their web page for tour times etc, when we got there we found out that there were no tours for the day and that they were completely closed due to a wedding event being held. It was disappoint that we could not go inside at all even though the bridal party had not arrived yet. I think it would have been nice for them to have posted that on their website. A lot of other people we know did the very same thing we did. I had also hoped that on Saturdays they might have had a matinee movie so we could see the theater but that was not the case either. Shows are just at 7:30 pm every day. All in all, a pretty big disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bxmt54
40,Architectural and Historic Treasure of Avalon,Took the tour of the Casino and it was worth the fee. What a great old building with tons of history and fine craftsmanship from another age. The tour guide was an native Catalina Islander that was proud of the building and it's story which made the tour even better. The theater and the ballroom were both very impressive. You felt like you were on a Gangster Movie set when you entered the ballroom-it just oozed 1920's hipness. Check it out if you are at all interested in the History or Architecture of this era-you won't be dissappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txyz

There are quite a few stairs and incline, so be aware. We loved the tour and went back to a movie that night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susilou
50,THE most iconic symbol of the island never disappoints!,"The casino symbolizes pure happiness for my family and I. Been coming to the island for over four decades, and just took the Casino Tour again this summer. Still an awesome tour, and a must-do for every new visitor. The casino is located directly between Descanso Beach Club and the Green Pier. Some of the best scuba diving in the country is located right off Casino Point. I love this landmark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catalina_Lifer
50,. The ballroom is exquisite.,Did the Behind the scenes tour and it is well worth it. The beauty of the building is easily missed and it is in original shape and should not be missed.

It is a huge theater and it is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222marciad

I missed the free tour by about 10 minutes, oh well! Tours are at 11:45 and 2:45. They take about 45 minutes so I wonder why they don't offer them more often? Anyway, I went the next day and paid the price and felt ok about it, because it was a really great tour. You start out in the fantastic theater with a film about the history, then walk up to the dance floor, and go out to the balcony overlooking the harbor for great views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janh430
50,Great tour for entertainment and history buffs,"We took the Behind The Scenes tour, and it was great! Our guide, Paul, was very informative. There are only two times for this tour, so it takes some planning if you have a lot of other activities. Walking on stage, seeing the green room, and the Wrigley private lounge were highlights after the ballroom and theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738bobm
10,Rude Staff,"Little value for what you pay for, and you only pay $12 so you can imagine how little you actually get. Basically, the the tour will tell you how expensively this casino (""place of gathering"" and not gambling) was built in many different ways. That's about it. Plus they show you an old, boring 15 or 20 minute video on how the casino was bigtime in its heyday. The highlight however was one of the staff, lady in her mid to late 60s, who was rushing us out of the building because we had ""taken too long already! This is only a 40 minute tour!"" when I assure you we had not. We took maybe an extra 1 minute admiring the view from the balcony, which was the very few good things about this place. Mind you we had a stroller and a wheelchair, so we could have been forgiven for being slower - but we weren't even slow because others who did not have wheeled equipment were also still standing around looking at the view. She rushed us so much she would not even allow us to use the ramp in the ballroom because ""that would take longer"" so she literally lifted our stroller so we would just use the steps. So wrong on so many levels. I hope when she needs a wheelchair later on, she would not be treated in the same ill way. Don't offer a tour if you don't welcome guests. Or be reasonable and warn your guests about time restrictions. Or how about shorten the boring, outdated video. Or how about change some of your staff to people who are not miserable. Waste of time and money. I know there is little else to do on this island, but this one won't add any more to your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graceb167

It is amazing and takes you into area's most NEVER get to see and up into the massive Ballroom and the wrap around balcony upstairs.Also be sure to see an evening movie inside the theatre.

40,Behind the Scenes Casino tour--Catalina's icon,"To most fully experience this Catalina icon, developed by William Wrigley Jr. and opened in 1929, I signed up for the 70-minute Behind the Scenes tour. There is also a shorter 40-minute Discover the Casino tour. Both are walking tours, and the Behind the Scenes tour involved stairs.The Casino building houses a movie theatre with a grand ballroom above it. The tour begins outside the Art Deco theatre, which shows a current film nightly (""Finding Dory"" in our case). The entry, lobby and theatre are grand, with elabourate murals and lots of Art Deco flourishes. There is a 1929 pipe organ, one of only 4 still in operation--it's played before the film screening on weekends. We saw a short film about the Casino's construction and heyday beginning in the 1930's, with countless celebrities visiting. We went onstage then upstairs past dressing rooms to a larger green room. Photos of big bands that played here back in the day were everywhere. We saw the projection room and a private room that Wrigley family members still use for private functions. Then we went up a wide concrete walkway to the Ballroom with its magnificent domed ceiling that seemingly has no support. We then exited to the Ballroom's outdoor ""Romance Promenade"" with its lovely views of Avalon and the Pacific.Our guide was Rebecca. She finished the tour in one hour (10 minutes early), but seemed to have many stories to tell. She encouraged us to take the tour with another guide, because they all have their own stories.A visit to Catalina would not be complete without a tour of its most recognizable icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pillowsofwanderlust

She answered all our questions and was very patient when we lagged behind. Our only complaint is that the tour was not long enough. I wanted to hear more.

Movie showtime was just one @ 7:30, but it was a pretty new one. However, we were not able to do any of them due to time constraints. Would love to come back and see the inside sometime- sounds gorgeous! Not a gambling casino- a ""gathering place"" in Italian type of casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimwB1214HM
30,RUSHED,Not sure what was going on the day we were on the island but each tour we did seemed to be cut short and the tour guides were rushing us through the tour.For this tour we got an ill tour guide that was very nice but must have mentioned 10 times about how short on time we were and how she doesn't like to do crowd control. I found it very odd that she kept mentioning how short on time we were when the tour didn't even last the entire time.The view from the top is amazing but be quick about taking a photo because we didn't even get 5 minutes out there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
40,Worth coming early to the movie to admire the buidling.,Although the casino only offered one film (and one that I'd never watch other different circumstances) it was worth the price of admission to admire the building and its interior.

Incredible structure!!Great short clip about the history of the island.The tour was overbooked by 3-4 peopleOur guide knowledgeable but she was quite ill and kept saying how the tours would be canceled if she wasn't able to run them. At times she seemed so ill that I thought she may faint. She said she was running a temp....and appeared to have a hard time breathing...maybe more guides need to be hired ( as there are only three)something to point out is that perhaps there should be an age limit >>there was 3-4 year old in our group not bad behaved but just doing what toddlers do , however it became very distracting at times while we tried to listen to the soft spoken guide. Not much for a toddler to be interested in.After the tour we realized it had been cut short by 15 mins ....I guess bec of how sick our guide felt?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryR2127
40,Much better than expected,"I was pleasantly surprised by this tour, which lasted about 45 minutes. You get to see a movie about Catalina's past, but the best part is that you see it in the spectacular Avalon Theater, which is in the Casino. Then there's a quick tour of the ballroom which offers great views of the harbor. All in all, a fun and interesting way to spend about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabsDan
50,Tour of Casino,"This was a 40 minute tour of the theatre, ballroom and some of the stories of how the casino was built. Rebecca was our tour guide and she did an excellent job leading our tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williame813
50,The tour is well worth it!,The tour of the arcade was such a fun look at California during the golden years of Hollywood. The arcade itself is a gorgeous example of art deco architecture. The views from the ballroom can't be beat. Definitely worth your time!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1062XEamyh
40,Beautiful historic venue,There just aren't many gorgeous large historic venues like this! Fun to visit and it has a great gift shop too! We saw people attending a wedding here which would have been so fun to be a part of. A wedding here is a fabulous idea!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TayaLeReve
30,See a Movie & Hear the Old Pipe Organ,"Pleasant for those interested in the arts and history. They were playing a first run movie I wanted to see anyway, so thought it would be memorable to say we saw it on Catalina Island. Enjoy the Art Deco murals and live performance on the old pipe organ before the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wordpictures
50,Gorgeous Art and Architecture,"What a fabulous place--full of history and the most beautiful, exotic-art deco murals. We saw a movie there, so took a sort of self guided tour. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquaBend
50,Casino Museum,"Well designed & enjoyable. Staff are very welcoming and informative. The ""Do-it-Yourself"" tour is more interesting than anticipated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayakveggie
40,Casino Tour,"The Casino Tour is interesting and gives you a lot of information about the Casino, the industry there, and the island itself. The behind the scene look at it is worth the time. The great staff at Mount Ada Inn made the arrangements and was included with our stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikepontarolo
40,"YOU'RE ON THE ISLAND SO, YOU MAY AS WELL","Catalina offers only a small amount of activities as the town of Avalon is very limited. So, as a visitor, you may as well sign up for the Catalina Island Casino Tour. The history of this structure is very interesting and your tour guide will give you all the facts and figures as you walk thru the building. You can take pictures as you go. Don't be fooled by the current use of the word ""Casino"" as a place to gamble. The word in old world Italian simply meant a ""Place to Meet"" and there is no gambling within the building. Some of this structures art will never be used again in modern buildings. It would be far to expensive and the people who were trained in such art no longer are used in todays buildings. The walking tour does involve some steep ramps and you should be used to walking up stairs in order for you to make the climbs. Best to go on line to get your tour times and tickets as there is many people who will be taking this tour everyday and a last minute ticket purchase may not be possible. Hey, it's one of those things you can say, ""We Did It"". Ron and Pam",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avie8tor
50,Casino Tour,The Casino Tour was very informative and I learned a lot of history of the building and the famous bands that played there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bookitjanno
30,A Casino??,"We thought it was a casino!! When we get there, we read the note that casino is Italian for gathering and this place is NOT a gambling casino",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UandMeTravellers
40,fun history behind it,Great tour and fun to add on your trip. We did the behind scenes tour and enjoyed the information and facts about the ballroom. Interesting to know ships would come packed and then leave when they were done dancing back to the mainland early morning. Wish we could have stayed and taken in a movie there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddie27c
50,Discovery Tour was Super fun!,Rebecca was a Hoot! Paul very caring and helpful. So entertaining and knowledgable about the history of the Casino and its past lies! Loved the DVD. Loved sitting in the Wing backed seats and seeing clips of the silent film in the theater. But most of all I loved standing in the middle of the dance floor of the ballroom and being sung to by the 75 people there Happy Birthday to me!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/631megt
50,Catalina Island Casino(Behind the Scenes) Tour,"If you go to Catalina, visiting the Casino is a must. For one, it is the most iconic structure on the island. It is also a beautiful architectural masterpiece, incorporating brilliant structural design as well.I have been on the regular tour of the building twice, and recommend that tour for first-timers. The Behind the Scenes Tour gives one the perspective of the producers, the performers, and all the people it took to put on the storied events that took place from the 1920's to the present day. The Casino has never been a gambling establishment. It got its name due to a literal translation of the Italian word meaning ""gathering place."" So the only money that will come out of your wallet will be the cost of the tour($27.50 reg., $25 seniors, I think, and I don't remember prices for young ones). Our docent, Paul, was very personable and knows the Casino inside and out, and he has made it his mission to inform the public about its importance in California's history, so that it will be preserved for future generations to admire. The Casino also offers first run movies in the incredible art deco theater. In October it hosts the Jazz Trax jazz festival over a two weekend span.If you don't do anything else on the island, at least go see the Casino, it's fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gitman
50,the Casino a unique historical landmark.,"When visiting Catalina for the first time a tour of the Casino is a must for those interested in the history of the island, as well as life in the early days. The Casino has a very interesting history and is a unique architectural structure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S215EKjamesc
40,Beautiful architecture and historic importance,"I was awed by this building from every angle, all the way around the harbour as well as right up in front of it but it makes me sad that we don't live in an age that can appreciate it properly anymore. It used to be a ballroom on top of a theatre with a ballroom in there as well and you can picture ladies and gentlemen arriving in their finery in another age. Now it's a museum and a movie theatre but it deserves better. So beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeganWalters
40,"The smaller museum tour in the basement is fun, but brief and very warm.","You can pay more to tour the theater and ballroom, but they apparently are not run by the same company. And the person who sells tickets to that tour apparently the box office doesn't open until nearly 11 or noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249tanyac
50,The ICONIC Casino is a must to see!,We always pop in to see what ever movie is playing! Try to arrive early as you'll be amazed at the details of the building exterior and interior you'll want the time to take it in and probably take pics! It's one of kind AMAZING from the 1920's.I def. recommend coming during the day to take in the little museum on the side but just to see the daytime view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72LMH
50,Behind the scenes at the Catalina Island Casino,"Totally recommend the behind the scenes tour - Our guide, Rebecca, was terrific, full of old gossipy tales of long ago, and she even sang for us! Good voice, lady! The size of the place is amazing, especially when you understand what a popular and crowded venue it was in its heyday and what was involved in its construction. Nice place for a wedding. $$$$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgal328
30,Concert in the casino,"I didn't tour the casino, I just went in the main hall for live music and out, didn't really have time to look everywhere. It's a nice photo spot outside, all the way leading up to the casino, but inside was just ok. It's cool to be there once and next time I think I prefer sticking to outdoor activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweeetkiwikisses
50,Beautiful Venue,My husband Fred and I took the Avalon Casino discovery tour while we were there and it was well worth it. Our guide was Rebecca and she was wonderful. She was a wealth of knowledge about the Casino and even treated us to a lovely rendition of the Avalon song at the end! The Casino has such a beautiful history to it. We are hoping to return and take the longer tour next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650christalh

I recommend seeing a movie here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3228DMruthp

50,Beautiful building & views. Take the tour.,"A beautiful building with interesting history. Great views from ballroom. We even watched a movie in theater which was very cool and got there early for the organ music. Not my kind of tunes, but interesting to hear all the different sounds the organ can make. I'm from Chicago area so the connection to the Wrigley family was interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyWren
50,Take the Tour!,"We went on the 40 minute Discover tour (don't remember the full name), and it was great! I highly recommend paying to get a look inside the casino.

The casino is so iconic, it's well worth getting inside to truly appreciate it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious1991
50,This building is amazing,"I've never been one to want to sign up for tours on a vacation, but this was free with our stay at the Inn on Mt Ada.

30,Old fashioned..,"For many years long ago, my grandparents came here, they brought their kids here to Catalina, as well as later on bringing their grandkids.. My grandfather always came to the Casino, he'd go there alone leaving us kids with our grandma. We assumed he went there to gamble, play poker etc. Many years later, my mom and my daughter and I visit the casino and find out it was never use for gambling, but for entertainment such as drinking and dancing and socializing..We were surprised..Anyways, we saw they were showing Superman vs. Batman there, so we decided to watch it there just so we could have a reason to sit in such antiquity and elagance... Ooh my God! Never see a 2 plus hour movie in such straight back chairs. These chairs were made for viewing short films for a nickel for a reason. Not even seeing Jason Mamoa for 5 seconds was worth it.... almost.We did love they had an actual organ player playing before the movie started, and he was amazing! I could have just listened to him, at least I could stand and listen to him at the same time.On a side note, the women's restroom had a creepy feeling to it... just fyi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemL6615US
40,Spring break,Catalina Island Casino is not a casino but a movie theater with museum at the back. We wanted to watch a movie here Batman vs Superman and to see the casino itself.It seemed like the whole town was there last night. Large bucket of popcorn gets u a refill for 3 dollars. Decent price .. ticket however is 15 dollars.. a little more than your usual price ticket.. nonetheless we wanted to . experience it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icyvegas
50,Beautiful - the tour is well worth the price of admission!,"We toured the casino - theatre and dance hall - and the museum. We also went to a movie that evening in the theatre, and it was terrific. I wish there had been a dance the week we went. We will plan to come back :)Just stunningly beautiful facility.

50,Wonderful tour given by Rebecca!,Visited the casino in early December and it was a gorgeous day. Rebecca was our tour guide (very small group) so she gave us a little more time since she didn't have to herd the masses. We were able to watch a short video and learned so much about the Casino and Avalon.Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our tour and Rebecca serenaded us at the end with a lovely song of which the lyrics are printed inside the Casino. Highly recommend this tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinascucina
40,Fun tour.,We took the shorter of the two tours...fun and informative. Beautiful old building with a movie theater on the first level and ballroom above. Happy to see it still in use.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233joyces
40,Casino with No Gambling!,"Guess I was naive but thought I would gamble at Avalon's ""casino"" but learned there was never gambling at this place - casino means gathering place. Took tour of theater and ballroom - beautiful and well worth the tour cost. Incredible building and thanks to the Wrigley's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymS1571ZG

50,Historic Hollywood alive,"I read that Charlie Chaplin and many others of the 30's and 40's came here and all the architecture feels that way- Art Deco and so sumptuous. I felt like I could turn the corner and run into any number of ghosts, like a Midnight in Paris, this place evokes those spirits. Great history, feast for the eyes, and a lovely walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPBSanFrancisco
50,Elegant Art Deco Theatre and Ballroom,"This is a ""gathering place"" not a gambling place. The plein-aire art work is art deco and amazing. It has to be seen. They play organ music that is piped throughout that shouldn't be missed. Take the whole tour and hear the history. The ballroom is amazing. Attend Jazz-Trax...have a wedding or anniversary!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243charlenew
50,Wonderful tour of the Avalon Casino,"Took the hour and a-half tour of the Casino and marveled at the beauty of the theater and the ballroom, not to mention the uniqueness of the theater projection room and the dressing rooms of celebrities both old and new that perform in the ballroom. Lots of ramps to walk up and down that accommodated up to 4,000 people who enjoyed the Big Band Era in the ballroom. Loved our guide Rebecca! She even sang the official Avalon song and did quite well! Our ticket also included the museum that is there, which was quite a treat. Loved all of the history of the island and the celebrity photos of those stars that visited often, including John Wayne, Clark Gable, Charley Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe (who actually lived on the island during her first marriage), Mickey Rooney, James Cagney, and many more. I highly recommend this tour, as it was the highlight of our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagunanina
40,Ballroom and theater walking tour.,"Nice tour that needs to be a full hour. Guide really likes her job and goes the extra distance for us. She even sang to us the official Avalon song. Lots of ramps to race up and down for time sake. Theater was special old Hollywood style with artwork, real gold, wood and silver they remind us. We have a similar one in Santa Barbara in spanish adobe style. Lots of history, architecture and a great ballroom to rent for a special event if you have a pile of dough to burn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354JasonS354

50,You Have to See This Property!,"Totally surprised with the property. The historic facility was beautiful and very well maintained; felt like we were stepping back in time.

50,Short Casino Tour is Great,"We took the 45 minute casino tour and it was well worth the price.

50,Architecture not to be missed,"Built in 1931 for $2,000,000 says it all. Massive structure and even bigger on the inside than appears.

50,Very interesting and educational,"When people hear of the Catalina Island Casino, they instantly think of a gambling experience. Totally not the case.

50,Walking Tour was Great!,"An easy walk from town, it was well worth taking the 45 minute walking tour. It includes watching a DVD about the history of the casino.

50,Beauty and a movie!,"While exploring our eating options, we stumbled upon an opportunity to enjoy a movie-Star Wars: the Force Awakens as a special treat after eating and with no extra charge! We have been to the Casino several times and find it fascinating. THIS, however, was the first time we got to see a movie in the beautiful theater in the lower level of the Casino. The theater seats 1,184 and is glorious in it's art deco decor and is a real treat just to see. We were too late to enjoy a performance from the pipe organ so will have to (get to!) schedule this for our next trip. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402dougd
40,Nice tour - very informational history of the island,"My wife and I enjoyed this short tour. Takes about 20-40 minutes depending if you want to read every word, and study every picture. The museum provided a very interesting history of the island. Not being from California, we knew virtually nothing about Santa Catalina Island. This tour will tell you why it is named so, who came to it, who owned it, and a few other interesting tidbits. We enjoyed it. I cannot comment on the value of the tour, as our hotel gave us free tickets to get inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcchuck2014

Tickets are $12 per person which includes a 40 minute tour of the ""casino"" with beautiful art work and a short movie.Guides are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.

Beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl6662013
50,Casino didn't always mean gambling hall,"This place has an awesome theatre and ballroom. This was never a place to gamble. There are two tours available, I recommend the behind-the-scenes tour if available. The short film about the casino is shown during the tour and very interesting. We were there on 12/31 and they were preparing for a New Year's Eve ball that looked like it was going to be spectacular. If you've ever been to Radio City Music Hall, you can tell it was inspired by the Casino's theatre. The tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was about an hour. I recommend visiting the casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ivan58_10
50,Great $12 Tour!,"We had previously been to Catalina Island for a quick day trip, but we didn't think to take the tour of the casino.My husband and I had a few days to spend on this stunning island, so I was really looking to get inside the casino and explore.We picked up our $12 tour tickets for the 40 minute tour.Fun fact, the casino was never actually used for gambling, it was more of a glamorous dance hall and theater.Our guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We really enjoyed the mini movie that we saw in the beginning about this iconic building. You watch the movie in the beautifully kept up theater. There is so much beautiful artwork to see on the ceiling.After the movie, we were taken up to the grand ballroom. I could envision the glamorous events of yesteryear happening when I stood on the dance floor.Definitely see this if you are visiting the island.

50,Let's go to the movies!,"The Catalina Island Casino was the perfect place to experience a movie. While it doesn't offer IMAX or 3D versions of films, it gives something rarer - the taste of a bygone era. The movie we saw was mediocre; the setting was incredible.

30,"The Casino says ""Catalina""","A 40 minute tour of the casino for $12 a ticket. Tours are 11am, 11:45am, & 2pm. I loved the tour and being inside the Casino, but it felt a bit rushed. When you're taking photos or wanting to admire or read the posters they have the tour guides are already shooing you out to the next part of the tour. It is such a beautiful space, but really only informative on the paintings on the outside. There are no stairs in the venue, but there are ramps which is really good for those who are not able. The top is the best part for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee

40,Meeting Place,"Casino means ""Meeting Place"" as this place totally is & was. Many under estimate the importance of architectecture, when designing a Large Building space. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF INGENUITY & Creativity! Spacious & delightful views from all angles! Inside this Ballroom is the Best 360 view of Catalina/Avalon! Imagination is turned into reality! The times of Intellectual Melding is near gone, but if the walls could speak... listen closely. A must see for the Nostalgic traveler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165catherinel

My husband had to push me up EIGHT ramps to the 8th floor casino ballroom during the tour. What strength! Not sure we would have taken this tour if we had known. If someone had a power operated wheelchair, the decent would have been scary! Be forewarned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandaceR9

50,A must visit,It's a true experience to attend the cinema at the Casino. Attended once during Silent Movie Festival and the organist played the famous organ at the crucial times during the silent movie. Wow!Tuesday nights are the discount nights and movies are around half price! Great clue. The inside walls and ceilings are a spectacle.During the day visit the Museum or take a tour. Well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foileyer1

50,BEAUTIFUL CASINO,"We were on the Carnival Imagination cruise; stopped for us to get off at Catalina Island. It was really super! Love the art deco!!! Yes, it cost us; but it was super! I'd go back again to the Island, but I wouldn't pay the price. The surrounding Casino was beautiful and the air was really great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenrY2536DB

Saw a large group of scuba divers at the back of the casino suggesting a good place to try the waters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ontheroadat62
50,Spectacular Building,"This is a must see while in Avalon, the art here is amazing the whole building is breathtaking!

Our tour guide was on point and truly has a passion for the Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lissette1962
50,Wonderful place,"Not too far from Los Angeles, on the California coast, this is a quaint little island, used mostly for summer holidays. People move around in golf carts or bicycles.We landed in Avalon, and travelled the island on a narrated scenic bus drive.We went all the way up to the canyon, from there you get breathtaking views.Down by the pier there are a string of trendy boutiques selling quality crafts. I didn't see junk souvenirs like in many other places.We spent the morning there and had a lovely time. A place to come back to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nonnita02
40,Insightful tour of historical landmark!,"Though we have visited Avalon before, we decided to take the Catalina Casino tour this time and absolutely loved it. Our guide, Rebecca, was funny, insightful, and engaging! We enjoyed learning about all of the history behind this landmark - and we would definitely recommend that you take the tour! It does involve a little bit of walking, but the views from the top will make it worth the trek! Additionally, if you can spare the time, definitely take in a movie at the absolutely breathtaking theater ... We wish we had had the time, but look forward to doing so on the next visit! Thanks, Rebecca, for making our first tour of the Casino a very memorable one :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334vidyav
50,Unbelievable building,"Saw a great concert upstairs, beautiful building, warm late summer evening overlooking the harbor. Couldn't ask for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241JimS

50,Gorgeous and so interesting!,My favorite evening was the night I took myself to the movies at the old Casino and then took the long tour the following day. This is a really astounding structure and the story that goes with it is so interesting. I'd recommend you do the full tour so that you can see the ballroom on the top floor. It's pretty impactful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparrowFox
50,Amazing Piece of Architecture,I have bee dreaming of seeing this place for myself for many years. I am so glad that I finally made it. This structure is Amazing and it's position on the island facing the sea is just Breathtaking!This was indeed my Highlight and worth my entire trip from the East Coast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mytyia

50,Smooth,We had a smooth ride and on time round trip to Catalina Island. Friendly crew and clean accommodations. Can't complain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2181PPdavidt
40,Unique Facility with a Great Story,"On a day trip to Catalina I had reserved tickets for the Casino tour in Avalon. The tour was well worth the money ($11 prepaid) and Rebecca did a fine job of bringing this historic entertainment center to life. A beautiful theater and an amazing ballroom highlight the 45 minute tour. There is great history here from Wrigley's concept and construction of the facility to the big band dances that accommodated 3,000 dancers. If you're going to make the effort to go to Avalon take the time for this tour. I suggest prepaying online especially on days when cruise ships dock --quite a crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottR625
40,"Tour of Casino, a 1920's Wonder",Rebecca was our tour guide on 10/6/2015. She was very well informed and engaged with the folks on the tour. Highly recommend the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4620VVthomass

40,Catalina Casino,We took the tour and really enjoyed it. There is a lot of history to learn about the island that I had no idea about.The parties they must have had there! They place is really nice.The theater is incredible. The place is trimmed in real gold and silver with Tiffany lighting and fixtures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339rhondab
50,A jewel of history and class,"This is one of the most recognizable buildings in California, if not in the western United States. It has been in movies, advertisement, and has hosted some of the most famous big bands of the century. Many festivals and events have made this an amazing venue. There is so much to see inside, that the daily tour is very well worth the money. If you go to Catalina Island, don't miss this place. Go watch a movie, take the tour, go to an event, and take a picture. You'll always remember this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
50,So beautiful!,"We were lucky enough to get a free tour for our birthday - but even if you have to pay, this tour is worth it. This building and especially the ballroom are amazing. You will learn a little history and feel like you are stepping back in time. Don't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/We3luv2travel
50,The movie theatre is the best place to visit.,We were surprised that you can't place bets at this Casino - just dance! You have to go up fairly steep runways to reach the dance floor. The murals in the movie theatre were beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242ellenk
50,Casino stands for a place to gather and entertainment so do not expect gambling.,Santa Catalina Island Tours offer a very informative tour of the history of the Casino. It is very beautiful. The movie theatre is amazingly elegant where you can view a current movie nightly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckahla
40,THE Must See Avalon Attraction,"This Art Deco / Mediterranean Revival style monument is worth spending some time at. Take a tour, take some pictures, take in a movie, and take a dip!- The City of Avalon Dive Park is right outside. Ask when the organist will be rehearsing and go see a movie that evening, they'll let you in 1 hour early to enjoy the music!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyG555
50,Beautiful building!,The Avalon Casino is such a glorious old building! We had the pleasure of seeing a first run movie in the working movie theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506RebeccaW
50,Don't bypass the Casino!,"A must-see on your visit...take the time for the 40 minute tour of this landmark, BEAUTIFUL building which includes the movie theater and dance hall, where all the big names came to party and dance the night away back in the days of old Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstoochie
50,Lots of history,"What a beautiful building and such rich history from the average ""joe"" to movie stars. Rebecca was an amazing guide. We missed out on the longer tour, but I highly recommend that one. Get your tickets early in the day, tours sell out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandra608
40,Wonderful tour of an amazing place,"Unfortunately, our travel plans did not allow for us to actually see a movie or other performance here, and we left regretting it. The Casino is an very unusual building with a fascinating history, and our tour guide did a great job of helping us to understand the architectural features of the place.The 40 minute tour was just about the right length for us. We saw the lobby, theater, and ballroom and went out onto the balcony. All have stories behind them that make this a very interesting place to visit. There's a nice view of Avalon from the balcony.Note that the ballroom is above the movie theater and on the tours, you walk up several long ramps (think of the type in older baseball stadiums) to get there. My wife walks with a cane and managed okay, but it might be a challenge to some people. Wheelchairs can go up the ramps though a companion to help push might be desirable. They do not use the one small elevator for the tours and I do not know whether they'd make an exception for a handicapped person.Before or after your tour, you might want to see the small museum in the basement, around the right side of the Casino. We found it quite worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94741233
50,I recommend attending a concert of the fabulous Pipe Organ,"We go to Catalina Island every year around Labor Day. It is one big party! Among the attractions I so enjoy is the Pipe Organ in the Casino. The organist is one of those rare musicians who can play the 85 year old vintage organ. He is amazing to watch. There are about 4 keyboards and many pull out knobs that mimic brass, percussion, strings, etc. He plays tunes from the era of the organ so you can imagine what it was like before the talkie movies. The casino is a museum in itself. The movie theater plays contemporary films and there is only one large hall, but we go for the organ concert and usually leave when the film starts if we don't like the particular film playing. This is truly a unique experience. There are so few of these organs that can still play left in the world and I hope that Catalina always supports the upkeep of their wonderful Casino and organ. It is a treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanochka
50,The 40 minute tour... wanted more : ),"Our tour guide Rebecca was amazing. Great voice (she sang a few songs!!) and handled our group like a pro. A few people brought there 1-3 year olds (BAD IDEA) that disrupted her, but she handled it great! An amazing tour... crazy history!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richardriverajr
50,Don't miss the casino tour,"Had a fantastic tour with Rebecca. Very interesting history and stories about both casino and island. Also about the construction , great place and tour by Rebecca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1119WHbarbaras
40,Imagining the celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s at Depression-proof Catalina.,"We took a docent guided tour of the Casino, theatre, ballroom and behind the scenes dressing room. The building is well maintained and the original design is a gorgeous example of 1920s Art Deco in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelatC3755PC
50,Beautiful historical site,"I never imagined that building could be so beautiful on the inside. I thought it was just going to be an old theatre - wrong! Definitely worth the tour. And it's free on your birthday! Lots of history, gorgeous wood, interesting architecture. Rebecca was our guide, she had plenty of knowledge and a great singing voice too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noelle310
50,Casino Ballroom Tour,"Take the tour! It is worth every penny. The Casino Ballroom is so tall it looks over the Bay and not only provides spectacular views, but makes for a perfect place to hold that very special event. It is truly a beautiful place and great tour guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyZ246
50,If you are in Avalon you gotta see the Casino!!!,What an incredible building!!! You must take the tour! Bring your camera and take tons of pictures. The museum and gift shop is a must. The little restaurant just outside has great fish and chips. Be sure to look back at Avalon when you go out on the deck next to the ballroom and take a picture. Amazing!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohart2
40,A Quick Visit and Tour,"Right off the Catalina Express we walked to the Casino from the landing, in time for a 40 minute tour of this place.Not to be missed, an engineering fete managed by the Wrigley's of Chicago in the early 20th century, with a lovely museum-type theater with a rare organ, and a ballroom and outdoor balcony with many great sites of Avalon and its harbor.An engineering marveled well worth visiting and one we definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25denniss
50,Great place to see.,Built back in the 1920's as a dance hall and movie theater. The art deco is great to see. Tour was 40 minutes long and shows both the theater and ball room. Be prepared to do some climbing as there are at least four long ramps to get to the ball room. The view from the top is great. The ball room takes you back to the time of the big bands. Looking out from the ball room you can see most of Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjk9999
50,"Casino fantastic, guided tour not so much!","We took the behind the scenes tour. I have taken it before. This time the tour was disappointing as the guide spent most of the time talking about life on the island and less about the juicy stories ""behind the scenes"" at the Casino. It seemed as though she either was new at the presentation or just going through the motions for the tourists. Anyway if you get the right guide I can assure you the tour is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonS383
50,A must see,"This was a highlight of our trip to Catalina. The first part was a tour of the beautiful movie theater with its colorful murals all around the walls. Our guide told us the history of the building and reminded us that it is still a functioning movie theater with a new movie showing each week. We walked up several wide ramps to reach the actual Casino - Ballroom and it is impressive. One can really imagine the 6,000 dancers having fun in the old days. Our guide told stories about the ballroom and we were able to view some old photos on display. Great fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandybP9942XQ
50,"A casino where there is no gambling, but well worth the visit.",Full of history and the tour was educational and informative. Saw the ballroom and the auditorium. The ramps to walk up to the upper decks was very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80ricks80
40,Great tour,Interesting building and history of the island. The tour was great and the behind the scenes part of the theater was great to see as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingJohnB80
50,The tour of this place is A+,The tour we took was very well done. The building is rich in history and I especially liked the architecture. lighting and photos. The theatre itself is awesome with super art work and an old grand organ.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartca
50,Behind the Scene Tour Affordably Worth It- Not a Gambling Casino!,"The Casino building is amazing. They spared no expense when they built this place in the 20's! I love historic 20's architecture. This is not a Casio as we know it no gambling at this place, they explained Casino was a gathering place. I loved the painting on the ceiling in the theater and the art deco chandelier in the ballroom upstairs. It was interesting to see the old backdrops and system behind the stage and the eras of film projectors in the screen room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winecountryseeker
20,Waste of time,"There should be an option to pay an admission fee to view the Casino with a supervisor, instead of a tour guide. I learned more about the Island and the Casino in my first five minutes on the island than spending 30 minutes on this tour.The tour guide, Rebecca, added no value. She rushed us through every room on the tour and talked more about herself than anything of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffrM1197LF
50,Tour is worth taking,"You can pick up a ""passport"" on the green pier and it has a half-price coupon for the discovery tour. Seeing this building and learning it's history was a highlight of our stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abiquiu
50,"Catalina Island, California","We, my wife, I and two beautiful 10 and 3 years old grand-daughters packed luggage and headed on to Avalon city at the Catalina Island in Pacific Ocean off Dana Point, CA for three wonderful week end days! It was a first time with these adorable grand-kids and more than five times for my wife and I. The climate was a little overcast and wet for sometimes but it didn't affect our plans at all. The whole time was dedicated to the girls who enjoyed the safari by Sea, the submarine adventure was awesome and the Nautilus vessel was impressive! The girls had fun swimming at the Avalon Harbor and the fishing experience was excited and productive! The transportation by golf carts unique! We toured the city and surroundings. We shop, eat excellent food, tasted great ice-creams and walked a lot admiring historic landmarks and exclusive hillside estates. Our accommodation at the Pavilion Hotel was excellent.In closing, I highly recommended visiting this magnificent Island of Catalina located one and a half hour away from the California shore!Edward A. Nieto",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864edwardn
20,"It's all about ME...well, no it isn't!","We were interested in the history of the Casino, the most notable landmark on the island, and decided to take the 40 minute tour. Our tour guide was a woman in her 60s I'd say named Rebecca who is probably a perfectly nice person, but she is in the wrong job! The only two real areas that you see on the tour (which I believe was about $12 per person) are the theater and the ballroom. Both are magnificent, but we really didn't learn that much about anything beyond the basics of year built, price and how people used to dance in the ballroom (duh!). What we did learn is that our tour guide is a former high school teacher and coach, has a big voice and prides herself on ordering her tour to pay attention, fancies herself an historian, and really likes tips! Yes, she practically asked for a tip! At one point in the ballroom, she totally embarrassed a guy, probably also in his 60s by making him dance with her...he was not a dancer. Then she finished by singing some phrase of a song that was inscribed on a wall and passing out her personal business cards instructing us all to share with any Hollywood agents we might know! Are you kidding me? She wrapped-up the tour in 30 minutes, not 40, and never even addressed one of the biggest questions: How was this a legal casino if this was before California allowing Indian gaming? We learned more on Google than this tour. Turns out that in Italian Casino refers to a gathering place and has nothing to do with gambling. BTW, they show movies every night in the theater....Google the history and go see a movie. Don't waste your money on the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martik2014
40,Nostalgic Theater,"We decided to take the grand kids to a Disney movie one night. This is my 8th trip to Catalina and my 1st visit to the Casino / Theater. Wow it was so cool inside. Either take the tour or go see a movie. A lot of 1930's memorably, hand carved theater seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/807philipk
40,Beautiful,I took a tour of the Casino while I was on Catalina. I loved the history of it all and the building itself with the Art Decco design was breathtaking. I think it is very worth while to view this historical building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jemetta
30,Expected more from this icon but glad I saw it,"As the iconic image of the island and an expensive admission for guided tour, I was expecting quite a bit more of an art deco beauty. The most architectural gems are on the building exterior so the tour isn't entirely necessary. The theatre is beautiful but would have rather seen a movie there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
50,Great place to see a movie,"Go see all the murals and tile work inside and outside the casino!Beautiful!! The inside of the casino is beautiful like the old movie theaters use to be. The movies are geared for children also,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraw166
40,Must see!,Even if you just walk around the outside of the building it's worth the walk down here.A ticket buys real glimpses of a bygone era and why we liked it so much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292debbieh
50,Beautiful piece of history,"What can you say about such a beautiful place?The casino was the first of many stops on our trip to Catalina. It was built in the 20's and has so many art deco pieces it made me smile! (I love art deco)We took the casino tour and it was amazing to say the least. We climbed so many stairs, walked right onto the stage of the theater and even danced under the 20's style chandelier in the ballroom. We loved it so much we are making plans to go back for their big New Years Eve party.If you want to take a walk into the past please see the Casino you haven't discovered Catalina without it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mryme
50,USC Trojan Marching Band Concert A Must,"Over the Fourth of July, the USC Band and Song Girls have been part of the Parade and Concert/BBQ/Fireworks Show for over a quarter of a century. It is a great time in an iconic venue that hosted the great big bands of the past. A must for this weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrederickBurg
50,A casino with soul,"We took a tour of the casino with a novice guide. The surroundings were most interesting, the narration less so. The building is an extraordinary piece of architecture, and the grand ballroom affords a stunning view of the bay of Avalon. I would definitely recommend taking the tour.If you do that, you can skip seeing the movie (we paid for seeing Jurassic World the night before, not knowing the theatre would be part of the tour.) SKIP THE MOVIE if the title doesn't appeal to you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KFM214
40,Interesting history,"Enjoyed the tour through this interesting casino, although it is no longer a casino. Special events, dances, etc. are held here. It is also a movie theater for the locals. It is certainly worth the inexpensive amount to take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895marlenep
50,Beautiful and original beauty,"Great walking tour which included the museum. We did the longer tour and we saw the movie theater, dressing rooms, projection rooms and the ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robininfresno
50,Historic,We watched a movie in the Casino. The theater is very old and historic. Before the movie begins and organist plays live music from an old organ at the foot of the stage. Very interesting architecture. The theater has a seating capacity of 1100 people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brollins
50,Thank you Rebecca!,"Rebecca led us on the Experience tour on 6/30/15, and it was very enjoyable. She moved us along quickly so that we could fit a lot into the 30 minute tour. She was knowledgeable and friendly, and even treated us to a dance and a song!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg2LD
30,The main thing to see in Catalina,Not a casino as in gambling. Simply a building in the round. It has lots of history and I have enjoyed seeing it a couple of times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641lindad
50,"Casino Means ""Gathering Place!""","I have visited the Casino on Catalina Island many times and having just been there a day ago I decided to finally review this attraction. First of all the word ""Casino"" means gathering place in Italian. This casino has always only been a place of gathering, there was never any gambling at this venue. The casino boasts a 6000 person ballroom on the top floor. On the ground floor there is a theater where they change the movie once a week. They only show one film at a time. They do offer a tour of the casino, and there is a museum that you can look through as well for a small fee. The Avalon Casino is a rich part of the history of Catalina Island. I have read some reviews here where some have said it is not a Casino and in the sense of what people think of when they hear that word it is not. This Casino is still a gathering place and it is a short walk from Crescent Street the Main Street in Avalon. The Bay in front of the building is a popular spot for scuba divers and you can also sit and watch people dive. If you are visiting Avalon walk to the gathering place and imagine it in the early days after it was built. You will be glad you saw it up close and in person. Make sure to stop near the box office and see the tile frescos such as the famous Catalina Mermaid!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodvilencia
50,Great tour,You learn a lot about Catalina on this tour Was really fun to see the big ball room at the top of the casino. Also the theatre is so pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancesG_12
50,Great historic place to see a movie,"We saw a movie on a Sunday night and really enjoyed the organ concert that preceded our showing and the theater is just really spectacularly decorated. Since we didn't have time to take a tour, seeing a movie was great way to experience the casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigerfan85
40,See it to appreciate the history of Catalina Island,"This building is pretty cool, but what makes it a ""must see"" is the role it played in the development of Catalina Island. We were staying overnight, so we went to the movie showing in the theater that evening. We went early to enjoy the pre-show organ concert and study the amazing murals painted around the huge theater. The next day, we went on the short guided tour, which really added only the ballroom to what we had already seen--maybe not worth the price of the tour since everything the guide told us can be found online. I thought the ballroom would be much fancier than it is. If you are not going to the movie, I do recommend you take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blaze-21
50,"Beautiful Architecture, Old World Charm","We've been going to Catalina for many years and have always enjoyed seeing all the sites. One of the most beautiful and definitely one of the oldest places of architecture on the island is the Casino. It houses the theater on the main floor as well as the museum which is on the outside. The theater has gorgeous, hand-carved, wooden architecture. Every Friday night a new movie is highlighted for anyone who wishes to attend. Most movies are older but entertaining. The entrance fee is only a few dollars. There are many beautiful pieces of artwork and paintings as well as the incredible, old world charm. On the top floor is the old dance floor which is made of special wood and designed so that no matter how much noise and stomping is being done on the top floor, it can't be heard on the first floor of the theater. The views from the top are incredible! There are tours daily and well worth every penny. You can't go to Catalina and not tour that famous casino. There is amazing history here in addition to stories told of the days gone by when movie stars would be brought over by boat from the roaring 20's through the 1960's. There is so much to see it can't all be told here. You have to go see for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289martib
50,Great tour - movie nights available,"Great tour of an historic, beautiful building that is not a casino. Single tour available or combine with movie night to view. Upstairs ballroom was used in the big band days for dances. The movie theatre is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brillfrogs1
50,A Southern California Treasure!,"This is an iconic and historic structure, and also a very cool place to see a movie! The theater inside the casino shows first-run movies, which at certain show times are preceded by someone playing an authentic organ, like they did during the silent-movie era. The decor inside is period and incredibly ornate, so get there early to appreciate the decor and the music. This is also a venue for formal balls and galas (the Marine Corps has an annual black tie ball here).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SACNORAD
40,Casino Theater,"At the time that we traveled to Catalina, Avalon Grille was doing a deal where you could eat at their restaurant and get free movie tickets. I would have paid to just get into the casino theater. It is stadium seating with very decorative walls and ceiling -- very beautiful. There was an organ player playing music before the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicki820
50,The only real Must See in Avalon,"A short walk out Casino Way. We were there for the 2:00 PM short tour ($12, 45 min.) on a Wednesday in June. Got there early to check out the old cafe west of the Casino building; it is Closed for now. No problem -- just continue on past the Casino down to Descanso Beach, which has a nice little pocket beach and a pleasant bar.The tour itself takes you into the magnificent movie theater on the ground floor of the Casino building. They show movies nightly at 7:30 (Jurassic World was there at the time); would be worth it if you're there for a few days. Then you walk up a series of ramps to the Ballroom, built above the theater, which is glorious. Reminiscent of Catalina's glory days. They claim 6,000 people were on the dancefloor at once; I kinda doubt that, but you can count 'em in one of the photos. Might require the two big steamers that used to ferry passengers to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metlc
50,"A Must, Must see! !",If there is anything you MUST do on Catalina Island!!!! The Casino is not a Casino like we have in Vegas. It has a movie theater that we just love even if the movie is terrible. A classic style theater. A beautiful venue that hosts dancing and music in a style of a Golden Age. It's a museum all on it's own. It has the architectural structure of genius. It's easy to understand how so many can actually love a building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicCouple
20,An Ok Way to See the Casino and Ballroom,"My husband and I happened by about 5 minutes before the tour started so we paid the $12 each and joined in. The history of this beautiful theater and event venue is interesting and the building is no doubt beautiful inside and out. We loved the black walnut, art deco paintings, sterling silver and gold leaf stars on the ceiling, the long ramps to the ballroom, the organ, lighting, Tiffany Lights, huge round ballroom and balcony. Our guide was good, moved at a nice pace, answered most questions without a problem. Her helper, however, was extremely annoying. We had barley started walking into the theater and she shouted a warning that later we have 10 stories to walk up and we'd better keep it moving (!!!). She said this again, very loudly, a couple more times. I wanted to say, ""Hey, lady, we just paid $24 to take a look around this nice building and hear a few facts, not be yelled at every five minutes."" I know she was just doing her job but it felt like we were being scolded. It actually made everyone on the tour very quiet. Our guide later asked why we were such a quiet group. Who would want to slow down the tour by asking questions after being told to hurry up 3 times? I guess I saw what I wanted, learned what I could - but it wasn't as pleasant as it could have been. I would have gotten more out of it google search + a visit to the theater for a movie/organ concert + an event in the Ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelVal
50,So Interesting to Learn of Catalina History,"When I booked this tour, I really didn't expect much but I was wrong! I enjoyed a tour by Rebecca. She was very knowledgeable of the historical virtues of the Casino and the city of Catalina. We went into the main theater and up to the ballroom above, I even got to dance with Rebecca on the dance floor! There was more to learn but for the sake of time it was kept to one hour. There are several tours available, any of them are well worth the small cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kansasboy2011
50,This Should Be Your First Stop!,"Fantastic tours and museum give great retrospective on significance of Casino Building to Catalina Island. Also, importance of Catalina in California History.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WiseFox
40,Beautiful!,"The mural painted on the walls of the casino was incredible! Just to hear how this building was built, is such an interesting story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckiesandiego
40,Casino museum,"I wanted a tour of the whole place, which is available, but it was closed on June 1, 2015, thanks to an event over the weekend. I paid $5 for the little museum on site and enjoyed what I learned there. Took me about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susantK1403VU
50,Piece of history,"Great architecture, and the great bands played there back in the day. Still has evening dances, but I just went on the tour. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John_Rethorst
50,Behind the Scenes Tour was excellent!,"Loved this tour...the Casino theater was the Best as well as the Grand Ballroom and the scenery from each window was beautiful and breathtaking!If you have a chance, see a movie and hear the organ in the theater...it has 1,184 seats and it is an experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmakhoul
50,Backstage visit,"The tour was great for people who have not been able to visit the Casino before. We had just found out that it wasn't a gambling casino on the ferry trip over! Mind boggling how quickly this impressive architecture came together and how beautiful it remains to this day. We even paid to see a movie we had no interest in to see how the theater looked in action (and the organ player). The tour (extended) was worth it. The movie and organ.. ehh- wouldn't do that again, but was fun to see it all. We thought it was well worth the price and time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RRRCA
40,Cool old place,Cool place to come watch a movie in a big theater. Come early to hear the organ player bust out some tunes before the movie. Don't pay for the behind the scenes Casino tour... way overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lclosner8
50,A Last Minute Success!,"I wanted to extend a sincere thank you to the tour staff over at the Casino for the 40 minute walking tour! We brought a school group of twenty to the Casino to show them some of the history of Avalon, and were able to be accommodated quickly! It was a last minute decision due to rains requiring a trip into the interior to be reworked. We want to thank Eric for making this a possibility for us. At the end of the day, almost half of the students said their favorite part of the full day trip was the tour of the Casino building.For me personally, this was my second time taking the walking tour and I feel like I have learned so much more! Rebecca, our tour guide, was both hilarious and informative. She did an excellent job at keeping everyone's attention and kindly keeping our students on task.I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Avalon. If you have the 30-40 minutes, just make it a stop on your way out to Descanso Beach Club!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostCoastWanderer
50,a look back in time,"I think you should take this tour if you like history. I enjoyed it, but I could see if you're part of the ""younger"" generation or if you don't appreciate the older generation, this could be boring for you. When I stepped on the ballroom floor, I felt like I was living in the 1930s. I went back for the 7:30pm movie showing that night. You should definitely make time to see a movie here, beautiful theater. Tickets are $15...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanM779
50,Well worth it,"Took the ""Behind the Scenes "" tour Our tour guide Rebecca was excellent . Be prepared to walk. Great history, architect, amazing building. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mets51
50,The walking tour was the highlight of our Catalina visit,"A talented docent takes you around the stunning art-deco structure, sharing the details, the history and making it all come alive in a light-hearted fashion. Its a medium size group, easy enough to make the walk and hear and see everything. This is your only chance to see the grand hallways, theater, banquet area and awesome historic photographs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4250VGchristopherk
40,Santa Catalina Island Company Casino Tour,"Wow it was really interesting. Tons of history there. Silver, gold tiffany lamps and an amazing theatre and ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177catherinek
50,Nostalgic,Don't miss this one. Lots of history. A great place. Takes you right back in time. Architect is simply amazing. Take the time to see a movie there also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421jeanninec
40,Great Stop to Learn the History of Catalina,"We loved the preservation efforts of the members. The building is well cared for. The small museum chronicles the history of the island including the days of movie stars frolicking on its shores, to now. There is also a gift shop where some local artists show their wares. Cost of admission of $7.00 is very reasonable. Had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnM104
40,Enjoyed the short tour...,"We opted for the shorter of two tours to see this Catalina landmark. The building is not generally open to the public...one must take a tour or attend an event to go inside. I think our tour guide was Barbara (short dark hair with shock of white in front...very pretty). She was fabulous. A local with lots of good anecdotes, she didn't let an injured foot stop her one bit! We saw the stunning Art Deco features in the theater and climbed the ramps to the top to see the dance floor and priceless Tiffany light fixtures. We also saw photos and plans of the design and construction and learned how that dance floor managed to hold up under the weight of 4,000+ dancers. Very interesting and worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracebeavis
50,"No matter what movie is playing, go!","The art deco inside the movie theatre, not to mention the hallways outside and the popcorn/candy counter are all so photo worthy! The really comfy seats are toward the back, but there's really no place in the theatre with a bad view of the starry ceiling and the fantastic murals. As the movie is about to begin, note the changing colours as they dim the lights. On Saturdays, someone plays the old piano that was once used during the showing of silent movies. It's a great bonus experience. Note there are matinees and cheaper Tuesday tickets. If you happen to be in Avalon during the annual health fair, do yourself a favour and attend. It's held in the breathtaking casino ballroom and it's free. Usually held in April, we missed it this year when they moved the date to early May. There's also a casino tour you can take. Remember, this is not a gambling casino! We overheard someone saying they planned to gamble; 'casino' means 'gathering place.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/getgoingCanada
30,Not so impressed,"It was not the facility, but it was the guide we were assigned. The facility was amazing with great history. There are other guides available. I would recommend the tour though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeromeR841
50,Do the behind the scenes tour,This was much more fun than I thought it was going to be.Over the years... not knowing the history of the Casino... I thought it was a gambling casino... and had no wish to see it.Our Friend who we were celebrating a birthday with... knew all about it... and insisted we go on a tour.Rebecca out tour guide was a hoot... and we had a wonderful time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpguess
50,Catch a movie and you'll see the inside,"We had planned to purchase tickets to tour the inside of the Casino when one of the locals suggested we buy movie tickets instead and this would allow us enjoy the inside for a little longer, cheaper and more personalized experience. It was a great tip and I would recommend it for anyone staying more than one day (if you're there for a day trip, stick with the structured tours of the Casino). We enjoyed a nice movie and took plenty of pictures before and after the movie. The price of the movie was consistent with what we pay on the mainland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399
50,Take the extended tour!,"We took the basic tour 25 years ago and were hesitant to pay the higher price for the full one hour tour. Best money spent on the island! Our tour guide Rebecca was such a doll and gave us a sampling of her amazing singing voice! The extended tour takes you to all the levels including the dressing rooms, the Wrigley family private viewing room, the projection room and of course the theatre and ball room. Gorgeous architecture and decor and fascinating history. Thanks Rebecca!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7942AKtracyw
40,The Gathering Place of Avalon Santa Catalina Island,"Many ticketed events year around. We love the Jazz Trax festival in October. Concerts, tours and museum. Amazing views from the upstairs ballroom! Historic museum and tours available daily. I would rate an excellent except the casino requires rest room maintenance as soon as possible. It is a shame that the problem was not addressed for this Catalina icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjoc738
40,Beautiful place,"The place is beautiful, the views from here were amazing. We went back to watch a movie here and the sound was great. An organist played before the movie,we had a great evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackiW622
40,Dressing room tour,the stairs can be a challenge if you have health problems. If you can pace yourself it is well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookies575
40,Historic architecture,The tour guide was informative and entertaining. It is an amazing building! The artwork is exquisite. It is not a gambling venue; it contains a movie theater and a fabulous ballroom. The museum is worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJHohman
40,Was Only Open at a Selected Time,"I was able to finally get a chance to gamble on the Island after the Casino was closed for an extended period of time. This was back in 2001 however, so I' sure the environment has improved!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcrees2
50,Casino Tour,"The tour was great! Rebecca gave a fantastic presentation and rich history of the Casino. She was so lively, funny, warm and informative! What a great way to spend my birthday this year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelletE9374MH
50,Behind the Scenes Tour,"Excellent tour with access to areas of this iconic building off limits to the public. We had Bridgette as our guide and she was so involved in the history and beauty of the Casino we ran 10 min. Over, which was fine with us. Views from the Ballroom balconies are breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verachildress
50,Go See a Movie at The Casion,"If you're in Avalon for a day or two, be sure to go see a movie at The Casino. The theater is gorgeous inside with incredibly vivid murals, starts twinkling in the ceiling and, if you're lucky, a organist playing some old Hollywood tunes before your movie begins. The picture quality is fantastic and the popcorn is hot and fresh! Movie is at 7:30 every night, tickets are $15 and can be purchased at the box office right before the show. I believe there are also matinees on the weekend. This is also a great way to see the inside of the casino without taking a tour (although you will not get to see the ballroom upstairs).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefabforneret
50,Stunning location! Must See,"The Catalina Island Casino tour is absolutely stunning. You MUST take at least the 30 minute tour. With that tour they show you the theatre, and the ballroom. The murals are so beautiful in the theatre, and they allow pictures! The ballroom is huge, and you can just picture the dances that used to take place in there...and they still do one now and then to raise funds to keep the casino up and running.The 30 minute tour is only $12!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Checkers_Domino
50,Beautiful Art,"When visiting Catalina Island, you must stop at the Casino for an inside tour. The fresco's covering the ceiling and walls are spectacular. Standing at the center of the theater you will hear an echo ‚Ä¶ starting first with your footsteps, than your voice. It's amazing. What a wonderful piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiheiSands
30,So What?,I made the mistake of trekking out to the casino from the ferry dock without checking the times for tours first. Big mistake. Tours are only scheduled at intervals and you better know what they are or you'll be out of luck as I was. One tour started at 12:30 or so and the next was at 3pm. Are you kidding? I have to be back at the boar by 4pm. No luck for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surfpinky
40,Art Deco,We loved the architecture and the 1929 pipe organ. Check for times for when they play the organ. We watched a movie. There are tour available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorena713
50,Take the tour,"The main rooms of this place are absolutely beautiful! Really enjoyed the inner chambers, where all the workers made all the entertainment for the masses happen. The old equipment used to run the theatre portion and...want to know more, take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goosefarm
40,Nice visit,"We only visited the museum, did not tour the theater or see a movie. Had some interesting displays about the island, the Wrigley's and the Chicago Cubs. If you want a little history about the island and it's famous visitors stop in and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benandme53
50,Behind the Scenes Tour - EXCELLENT!!!,"We took the behinds the scene tour and it was pretty neat! Got to see the projector room for the theater, the viewing room the Wrigley's use/used, some make-up/dressing rooms and the ballroom. A must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joey22latin
50,A must see!,Took my group to visit the casino. In my opinion it is a must see on your trip to Catalina. The tour is about 40 minutes and you get a lot of history about the early days. This place has a huge theater with amazing acoustics. Go to a movie if you have a chance. Amazing. The only thing Wrigley was completely wrong on was the number of restrooms they would need for the amount of people. Great place worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Molly1girl
50,Beautiful art deco structure,30 minute tour of the casino was great. The theater is worth the cost alone. Gorgeous structure; built by Mr. Wrigley in 1928. Easy walk from downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgepatsye
40,The roof of the theater is gorgeous,"An iconic landmark in the Island. The theater is old and charming; the weekend I was there, they were airing American Sniper. Didn't watch it then as I had already watched it the previous week, but must have been such a treat for those who did. The walkway leading up to the Casino, via Casino, is lined with beautiful well manicured palm trees and a drop off to the habor full off boats. It's a beautiful place, but don't expect too much besides the history and beautiful decor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simplyfanu
50,A true Landmark,"If you love historic places then this is one place you have to see and visit. Built in 1928 it still has all its charm and decor . You must go on the tour. Only down side is when we went, they only had one a tour a day at 11 am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samuelm641
50,Great movie theater,"I saw American Sniper at the Casino while on the island. The live organ music that's playing when you first enter while waiting for the previews is almost surreal. Though the seats are a throwback to old cinemas, the Casino offered a beautiful place with great acoustics to see a movie. It's right on the water and an enjoyable walk to/from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16paulg
40,A grand old building,Visited this grand old building and had a dinner in the main grand hall. The view at night from the wrap around balcony was of a full moon with a cruise ship anchored off shore. The old photos on the floor below show of great old times of late nights dancing and enjoying life.The cinema was showing a movie down stairs so we couldn't see inside but presume it is just as grand. An Art Deco themed building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Munro76
50,Go on the Tour,What a quick but informative hour tour. It was chalked full of history and the building is just not what I expected once we got inside. I do love that it has ramps just like Wrigley Field :)Must do it again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBear227
50,Love it,"no dislike, everything about this iconic landmark is fascinating, and going to the Jazz Festival in the ballroom every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlwtaw9493
50,Casino,"Took a tour. Stunning. Organ concert magical. Saw a great movie and had stars twinkling overhead. The history, craftsmanship, ocean views were awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelly1portland
50,"Somewhat rushed, but amazing building","We only had time for the 30 minute tour, but thoroughly enjoyed the presentation.The docent, Rebecca, was well versed in the history of the casino and did an excellent job passing on the interesting historical tidbits. She moved us alone at a clip, but was necessary to get it all in in the allotted time. An absolutely amazing building- to think builders finished it in 14 months! Quite a feat for 1929. Don't leave Catalina without taking one of the casino tours. And hope you get Rebecca as your guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159judyg
50,"Tour, movie",I did the background tour. Interesting history. Also went to a movie and on weekend they have an organist playing the organ an hour prior to movie. Quite nice. Also the Theater is huge and the acoustics were wonderful for the movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808erict
50,Theater and Ballroom Tour,The theater and ballroom were both awesome. Money well spent for this tour! Both of these were huge. The outside of the theater and entrance to the theater inside had awesome artwork. The ballroom is 10 high and you climb ramps all the way up but it really was all that bad even though I am a person 60+ and use a walking cane I made it with no problem....good exercise!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melban711
50,Uncommon beauty and craftsmanship,Take the tour (with Rebecca if you can; she's a real hoot and will belt out a song at the drop of a hat) to see the gorgeous workmanship of this building up close. They really don't make 'em like this anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicmarsojourn
30,Nice landmark,It was a nice land mark in catalina Island. Good tour of the casinoNice theatre but no gambling Nothing to see much there.it's just a hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anupama27
50,Beautiful Theatre,"The design of this theatre was copied by the architect of Radio City Music Hall. Built by the Wrigley family in the late 1920's, they spared no expense in creating a fabulous palace for entertainment on Catalina Island. I recommend the ""behind the scenes"" tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WolfgangThis
40,Nice 30 min tour,Enjoyed the 30 min tour of the Casino with our tour guide Rebecca. We toured the downstairs theatre and upstairs ballroom dancing area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krempert
40,Discover the Casino Tour,Use your complimentary passport book to save on this short 30 minute tour. Gives you an overview of the Casino and a chance to see the theater and ballroom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wavcpa
50,History and Architecture,"I am a history buff so I have visited the Casino building and taken tours of it many times. The Avalon Theater, on the ground floor is unique. The deco murals are magnificent and the silver leafed ceiling with twinkling stars is impressive. Check out the theater organ being played before weekend showings in the theater to get an idea of what this instrument can do and what it was like to view silent movies with the organ playing. The upstairs ballroom is still one of the largest in the world. You can almost hear the big bands playing from the 30s and 40s. The view from the ballroom balcony is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerrywHamilton
50,"Great short tour, well worth the time","The iconic casino of Catalina island offers a 30 minute tour for $10 per person. It is well worth the time and money. The tour includes the cinema, soda shop/bar area, and ballroom. Most of the 1920's building has the original fixtures and wood. It is a beautiful snapshot of a bygone era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tostrand
20,Review of casino MUSEUM,"We bought tickets at the casino museum thinking these included getting to see the ballroom. Beware they do not. The museum is very very small and we would have never gone except that our son wanted to see the ballroom. We never did see the ballroom as you have to pay a separate price at a different part of the building. Since the museum is so tiny, and it's in the casino building, I think getting to SEE casino bldg would be a reasonable thing to include in the price or make it free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607nanc
50,Great 45 min tour with Rebecca,We had always wanted to visit Avalon and finally got an opportunity to do so. The casino (what we would call a party house with a dance floor and movie theater) was build in the art deco style and is steeped in history. Rebecca our tour guide brought the place alive and was extremely knowledgeable about the place. The art work is fantastic. There are some long ramps to walk up and a fair amount of walking but anyone in reasonable shape will not have any problems. There is less walking than you do to find your seat at a football game. The stories of the construction and celebrities that came to the place make the history come alive. Ask Rebecca to sing! Overall a great tour at a reasonable cost. At 45 min the tour is short. You could spend a lot more time here but they keep the tour group moving. Purchasing the tour ticket gets you $1 off admission to the museum in the lower level. (They don't tell you that if you go to the museum first),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hiker-7
40,Casino,"Interesting, if you're a first time visitor. I suggest you do the guided tour, very informative. The museum, for a $5 fee, has a lot of interesting trivia information as well, especially about old actors and actresses, like Marilyn Monroe. You need at least 2 hours to see everything, including a short walk to the Descanso Gardens. Great family activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joseb749
40,"It's not a casino, it's a movie theatre and museum! :)","The tour of the casino is very interesting. Wear comfortable shoes though! If you are staying in Avalon long enough, go see a movie here. It's art deco - gorgeous! The ceiling even ""twinkles"". We saw the MockingJay Part 1 (Hunger Games) there over Thanksgiving and it was a treat. Hard to hear, though, maybe because the equipment is so old. The Catalina Island Museum is worth seeing also. Even the gift shop is worth seeing! If nothing else, go to the east side of the casino and spend some time sitting on the bench. It faces Descano Beach Club and the ocean. You'll see lots of pelicans and other wildlife! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KWoodson
50,The Casino on Catalina Island,We took the Casino tour in November and got to see all of the floors where so much entertaining happened in the glory days. Marvelous wood work on the floors & ceilings. Great views from all of the windows and outside balconies! The guide was very knowledgeable and made our tour come alive. Lots of pictures and old billboards to fill in the history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294Judie
50,Art Deco at it's best,"As we stepped foot on the Island it became a magical day. Blue skies, temps in the 70's. We rented a golf cart and the the four (Family with us are from WA State) of us took a great tour around the Island, and I must say if you go to Catalina Island it is the only way to really see it all and take some beautiful pictures. As we finished our site seeing, we stopped at the ""Casino"" and decided to take the tour, (price was reasonable and if your a ""Senior"" you get a discount!) wow are we glad that we did. The Art Deco that is outside and inside the building is wonderful! The grand ballroom is beautiful, you can close your eyes and hear the music of Glenn Miller and see your parents dancing. (my parents went there and danced in the 1930's). Our tour guide was so helpful and told stories of long ago. The Theater was also beautiful, and they still show movies on a current basis. The ""Casino"" was never a Casino; In Italian Casino means a place of entertainment to dance or listen to music. Interesting information. So It's a grand place to visit, I highly recommend it, and we plan on going again, perhaps next year? I hope so. Amore'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannm816
10,take a hike,"First they did not change their marquee until after the tour was supposed to start they came out 5 min after the sign said the tour was going to start and said they forgot to update the day before, ruining our plans for the day. Their suggestion was to come back for the higher priced tour. Then the guide was not even into it. Bathroom and projector were both broken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arobertb
50,An apple of my eye,After many years of my last visit at this wonderful place... the great Catalina Island. My impression changed. It was great before but more impressive now because of this golf cart that you can use to go around the island on your own phase. My family who was visiting from Canada was so impressed either. You can see the real beauty of the island if you go up to the historic landmark. There's a lot of great restaurants you can choose from.This place was the apple of my eye big time!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506mariaf
50,Casino tour,"This is a must-do tour. Be sure to take the full length one to get the entire experience. The tour guide is great and has good knowledge. You will see so much fun history, hear great stories and I promise you won't be disappointed. The price is reasonable as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriD373
50,"Beautiful 1920's architecture, murals and history‚Ä¶A Wonderful place to relax.",Rebecca was our tour guide and very knowledgeable docent. She really inspired me to look more seriously at the art and history of this beautiful building. I brought my 9 and 11 year old girls and she kept them interested and asking questions. Greeat place to visit. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335ginac
30,A classic historic place in the island,"This is a classic historic place to tour and visit in the island. I also recommend renting a golf cart, doing the whole around the island tour and ending at the casino and eating at the restaurant that is right next to the casino by the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseR814

40,Worth a Visit if You're in Avalon a few Days,"I wouldn't put this at the top of my list for places to visit in Avalon, but it is a very interesting place with some fun history. We did the backstage tour and it was enjoyable, though not very memorable.If you enjoy quirky movie theaters, they still show movies, twice on Wednesday and Saturday, and once every other day. We didn't see a movie there, but imagine it would be a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ethanjdelano
50,Behind the Scenes Tour!,"Pay a little extra and do the behind the scenes tour, so worth it.

40,Classic architecture and lovely setting...,"O.K., I've done a variety of shows at this place. It's a bit long-in-the-tooth in terms of maintenance however it is a classic structure, a lovely location and worth a visit. They have added some film and tour ideas to their offering. Lots of scuba activity in back of the casino where you can rent gear and shore dive off of stairs leading to the water.

50,Very nice to explore,My wife and I had the opportunity to stay in Avalon on Catalina Island and while were were there we visited Catalina Island Casino. We enjoyed a jazz concert while there as well took a tour through the casino with one of the long time locals.

40,Catalina island 9/2014,"I took Catalina express from Long Beach to Catalina. Remember to book ticket on line, if not we always wait for at least 2 hours, Book two nights for a house at 219 Decanso st thru CIVR. The house has 4 bedrooms, 3 bathroom., spacious enough room and beds for 8 adults. There is no AC, only fan for every room. House is clean, have kitchen with microwave, stove....The location is very convinient, one minute to Von market and two minutes walking to the beach and center of island.The restaurant Lobter trap is rated #1, but the food is salty. The Blue ocean restaurant have a limited choice including hamburger and hot dog for dinner, Jack Daniel restaurant for breakfast and lunch but nothing to compare with IHOOP.The beach is crowded and a lot of rocks, We should wear water shoes while swimming. The water is warm.The Zipline is expensive $125 each person and must be booked ahead of time. Other activities mostly for children.

You can get a ferry from almost any port in southern Ca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DulcelelecheAngel
50,Diving,"A protected marine park is at the Catalina Island Casino (Casino Point). There are stairs that lead down into the water, which is awesome during high tide. Not so awesome in low tide; however better than crawling over the rocks. A very large grouper calls this park home. Wander around to the right to find the Jacques Cousteau memorial plaque. Venture around to find the two wrecks that are hidden within it's boundaries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleg592

50,Not to be missed!,"The beautiful Casino (not a gambling casino) is a must-see. Before you enter the building you will find great tilework and paintings in the arched entryway. There are spectacular Art Deco paintings and architectural details inside the theatre, and the walnut paneling in the lobby is amazing. They show one movie a week, and if the movie interests you in the slightest I recommend you buy a ticket. Go an hour early to the movie on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and you will be treated to a man playing the pipe organ in the front of the theater. You can also tour the casino, there are two available, we've only gone on the shorter casino tour that costs $10, which includes the impressive second floor ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilbert00

50,The Beautiful Catalina Island,"It has been awhile since we visited the Island. It has a wonderful and quaint village, it is so enjoyable to walk about the area.the Beautiful Building that is now a ""casino"" was attended by my parents in the 30's, and my brother took his date there for their Prom dance in the 40's. All the Big Bands played there. It was a grand place in it's day. We plan on going again in September I would love to see the Wrigley grounds, I hear the gardens are beautiful, the best way to see the attractions is to rent a golf cart, if you go with another couple the cost is not bad. I will update you when I get back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannm816
40,"""A Deco masterpiece!""","This tour is a good way to orient yourself on the history of Avalon when you first arrive. The short film is informative, and the theatre and ballroom are gorgeous and impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcmor
40,Beautiful Building--Tour Left Something to Be Desired,"The Casino building is beautiful and we highly recommend touring the interior, but do take the ""behind the scenes tour"" if you can. The regular tour is very hurried--we were told we couldn't even use the restrooms (not that we needed to, just giving an example :-)) b/c there was no time and everyone had to ""be out before the next tour"" which, I believe was over an hour later. We started in the lobby of the theater for a very quick overview, then on to the theatre for a short documentary about the Casino and the Island; up to the mid -level area, via multiple ramps, briefly, and then into the ballroom and out to the balcony. This tour should really be 45-50 minutes.I didn't get the impression the guide really wanted to be there giving the tour--someone who loves what they are doing can make all of the difference. Having said that, we still recommend taking the time to visit this beautiful building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurensaunt
50,No Slot Machines,"Not a gambling hall but a magnificently designed building in the grand style of the twenties. Take the tour. Massive, stunning grand ball room and theater are still in use for special events and weekly movies. Museum below is quaint and non-commercial and presents a good history of Catalina and its visitors. Views from the waterside walkways behind the building are not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamusb
50,Take the Tour,"It was never a gambling facility, but this historical building is a spectacular architectural masterpiece. Take the $10 tour to enjoy the history, the theatre, and the views. When you see the ballroom with its massive Tiffany chandelier, you are instantly transported back to the days of glamour. We definitely want to plan to attend one of Catalina‚Äôs big events, like their jazz festival. Our tour guide was Porschia and she was not only an inspired guide, but a terrific chanteuse. You'll get to take amazing photos from the outdoor walkway at the top with wrap around views of Avalon. Gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarLady99
50,Great Museum,"There is a very small museum on the side of this building. It had a great history of the island. Showed the many celebrities who used to come to the island years ago, Charlie Chaplin being one if the main characters. Lots of great photos. It was very inexpensive, only about $5 or $7 to enter. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debtaylor

50,Lovely Art Deco,"Bought tickets online a month in advance - and the tour times changed! Double check times when you arrive on island so you don't miss it. Luckily we caught the Behind the Scenes tour and loved the theater, ballroom, and other private rooms. Guide was informative and funny. This is the crown jewel of Catalina, so everyone should go on one of the tours to see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristio329
40,30 minute tour,"The casino is such a focal point of Avalon that we decided we really wanted to take a tour and see the inside. The behind the scenes tour was already sold out for the day so we settled for the 30 min. tour. We got to see the beautiful movie theatre and lobby and the incredible dance floor upstairs. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable, we learned a lot about the building and Avalon, but like everyone we encountered at the casino, could have been just a little more friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29kindergartencuties
50,Great place to catch a flick,"*Notice* It is not an actual casino! While staying on the island for several days, we decided to go check out the ""casino"". I didn't really do my homework before I went there, so I was actually hoping to get some gambling in. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a movie theatre and not a real casino. We went ahead and caught a movie while we were there and it was awesome. They only play one movie (they only have one screen) and change it once every week or two. It has a old theatre feel and is pretty cool. The theatre itself is huge and allows for large crowds to watch the movie. Don't be late though, doors close 30 minutes and the movie starts and they do NOT let anyone in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeH574
50,Grand old building,"If you are interested in movie theaters, ballrooms, or Art Deco, this is a must see. Take the tour and see the theater and the ballroom inside this lovely building. It is very picturesque inside and out. Most of it is all original and extremely well-preserved. It isn't hard to imagine 1940's big bands performing there with the ballroom filled with dancers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squidhead

50,One of THE Architectural and Historical HIGHLIGHTS of Catalina,"A simply beautiful 1930's Art Deco Gem... recently revitalized and now a protected historic monument 'not to be missed' on Catalina.A picture focal point, and monumental landmark of central Avalon, be sure to take a tour (the longer more intensive tour) of the building. Also ensure that you take a stroll around the out side of the building being sure not to miss the amazing main entrance - high styled Art Deco - and walk around the shoreline 'back' of the building.Also don't forget to make a stop into the Historical Societies retail shop on the waterfront side of the building. Great product with proceed going to the maintenance and preservation of the building.Our visit was one of THE highlights of our day on Catalina...and we will be back to the island and to the casino again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianwickens407
50,HISTORIC...UNIQUE,This building has a spectacular design. Back in the WWII era...2 or 3 bands with thousands (yes thousands..) would be dancing upstairs while a movie played in the lower level theater completely oblivious of the upper level activity....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roeservices
20,Disappointing,"What was described as a casino, was nothing more than a movie theatre and very small museum that had nothing but recreated photos from the past which you pay $5 to see, took me less than 5minutes to go all the way through. As for the ""Casino"" as I entered the front doors, I was greeted by a less than happy to see me employee who asked for my ticket. I told him I was just here to see the casino and he let me know there was no casino and that the building was only open for tours 3 hours each day. After that, it becomes a movie theatre.One of your review questions asks ""Was there food available for purchase?"" Yes, there was movie theatre food and drink available for purchase during the showing of the movie. If purchases were being bought with a credit card, the purchase had to be over $10, otherwise you had to pay in cash or they would not sell the purchase items to you. Very disappointing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggnickelimages
40,Beautiful historic building,"Returned to Avalon for our 26th anniversary and finally toured the Casino. Gorgeous inside with a very informative tour. Nice views from the balcony. Recommend seeing one of the movies there too. I have to say though, Avalon has certainly changed. The cruise ships come in twice a week (Mon & Tues) which changes the whole vibe. We noticed lots of ""workers"" hanging around with their families. Takes away from that vacation feeling. It's just was not as pleasant as it was years ago. We found Two Harbors to be more enjoyable if you can afford to get there from Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donatella-Bingbong
50,Art Deco Wonder,I love the decor and the way the building is so much of its time. I have to visit it every time I visit Catalina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonh27

Definitely a bucket list item...so much to see & so little time that I will be adding it to my bucket list for a return trip to enjoy many more of its wonders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilad909
40,"Very informative, lots to see behind the scenes","The best part about this tour of the Casino included a trip upstairs to the grand ballroom -- it was an amazing space with the circular ceiling, recessed floor and various lighting elements. It would be great to come back here at night - during a snazzy event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDG2
40,Avalon Casino,"Interesting videos of the former movie stars that frequented the island along with Indian artifacts, 1 section of the museum in the casino was being renovated. Entry is $5 per person although birthday people get in for free, just show your ID.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30fredt
40,Amazing Building BUT it is not a gambling Casino,"I would recommend doing the walking tour of this building (this builidng is 7 floors so be prepared to walk alot :) Also note this is not a gambling casino. We learned upon arriving that casino in italian means ""place of gathering or of entertainment"". The movie theater inside is neat as well for something to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine2120
50,take the back stage tour,"I have been traveling to Catalina for over 50 years. We have family history there. Many people never take the back stage tour of the Casino. The history and tour are amazing. Catalina has such a rich history, it's a great tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougrh
10,Amazing building really really aweful guide,"I was in Catalina in February with a group from the travel industry. I had been to Catalina a couple of times before and had enjoyed a movie at the Casino on one visit. I love the building and so was very excited to see that part of our agenda was a tour of the Casino.The building was not a disappointment, I loved it, however the tour guide Joe was horrendous. It started on the walk from the hotel to the Casino a few of us walk quicker than others and three of us reached the tour guide first. We introduced ourselves to him and said the full group would be there in a minute or two. He nodded and started his tour. When someone asked if he could wait for the rest of the group he ignored them by talking over them.Joe certainly knew his history but his rudeness spoiled the whole tour for me and most the others when we discussed him after the tour. He rushed us through like cattle and all his lines were a ‚Äúspiel‚Äù that he had done a 1,000 times before. During the tour his spiel included some attempts at humour, really? Having knowledge does not a tour guide make, personality does, and this man has zero personality. I work with tour guides every day, Joe would not last one tour with our company, he would be fired.If you can take the tour from someone other than Joe, take it the Casino is beautiful, if Joe is the only option, skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskwatches
50,Must See,"Let's face it--this is a small island with not a lot of sights so going to see the Casino is worth an hour of your time. Casino, before Las Vegas, was a dance ballroom so there is nor never was gambling here. Make sure you pick up the booklet called PASSPORT at the pier with the food shacks on it-this will get you tickets at half price for this and other sights on Catalina.Check times for the half hour tours so you can see the theater and ballroom plus photo's from the 40's. Without the tour, it's just a large building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmahler
50,A must see,"If your on Catalina - make the time to see this timeless beauty of a ball room. Take the tour it's worth the time, especially if you enjoy architecture and nostalgia. Catch a movie in the theatre below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islandwoman2014
50,Catalina island was clean & lovely !!!,"Visited 14/04/2014Arrived here with the cruise ship ,carnival cruise...we had time to explore this island until 4 pm.I don't know why this island is part of 4 night Mexico tour as its got nothing to do with Mexico !!!We did our own thing here, walk down the beach front to descano beach, paying by the casino,which is a museum now,we didn't venture in,but had a look in the window.It was a 15 min walk to the beach,nice bar for some drinks,no coffee served!! .The beach club charged $70.00 USD for two deck chair,you got chair and some water for that.I saw 2 couple there only,don't think it was a great money day for them.Why so overpriced !!! A fair & decent price would attract more guest then NO guest !!!The beach was lovely clean sand,not the best ,I've seen else where better!!! Water clear with large stone in the water..There is nice clean toilets and a cute gift shop !!After all this we ventured back to the main area ,where heaps of shops are for dining at.looks like heaps of guest were dining there.Some lovely shopping to be done here.We choose not to do any tour via the ship recommendation ,as we have done water sports and land activities in the pass,so just happy to do our own thing...You stay here at some cute little hotels amongst the shops area or maybe higher up in the hills...Overall it was a lovely island to visit and you can get transfers here from mainland Los Angeles area, not just from a cruise ship.CiaoELISA.

40,"When is a casino, not a casino?","When we fisited Catalina Island, off the coast of California, we were told to make sure we took the Casino tour. Then they said, oh, it's not really a casino, I mean it is but it isn't. Anyway, we took the tour and they really pack in a lot of information for just a half hour tour. Really cool place with a fascinating history. The tour guide is a native to the island so born and raised. He shared so much with us and presented the historical information in a fun and entertaining way. From the theater all the way to the ballroom, a great tour. Follow it up with a tour of the museum downstairs. Both are well worth your time. Oh, make sure you get the coupon book from the ferry as there are discounts included for this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmcbrayer

50,"Catalina on your Birthday (its free, kinda)","Catalina Express was offering free trips to Catalina on birthdays, so I took advantage and went yesterday. Great trip, fast and comfortable. Got to Catalina and realized that there is NO shade anywhere, so bought a hat. Forgot sunscreen (WEAR sunscreen). I was a lobster at the end of the day. Ate lunch at Bluewater Cafe on the water. Really good food, reasonably priced. Then went to Lloyds icecream and candy shop, very popular. They sell Dreyer's ice cream, okay, but not many flavor choices. Some shopping on the main street, but very small shops. Take a walk on the side streets and you will see cute cottages for rent. Maybe great for a family or bunch of friends to rent for a few days. There is lots to do, couldnt pick all of them being there only one day. Went on glass bottom boat. Always fun, and only $14 for seniors like me. They now have parasailing -- THATS an adventure! Lots of snorkeling and scuba opportunities, full rentals. Run around Avalon in a rented golf cart, take a tram tour around the island and see the wildlife including Bison. Just a fun day (or two).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvemaui08

The history of the building was amazing. I took the tour in Jan-2014 and Porschia was the guide. She was very nice, and easy going, and everyone just enjoyed the tour. You get the history, a walk through the casino, and to see the theater and go up to the ballroom and then walk around on the outside of it.

40,History and Arhitecture and Harbor virews Combined,"An acoustically excellent theatre and a Grand Ballroom that has borne witness to more than a large measure of modern California History..take time out to visit and tour the museaum also....You won't be sorry!! Inexpensive, Easy to do....and pleasant!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billybuzzy
50,Casino Tour and Museum,"The casino tour and the museum, located at ground level from the casino were great attractions and definitely should be visited. In addition to the architectural beauty, the tour and museum lends to the historical aspects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vagabondfromNY
40,"Very nice building, by far the best on the island.","This place is actually not a present day casino. It is used for performances on the island, as a meeting house and for movies. The inside is very classy and a throwback to the days of old when theaters were lie mini-palaces. It is located in the Avalon Harbour area on the far right as you approach from the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAChuck
50,"Aaaaah, the elegance!",You are transformed to a bygone era of elegance and beauty...the architecture & decor evokes images of Fred & Ginger gliding in this amazing ballroom. A building like no other - do yourselves a fair & explore this treasure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cwh25
50,What a theater,"We took a 2-hour tour of the Casino which included the theater, the ballroom, the backstage rooms and the front lobby. Thoroughly enjoyable and informative. The tour guide knew his material though he's given this tour way too many times and the spontaneity was long gone. You can get a real feel for the big band era and the heyday of the Casino. In the lower level of the Casino is a fine museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
40,Beautiful Theater,"There are two tours of this building which is called a Casino, even though it is not the modern day type of Casino. Casino means ""gathering place"" which is what this was considered when it was built for Hollywood stars to visit in 1915. We took the 30 minute tour and will likely take the 90 minute tour if we return to Catalina Island. It's a beautiful place with a lot of history. Our guide was knowledgeable and energetic. The theatre is ornate and the ballroom is huge. The architecture and d√©cor are worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196CindyW
40,Definitely worth the stop,"Absolutely beautiful building! I really enjoyed the opportunity to see this place. That said, we took the 1/2 hour tour and found it to be very rushed. Of course I expect a 30 minute tour to be rather short, but half of that time was taken up by watching a DVD about the facility. The tour guide was very friendly, but that tour consists of a brief introduction about the place, watching the video in the theatre and then climbing up to the ballroom for a bit more info and a few pictures before being herded out the door. The place is magnificent and the tour inexpensive, but expect a bit of disappointment over the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneW_12
50,Beautiful Classic Theater!,"This is a beautiful building! The acoustics are amazing inside and the building itself is absolutely stunning! Be sure to go there if you are on Santa Catalina Island and enjoy classic beauty. We saw a movie there and enjoyed the usual popcorn, candy, and colas. The curtains at the theater entrance reminded me of going to a show when I was a kid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4TNTravelers
20,Casino,"Only a movie theatre inside. The art gallery is closed. There is a ""museum"" tour that is mainly a gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdemaree42
40,New Years Eve Bash,The new years eve bash is a little pricey but nice to do at least once. Food was fair but the venue very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndiMom
50,very nice place,"We got a private tour of the casino, luckily me and my wife only..haha.Its a nice place to visit while staying on island. beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COOLDUDE0110
40,Don't come here to gamble...,We did the half hour tour of the building. The guide shepherded a BIG group into the theatre and shows a DVD. Then we scramble up a ramp with a reasonable gradient but our group of all ages managed it with ease. Finally you get to a HUGE dancing floor which can hold 1500 couples at a single time. This floor is cantilevered and provides a massive space without pillars. A 90 minute visit is also available.There is also a museum which highlights the story of the museum. They also sell Catalina tiles. But these are not cheap! There are toilets almost adjacent to the Museum which were closed. Signs advised people to use the portable loo. But there was no soap or water here. And our 4 year old refused to go in saying it was smelly!We returned in the evening for an organ recital which was impressive and yet was free if you had a ticket as we had for the Hobbit!The Casino is a must do for Catalina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imliooper
50,Romance with great views,"Just proposed to my girlfriend at night by divers point, Flawless. Sound of small crashing waves, nice breezes, Stars like bulbs in the air priceless. She said yes so this will always be a special 5 star spot. During December the casino has green and red spotlights illuminating on it, cool effect for Christmas time on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centurionspqr
30,Museum is a better Description,"We took a ferry to Catalina Island over the Thanksgiving Holiday and the boat ride,about an hour and a half was nice. We got to the island and renred a Golf Cart to do some sightseeing, about $80. The island is cute but not much to do. We thought that there was a real Casino on the island but it is closed to the public except for a tour, in a group, of an old Casino building. Probably won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyH158
50,Magnificent place,Restored to all its glory with the original floor it evokes the 1930's. Worth visiting. Great ocean and bay views from the main floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tutis_12
50,Our 1 1/2 hour tour of the casino,"Our guide, Jess Herzog; was great! She was very knowledgeable in the history of the building, the uses of the building and the people that have used the building since it's opening in 1929. She also had an excitement about her in sharing her information about the casino and the island that she loves, which showed in the overall tour she took us on. Yeah, Jess and Catalina Island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cccccccccc0987m
50,The Catalina Casino tour is a must,A can't miss in Avalon is the Catalina Casino and a guided tour is the best way to see it. With the tour you get a knowledgable guide who explains the history of the building and it's Art Deco design features. You are taken through both the theatre and the grand ballroom. Our guide Jessica was fabulous offering to both answer questions and take pictures.The theatre is exquisitely decorated and beautiful and Jessica demonstrated the lighting effects that are used for movies. The ballroom and the views from just outside the ballroom are breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwnflfan
50,Or visit to Catalina Island,The casino built in 1929 was beautiful and the tour guide was very knowledgable.There are limited bathroom facilities. It wasn't a big issue because the tour was short.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pamelaw668
50,Breathtaking architecture,"From the ground floor theater with its magnificent organ to the beautiful grand chandelier in the ballroom, I loved the unique designs. Do not miss this historical landmark on your next visit to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJCAN
50,Beautiful venue for a concert,"We attended Jazztrax here and loved the location and beauty of the building. Very historical, and there are tours available. There are ramps to climb, so beware if you have trouble walking on an incline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
40,Beautiful historic place to visit!,"We loved watching a movie in the Casino. It's a movie theater and museum with a fun 'old timey' feel to it. You walk in through big velvet curtains to a quaint little stage area, where you are serenaded by a talented organist playing fun songs. The screen is on the smaller side, so just be sure to sit up close, but the atmosphere and art make it a must see while in Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itzarosielife
50,A non-gambling casino,"When a friend recommended we tour the casino on Catalina Island, I was ready to gamble. Was I ever surprised that it is just a name for a historical building used before & during WW II. The building is beautiful and was used for dances, shows, & movies. We had a great tour of the building plus it is always fun to learn some history along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginiaY_13
50,Beautifully kept Casino,"The tour was short (30 mins) but informative. There were several ramps up to the ballroom, and no one mentioned this when purchasing tickets, so keep in mind. No elevator (except one not used). The 1929 Art deco decor was beautifully maintained and fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maigheu
50,Wheeee it was Fun!!,"The Zipline Eco Tour in Catalina Island is the BEST!!! This was my first time ziplining and the instructors (Kevin and Michael) were great. Within minutes of meeting them, I was made to feel confident and relaxed that this would be the best experience.....and it was!!! The course if beautiful and they each explained all the safety precautions that they take (usually going above and beyond what is regulated!). Both Kevin and Michael shared fun stories of Catalina Island, their lives and their love for ziplining. These guys were great and wonderful 'eye candy'...both had wonderful personalities and are a positive reflection of the tour agency.The cost of the tour was not cheap, but you definately get your money's worth. It's something everyone should do at least once in their lives. And if possible...do it in a paradise setting like Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starwood9
50,Not to be Confused with the Theatre,The Theatre is an integral part of the Casino. This is not a gambling hall but consists of a unique theatre and ballroom above it. Appreciate the fine Douglas Fir woods and the marble floors. Spend a few bucks more and take the behind the scenes tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acgardiner
50,Amazing architectural gem in Avalon,"The history and charm of the island really shines through in this marvelous structure. The Avalon Theater and Casino Ballroom are something to behold. The entry frescos are beyond breathtaking, as are the views from the Ballroom balcony. Certainly worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susankX5159WC
40,Magnificent building,"We took the ""behind the scenes"" tour. If you just want to see the inside of the theater and ballroom, take the cheaper regular tour. Joe our tour guide knew everything about the place. Seeing the old projectors and the green rooms was cool if you're into that stuff. ""They don't make them like that anymore"" is true for this building. Absolutely magnificent. Bring your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostInSpace2013
50,See My Avalon Theater Review,"Our tour guide, Joe, was great. He gave us the history of the Casino, built in 1929, and showed us behind the scenes, where the star's dressing rooms were, the Marine Bar, the Theater, the Ballroom and the projection rooms. He educated us on the architecture of the building and was especially informative about the history of the stars from the past who have graced these magnificent halls. There are many pictures of the stars who performed here and you just want to say...""if only these walls could talk""! I recommend the Behind the Scenes Tour. There are ramps and stairs, but most people can handle it...I was injured at the time I went and I handled it just fine, so when they say there's something like 55 steep steps, just know they're not that bad and they're not all together. It's worth it and I got some exercise to boot! Plus, the view of Avalon Bay from the top is spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444katherinej
50,Tour,"We took the 30 minute tour of the Casino. They also offer a 90 minute tour. The 30 minute tour was great, we would have loved to take the 90 minute tour also. Lots of history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360lynnm
30,Lots of history but a very structured 30 Minute tour only offered twice a day,"First Point: PriceySecond Point: A rushed tourThird Point: Two tours a day so you have to time thisFourth Point: Don't wear heelsFifth and Final Point: If you love history, dance or buildings you will love this if you don't then a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
50,Architecturally significant,We took the short (45 min) tour and saw the theatre and ballroom but did not have time to do backstage as we did another tour the same day and were only on the island for the day. Well worth seeing. Acoustics of the theatre and structure of the ballroom are excellent. Things have been kept as they originally were for the most part.Random hint--when we came over on the ferry and bought our tours on board the guide told us the cheapest place to get a sandwich was in the small Vons' deli counter. Great sandwich at a great price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sometime_Wanderer
50,fun way to spend the day,We walked around the casino and watched the divers and looked at all the boats in the harbor. So relaxing! Then we learned quite a bit of Catalina history in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopeverah
50,A bit of history,"My husband and I took the 90 minute tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a marvelous place! If you like history and architecture you will love this tour. I could just imagine the thousands of people dressed to the nines during the 30s, 40s, dancing away to the big bands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Humphreyspeak
50,Take a tour!,"We took the backstage pass tour and saw the whole theater, ballroom, green rooms, private viewing rooms, everything backstage and front. Wish we would have taken it sooner; it was a great history lesson about the Island and Avalon. The guide was well-informed, courteous, and funny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jollyone333
50,Great,What a beautiful place to see. We loved going to see Catalina's Casino this is a must see for anyone visiting Catalina. Step back in time as you tour Catalina biggest land mark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdcomfortcruise
50,Classic Chicago Architecture,"so much wonderful history. beautiful, and absorbing. I love the view as well. You want to explore the entire place. They don't make them like this any more. Worth the tour and I am not a tour person",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanFinn
50,Jet Ski at Catalina Island,"Amazing experience!! We rented Jet Ski's from the only place on the island that had them. We ended up right in the middle of a large school of dolphins and had an amazing time ""swimming"" with them. So much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aloerzel
50,Theatre Girl HEAVEN!!,Ok let me just say as the Master Electrician of a theatre in Los Angeles seeing gear that I have only ever seen in text books in full working order was a dream come true. The best part of our Behind the Scenes tour was Rebecca our tour guide she knew so much information her laugh was awesome and she took care of my as I have some special needs physically with climbing stairs and such. She even let me and my friend in out of the sun because I wasn't feeling well. I really can't say enough great things about this woman!!!!! If she gives that much care to all her tours she is a priceless asset to the SCIC!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaj493
50,I liked the Museum,"Although warm inside, I enjoyed seeing some of the Island's history displayed on film and in books, etc. you could get at the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolljr
50,Avalon Behind the Scenes Casino Tour,"Visited the Avalon Casino on a behind the scenes tour and it was great. The tour guide (Porschia) was knowledgable, enthusiastic and she even sang the song Avalon to us! I highly recommend this tour. Be sure and ask Porschia to sing to you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rxman72
50,Do the behind the scenes tour!!,"Excellent tour, very informative, and our kids loved it too. Amazing architecture and history! The tour guide points out details and trivia that tourists would never realize on their own. Just beautiful!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crvd
50,"""Want to take a look back to the Big Band Era""",The Casino on Catalina is a well preserved jewel from the Big Band Era. The back stage tour really gives you a chance to step back in time and learn the history of this unique landmark. It was never used for gambling as the name might mean.Rent a golf cart and explore the beautiful town of Avalon.There is so much to do and see. You can spend hours or over night at one of the many different hotels and see it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeo364
10,Tourist Trap Island - Could not wait to leave!!!,"A complete waste of time! Boring is an understatement. T shirt shops, useless novelties, bad food, etc. Its exactly what I don't want on a vacation. The entire island is cheesy! There is a very good reason that the helicopter business thrives there. After 3 hours on that carnival wasteland I was willing to give up my first born to get the heck off of that novelty store called an island. Might have been nice once but a complete joke now. I think the place totally sucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmonkey2775
30,Nice place - but please fix the bathrooms!!!,"This is a nice attraction. Unfortunately, the public bathrooms next to the museum are in horrible condition, dirty, and in desperate of a remodel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techkraut
50,Fascinating tour,"This was our first trip to Catalina, but it will not be our last. We had a great time. One of the highlights was the half hour tour of the Casino. Our guide, Joe, did a great job and shared some fascinating information about this unusual and icon building. This is a must for Catalina visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingdiamond
50,Beautiful & Worth The Trip,"Visited Catalina Island in April, 2013. It was a bit chilly - perfect t-shirt & capri weather. The island has no motor vehicles so even though there are a lot of people, it's surprisingly quiet. We rented a golf cart & toured the island. There are several places to rent a cart right on the Main Street. You can walk around but the cart is definitely worth the money, which isn't very expensive really. You can take it to the top of the island & the view of the ocean & Avalon below is breath taking. I really want to go back again - it's a unique, peaceful, beautiful place. A bit touristy, but that's okay - fun shops & restaurants. And it could be a romantic little getaway as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946pattyj
40,Breathtaking,"The art work is gorgeous through out the building. Wonderful murals, glass doors, a movie night is great fun. wander back in time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samyers48
50,Turn back time,"A visit to Catalina Island would not be complete without a tour of the Casino, which shows new movies each week. To view the Art Deco decore, is a visual treat, and the organ is one of only five of this genre. I believe each Sunday you are invited to hear it played by a professional organist. More fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoinetteW304
40,Amazing place!,"We had a guided tour of the Catalina Island Museum on the bottom floor of the Casino. Very nice if you like history. Then we saw a movie in the 1200 seat theater. The theater was cool to see but we sat far back (our choice) and the screen felt too far away. (honestly, I'm not sure why we didn't move closer) We wanted to take pictures inside but it was already dark because there was an organ concert gong on before the movie. Tickets are steep at 15 dollars each. Next time we'll take the Casino tour. It is a beautiful, beautiful building. I don't know how many pictures I took of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milo7961
50,a must see!,well worth to look at the decor and the ceiling and the ambience. We watched Fast and Furious 6 there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdpgod
50,Musem is fun and informative,Great little museum with sufficient information about the island's history and culture; interesting artifacts related to the digs on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maradonov
50,nice,"loved the tour of the casino, guide was well informed and funny. Must see if you go. It was on the end of our island tour. (visited few yrs ago but had to chose a recent date....silly)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FotiniC
30,Amazing Building but....,Took the behind the sciences tour. Fantastic building but the tour lasted barely an hour. The guide seemed to want to move us on as quickly as possible. I now know how long it took to build and how much it cost but little or nothing about who played there during its heyday. The ballroom and theatre/cinema are stunning but the backstage is only mildly interesting without more information about the artists who used the dressing rooms. Even so I'll go back to dance on the fabulous circular dance floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanalcruiserDerby
50,Great tour,"We took the basic 3o minute tour and really enjoyed it. They discussed the history of the building and included some details of the artist who painted the murals. Tour includes the theater, mezzanine level, ballroom and balcony. The access is via a series of ramps so is easy on the legs but beware you do climb about 10 stories.May take the longer tour on our next visit when we have more time. Guides were very knowledgeable and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtRyan
50,Beautiful building worth the tour,We took the basic one half hour tour. It really is an interesting building and you should definitely visit on your trip. It would be a shame to miss. Tour includes so island history as well. You see both the theater and the ballroom on the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobretired
50,So much history so far from the mainland,I was excited to tour the island but I was elated to go inside the Casino. The beauty can not be captured by camera. The outside alone is worth the trip but when you go inside and see the theatre and how preserved it looks you are blown away. Our tour guide was very nice and informative. Must do while on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzonthemove
50,a most beautiful building,"Many, many original features of this historic building are still around - and wonderfully preserved or restored. And you can see a flick at the theater and (on the weekends I think) enjoy live organ music before the show! Take special note on the tour of the ceilings, the aisle signs and the chandelier in the top floor ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mj333
50,If Walls Could Talk...,"What a wonderful place with a wonderful history! The tour was easy walking with an informative guide. There were no events going on while we were there; I'd like to return to attend something here. It's a flat, not-too-far walk from the center of town and the boat docks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daruth
50,beautiful‚Ä¶Beautiful,"Went to a move on a Saturday night- arrived an hour early to hear the pipe organ and look around the casino. I did not take the tour, but will next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PracticingTourist
50,The architecture and artistry was amazing,"We took the back stage tour. Porschia was our guide and she led us through the theater, dressing rooms, projector room and ballroom. She has a wealth of knowledge and she even sang us the Avalon song with her beautiful voice. What a treat! The architecture and artistry was amazing. The paint on lobby ceiling was a brilliant red and has never been touched up! The place is beautifully maintained and all the old lights, projectors and pipe organ are used on a regular bases. 80 years old and still going WOW! This place is so marvelous that we went back to see a movie and hear the organ played in the theater just to experience the acoustics and nostalgia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/axel179
50,Great tour,I recommend you see this it is absolutely beautiful! I even bought a clay tile of the entry way mermaid to be the center piece of our remolded bathroom. The history and the atmoshere is breath taking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckiC724
40,"Cool ""Casino"" but not a gambling Casino","My wife and I walked to the casino building seeing how interesting it looked wanting to go do some gambling. We quickly discovered that it wasn't open and just had tours. Signed up for the tour and then soon discovered its not a casino as we know it in today times.Casino, in older times meant to entertain, or to gather. So no slot machines, black jack, roulette, class waitresses with a endless supply of drinks.It was still really neat to tour the building and see all the different features ranging from the ball room, the movie theater, soda bar, etc.Id recommend doing a tour just to see the cool interesting features of the historic building. Word of advice, there are quite a few steep ramps to walk up so if your older or have trouble moving around be sure to check with the tour staff to see if maybe they can accommodate you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barracudamuscle
50,Beautiful Place,"We visited Catalina Island while on a cruise on the Sapphire Princess. It was an easy walk to the Casino, which by the way is NOT a casino as we think of it, but ""Casino"" means meeting place. The tour shows you the lovely theater and ballrooms, as well as incredible murals. The guided tour was $10.00. Also, well worth the time is the Museum underneath and around the side of the Casino. I believe admission was $5.00. Later, we heard there was a combination ticket, so check that out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marilyn540
50,Behind the Scenes Casino Tour,"This is well worth it. Spend the extra money for the Behind the Scenes version of the tour. Joe is an awesome tour guide, he's friendly, knowledgeable and good sense of humor. Since it was the off-season we lucked out on being the only couple on the tour for that time slot so it was like having a private tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishTomKat
20,Mystery Ghost Tour,"I have a question for those who took the 8pm Mystery Ghost Tour at Avalon March/10/2013.If anybody got their identity stolen or your credit card got charged either in CA or anotherState...like it was in my case. Somebody insistently called me from the Mystery Tour claiming theyneeded more information on my credit card; such as: Zip Code, address, security code, etc. I got 4 insistent calls needing this info and that same night my credit card was charged at a gas station in Portland. I still had card in my possession. My bank called me next day. Please post it here if you had similar experience. Thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patrizia78128
50,"""Discover the Casino,"" 1929 Movie House and Ballroom","If you go to Catalina, you HAVE to check out the Casino. Not as in ""gambling house,"" but as in original Italian sense of ""ballroom."" WOW! Amazing architecture, artwork, gold and silver in the ceiling, built in one continuous concrete pour in 1929. First ""talking"" movie house in the nation! Absolutely stunningly beautiful. Tour guide Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MailmanJohn
40,Stunning building,"The Avalon casino building is a gorgeous place, both from the inside and the outside. It is well worth photographing. Views of the bay are all around you - quite stunning - a photographer's haven. However, the tour of the place is NOT worth the $ 10.00 that you pay. They rush you through the tour and do not talk about the important parts of the casino. The tour guide we had rushed us through the casino and spoke in a monotone boring tone. She sounded like she prepared a pre-recorded boring speech. You are better off seeing this place on your own. However, that is not allowed. If you want to see the place, you have to pay the $ 10.00 guided tour price.. I would much rather pay $ 7.00 - $ 10.00 in the form of an admission ticket and allow me to tour and photograph the place on my own. That is not currently possible. The tour of the place is advertised as being 40 minutes long but that is false advertisement. The tour is 27 - 30 minutes in length tops. Of these minutes, about 5-8 minutes are spent outside the building in front of the main doors when the tour guide talks about the history of the place. The building is superb but the guided tour of the place is not worth it at all. Worst tour and tour guide I have ever seen in over 25 years of travel. I hope that the casino people are listening and I hope that they make some positive changes based on this feedback.. That remains to be seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Saul
40,Iconic,This is the most famous building here which also has a movie theater. Worth seeing up close and expect to see a lot of divers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
20,Sadly disappointed :-/,"I was excited to view the casino and take the tour. I paid 32.50 for a behind the scenes tour.... SO disappointed. Joe the tour guide, although knowledgeable was terrible!! Horribly corny jokes, monotone voice and gave no time to explore to take pics. I lost interest in the first 5 minutes. The overall tour would have better if I could have gone at my own pace and not had to listen to Joes personal stories... sooooooooooooooo boring. It was not worth the $$ I paid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saucy_MC
50,Excellent!,"Thank you to Emily, our tour guide! We went on this tour and were very pleased not only with the price but with the informative tour. The casino is an amazing island icon with so much history. I can't wait to return and actually go to the organ concert Emily told us about and watch a movie in the theater! Beautiful wood and art throughout!! Great tour!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AS1951
50,A deco GEM!!!,We took a 40 minute tour of this masterpiece of days gone by - it is a must if you are in Avalon. Worth spending the time with the guided tour to learn the history and hear some of the stories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FL_BabyMomma
50,I highly recommend the Behind The Scenes Casino Tour!,"We took a Behind The Scenes Casino Tour which included the theatre and the ballroom.

50,Class Art Deco Beauty,"I've been to Avalon four times and each time I go, I go to the casino and take the tour. It's a beautiful place. The woodwork, paintings, and tile work are great. A place like this will never be duplicated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skye-mother
50,Back stage tour Catalina Casino,"Great tour led by Kathy (aspiring movie director). Started out in the lobby which had all the original wood and decorations. There was never any smoking allowed anywhere in the casino. Went to the dressing rooms, private (Wrigley) viewing room and the projection room. Many movies were made on the island and the film was processed on site and screened in the movie theatre that evening. The casino has two floors, the lower the movie theatre and the upper the ballroom. All are original and absolutely in prime condition. We were treated to some music by the long standing organ player in the theatre and had a demonstration of the outstanding acoustics by the tour guide. The design was copied for the radio city music hall. The tour also includes admission to the museum that is a must if you are interested in the history or the island and Wrigley family. A must tour for about three hours of enjoyment.This was part of our day play that included our free birthday boat trip to the Island courtesy of Island Express",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpr700
10,Will have to look it up for a view of its glory days,"It is one of the most interesting and enticing beautys of architecture I have seen. What a dissappointment it is no longer open as a casino. I could only day dream of late evenings with beautiful starlets in long gowns, cocktails and cold stares, and the glitz of casino nights...they do still have the ballroom and you can tour or go to a movie. ;(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahF2

We were also serenaded by the organist who stopped by to practice. We heard old time movie music and a rendition of the Phantom of the Opera. Lots of info, beautiful artwork, and living history. A visit to the museum was included in the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB992
50,Behind the Scenes Tour,"Porschia was our guide and was absolutely great. She made every minute of it fun and informative.

50,A Beautiful and Historical Experience,A must see while on Catalina Island. Well worth the money if you want a glimpse into the past. I took the 30 minute tour which included a tour of the theater and ballroom. Although it was a bit rushed I enjoyed myself and learned a lot about the island's history. The architecture of the casino is just beautiful and there is a great view of Avalon from the top of the Casino.

50,Casino tour is fun and a glimpse into the past,"It's a hike up to the ballroom (ramps not stairs, so a bit easier). The theater is a gem from 1929 with art deco murals and lights. It was the first movie theater specificially constructed for sound films.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrismaticCalifornia
40,Beautiful and interesting,"We just got back from visiting Catalina Island. Took the tour to the Casino. The word ""Casino"" means ""Gathering Place"" in Italian, it is not for gambling!

The views from the Casino are one of the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewel52
40,Avalon Scenic Tour,"We had only one day to see as much of Avalon and Catalina Island as we could, so we decided to take this tour for an overview of the city. We reserved our tickets well beforehand and from home. Sometimes there is space for last minute passengers, but I wouldn't count on it and never during high summer season.The covered, but open coach, picks up psssengers from the center of town (where all tours meet) and runs through town and up to the Zipline where it turns around. Two senior tickets were $17 each. The guide was most informative and we learned much about the island's history as well as the places we saw. She lives on the Island and all guides are trained so they know their information. The tour does not stop and there are no facilities aboard the bus. The meeting area in town does have clean public restrooms and food is for sale there. Gift shops are also there.I would recommend this tour for those who want to know and see something of the island but are short on time. Older children might be interested, as this is a good way to see things that one would otherwise miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violette54
50,An absolute must-see,"From the amazingly acoustically-sound movie theater auditorium to the 6,000 person capacity dance floor above, the Catalina Island Casino is a must-see! Took the 30 minute guided tour on a recent first-time visit to Catalina Island and I was awe-struck at this amazingly historical structure! I found myself wishing the tour would never end. Really. Amazing. Do not miss your chance to visit a bit of history. This was the highlight of my visit to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickenbiscuit

40,"Fun, short tour in a beautiful building","It was a gorgeous building, ballroom and theatre. I enjoyed the historical information as well as the architecture. The tour was just long enough that you were satisfied, but not too long where you became bored. Only a $5 admission, so that's good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsAch
50,Take the Behind the Scenes Tour!,"It is truly a wonderful thing to have a tour guide that is as enthusiastic as our guide (I think his name was Joe?). Especially a guide that has been there for as long as he had been (15 years? Wow) and still truly had a love for the place that seemed indefatigable. Not just the theater (he showed us the acoustic ""Hot spot"") but the murals and the backstage dressing rooms, projector rooms, bars, viewing rooms and of course the ridiculously glamorous ball room! It was truly a step back in time to see this place so lovingly kept up and preserved for everyone to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WKDFIRO
50,"Best tour, seriously","I've been to Catalina for extended stays on three occasions and it wasn't until the third that I did the Casino tour. Perhaps I thought it would be lame. Silly me. It was fabulous! The tour guide was super charismatic and the information during the tour so entertaining. I loved it. The casino is already gorgeous but when you learn so much about its beginnings and its history, you can't fall in love with it even more. We highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1ssy
50,Do not miss the tour of the Casino.,"We absolutely loved the tour of the Casino, given by a lovely Black woman with a great sense of humor. We were impressed by the historic beauty, the lovely art deco decorations, the ceiling full of stars, and the grand ballroom. I want to come back for New Year's Eve!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandac64
50,Gorgeous Art Deco murals and building!,"Dating from 1929, the Casino is actually a ""place of entertainment"" or ""social gathering place"" consisting of a 1100+ seat movie theatre and enormous circular ballroom above it. It is featured in most photos and paintings of the Island, yet there is very little information available on what makes it so special unless you actually visit the building and find out for yourself. Thus, I was truly surprised to see the enormous and gorgeously imaginative undersea-world murals on the entry facade by artist and Hollywood art director, John Gabriel Beckman. Apparently, Beckman was selected for the project based on his work two years earlier for Grauman's/Mann's Chinese Theatre. Inside the theatre, Beckman loosely interprets early California history in murals that surround the visitor on the domed, star-lit ceiling.The Art Deco/Mediterranean Revival building itself, with an almost 360¬∞ view of the Pacific at the ballroom level (the equivalent of 12 stories high), won an American Institute of Architects (AIA) award upon completion. Its theatre was apparently the first to be designed for movies with sound! In fact, the acoustics in the theatre are eery, as one hears conversations, but can't figure out where they are coming from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorCalDreamer

50,Awesome building,Good memories of Catalina from childhood. Used to drive boat from Huntington Harbor. I especially enjoyed the glass bottom boat and the bus tour to the airport. It is nice to go for free on your birthday. I was impressed with Theresa's historical knowledge of the island. She gave a very interesting tour. It was great to see the buffalo are still there and the population is under control. I would like to go back and do some hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355PamelaH

The Avalon ""Casino"" (no gambling there now or ever before) has a 1,400 seat movie theater for an island of 3,500. Took the fmaily to see a movie there.The building is beautiful on the outuisde, beautiful on the inside.The lobby is gorgeous.The theater itself is big and beautifully decorated, with a pipe organ (and there was a free pre-show concert going on, too).And when the first scene flashed on the screen, my son and I looked at each other and said ""WOW - that's SHARP!"" (and I spent a career in computer graphics!Quite simply, the nicest movie theater I have ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyTheGameInventor

50,"The best ""casino"" I've ever been in!","When you visit the Casino Building, don't plan on seeing a...well...casino. *Spoiler alert* The word ""casino"" really just means ""a gathering place"" or ""place of entertainment,"" which is what the casino building was and still is. (Sorry, Guide, just totally stole a bit of your thunder!)My husband and I did the tour of the Casino (just the walking tour - not 'behind the scenes"") a few years ago, and it was very enjoyable. At the time, it cost somewhere between $15-20 each. We recently went to Catalina again and wanted to tour the Casino with our children, and were pleased to find that the cost was much lower than last time - $6 for adults, $5 for kids, hence the 5-star rating. I would not recommend it for young kids - they would get bored - but 10 and up would probably enjoy it.The tour tells the history of and visits the painted murals, the gorgeous art deco theater, the ballroom at the top, and tells of events held at the Casino. Our guide was very informative and entertaining. You do have to walk up several long ramps, which shouldn't be hard for most, but you should be aware of it if walking is difficult (they are handicapped-approved). After the tour, I did get carried away and ran down the ramps as fast as I could...the guide looked a bit disapproving as I flew by him, but at that point, there was no stopping me. No...seriously...I couldn't stop. It was fun.I recommend this tour. The Casino is a beautiful building from the outside, but you'll want to see and learn about the inside as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandGirl67

50,What I didnt know about Casinos,I had not realised that this was not a gambling casino. Apparently in the old days a casino was just a place of entertainment. The Catalina Island Casino houses a theatre and a huge ballroom. It was built in 14 months and despite that it is still in excellent condition. We had a great behind the scenes tour with a very articulate and informative guide Chuck Liddell. It is really worth a visit if only to listen to Chuck.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfanwy

50,Amazing from the Outside; Even Better on the Inside!,"Took a tour of the casino at 2 PM on Sunday, April 29th. This was en excellent tour of the theatre and ballroom inside. Our tour guide was Chuck Liddell, who was born and raised on the island. He was a fabulous tour guide, and as you could imagine, is very knowledgable about the casino as well as the island.

After walking 4 stories to get to the beautiful ballroom, you are greeted with a huge walls of murals.

I have had the pleasure of seeing several concerts and movies in this venue.The acoustics of this building are magnificent, it was designed as a concert and dance hall.The Big Band days may be behind us, but seeing a band upstairs will bring you back to those days.The theatre (below) is as large and comfortable as any modern theatres, with the added treat of (on the weekends) a gentleman will play the old pipe organ while you wait for the movie to begin. The cost of admission is comparable to most modern theatres, but the snacks are where you'll be pleasantly surprised. A soda and a popcorn can run you about 6 bucks, depending on the size. No gigantic tubs of popcorn for 12 dollars, the prices are wonderful. As you take your seat, the pipe organ plays tunes from Phantom of the Opera, or Wicked. It's an amazing talent to be able to play the antique pipe organ, and what a great way to start a movie!If you have the chance to take in a movie (they change weekly) while you're in Avalon, I strongly recommend you wander out to the Casino and enjoy a trip down memory lane and a great walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharkRescuer

50,Very informative.,"Wonderful overview of Catalinas history, and understanding it's not a actual ""Casino"" and never was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoungSeniorCruiser
40,A beautiful old venue. Take the tour.,"Historic, artistic, don't miss this. The 2PM tour is a good way to see the entire complex, and get a free ticket to the museum as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLD101
40,Nice movie experience,"For movie night, this is a nice change from a regular movie theater. Great decor in the lobby areas and inside. Was a little eerie walking in and hearing Phantom of the Opera music being played live on an organ up front. But, whatever! Snacks available for purchase but very limited selection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandGuy42
50,Beautifully restored and well worth seeing,"This is a great tour. The casino and theater have been lovingly restored. Our guide is in love with the place and it's easy to see why. I only wish I could step back in time to join 6,000 people on the dance floor in the big band days. Fortunately you can still see a movie at the theater. Both are awesome. You can take all the photos you want on the tour and it includes free admission to the museum, which is also worth seeing. You need to plan this one in advance as they don't have many tours per day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffZee
30,Beuatiful building but expensive to take the tour,Its really a beautiful building but the cost for the tour is right around 20.00 US per person which I think is real steep for a 45 min tour. Save the money and walk around and see what you can see for free. save the 20.00PP for lunch instead. If you visit Catalina it is impossible for you to miss this place! It is walking distance from the pier the cruise ships bring you to or from the dock the ferry drops you off at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElitePhx
50,Always so beautiful,Attended an event in the Casino last August 2011. It is always so beautiful up there! Take a minute to go to the museum down below to learn about the history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibujacqui
50,Wonderful Vintage Building!,"We took the tour as well as attended a movie there, and it is a wonderful, fully authentic building from the 1930's, also a very nice and interesting catalina Island museum is attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandmere1
20,Wedding Reception was alright,"I expected more for the hype. It was a huge venue, that seems so overbearing when they're are only 100 guests. I expected more formality and better service. The buffet was just ""alright"". The evening view was the only worthy thing about the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinamija
50,If you go to Catalina take this tour,"You should take this tour because of the very impressive ballroom, 1100+ seat theater and the overall design, murals, and decorations in the building. They just don't build them like this any more. Art Deco!Cost is steep at $22 for a 50 min. tour but you got to do it once. It cost an astronomical $2 million in 1928-1929 and was constructed in 14 months by crews working 24/7. Also don't forget to take in the Casino museum after the tour which normally costs $5 admission, included with your tour (dual) ticket.Went there on my birthday and got a free rt trip on the Catalina Express, part of the ferry company's celebration of their 30th anniversary...offer lasts till April 2012...a great deal since an rt trip is $70 for an adult. I figure that paid for the tour ticket, a great lunch at Steve's Steakhouse and later a beer and snacks at some joint with $s left over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007Traveling_Man
50,Gem of the Pacific,"Catalina Island, a short ride from the Los Angeles/Long Beach, CA area. On the island are available many water sports from fishing to para sailing. Rentals offer water craft of many types. The town of Avalon is small enough to easily walk it. Shops, restaurants, markets adorn the streets. Recreation from miniature golf to visiting live buffalos in the wild.And of course there is always the sand and the sun for those who choose to just relax.Top all that with the people and life style and you will have one enjoyable stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Augydoggie
40,Recommended,"Great tour, informative, should not be missed when visiting Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelgirlMalibu
30,Cool but cost way too much,"The tour and the Casino were above average but I had to give the attraction an average because the overall experience was negatively impacted by the price. We enjoyed the Casino tour. It was definitely something you should see. The problem was the cost. Like almost all things to do on Catalina, it cost about 2 times as much as it was worth. $110 dollars for family of five for a 50 minute tour. I felt ripped off but we wanted to see it so I paid it. I find it interesting that no one seems to complain about the price. Everyone that has an attraction uses the Catalina Island Tours Co. that seems like nothing but a middle man that spits out a fancy looking ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Averagefamilyguy17
50,"Educational, enjoyable and definitely a MUST SEE!","I had previously been to Catalina Island many times prior than my last trip this past week. However, I had never done the Casino Tour. After seeing the reviews on TripAdvisor, I realized that it was something I might be missing out on if I don't do it. So, I convinced my mom to join me and she is SO thankful that I did. WOW! What an unbelievable tour. It was so interesting to see and learn about such a historical landmark. Chuck Wadell was our tour guide and he was fantastic. He instantly was able to transport us into the time period when the Casino was at its prime. The organ was played for us and the entire tour was in awe. There are no stairs but all ramps so don't worry if you aren't a stair person, you will be fine. Next time I head back, I'm definitely going to be taking the behind the scenes tour now. Truly a must do on Catalina...since the Casino will be in all your pictures, you might as well know a little history about you it ;) Only an hour and worth every penny! ENJOY!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissAtalanta
50,"If you don't do this in Avalon, you screwed up.","The Casino in Avalon is absolutely central to Avalon's culture. This building is the finest example of art deco architecture I've ever seen, and I promise you the first time you see the theater and the ballroom will give you chills. The absolute best part is the staff and guides. Their love for the building and their culture is clear. If the Great Spirit smiles on you, you'll get Chuck. He was born here on Catalina and was here during the Golden Age. If this man tells a story, stop whatever you're doing and listen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSpinrad
40,"Casino Tour was great, wish Backstage Tour hadn't been sold out","My advice is to book ahead if you want the Backstage Tour. I called the morning of the tour and asked if I needed a reservation for the 12:30 tour. They said no... to arrive around 12 to buy a ticket, but when I did, it was sold out. I came back at 2 to take the Casino Tour instead. The Casino Tour was well worth the cost. It gave great information about the construction and history of the building and provided a decent sense of what it must have been like in its glory days. They showed a short film in the historic theatre, which was an unexpected treat. Unfortunately, they kept us in the back couple of rows of the theatre. I would have liked it better if they had walked us down front too, so we could see the pipe organ up close and get better photos of the murals and artwork around the stage.The building is simply gorgeous, and the Casino Tour gives you plenty of time to look around the upstairs ballroom. It also takes you out on balcony, which offers great views of the town and harbor.I just wish I had been able to book the Backstage tour, which goes to even more areas, such as dressing rooms.Admission to the Catalina Museum of History is included, so save your ticket stub to save the $5.00 admission fee. There is a great short film there about the history of the island, and some interesting displays and memorabilia, particularly about the Cubs Field of Dreams and winter training on Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kleetampa
50,Amazing Building,"If you are a fan of swing dancing, this is a must see. I didn't know anything at all about this place before I took the tour and wasn't sure I would enjoy myself, but I loved the tour and the building. It is an amazing work of art and engineering. Check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaTye
50,A great way to spend an hour & get some island history,"Let me start by saying I really wasn't interested in doing the tour, and at $17 a pop, I was a little skeptical. But the tour was quite interesting and the inside of this beautiful multi-purpose facility was phenomenal. I don't want to give too much away. Just suffice it to say that there is more than originally meets the eye. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oceanloversd
50,Amazing place to check out,"If you want to see the history of Avalon on Catalina Island, check out the casino. The tour was very educational and the tour guide was very amusing. The 10,000 sq. ft ballroom was a site to see. Take the tour if you have an extra hour, spectacular views of the town from the balcony of the casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beechtown
50,Annual 4th of July BBQ and fireworks show at the Casino,"Friends and I bought last minute tickets to the July 4th 2006 BBQ, USC marching band performance, and fireworks show at the Casino. We had a good time even though there was a big crowd. We arrived 20 minutes early and found a parking space for our golf cart right in front of the building. There was a long wait to get inside, but most of the time we had a low stone wall, in the shade, to sit on as we waited for the long line to move. Once inside we walked up the ramps to the top floor (might be hard for an elderly or inactive person to do) and we settled into a big table and got in line for the buffet. The ribs and chicken were delicious, the side dishes (beans, corn-on-the-cob, potato salad, green salad, rolls with butter, and breadsticks) and deserts (brownies, apple pie, cherry pie, lemon bars, assorted cookies) were very good too. There's a full bar and soft drinks available near the buffet tables, drinks cost extra.Considering the number of people there, it all ran smoothly and the hot food kept being replenished until everyone had a generous helping of their favorite buffet items. The ribs were so tender, moist and flavorful we gobbled them down in seconds The USC marching band, cheerleaders, baton twirler, and flag dancers put on an excellent and energetic show. We decided not to stand on the crowded balcony to watch the fireworks (chairs are not allowed on the balcony so you can't sit). Instead we drove our little golf cart down into the lower parking lot alongside the casino and had a beautiful and more comfortable (sitting) view of the fireworks show.This event has been held every year for a long time and will probably go on for many more years. Lots of USC alumni attend, as well as us non USC alumni. There were people of all ages there, including the very young and very old. Little kids were encouraged to sit up front and dance with the cheerleaders as the musical performance progressed. The kids looked like they were having a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissEllie
50,Don't Miss Out On This One!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Casino Walking Tour lasts 50 minutes, costs about 15 bucks per person... and is great!!! You get good information about the history of the Island, the Casino, and get to see some BEAUTIFUL artwork and architecture along the way. I highly recommend this tour to everyone. You get free admission to the museum with your ticket stub, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanDiego
50,A Must See,The casino is a beautiful location to take in a unique view of the island. The artistry in the ballroom is breathtaking and the unique ramp design is so deceiving that before you know it you're at the top of the casino. Its defenitely one of the must-see tours on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass15547
