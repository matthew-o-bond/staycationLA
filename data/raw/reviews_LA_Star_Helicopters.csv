50,Great tour and service,These guys are great! Logan was our pilot who expertly flew us on the Hollywood and more tour. It was great to do the LAX VFR transition over the coastline. Ofcourse the sign and homes of the rich and famous. Highly recommend,Andrew
50,Loved it!!!,"Amazing time with my son! We were barely in LA and we decided to go on a helicopter tour. So glad we did! And so glad we chose this company!Super safe and friendly pilots!If you can do it, do! You will never look back and regret it. Make those memories! This will be special!",Angela Holtz
50,LA Helicopter Tour,"There were a lot of amazing things about this tour, but the best was flying over LAX with planes taking off and landing below us. Our pilot, Dimitris, did an excellent job of describing the different sights as we flew over them. My two boys (15 and 18) had a great time.",Louie K
50,"Great tour - big city, nice long flight, great guide","Thanks to Paul, our pilot for an enjoyable and informative tour of LA, Hollywood and Adjacent boroughs.Great tour - begins in Inglewood so get to see the whole of LA as you fly up towards Santana Monica and then across Hollywood to the sign and back across to the airfield.Felt safe - although the smaller copters are a little wobbly feeling.Tour guide very knowledgable with good banter - nice treat for a vacation.",GlynB1971
50,Great Pilot & Overall Experience,"I ended up with a Saturday morning free after my co-workers left town following a conference. I'd never been to L.A., and never been on a helicopter. I'm so happy this company was referred to me! Vince (the pilot) and I were in a 2-person helicopter, which made it seem like a very personalized trip. I opted for the 50 - 60 minute tour. He was great about pointing out everything of interest and answering all my questions. I didn't feel rushed through the trip and actually loved the feel of being in a tiny flying machine! I would definitely look these guys up if I had another opportunity to do a tour in L.A. Oh, and from downtown where I had the conference, this airport is just a couple of exits shy of LAX, so I was able to grab another taxi and easily get to the airport to catch my flight on time.",CJMonkey55
40,My first helicopter ride; AWESOME Experience!,"I purchased a Groupon for a helicopter ride for 2 with Star Helicopter over USC, LAX then towards the Hollywood hills, Dodger Stadium, and finally downtown L.A. My brother and I took the trip and I believe that my left side of the helicopter seat was better for viewing than the right. Either way, it was a very fun ride. We setup the ride for sunset (4:30 in Dec), which was really cool as well. The staff was great and the pilot as well. My brother and I were a little surprised that our backpacks weren't checked prior to taking off, but perhaps we are just paranoid. Regardless, worth the money!",jpmthumb42
50,Five star tour,"We booked with this company based on trip advisor reviews and are very thankful we did. They were wonderful!!! Our pilot, Jimmy was terrific and the tour was simply fabulous. I would do this again in a minute!",Lynn K
50,Great experience!!!!!!!,"Went because we had time to kill. The reviews here were on point. We didnt have an appointment and still they made it happen for us. A really nice pilot greeted us at the door and arranged for the tour. Theres plenty to choose from, starting with the mini tour for 90 p/p. We opted for the 30 min 300 for the 2 of us. Since it was our first time on a heli we opted for less time. We made the right choice. The facilities are very clean and they make you feel comfortable.Alex was our pilot. He squeezed us in in his schedule. Alex, was really, really nice. He explained everything clearly and then we took of. It was awesome. He took us up the coast. Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Over LAX. It was awesome. We saw 2 planes take off, a few land. It was an awesome experience. During the tour Alex gave us the heads up when turning. He was really cool.If you are in the area, go on this tour. It beats the traffic! I will go again when in the area for sure!! Ask for Alex",cortavediva
50,FUN!!,"I was in LA for a wedding a few weeks ago with a friend of mine. We had plenty of time the day of the wedding to fit in an adventure. We chose the short tour with Star Helicopters called the ""Sneak Preview"" tour. It was short but I was just FINE with that. I was a little nervous flying in a tiny helicopter as it was so I didn't feel the need to book a long tour.We had a blast! Ask for Jimmy. He was a young and fun pilot from Australia. He told us all about Manhattan Beach, Redondo beach, and Hermosa beach. We then visited all 3 of those beaches on a fun and pretty drive after the heli ride! For $90 and only 20 mins... I still think it was worth it if you are looking for a little adventure.",Fun_traveler1380
50,LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!,I just finally got around to writting a review! I purchased this ride as a surprise birthday gift for my husband! And i must say this tour was breathtaking! I've lived most of my life in LA and never seen LA from the top! It was an awesome experience and my husband is already talking on going on a ride with our 9 year old! He said he was the best birthday gift he has ever received! The two pilots were so awesome they are very knowledgeable about LA and very friendly! Loved every minute of it! Oh and we did the ride during sunset! Hubby said he felt like he was in a scene of Hawaii Five 0!!!,lizy213
50,Spotting flight,"Was very exited to do a 2 hour plane spotting trip over LAX in a R-22 chopper, and was lucky to get Paul , who understood exactly what i wanted from the flight, and had the aircraft in the right place at the right time, so any bad photos are down to me. ! I you ever wanted to do air to air spotting over a major international airport , then Star Helicopters are the people for you.. Can not wait to do it again in 2017 . I rate them very , very , highly.",sirsteve1960
50,Night tour,Took my husband and my two year old daughter for a night tour of LA and it was a lot of fun! Our pilot pointed out all the sights. Can't wait to go go again.,teachlove21
50,Friendly staff and awesome ride,Used these guys last week for an aerial photo run of DT LA. The staff was friendly and accommodating and made me feel really relaxed for my first time in a helicopter. They were also punctual and just pleasant to hang out with. Highly recommended!,Bsugden
50,Wow!!!!,"We have no regrets at all in booking this trip with Star Helicopters. The memories of this flight will stay with us for a very very long time.There was a small hitch when we turned up, as we were doubled booked. However, the gentleman soon sorted this out and we went out as originally arranged.We had booked the 40-45 minute Hollywood tour in the Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter. We was toying with booking the smaller Rave I, but so glad we didn't as upon seeing the smaller one concluded it would had been a tight squeeze and we are not large people.Our pilot took as through a few safety points and the does and don'ts before getting in and then we were off! The view were stunning and with a very knowledgeable pilot made it all the more interesting. We flew over the beaches, theme parks, over LA and pass the Hollywood sign. Upon landing our pilot even indulge my girl in answering if helicopters can reverse!If you can. Do go for a helicopter flight. It is cheaper than a day drip to Disney - for three.",Debra M
50,Amazing experience!,We took the half-hour Los Angels tour and absolutely loved it! Very friendly and knowledgeable stuff.,calalik
50,Let's Fly Away,"Ever thought about a helicopter tour? This is one of the best companies I have flown.It is pricy, but certainly worth a special celebration or a very special gift.There are set tour packages that offer a variety of viewing options in the LA basin. You can customize your tour, but I would strong suggest that you discuss this at the time you make your reservation.They fly 2 seat and 4 seat Robinson helicopters. They are comfortable and provide a very smooth ride. The pilots are knowledgable about the area and provide their own twist on each narrated tour.Flights can include a bird's eye view some of the homes of Hollywood's most notables, Dodger Stadium, downtown LA, Santa Monica Pier and the list goes on.Of course, sunset tours are available that head over the nearby beaches and provide views of the coastline, mountains and downtown.Occasionally, coupons are available on Groupon. They offer a nice reduction in cost that can lighten the impact on your pocketbook or allow you to extend your tour.The office is located at the Hawthorne Airport and there is parking directly in front of the office.If time allows, stop by Eureka Tasting Kitchen (see review) before or after your fly.This should be on your to do list whether your local or tourist.You will be impressed.",LifesaSnap
50,Best helicopter ride and service ever!,Ben was our pilot -- he is the best! I surprised my family for a ride for 3 and it was so awesome. It was literally the highlight of our trip. We saw all we wanted to in LA via the ride as an overview. Very smooth ride! At first it looks scary to have the big jets fly in above you into LAX but then you get used to it and its cool! Ben took us over the buildings of downtown LA and that was pretty awesome. Everything about the experience was sooo cool. We can't stop talking about it! Thank you Star Helicopters -- we will for sure be back!,HilaryWyckoff
50,First Helicopter ride at Sunset,"I didn't know what to expect since this was my first ride in a helicopter. I would highly recommendStars Helicopter. Upon arriving we met Paul, our Pilot who was very nice. He asked us what route we would like to take and we choose the coast. He showed us on the map where we would be going. Then went outside to the helicopter where we posed for pictures which he took.After explaining all safety precautions we took off and had a wonderful experience. Paul pointed out places of interest along the way. It was a great time.",Bonnie651
50,Souring the Shoreline Tour - amazing!,"We found a brochure for Star Helicopters when staying at Hilton, Marina Del Rey.We were looking for something different for my sons 13th birthday & are so pleased we booked.We chose the Soaring the Shoreline tour, which took us over the beaches and circling the Santa Monica Pier. The pilot was fantastic, talking to us through headphones all the way.Thanks for a fantastic flight guys!",TheAucklandTraveller
50,Magnificent view of LA from the sky with Star Helicopters,"My mum was visiting from the UK and it co-incided with British Mother's Day. We have visited most of the LA tourist sites and I thought it would be pretty nice to see them all again from the sky. The trip and hour was AMAZING!! Our pilot Nina was very friendly and an exceptional pilot and tour guide, with great knowledge of LA.....the weather was fantastic and views were breathtaking......from passing over my apartment, to Palos Verdes and up the coast to Santa Monica, and then breathtaking going so close to the Hollywood sign......I would definitely recommend this as a must do in LA!! Hawthorne airport is so easy to get to and accessible.....and pretty amazing when we had to fly low so that our flight path didn't clash with planes taking off from LAX!!",Dawn S
50,A great way to start a Los Angeles vacation!,"We were only staying in Los Angeles for two nights and wanted to see as much as possible while we were there. So, we found Star Helicopters online and booked a tour. It was just two of us along with the two pilots so we had plenty of attention.After a quick safety session, we loaded up, put on the headsets, and took off. The headsets were good quality. As anyone who has ridden a helicopter knows, it makes a lot of noise. But we were able to hear the pilots as well as each other very well.The tour took us down to Long Beach and then up the coastline of Los Angeles. So, we got to see the piers and other attractions we wouldn't have had time to see otherwise. Then we took off over some of sites of Los Angeles and some Hollywood mansions. Following that, they brought us around the mountains and right across the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign! What a view!Overall, it was a great way to see Los Angeles and, though costly, the tour was worth it.",sodajunkie
