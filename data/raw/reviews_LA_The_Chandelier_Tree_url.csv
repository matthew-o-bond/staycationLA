50,Finally! 60 years later,When I was 6 years old I was given a Viewmaster and one of the photodiscs was about the Californian Redwood Forest. The thing I remembered always was the image of someone driving their car through an arch in a 300ft high fir tree.......the very same Chandelier Tree. And I did it this year just a small matter of sixty years since I first saw it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farside53
40,loved it,"while visiting LA, made the drive to see the chandelier tree in a quiet neighborhood on a perfect summer night. loved it. something beautiful among the smog, homeless issues, trash and traffic that we had experienced. LA has lots of cool things to see, but this was the highlight of a long day of exploring. i would go see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosmith7
40,Definitely worth the stop if you in the area,On our road trip up to Canada from LA we had a chance to stop off and see part of the great Redwood forested area. Where we were able to stop at Leggett am do the drive through tree. Cute little experience and a good laugh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grants976
20,Let There Be Light -- But There Was None. Disappointed!,"I'm sure this unique destination would have been wonderful to see. I recently took someone very special to this tree (as a surprise) in honor of our one-year-long relationship and was disappointed that the chandeliers were not lit, despite it being a Saturday night. Another couple was there and they gave a donation via credit card in hopes that the tree would light up. Nothing happened. I too swiped my credit card for a donation, but still the tree didn't light! Very disappointed. Tsk, tsk, tsk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCofPointLight
20,Time to kill,It is a small tree (can not drive thru it??) on private property. It has several chandeliers hanging from the tree. If you are in the area - OK but otherwise ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockcole
40,Unique Stop,"This was a fun stop on our road trip. The tree was pretty narrow to drive thru, BUT where else you drive through a tree? This was a really unique visit, if you have never done it, it is worth a stop. They charge is $5 to get into the park, then if you use your ticket they will give you $1 off your gift shop purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makjms
30,awe inspiring,Well we wanted to make a point of seeing some huge majestic trees and we found it in the Chandelier tree.Our rental car just squeezed through the tree.Our 10 yr old have never seen a tree so large.The drive up around this area is also stunning with these green giants towering alongside the road.It was a quick rest stop on our drive from LA to seattle.We saw cute chipmunks there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9749FGkarenw
40,Unique creation,"Chandler tree is a single tree in coastal CA .This huge tree has a big natural hole at the base .The parson who owns the tree has created a road ,(without harming it anyway ) which passes through this tree , wide enough for a car,sub to pass through This is a novel idea, worth visiting the place.Gift shop and rest room facilities exist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roydinesh
20,Overrated,It is just a tree which has been lit up by a lot of Chandeliers. Does not look that interesting or fancy that it deserves a visit. It is best to be skipped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Quick stop,So wouldn't recommend if you tight on time.. It's an individual effort.. Lots of chandeliers hanging from a tree.. Different types and looks pretty..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
50,Chandelier Tree,If you're driving through the silver lake area and have time to kill I highly recommend making a quick stop and check out the chandelier tree,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianlperalta13
40,Glitz And Glamour,There is nothing that say's glamour like a Chandelier. A touch of elegance hanging from a tree. Very unique and beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolwU9291FA
50,"Magical, you simply must see it","I read about this a few months ago and vowed that on my next visit to L.A I would make sure I stopped by to see it. This is a magical place the beautiful chandeliers in the tree of this private home are simply stunning. Please leave a donation if you do visit and remember that this is a private home in a residential area of Los Angeles, please be respectful. I will be back in town in August and will come and see it again, it is just that beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ausjet
50,"Let there be light (and art, and joy and sweetness)!","Adam has created an illuminating experience for anyone who walks, drives or otherwise mosses by... what a gift to the community. I rented his airbnb cottage for the night and made it so that my sweetheart and I drove up after dark.... the tree beckoned us from a block away... and made me want to dance in the moonlight, sing silly songs, skip, play and frolic! What a gift of love, light, art, creativity and community. Check this special place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLE08
50,One-of-a-Kind Ode to Light!,"As a lover not just of trees but of chandeliers, this attraction was a must for me! And it did not disappoint. We visited at sunset on Christmas Eve, a perfect time all around, there was even partying inside the hosts' home. The size was surprising, as was the variety of chandeliers and the way it all came together as a work of art. Highly recommended, but remember this is on private property. So don't overstay your welcome, respect the homeowners' privacy, and leave a donation in the box provided to help light the beauty you've enjoyed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
40,Curious,"Read about the Chandelier Tree a while back, and never had the chance to check it out until tonight, it's only about 11 minutes from the Griffith Obseratory so it worked out perfect. There wasn't a crowd and parking was a piece of cake. Took some pictures and I'm in love with the concept of this. Wished there were more places like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katzeee8
40,A LA Oddity for Seven Years!,"So I was in the San Fernando Valley and I had stopped in Griffith Park to figure out what I was going to do next on this fine afternoon. I really didn't have a plan but I knew I wanted to see something. So I looked up land marks on my trusty smartphone and presto the chandelier tree was only 2 miles away. Well I'm going to see this I said. I don't have a clue as to what it is, but I will find out! I drove to where the chandelier tree and found it was on a side street off Los Feliz. It was on the corner of a dead end side street. I went up the street turned around came back and parked in the red zone right next to the chandelier tree. It was interesting a big sycamore tree with lots and lots of chandeliers gracing the branches. As it was daytime so the chandeliers weren't lit up just yet. The is a little parking meter in front of the tree. It is an ornate parking meter for sure. The parking meter said donations. I'm sure this guy is using the donations to pay for his electricity so I dropped a few coins immediately. Wow what an interesting idea! Well as I looked up and and there was a man sitting on the porch he said howdy I said howdy and we chatted a little. Yes it was his house his name was Adam Tenenbaum. He put the tree up about 7 years ago and it's been a local hit. We chatted about some other things and he said well in about 20 minutes I'll turn it on turn on the lights for you.Without asking, Adam went in and turned on the lights.I took a few more pictures I thanked him, and went on my way. Have you seen it the chandelier tree? if you live in Los Angeles and you are in the area come by in the evening and see it when its lit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
