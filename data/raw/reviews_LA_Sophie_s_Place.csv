50,Great brunch,"We stopped off for a quick midday meal, and were offered the brunch menu, with a choice of IPA's. Fantastic service - very knowledgeable about the craft local IPAs on offer, and perfect for a cool down after a long walk.",David H
30,Holiday Stroll,"We stopped early because the village was wonderfully crowded as was Sophie's. No one at the front but we did get a table after hunting around. The food was very good, service spotty given the crowd and they brought the wrong wine to my wife and it was at close to room temperature. Seemed eager to get us out as the streets were mobbed. Have had better meals here so maybe just this evening!",Steve S
30,Small and noisy but good food,Had a breakfast meeting here. We had the entire restaurant. There were 30-35 of us and we pretty much took most seats except at the bar. Must pay for meter parking which is a pain as people kept running in and out. Our menu was nice and food nicely presented and tasty. The first table was served before our order was even taken. When I left some people had not yet been served. It was extremely noisy making conversation challenging.,SandraAl
50,Delicious!,"Must Order: Bacon Dates - mouthwatering doesn't do it justice. Small little space, with outdoor space - fun live music on Sundays. Food was amazing! This whole little part of town is super cute and great for dates or casual nights with friends.",Samantha S
