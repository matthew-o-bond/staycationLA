50,Andy Warhol exhibit,"Great art, amazing Warhol belongings in a friendly manageable gallery. And free. Thank you revolver gallery.",HBS
50,Great Place!,"This was a fun, interactive exhibit of a great collection of Warhol, many that we have not seen before! Excellent collection and a lot of photo opportunities.",marjesam
50,Fabulous Warhol exhibit,Extensive and also included a documentary! I've seen several Warhol exhibits but the Revolver exhibit included not only his art but a documentary and even his Rolls Royce. Loved it so much I went twice in order to absorb all.,pinggirl
50,Best Warhol collection you'll see,"This is by far the largest, most diverse, and most impressive collection of Andy Warhol prints and paintings you will ever see. It's unbelievable that so many iconic and important pieces are housed all together. Other museums might have a few Warhol pieces, so you should make it out to Revolver soon before it moves to another city because you may never see all the great work of this great artist ever again.",engranadaeresgranada
40,Unexpected Warhol Explosion,"This was a really unexpected stop on my day in Santa Monica, nestled among all of the other galleries and studios in Bergamont Station. On a whim, I made a reservation to the gallery online. One can never see too many Warhol pieces right? The exhibit includes a complete collection of art pieces from Marilyn Monroe to the iconic Campbell soup and Andy's own Rolls Royce.One note, you need to reserve your free tickets before you visit. Unlike the other free LA museums (like the Broad) you can usually get tickets for the same week or next day.",Patricia J
