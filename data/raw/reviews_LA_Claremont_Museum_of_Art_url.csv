50,"Take the train for the art, stay for the community fun!",This place has all kinds of different exhibits. It is a fun place to ride the train to and then stay in Claremont for lunch or dinner. No need to worry about parking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewelzpedroza
40,Support this one!,"Apparently this very small museum has occupied other spaces and now finds what is, hopefully, a permanent home in the Old Santa Fe rail depot. The curator/docent/ticket taker says that it occupies two rooms but, truth be told, its more like one and a half because the foyer room also houses the desk that takes your $5 admission and distributes the tickets and other literature. However, the selection of works by Claremont-associated artists that is on display is no disgrace. There is likely to be at least a couple that you will find arresting in the best possible way. Most of these are paintings. A member of the museum staff explained to us, at some length, the background of one artist and his other contributions that could be found on public buildings in town, including the local Post Office. There is also a fine small sculpture section that includes a fearsome pike (the fish, not the weapon) and a touching pair of figures, hugging in the shelter of an enfolding cape - recalling the angst of refugees and other so-called ""aliens"". I was impressed and wish the principles well in their search for appropriate space in which to honor the town's artistic heritage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taughboyne
50,One of the True Gems of Claremont!,"While Claremont is definitely charming at first site, it's historical roots are deep! Claremont Museum of Art is a definite must!

Plus it's located in the historic Claremont Depot....a WIN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4907ZTjosev

50,"Claremont Museum of Art, Always a Surprising Treat","I have visited 4 times, 4 different shows, and each time they are different, and captivating.The Claremont Museum is not large, so you can spend some time with each piece. Usually, I am done in an 45 minutes, and there is always something new and refreshing, that captures your imagination.Make sure to visit the Museum Store next door. They have some very unique items that I have never seen anywhere else. My only suggestion to the store is that it used over one-hundred very high watt light bulbs that should be converted to more modern energy saving low-watt bulbs with the same or more lumens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aceaceace
50,Great museum with a fun quirky store!,"I've been to two exhibits at this museum and they were both so unique and interesting. I can't wait to see what they do next. This museum is such an asset to Claremont. It's in an old renovated packing house and there's shops and restaurants all around. Plus, the museum has the coolest store. Way better than LACMA. We take the Metrolink in from Union Station and spend the whole day in Claremont.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5nationarmy
50,I love this little Museum!,"What a great little gem! Thoughtful, interesting exhibitions in a really cool space. And it's surrounded by shops, galleries, bars and restaurants, so it's a really great little get-away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holarubia
50,Must see museum...,"Great new fine art museum. Eclectic, quirky, and unusual exhibitions in an interestingly rehabbed, historic building. Once again Claremont exceeds one's high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzzy11
50,Great art getaway when you don't want to deal with Bubbly Hills and Hollyweird.,"Anything past downtown LA is considered too far by most west-siders, but Claremont, just 30 minutes East of Pasadena, is worth the trip. Take the 210 East to Towne--the view of the mountains, including the great Mount Baldy is spectacular. The Claremont Museum of Art is located in a historic citrus packing house, which also houses great shops and restaurants. The Museum is a small package, but the exhibitions have a depth that can captivate even the most astute art enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hulaspacegirl
