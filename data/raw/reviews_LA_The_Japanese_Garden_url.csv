30,A lovely garden but beware the boat house television!,All the reviews describing how lovely the garden is are true. In early February we were additionally enchanted by an elegant white heron that calmly walked along the edge of the lake a few feet from where we were standing plus geese and cormorants and lots of lively ducks. The magic spell however was pretty much destroyed when we arrived at the boathouse. From the outside we could see benches that had a stunning view of the silver blue lake so we strolled in only to almost run right out. At the back of the room is a television where a voice is going on and on about how wonderful the Japanese Garden is which completely destroys the serenity of the most beautiful part of it. Inexplicable!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerEB
50,A peaceful hour in the San Fernando Valley,"Beautiful trees,water foul, and even turtles. This garden, hydrated with reclamated water, is a peaceful way to spend an afternoon. A great way to recharge your battery while seeing ecology working",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572pamm
50,"Peace, Peace...with a Star Trek connection!","These gardens are very well laid out. No matter which direction you look, it is beautiful and peaceful. You meander through paths to find joy around every corner. Ducks enjoy the ponds while a white crane keeps watch. We even saw an osprey flying overhead, close enough to see the detail of his plumage! Highly recommend this place. Oh, the Star Trek connection. Scenes of the Training Academy in Star Trek Next Generation were filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroltL5406DN
40,Japanese Garden Van Nuys California,A serenity can be achieved in this tranquil setting. Los Angeles has surpassedmany metropolitan regions with this example of how to camouflage a reclaimed water treatment plant. The gardens provide a beautiful foregroundwith a desert garden with pergola for sitting or meditating on the shade. The water garden is in bloom with lotus and water lily while providing a habitat for small fish. The stone lanterns are placed gracefully throughout and keep your eyes open for the falcon that frequents the trees by the waterfall.

50,A quiet place for contemplation,"This is a gem in the midst of a bustling megalopolis. Once I entered its walls, the peace and beauty overwhelmed me. My daughter, who lives not far away (as in L.A. County not-far-away), says she will make this a place to escape the hustle and bustle of the workday world. Every community needs something like this.

10,Poor Communication with Customers,"I have no idea if this garden is beautiful or not but I'm giving it 1 star because all sites that reference the garden say closing time is 4pm.I drove an hour to get there and arrived at 3:15pm, only to be told by a guard that they actually close at 3:15pm...they just don't have the ability to update sites accordingly.The garden is run by the LA Department of Public Works. Great job guys! Way to put our taxpayer money to good use in benefiting citizens. Nothing like wasting their time AND providing a poor experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cineasta48
50,Escape the city and reconnect with nature!,"This Japanese garden is divided into three: Karesansui, Chisen-Kaiyushiki, and the tea garden. The best time to visit in on Springtime since flowers bloom and you'll see the cherry blossoms. It was designed by the famous Japanese garden design Doctor Koichi Kawana who also designed a dozen garden all throughout US. When you get there, make sure to follow the garden etiquette so you won't get kick out. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinaynomad7

30,Hard to get to - if walking!,"We were staying about a mile away so we decided to walk to the garden. There was no signage as to the location of the garden, which is next to a water plant. We finally found it, but were disappointed. Maybe it was the time of the year - February - so nothing was in bloom. Might be better in the late spring and summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinyRides
50,A great place to chill,"I was returning from a visit to the dermatologist when I saw the sign for the Japanese Garden, which is in the Balboa Park area of the San Fernando Valley. I didn’t have to be anywhere for the rest of the day, so I entered the park. I walked around the garden grounds for a while then sat down. It is a great example of Japanese landscapes and art. It is a very calming place in an otherwise busy part of Los Angeles. A twenty minute stop doing nothing can sure lower ones blood pressure and clear the mind. I have to come here more often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Beautiful Oasis in the City,"LA has many hidden gems. This is one of them!

I was born and raised here and never knew about it until now when my step mother told us about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mismojorisin
50,Stunning Garden of Peace and Happiness,"I have lived in the San Fernando Velley for more than ten years and only now discovered the stunning Japanese Garden. It comprises more than six acres of perfectly designed paths along peaceful waterways or ""The Water Garden"" which has spectacular lotus patches (dormant in the winter). There is also a small lake, home to ""Crane Island"" where I was lucky enough to see a magnificent crane resting on the rock island in the center. It is also home to other aquatic birds such as herons, ducks and egrets. Walking on towards the traditional tea house, one comes upon a three level waterfall representing ""heaven, man and earth."" The circuit around the park takes about an hour, although resting to enjoy the peace and beauty made my stay a lot longer. There is also a ""Viewing Tower"" one can climb to observe the wastewater reclamation plant. This visit I skipped it but intend to go next time as the process is fascinating and supplies all of the water to maintain this lovely park along with 800,000 residents of the area. There is also a beautiful administration building/museum that affords a viewing platform for the lake, tapestries and a looped film of traditional flower arranging. In conclusion, there is so much more to say, but I recommend you go and see for yourself. It was a delightful way to spend my lazy Sunday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lollydepaulo
50,Treasure in LA,"My son and I visited here as a bucket ist item because a friend of mine worked here and kept telling me I needed too. What a cool place.

40,Zen atmosphere,Beautiful park and lovely photo opportunities. The only drawback is some places have a bad odor.Otherwise very zen like and actually very peaceful with butterflies and waterfalls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meena452
40,Unexpected surprise in Van Nuys!,"I spent a warm afternoon walking around the ""lake"". Taking my time for each of my photos. At first I was disappointed to to see such huge concrete building in the middle of the garden - it kind of takes you out of the tranquility. But after a while the big slabs or concrete were actually great photo subjects. For a water garden, yes some of the grounds did not look as lush as you expect, but the experience was nice and a great value for afternoon stroll.The whole purpose of the garden is to show the use of reclaimed water -- All part of the Tillman Reclamation Water Plant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142lp
40,Zen place,Beautiful park. It is pretty small but very peaceful. You can go and relax. There are different kind of plants and trees from the Japanese culture. I will recommend to go there if you like Nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthogx

50,The Japanese Garden,This garden opened up in 1984. It is a very fine example of a Zen Garden. Not many people know about the garden and Water Reclamation Plant that supplies water to several places in the Sepulveda Basin. If you are looking for peace and serenity the Japanese garden is the perfect place to go. They also offer docent tour if you make a reservation ahead of your visit.

10,It's not worthy!,"We went during the winter and everything was dry, almost not flowers at all, we get that because of the season is not as beautiful as it could be in spring or summer but it should be a recommendation, we traveled more than an our to get there, just to be disappointed and there were some real bad smells in some parts of the garden and lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulalvor
40,Lovely Sunday Stroll,"I've lived in LA for many years and had never visited this garden on 6-1/2 acres before. Clean and lovely for strolling on winding paths. Lots of different birds. We stumbled on Tony one of the security guards and he was a wealth of information on the birds, plants, Japanese stories. It really added to our time spent there. Entrance is $5 and there is an abundance of free parking in a lot near the gift shop and entrance. The water to maintain this garden comes from the adjoining Tillman water reclamation plant. The garden des gene by Dr. Koichi Kawana integrates itself with of modern main building of the water plant. I enjoyed exploring this place. I'm not sure I would return here soon since, before returning I'd rather discover somewhere new.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
30,For 1 hour walk,"Too few shops and shadows. We went there with a pregnant friend, and I was forbidden to take pictures of her! We said that the photo session is not professional, not commercial, but the employee went behind us and forbade us to shoot. Very unpleasant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_O3507TD
30,Disappointed,"Not expensive admission and free parking. I was expecting so much more. All greenery, no flowers. Very pretty layout and great water fowl. The plants should be marked so you know what you are viewing.There is an indoor exhibit but the volume on the exhibits below the videos were turned down so low you could not hear them. Extremely small gift shop which is too bad. Expand gift shop or add items and it could be useful tool to raise funds for the garden. Only need about an hour to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,A nice surprise,This is the biggest Japanese garden I've ever been to. It's amazingly well kept. $5 admission and discounts for seniors and kids. The water lilies is my favorite section. I wish they had koi fishes otherwise it's definitely worth a peek.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25huyd
50,A very beautiful garden,"It is a beautiful garden different from landscape which one generally see. It has small bridges, beautiful tress, Lamps, a fall and much more. One can see ducks floating in water or sitting under tree. At the entrance of garden one is given a information sheet which explain what all spots mean in the garden. Its a well maintained and very peaceful garden. The garden is not more than a mile walk and one can take stroller, wheelchair as well. Our family loved it especially our daughter who was excited to see ducks and fishes floating in water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
50,What a Great Deal!,"$5 to explore this garden is a steal! There are so many beautiful plants and trees. I very much enjoyed sitting on a bench to read the informational brochure and being greeted by a pair of geese! They walked so close to me and didn't seem bothered by my presence at all. I also got to see hummingbirds and ducks which was a bonus. I didn't notice the smell that some reviews had talked about but probably as an environmental engineer I am just not phased by it. The gardens are well designed with plenty of viewing areas and benches. If you plan to take pictures, make sure you read the photography policy on their website as no professional photography is permitted. I brought my little polaroid and had no issues using it and also took a few selfies on my iPhone. Just be respectful of the garden and the people around you :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancekatiedance
30,Strange surroundings detract from beautiful Japanese Gardens.,"My friend and I visited the Woodley Park Japanese Garden on April 9, 2017. We were at Woodley Park all day for a car show and had time to kill so we decided to walk around the gardens next door to see something new. We also had just rode our bikes back from the 94th Aero Squadron Sunday brunch next to Van Nuys Airport where we had gorged ourselves so we needed to walk off some of the bloat. The garden entrance is right off of Woodley Avenue and there is a security guard shack at the top of the driveway incline. We locked our bikes up at the bike rack next to the tiny gift shop and paid the $5 adult admission.My friend and I often bike from Seal Beach to Cal State Long Beach and hang out at the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Gardens located there. We thought our visit to the Woodley Park Japanese Gardens would make for an interesting comparison of the two. Woodley Park is over 4 times the size of EBM (6.5 acres vs 1.3). Both gardens have a wide variety of plants, manicured rock/zen gardens and water features. There are a few functional pavilion/teahouse structures of varying sizes scattered throughout Woodley Park, whereas the EBM has only one small teahouse which seems primarily for display only.There weren’t very many large koi at the Woodley Park Japanese Gardens, and those that we did see were only at the exit building and all were only black/dark grey in color. No feeding allowed! EBM has HUGE koi of various bright colors and you can purchase food to feed them to make them bigger. You can even pet them! Occasionally you may spot some tortoises wading around at EBM. Woodley Park did seem to be more types of birds compared to EBM, including some ducks and Canadian geese honking away.As a photographer, I find EBM better for photography. No matter where you point your camera the entire EBM gardens provide a nice, clean and beautiful background. Lots of thought seems to have gone into the photographic considerations at EBM. The Woodley Park Japanese Gardens is situated right next to the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant so from certain viewpoints there are factory/refinery structures that could photobomb your pictures if you’re not careful. In general, the reclamation plant is omnipresent and kind of makes it hard to chill out with the industrial sights, sounds and smells pervading in the garden.To exit the Woodley Park Japanese Gardens you walk through a building that is strangely incongruent with the tranquil garden surroundings. The architecture and interior decor of the building is literally a late 1970’s/early 1980’s time capsule, like something out of Logan’s Run. This building also serves an administrative function for the reclamation plant and you can walk from the garden up some stairs to a walkway to view the plant operations, which can be a smelly proposition.Although it was nice to finally visit the Woodley Park Japanese Gardens, I find myself preferring the intimacy of the EBM Japanese Gardens at Cal State Long Beach for a few reasons. 1) Admission to EBM is free. 2) You can feed the koi at EBM (25¢). 3) EBM is isolated from smelly industrial facilities and noise. 4) The exit building at Woodley Park is a total eyesore. It’s dated and grimy appearance detracts from the beautiful and tranquil setting of the gardens. But if you’re in the Woodley Park area definitely visit the Japanese Gardens for some peace and tranquility if you can manage to blot out the presence of the reclamation plant and exit building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pingvuiini
40,Awakening of nature,"Colorful flowers, various greens, in the middle of nature. You easily will forget the daily problems. I strongly recommend to visit this exquisite area of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yasarlev
10,Morning Walk,Went on a Monday morning...cool day and great for walking the serene paths. A few flowers were in bloom and more will be coming out. This is a surprise to find in the valley area and highly recommend to go and visit. Seniors are $3.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheapEats019
50,A quiet haven,"The Japanese Garden really is a place to get away from it all. Six acres of beautifully planned and executed gardens, incorporating all the essential features of A Japanese garden, dry landscape, lakes, tea house, lanterns and bridges.The water all comes from a treatment plant behind the garden and now and then we had a little 'whiff' from the plant but that is more than made up for by the gardens,Toucans, herons and ducks add to the atmosphere.The gift shop has excellent quality souvenirs at prices that don't hurt. My top visit in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9179UEpeterg
50,Relaxing Enterlude,"We enjoying walking this garden. There is limited mobility access and a beautiful and peaceful place to wonder, even with small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryBad987
40,Serene and Tranquil,"Of course it takes visitors coming in to town for me to finally discover this hidden gem in The Sepulveda Basin! This is located by the water reclamation plant so be prepared for a bit of an offensive smell which permeates throughout the garden.There is a good sized parking lot and parking is free. You pay your entrance fee at the gift shop which is wheelchair and stroller accessible. The volunteer at the gift shop was incredibly helpful advising the best places to stop and enjoy.There is one place at the beginning of the path where you will need to walk on stepping stones in order to access a covered sitting area to appreciate the dry garden. You can see everything from the path as it may be tricky for seniors and definitely not accessible for wheelchairs. However there is much to enjoy further along and as the volunteers repeatedly tell you, stay on the path!The paths are clearly marked. There is plenty of places to stop and sit on benches. It was hot the day we visited and I do recommend bringing some water, which they allow.There is wheelchair accessibility to the tea house and Japanese house in the back of the garden as well as a clean public bathroom.So take a cleansing breath and enjoy the serene tranquil beauty that comes from peaceful simplicity! I most definitely will come back to see the cherry blossoms but even in mid November, there were lilies in the lily pond, azaleas of various colors and of course the bonsai trees that made this experience magical!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Syllyt01
50,Surprising Oasis of Beauty in a Terribly Ugly City,"We live in Van Nuys and are always grumpy about the filth of the place from the gum spots on every square inch of concrete to the air quality which has been ruined by the 2 airports flanking the city. However, the Japanese Garden is a patch of beauty, elegance and function right up the road from us and is the centerpiece of the duck and geese filled Balboa Gardens which, if there were no drought, would be stunning and the Sepulveda Basin area which has amazing wilderness. The Gardens are cheap to get into and we never resent paying as the money is put to great use. This is the 'front window' of the Tillman water reclamation works, a marvel of water engineering. Worth seeing on its own (a bit of a whiff but you are looking at the collective result of Los Angeleans' preoccupation with food.). Anyway, on all scores, this is a magical place. We have been there and the only people in the place were a couple of Japanese girls and an elderly Armenian poet who was writing while gazing across the gorgeous lakes and islands. It's one of LA's best kept secrets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyRJarretaderas
50,Tranquility Abounds,"What an awesome place to visit on a lazy afternoon! Right in our backyards, a garden of flowers, trees, water and fish. It is easy to feel like you are getting back to nature. The path is easy to navigate with quaint bridges and unique mosaic studded walkways. The tea house has the most spectacular view, enjoy a drink and cookies while you relax. The Crepe Myrtles were in bloom reminiscing cherry blossoms but in late August. Events are held during the year so visit the website for a schedule. Very reasonable pricing as well. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary1
50,Serenity in a concrete jungle,"To come to such a place of beauty, serenity and tranquility in the midst of a concrete jungle is such a peaceful experience! Your first view of the garden as you enter through the gates takes your breath away. There are several areas of the garden in which to view, take lots of photographs or to sit and meditate. You can take a docent led tour, or take your time and do a self guided tour. You will walk in wonder when you visit this location. There is the dry ""zen"" garden. To sit in the shade of the wisteria covered arbor and contemplate the serenity, brought such peace. The water garden, oh my! All of the flowers, the color and beauty was amazing. You may even find a few different species of birds, I was lucky enough to see Egyptian ducks and brown pelicans. Learning the history of this location, knowing that all the water that flows in this quiet beauty is reclaimed water from the reclamation plant right next door, and to also fid out that the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation was also filmed here, was just wonderful. Stop and take in the peace that washes over you as you listen to the water flow at the water fall. Wear good walking shoes and maybe a hat if it's a warm day. Take your time and just enjoy the peaceful views no matter where you are in the garden! It's a small piece of heaven in the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottesl

40,Unique experience,"Who knows you can build such a beautiful garden next to a sewage plant? That in itself is worth a visit. The name is just perfect. Water and fragrant garden, except the frangrance comes from the chemical used to treat waste water so you feel like u r in a public toilet almost the entire stay.

50,Tranquil and beautiful,"My mom and I went to the Japanese garden in the month of May around 11am. The garden was absolutely beautiful and walking around was relaxing.

Lots of parking available and entrance fee is only $5.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victoria_BCTravelbug
50,Better than I expected.,"This a beautiful garden in the middle of an urban area. It is small, but had nice paths, lanterns, bridges, and of course bonsai trees.

40,Lovely,"I live just across the street from this place and had always wanted to walk over and check it out. Before you go, ALWAYS check the operating hours that day as they can be intermittent and unreliable. Also, this is not like a public park, so no outside food or drinks.Even though the space is a little small, these gardens are especially beautiful. As someone who is very interested in Japan and Japanese culture, it was great to spend a couple hours relaxing on the benches and taking in the scenery. They've done an excellent job with the walls around the garden to block out the noise and clutter of the surrounding city. The price of admission is cheap ($5 donation I think?), and goes to keeping the gardens maintained.I have every intention of going back again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatEmeraldGuy

40,A peaceful respite in the middle of the Valley,"I have always loved Japanese gardens... their serenity and simplicity soothe me. The Japanese Garden is no exception. Fortunately, even with L.A.'s drought since 2011, this garden looks good. Why? Because it is right next to the Tillman Reclamation Plant, which provides recycled water for this garden and also for Lake Balboa (another of my favorite places). My friend and I were the only visitors on this day and so we could sit down and enjoy the quiet and the beauty of watching the birds on the lake... a Snowy Egret and several American Coots. I've seen more birds on other visits. The only noise is an occasional plane passing over from Van Nuys Airport. I saw a few water lilies starting to bloom and am awaiting the beautiful Wisteria Vines that trail over the pergolas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea

Does not compare to the Huntington Botanical Gardens we had seen the day before but much more manageable for children as the scale is smaller although no less gorgeous.

30,The Japenese Garden,"We went a few weeks ago to pass some time during the day and this is exactly what the Garden is for. Its too small to spend any more time than say, two hours - maximum. I thought it would be larger and was a bit disappointed. If you ignore the continual overhead noise from planes which are taking off and landing from Burbank, its quite peaceful. Overall the Gardens are beautifully maintained and give off an aura of tranquillity. This is a nice place to visit if you are local but not worth anything more than say a 30 minute drive to reach. Although they give tours to school children, I'm not sure this is really geared for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaybea33
40,Peaceful and Beautiful,"Part of the Sepulveda Basin Recreation area, I was pleasantly surprised by the calm beauty of this place. It was also a great example of water conservation. This is not a place to go if you're looking for excitement but rather a place to go when you've exhausted your favorite spots in LA and are exhausted from seeing them. Also part of a large recreational area that houses cricket fields, walking trails, etc. Plan properly and you could very well have a rejeuvenating day away from all the main attractions in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseSF
50,An unknown joy in Los Angeles,"What a rather unknown treasure in the city of Los Angeles. The garden is beautiful, restful, inviting.peaceful. What a joy! There are several different gardens - strolling, flowers, lakes, wildlife, plus a teahouse. Fun to go on special days, with music or children's activities or when cherry blossoms are in bloom or in fall for the fall foliage. The garden is even available for rental for private events. It is part of the Los Angeles City's water reclamation center. A great civic idea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieLA
20,Could've been made nicer,"I am so sad to say that i am so disappointed of this place. I really wanted to go there for a while and I finally did (today).I just don't understand why they can't make it more exciting and educational.The water smelled so bad that my kids were holding their noses all the time. There were ducks, geese and fish but the bad smell prevented us from getting all the fun.Bonsai trees enclosure was seriously boring.I will include my own images soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/younis79
50,Wonderful garden plus the water treatment facility,"The Japanese Garden in Van Nuys is open to the public for strolling. However, it is much better to take a docent led tour on weekday mornings. You can understand the elements of the garden. You can also see the water reclamation facility that treats all the sewage from the San Fernando Valley. The garden is watered from this facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
50,A Happy Accident,"Looking for the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve and happened onto a lovely Japanese Garden instead. Spent two beautiful hours there taking pictures of many water lilies, Green Herons, Canadian Geese, doves, bamboo, etc... If you need a little bit of a respite in an otherwise busy day, a visit to this Japanese Garden is just the ticket. If you like to paint, there are many area where one could sit and sketch or paint. There is however a rule that no easels or tripods allowed on the paths. What appeals to the environmentalist in me is that the ponds are of reclaimed water. This was a perfect way to spend a sunny day with a friend and practice my photography. A lovely gift shop is there and the ladies who work there are pretty hilarious and friendly. There are events at the Japanese Gardens like origami folding and Ikebana flower arrangements if you want to learn. I would gladly return just for the water lilies. They were spectacularly colorful and a great subject to take pictures of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiZ_12
50,An Island of Calm,I am hesitant to share this treasure and have it go from a quiet oasis in Los Angeles to a tourist-packed chaos.This is a much larger than the usual Japanese Garden as it is part of an L.A. water reclamation plant and it borders on a bird sanctuary. You never know who will fly by or stop in.Please treat this beautiful garden with respect when you visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilY456
40,Quiet and Pretty,"It is difficult to find their hours on their website --- look under ""Contact Us"" or call the phone #. Note that they aren't open Fri-Sat.Modest admission fee (and free to members of any American Horticulture Society member garden if you have the appropriate membership card).We were lucky to see water lilies and a few cherry blossoms (there aren't too many cherry trees) in bloom. There are some rock garden spaces, a few water features, many birds and water fowl.There is a Japanese tea house where you can sit and admire the few. We came on a Sunday when they served tea or soft drinks and cookies ($3).In the large building there are a few short films of Japanese cultural interest and a video about the adjacent water treatment facility (all the garden water is recycled from there).Ample parking, not crowded the day we went (probably not usually crowded since it's not very well known). They offer several special event days throughout the year - check the calendar online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldhousegirl
50,Beautiful Peaceful Garden - Amid Frantic LA - A Must Stop,"I have an affinity for the meditative nature of a well manicured, peaceful park. The Japanese Gardens in Van Nuys is just such a place. The Sepulveda Basin is driven through by thousands every day. The 101 and 405 take traffic by the tens of thousands daily, and the Gardens sit peacefully amid the frantic pace of Los Angeles. For a quiet stroll, a beautiful afternoon, a contemplative session, or a meditative space, this is a wonderful place to visit. It is always interesting to find local friends who have never heard of the place or given it the I will get to it later excuse. This beautiful park is awaits all in an unlikely location, Van Nuys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
50,Piece of JAPAN,"I don't know how to describe calmness and peace I felt when I visited Japanese Garden. Such a great work and detailed art. I love Japanese culture and this is amazing place to feel, to see and to be lil part of Japanese Culture. Amazing place for family, friends or couples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570leonardoc
40,A beautiful break from LA,"Situated adjacent to a water reclamation plant, the gardens offer a respite from the noise and traffic of LA. It is peaceful and well designed around a pond with ducks, herons, and cranes. The tea house serves, yes, tea, provides a beautiful view onto the ponds. It's a favorite spot to kill time before flying out of Burbank or to just slow down a bit from the day. There are water lilies and lotus flowers and aforementioned birds. Small islands dot the ponds and black pebble walkways make for a visually peaceful spot. And the fact that the ponds use the reclaimed water makes the award-winning architecture of the plant blend well with the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel-adventure42
40,B+,Make sure to bring a camera. The architecture/design are very nice. I actually liked the fragrance. I'm assuming it's some sort of scents flavored in the water. Anyway it was worth a visit. Not sure about going back tho. $5 for adults and $3 for seniors and child.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bomle
40,Finally went on a day when it was open,I have tried over several years to visit the Japanese gardens and finally it was open after several failed attempts. It is a smallish garden but very nice. A nice way to spend an afternoon. The tea house is very relaxing to sit and enjoy some tea and biscuits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveagreatvacation
30,"Unique, Quirky, and Beautiful Japanese Garden","I have mixed feelings about this garden. It was built over/around a sewage treatment plant and water reclamation facility. The name in Japanese, Suiho En, seems somewhat cynical and tongue-in-cheeck (means ""Garden of Water and Fragrance""). You can smell the slight fragrance of sewage treatment, but I didn't find it objectionable (may depend upon the wind direction and other factors).The design and layout of the garden apparently changed, since the entrance is through a workers' gate in the back. The ""real entrance gate"" is in the front, but is now a restricted area where guests are not allowed to go. This is silly and unforgivable for a Japanese garden.The garden has massive water features and covers 6.5 acres. The pines are expertly pruned, and are probably the greatest feature of this garden. They alone are worth the trip to see this garden. The tamamono shrubs are lucious, dreamy, and some of the best shearing I have ever seen. The buildings such as the tea house and gazebos (azumayas) are high quality and built with great craftsmanship.......definitely worth a long and detailed look.Now the downsides. The pathways are artsy cement and flagstone construction that is inappropriate for a Japanese garden. Here and there one sees industrial equipment and pipes that detract from the overall appearance. The shoreline of the pond is a fake-natural cement, with only a few stones here and there. It would have been better to make the pond smaller, but pay more attention to the beauty of the shoreline. The worst aspect of this garden is the low quality, and low quantity, of the stones. Also, the setting of the stones employs marginal skell. Most are brown, unattractive stones. You would not see such stones in the gardens of Japan. The Sakuteiki says that the most important feature of a garden is the stones, and this garden proves that true. As soon as you walk in, you sense something strange and unpleasant..........the lack of attractive and natural stones. If it weren't for this one major defect, this Suiho En would be one of the top Japanese Gardens in all of North America. Really a shame.Nevertheless, you have got to see this place. It is worth going out of your way to experience the Suiho En.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pontevecchio56
50,Love this place!,"Had a great experience here, so beautiful and peaceful.. Enjoyed the gift shop.. Great for kids! My son really enjoyed it here and did not want to leave.. They give you a booklet that educates you about each little stop.. We will definitely be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brown_hippie
50,Great authentic garden,Was in a wedding that took place in the garden. It was amazing! What a great place that really feels like Japan. Please visit and chill out here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuziReckless
50,Water treatment plant and Japanese Oasis,"Drive down Woodley Avenue between Burbank and Victory Blvd. and if you are looking there is a small sign that says Japanese Garden. As it is part of a water reclamation treatment plant you will have to show the police officer at the gate identification. Proceed to a parking lot and then a admissions stop where you will be asked for 2 or 3 dollars depending upon age to visit the garden and take a look at. The water treatment area. We visit the gardens often. On weekends they sell tea and cookies in the tea house. Once inside the gate visitors are surrounded by a gem of a Japanese garden. Water, water lilies, bridges, many birds taking full advantage of the water and surrounding land areas. If you plan well or have good timing you might enjoy a festival of dance. Not as large as the Huntington gardens; however, you will find it less crowded and touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759MikeG759
50,"Beauty, serenity, and a chance to really enjoy your camera!","Although not quite as authentic as the Japanese Gardens in the Huntington Library, the Los Angeles Japanese Garden is quite beautiful and breathtaking. Well worth the palty $3 admission fee ($2 for Seniors). The flowers, shrubs, and wildlife (birds, fish) provide a movie-like backdrop that makes you forget that you are still in the San Fernando Valley. Food is available from food trucks parked at the entrance (yes you can exit and re-enter). There is free parking just outside the gift shop. Enter from Woodley Ave, just south of Victory. The day we were there, they had storytelling and puppet shows for the children, and a koto musical presentation, just to name a few of the activities. The staff, including security guards and groundskeepers, are all very friendly and love to talk or answer questions. There is a tea house (which we skipped, since we had just gotten exotic tea from one of the trucks).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilaFred13
30,Pretty place worth a look,Pretty and peaceful it's a nice way to spend an afternoon though I wish there had been more gardens It cost three dollars to look around and they use reclaimed water. We didn't go check out the plant so I have no insight there. It was very pretty but I have seen better so I probably won't go back but hey Star Trek fans it is Starfleet headquarters so that alone makes it worth a onetime trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darin_and_Christi
50,Beautiful/ peaceful place!,"My husband and I came to the Japanese Garden in May when we were traveling in LA. It's such a beautiful place, with ponds, bamboo grove, flowers, geese and birds. Entrance fee is $5 each person, they have origami lesson, Japanese story telling, flower arrangement exhibit, and japanese fabric doll display, and other event for Mother's day weekend. I am not sure if they do this every day, but when we were there, i sat down at the origami booth and learn how to make a flower with paper squares. Very simple to make yet beautiful! i saw even some little girl learned how to make the flower and put it on her hair! So pretty! we took a lot of pictures in the garden. It's not very big, but it's so peaceful to stroll around the lake and lily pond. We saw a goose family with two big geese and 3 baby geese. we also saw squirrels and a lot of birds, and even some big bird eggs in the bushes!!! what a wonderful place to observe nature and learn about japanese culture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142angelw
40,Neat Place,"We love Japanese Gardens and try to find them in many cities we visit. This one is really nice. We went after a visit to the Getty Center bc it is in the same general direction. There was a water conservation building right next to garden that took away from it somewhat, but it really is a nice garden and worth a visit if you are going to Getty Center. It is a drive from LA if you are not going that way. There is a very small fee, like 3 bucks a person, and really worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525karenj
40,Surprising find,"The Japanese Garden is part of the Balboa Park system from what I can tell, and an off-shoot of the waste-water treatment plant there. As a result, it is less ""polished"" than other Japanese Gardens I've visited (go to the Huntington if you want to be impressed), but the overall experience is very nice. Especially for the low admission price of just $3 per person. The garden is expansive so did not feel crowded even with a relatively large number of visitors the day we went. Reasonably priced drinks and treats in the tea-house, though we did not partake. I'm guessing that other times of the year the gardens are a lot more lush than coming off the winter season as when we visited. Amazed once again that a waste-water treatment plant was responsible for such an interesting attraction - definitely worth a visit or two!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgmDurham
50,Japenese Heritage,"I love coming here on warm sunny days and breathing in the Japanese heritage although it is quit small its a great experience.I love watching the coi fish swim through the cool water as they sparkle,and how gracefully the bird fly and swim.We went there today and we drank tea in the little tea house and watched the plants as we took every sip.I cant wait to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholek513
50,A peaceful place,Is your busy life taking toll on your health and well being? Stop by the Japanese Garden for a dose of quiet beauty. Pick a pleasent June day and come for the lotus blossoms. Enjoy the peaceful winding pathways and delightful bonsai trees all trimmed by hand and shaped to perfection. Pools and bird songs add to the surroundings. Come and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
40,Lovely place for a stroll if the prevailing wind is favorable,"Second only in the Los Angeles area to the Japanese garden at the Huntington Library in San Marino, at least in our experience. Great place for a stroll, usually not crowded. The water is from the water treatment plant and the fragrance is a double entendre because of that. This is definitely a place to see if you enjoy Japanese gardens. if it was a landscaping project for the municipal facility, it was done right. It does not look like an afterthought. Check the hours and holiday schedule. Very affordable.This garden was the setting for the exterior scenes at Star Fleet Academy in the Next Generation series. An image of the Golden Gate bridge was photo shopped (or whatever they did back then) in to make people think it is in San Francisco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Jones2014
50,Great place for weekend,"Japanese Garden is the great place for a weekend trip. The admission fee is very cheap (3$, 24 for seniors). The garden is beautiful and quite.The garden is so green, make you feel like far away city. I especially like the bamboo.The location is pretty nice. If you have time, you also can visit Lake Balboa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aleckw
50,Cultural showcase in Woodley Park,"This idyllic retreat in the heart of the San Fernando Valley is a wonderful place to bring visitors. It is a carefully manicured showcase that pays homage to the rock gardens, lotus ponds, tea houses, bridges, bonsai trees, and koi ponds of Japanese tradition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Dphotographer
50,Something nice in the valley!,"This place is so beautiful. It's so strange how a place that is so green exists in the Valley where it's surrounded by brown mountains everywhere.There is so much greenery, ducks, waterfalls, bridges, and a cafe.Bring your student ID for a discount!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
50,Beautiful and Relaxing,"So unexpected to find such beauty in a reclamation area. 6.5 acres of Japanese gardens, giant trees (cedars I think) ponds, Japanese lanterns and a tea house. Just off the 405 freeway and only $3 admission with free parking. A great rest stop for and hour on the way between San Diego and Santa Barbara,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dragonmoe
50,Lovely little oasis in the SFV,"What a find- a relaxing spot in the Balboa Park complex that you would miss if you didn't know it was there! This Japanese Garden in Van Nuys is very picturesque and relaxing! It is a wonderous use of an area of the water reclamation plant, and it is priced right for an entire family to enjoy! Make sure to check out their website to ensure you visit during their operating hours to give yourself enough time to fully explore the grounds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystica33
50,A real 'Secret Garden' just off the freeway!,"You would never expect to find such a wide expanse of green trees and open areas, let alone a true Japanese garden...just on the other side of the 101 freeway -smack dab in the middle of busy San Fernando valley! I went to see the magnificent lotus in bloom the other day and was transported by the calm. The garden is perfect for easy strolling through dry gardens with big and small rocks and artfully trained bonsai trees, then broad vistas of the water garden replete with real herons perched decoratively on high as they watch for the tasty little fishes. The path is lined with sinuously formed box hedge & tall bamboo swaying gracefully in the breeze & the beautiful lotus and waterlily pond is a lovely stop on your way to the teahouse for contemplative views back across the waters and wildlife. As you leave the gardens, you realize your stress level just went way, way down. Ahhhh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ladida12
50,Quite a wonderful surprise,"My orientation-I like Japanese Gardens in general. But as we entered this one, we were ""blown away"". It's very well manicured. We went on the first of May, and though not a lot was in bloom, the dry garden at the very beginning was just the start of a very impressive set of grounds - the rocks, stones, water, manicured and shaped bushes, the trees, the lanterns, the waterfall and streams, with revealed views as you proceed - all well designed. Be sure to pick up both the folded brochure and the ""black"" map if you're interested in some of the details. Entry was $3 for adults, $2 for seniors - a true bargain. This garden came about apparently because building a water reclamation plant needed a mitigation buffer next to the neighborhood, so without the plant - no garden, and without the garden - no plant, and thus a win-win condition came about. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonWR
50,a relaxing respite,"Someone invited me here one day and I just went, not expecting much. To my tremendous surprise, I had a lovely time. It's quiet and full of trees, very memorable. It's a must see destination for nature lovers. and people fond of Japanese things, I suppose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaidsylvia
40,Beautiful,Worth the visit but keep in mind that it's in the San Fernando Valley and it can get mighty hot in the Summer. Also it's closed on Fridays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
40,A Beautiful garden in a sewage treatment plant,"This sounds like a impossible task....build a beautiful peaceful garden in a sewage treatment plant. Yes, it does have a 'odor'....try for a breeze from the west! Lovely walking paths, migratory and clearly resident birds, fish, bunnies, and flowers. Last weekend it was late for the azaleas and early for the Chery blossoms...but still wonderful. Oddly...closed on Friday and Saturday. Nice exhibit of how the 'stuff' is processed and cleaned. Large lakes are filled with processed water...careful with kids! Cute gift shop, admission $3 for adults, $2 for seniors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniecat1242
50,Cherry Blossom Season is Best,"Very low admission, peaceful beautiful recreation of Japan by a Japanese landscaper and artist, almost feels like you are really in Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnastaciaM7
40,I call her Goldilocks,"Her name is Suiho-en, but I call her Goldilocks because she is Not too Big. Not too Small. She's Just Right.Southern California is blessed with amazing gardens. Huntington Botanical Gardens, Getty Museum, LA Arboretum, Descanso Gardens, and more. Despite all that, I believe overall value, this is in the top 3 of my favorites. Not $15 bucks like other places which to me seems a bit pricey compared to the many, many, many other attractions in So Cal. Entrance fee is nominal, $3 bucks (I think) Hours and days open are limited. Only real downside I found.Spent hours here. Took some great pictures here. Its not as overwhelming as the other gardens. One visit I spent almost 20 minutes watching a bird catch fish jumping from the lake Another visit was during an Origami Festival. Great teachers. Kids were just loving it. I was not the only one. Could go on.It is not big. Not as elaborate. Other gardens will give you a workout. Japanese Gardens is simply pleasant. Worked in the Valley and never knew the Japanese Gardens was here. Had little expectations. When I got here, I just loved her.She's beautiful. I let the picture speak for themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galahad17
10,Never Open,I have tried on several occasions to visit the Japanese gardens but it is always closed! It appears that they are only open during the week which is crazy if you ask me. Don't they want anyone to see their gardens?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveagreatvacation
50,A serene and peaceful oasis,"I read about this garden in a Los Angeles tourist publication that I picked up at our hotel in Van Nuys. Since it was so close, we decided to check it out and are we glad we did! Compact in size (only 6.5 acres), yet encompassing several classic features of Japanese garden design, this is a beautiful spot to spend a couple of hours. Do plan on getting here right when it opens, though, as it's most peaceful early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilMayLee
40,Beautiful spot for pictures! Great price for L.A.,"You really can't go wrong here! Admission is only $3 for adults. That's a pretty good deal in L.A. The gardens are not huge but they are big enough so that you don't feel crowded even on a busy weekend. Remember to bring your camera as the grounds are beautiful. The tea house has tea and cookies for $2 on the weekends...another great deal! There is a lake, a lily pond, a flowing downhill fountain, a tea house, several bird species, and a couple of small bridges that make up the garden. You won't be disappointed for lack of color!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
