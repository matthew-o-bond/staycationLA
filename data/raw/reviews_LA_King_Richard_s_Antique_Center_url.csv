50,Antique Mall Nice and Orderly,"On first sight, the Center appears to be one level but as you move through, there are 4 levels and instead of a 20 minute visit, we were there for almost 2 hours. Everything was organized well, clean and they had a great staff serving throughout the Center. Looking for tourquoise? There are various stalls, but we found the best to be in Aisle 3, Main floor. Will return if we're ever in the area. The parking is minimal but we walked there in about 10 minutes from our hotel in the Whittier Historic District. Well worth the visit if you enjoy antiquing or just like to have a peek looking back in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Ados

40,Cavernous antique barn,"King Richard's is a Whittier institution. It is a large building with multiple levels of stalls full of all sorts of items, from precious to camp. I have lost hours just walking up and down the aisles looking for that perfect addition to my home. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a small free parking lot, but plenty of free street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chumleyjones
50,Full of interesting items,"VERY large!, full of wonderful antiques! Very helpful, easy parking, actually had valet parking but it was a special day with all the activities going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieY206
50,shpooing,"great place, good prices and good place to browse, never know what you can find.the warehouse is very unique",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368mariaa368
40,Fun Browsing,Came here to kill some time and my daughters and I had a fun browsing experience. The place is large and well stocked with a variety of antiques. I ended up finding some French pink glass dinnerware that I had been looking for to complete a set of teacups and saucers I was given. The salespeople are knowledgable and very considerate. They wrapped up my purchase and handled it with utmost care. I will definitely come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711marcyy
30,Nice BIG Antique Mall for a day's outing.,"King Richards is big, big, big. Smaller than than it used to be though you might not notice. They have a nice selection of just about anything. I can always find a thing or two I can't live without!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateS7
50,The largest antique mall in the region,King Richards has been a staple for decades and has a wonderful selection of vendors and one of a kind goodies. They sell unique finds and private collections at moderate and reasonable prices . In the time of eBay and online sales this is a great option and highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeButcher
30,Vast Territory to Look & Find Antiques Amidst Quite a Bit of Junk,"For ""the largest in California"" antique and vintage mall this is ""OK"" but not really worth a long drive. MANY parts of the store smell bad, a lot of the vendors seem to have just given up and leave their crap piled up in their unit collecting dust and dirt. For a place with 57,000 square feet of vendors, they have VERY LITTLE parking. The mere fact there is a great restaurant next-door/included in the space means there is NOWHERE to park. Having been to MANY large antique malls all over the country, this is sadly at the BOTTOM of our list. OK, not great. NOT worth another trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeNMiSelf
50,Fun place,My wife and I have been here quite a few times. It's great just exploring around at your leisure without anyone breathing down your back like a desperate car salesman.So much to see and choose.Directly next door is probably the best Hot Wheels store I've ever seen.Freddy G Gonzalez,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freddyg902
30,Multitude of Vendors,"If you are willing to search through the expansive floors of booths, you can find some great items, and treasures. For the most part, you are on your own exploring all the displays. The sales staff is friendly and helpful when you locate something you are interested in buying. We have been able to bargain on the prices of some things we liked. It is worth checking this place out if you enjoy vintage, antique and curious wares.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indeedandintruth
50,Great storr,Lots of vendors and floors to shop. Very large building with a friendly staff. Easy parking. Nice place to spend a few hours of your day .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky677

40,Checking for cool stuff,King Richards has 3 levels plus a smaller sub level full of great items and many bargains.You'll probably find more than what you are looking for when you browse the many aisles of great collectibles and antiques.Many of the spaces have additional discounts on the entire space or ask the assistance to forward an offer to the seller.Great place to spend time and revisit days gone by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salc786
50,It's an Amzing place!,"If you like antiques or history this is a must see place. You can find so many cool, one of a kind, hard to find things to buy. It's my favorite place to browse and reminisce!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,Exciting items for sale,A nice place to shop and browse for at least an hour. A large warehouse swap meet full of items and collectibles for sale. After you shop stop by Reys kitchen in the back parking lot for a bite to eat. Cheap eats and a favorite place of mine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165Oldtimer
50,This is the place for the antique buff.,There's always something here for the antique collector of every kind and price range. A virtual museum of stuff to buy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig92017

40,Immense and Diverse,"Came here to do a photo shoot, so my perspective may be a little different. Spent about an hour prior to the shoot walking around to scope out sites and I have to say this place is incredible in terms of size and diversity. Did not explore the very bottom level but gave everything else a good look. Have been to places like this before but never found one this organized. Also appreciated that everything had a clear price tag, though did have to move a few when taking photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremiahg698
50,king richards antique shop,This is a good place to find anything and everything old new and inbetween seen some things I haven't seen in many many years it brought back a lot of memories to say the least you have got to check this place out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trkrman562
40,LOTS AND LOTS OF OLDER GOODIES,"Located less than two miles southeast of I-605 on Whittier Blvd, King Richard’s Antique Center is a hodge-podge of antiques, collectibles, and near-collectables displayed in small, unattended cuticles. The center presents an interesting assortment of “old time goodies”, but the problem is you have to spend at least an hour to get the general idea of what is there. Or you can just cruise the aisles to see what might beckon to you. There was a time in my life when I was interested in “collectibles”, and I enjoyed discussing the items and bargaining for a better price. All of that social interaction is completely missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertdA8325JD
50,Unexpected and fun,This place is huge and very nicely organized. You are surely able to find anything or a unique gift here. It was amazing to see so much stuff and prices seem very reasonable. Helpful and friendly staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,Great finds,"Great place to find unique one-of-a-kind gifts. I purchased several pieces of artwork for my home from here. They have a great variety of collectibles also. I purchased a desk a few years back. Highly recommend stoping by, but it is huge so prepare to spend a good amount of time. It usually takes about an hour to browse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshinacrockett
50,King Richard's Where You Can Get Almost Anything!,"This is a great place, like an indoor-swap meet, but so much more to see. Very few, if any, new items for sale. There are booths full of antiques, collectibles, furniture, jewelry, vintage clothing and accessories, and the list goes on. The prices, for the most part, are quite reasonable. They are less expensive than antique or vintage stores, because you are buying right from the owner/seller of the goods. Come by and take a look for something specific, or just stroll around and see all the goodies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCabrera
50,Fun Place to Find a Treasure,"I travel quite a bit on business and when I get some down time I enjoy visiting antique stores.

40,Blast from the Past,"King Richards is trip to the past. It has 2 floors of stuff to get lost in so plan on al least 2 hours to see everything. It has creaky floors and an old feel to the building, perfect for what it has to offer. The downstairs has furniture and other stuff. You can browse through your childhood & years gone past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wongway89
50,"If you like antiqueing, this is the place!!","You can get lost for hours at this awesome place, and try the restaurant next door for a quick snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPasillas82
30,OK Antique Center,It's kind of a run-of-the-mill antique Place. Some stuff was certainly better than other stuff but the prices were fine and the place was fairly organized.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811bernardf
40,Time travel....kind of,I stop in here every once in awhile when I have a some time to kill. I like to get lost in all the little corners with the odds and ends. Finding treasures here is a hit and miss but I'm never disappointed. If your hungry afterwards make sure to stop by Rey's. It's in the same parking lot and it's delicious!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringWonderland
30,It used to be good What happened?,"This is a nice cozy antique store. Sometimes its a little cluttered. I found various items there that I had when I was growing up. Some items are a little expensive, but if that is what your looking for its not way over the top. You can spend the day looking through all the collectibles. It's fun and nice to reminisce with someone. Nice afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/havingfun2016
50,Something new and exciting EVERY TIME!,"If you like it, you should grab it during that visit because it might not be there during your next trip. However during your next trip you might find something even better. We bought a set of Bullwinkle glasses for my brother-in-law who loves Bullwinkle and has everything; it was the perfect surprise Christmas gift. Recently we bought a neat old crate for an end table. It is a lot of fun to walk through. Buying is also easy and there is always someone around to help you. It is a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969JackieT
50,King Richard's Antigues,"I have bought several items from King Richards, found the pricing to be very good. Several pieces of furniture are in excellent shape. Many old items can be found for the collector and just walking through can bring back many memories of times gone by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesR884
30,Just okay,"I thought I'd check this place out since I was told it's the biggest in California. I doubt that's true, I've seen at least 3 bigger. They have some nice stuff but even if you found something that you couldn't live without, you will pay dearly. I thought the whole idea was to sell the stuff not price it so high that nobody wants to pay what they are asking. I think the antique stores in the Orange Circle in the city of Orange are much nicer and the prices are much more reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9335GRmariar
50,Better than any antique store in NYC,"We always come to King Richards when we are looking for treasure. We have relatives in NYC and they always want to come here when they visit us. They say it is better than anywhere in New York! Everyone who works there have always been very friendly and helpful. And, it is VERY clean. Some shops like this are covered in layers of dust which triggers my athsma, but King Richards is always spotlessly clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/338WendyD
40,nice place to search for antiques,"great antique center , very clean , lots to see , well kept, helpful staff, easy parking. heard about this antique center and drove from the valley to check it out. it was worth the drive. spent a few hours looking around, and even bought several things. nothing really blew me away here , but it is a nice antique center to spend a few hours checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/437MikeS437

40,Unique Collector's Items,"I like to go visit because it is like a trip down memory lane. The story is divided into 3 levels and one can spend hours looking at all the neat stuff they have for sale. They take credit cards and everyone is very friendly.The main level is wheelchair accessible, but I'm not sure about the other two levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHernandez
10,Bad experience,"I was planning on purchasing some gifts. Went to pick up an item to buy and a plate that was propped up and not secured slid down taking a shot glass with it. I was told store policy was to pay for the shot glass. NOT MY FAULT. Stopped looking, didn't purchase anything. Will be telling all my friends what happened and I will never purchase anything there again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glassteacher
30,"Great if you're looking for ""not-so-special"" items","Travelled 30 minutes from Beverly Hills to visit this Antique Center. It had quite a bit of square footage and a lot of items, but nothing that I considered ""special"" or ""worth"" traveling for. Still fun to visit and view all of the items. Not many high-end antiques.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apicozzi
40,A lot to offer,This was a pretty nice antique mall with many individual vendors. Lots to look at and some good prices. The parking lot is pretty small so you might have to park elsewhere and hike back. There were three levels plus a basement. We didn't spend too much time in the basement area due to a very foul smell down there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanhL187VR
50,Fantastic and huge place full of antiques and memorabilia,"This is 3 floors of everything from old American Neon signs and garage stuff, toys, clothes, furniture, cutlery... hey just about everything on 3 floors in a huge environment. If you like these places allow yourself 3 hours.To give you an idea I bought an unused and still boxed 1980's Tonka toy, a lit beer sign, 2 clear 1980's telephones for the wall, an old LP and ten pin bowling pin.Chuck, the owner, is a lovely guy and Eddie and Antonio deserve a shout out too for being super helpful.Next door is a thrift store where I got a load more LP's and some vintage T-shirts.Great stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dysonsphere
40,One of my favorite Antique Malls near north Orange County,"King Richards is very large, kept clean with over all good prices; while I have not found any bargains there I have bought things there for a good if not fantastic price. There is a wide range here, furniture, jewelry, clothing and housewares, toys and weird old stuff from past ears. There was a wonderful Disneyland tour cart that would have made a great poolside bar, but it had been sold. There is a small Betty Page store as well with a selection of current styles, so even if they don't have your size you can take a look before you order. Items are clean and mended, the 'antique store smell' is at a minimum save in the very small basement. Give the restaurant a miss or look it over closely, last time I was there is was a very nice family running it, they had just moved up from Mexico, but their style of cooking did not match my preference for the yummy foods from south of the border.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiacZ4570GI
