50,Unemployed artest given a chance. If you want to help feed the world you need places like this!,"If you appreciate simple art it is a fun drive by to see some history.I think it's a really nice story.""An unemployed Warner Bros. set designer named Les Grimes asks Farmer John if there might be any work for him. The Clougherty's ask Les to paint the exterior wall of the facility. Instead of painting it a nice, simple shade of blue, he begins painting an elaborate mural of pigs on a farm. At first, the Clougherty's are dubious, but publicappreciation of the work convinces Farmer John to embrace the mural, whichbecomes the famous artwork that remains at their original facility to this day.""If you want to look at big picture maybe we should remove all human life off the earth because we destroy hundreds of animals and insects when we plow over them and grow corn, rice and vegetables. We also kill all kinds of animals so that we may have clothes and shoes and food to eat.I guess I'm an old farm boy at heart and understand hard work and giving a man a chance to earn a living. Also with so many people in the world we need places like this that are able to feed thousands of people. We have so many people go hungry and bigger problems to solve than people being upset because of a farm painted on the wall.Basically it's a quick free to drive by or walk on the side walk. My little five year old girl liked to see the paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TM-Moser
30,A Disguise To What Goes On In The Inside,"At the end of the day, this might look like a nice mural and it gives a false sense of serenity when you have to think about what is going on in the inside. Not worth a special trip or anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
10,False Advertisment,"This mural is a disgrace. Pigs live horrifying lives and these murals make it seem like they live happy go lucky lives! Plus, ham or bacon isn't healthy for you at all.

40,Classic Americana Piggy ...,"Those piggy murals really do upgrade the meat processing facility of Farmer John's in Vernon / LA as you drive by. The scenic portrayals of pig farmers, pigs and life on the farm takes a full time team to keep up. Nice art in working area LA. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
10,Terrible!,"These murals make it appear that everything that goes on here is done in a kind and loving way. If you've ever seen, read or done any research into slaughter houses you'd know how horribly inhumane and cruel they are. Trucks with screaming, terrified pigs jammed in to small crates arrive every few minutes. These animals suffer terrible, horrible pain and agonizing deaths. Instead of looking at all the pretty murals, take a look at into what goes on behind these murals. Take a look at the real pictures of the fear in these animals eyes and the way the pigs are brutally slaughtered! Maybe this is what these murals should reflect. That would be a lot more honest that what these mural portray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beverlym63
40,pig mural,"well ,it`s better than gang murals .but behind the scenes ,We all know what goes on here.Just like all Slaughter houses. But we eat those products everyday,not realizing how tortured the Animals are. Or not caring ,as long as there is Food on our plate. Most Animals are raised for this reason,wool ,eggs ,milk, hides,cheese, Vegans are not amused. How many products come from Animals? I only named a few.Admire the Painting,and Artists of this Mural ,on a otherwise bland streetscape,not knowing how long it took to paint this,but there is more on YouTube.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoney5226

50,Farmer John Famous Pig Mural,"This is a hidden gem in the Greater Los Angeles area. I grew up in Los Angeles and remember my mother driving by this mural on her way to the Sears Tower. The Folky, humorous art always made me smile.For tourists headed from Los Angeles to Orange County to go to Knotts Berry Farm or Disneyland, this is a five minute excursion off the freeway while on your way. It is easy to find. Simply exit the 101/5 freeway from south at Soto Street. Turn Right and head past the Sears Tower approximately 3 miles. It is in Vernon on the left hand side.The mural basically depicts farm landscapes where you can see fields, trees, corn, barns, etc and of course, lots of pigs, big and small. Some of the pigs are happy and carefree, either laying in the grass, playing in the mud or with each other, flying airplanes, sleeping in hammocks and interacting with everyone from a buxom hill billy gal to keeping a boy company while he's fishing to pulling a wagon for a Gladiator wanna-be.Other pigs are trotting happily following a road and ""Farmer John"" signs to what they think is probably OZ, but is actually a smokehouse or a greased pig contest. A variety of other animals also grace this mural like dogs, chicks, quails, hawks, crows and probably even more that I may have missed this time around.If you'd like to know the history of this mural, it basically goes like this. In 1957, Barney Clougherty, then owner of Farmer John, was approached by Les Grimes, a talented painter of scenic backgrounds for Hollywood movie sets, to decorate the outside of his building. With Barney's blessing, Grimes spent the next eleven years working on his ""masterpiece."" Unfortunately, Grimes died in a fall from a fifty- foot scaffolding he was using to paint a portion of the sky on the mural.After Grimes' death, Clougherty hired Arno Jordan to finish the murals. Arno Jordan continued the legacy by painting new murals and restoring Grimes' originals. To noted art dealer Ivan C. Karp, the murals are ""a fundamental tract for West Coast vernacular painting."" What's great about this mural is that it includes several gatefold plates of entire walls. Now that's some great detail. The plant was purchased by Hormel who intends to maintain the murals.In 1964 Farmer John shifted to sponsorship of radio broadcasts of Dodger baseball games. This led to stadium sales of Farmer John's famous ""Dodger Dogs."" However, the extra-long wieners did not become the Dodgers' official hot dog until around 1990. Dodger Stadium sold about two million of the ""eastern grown, western flavored"" wieners a year. In 1999, the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council ranked Dodger fans as baseball's top consumers of hot dogs. Famed sportscaster Vin Scully pitched Dodger Dogs to great effect in his broadcasts. Clougherty also supplied other area sports venues, including the Rose Bowl Coliseum. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THE PIG DRESSED LIKE A DODGER ON THE MURAL.3049 E.
