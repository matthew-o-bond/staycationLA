30,1iota.com is sold out too often,"I think.it's great to get free tickets to talk shows, movie premieres and more in N.Y.C. It's always great when you can get a ticket. But I don't think they are giving them on a first come first serve basis. They are picking and choosing who to give the tickets to. And how would you get a promo code for a free ticket? Why would you need one? I saw Kelly and Ryan and the View a few weeks ago. Since then, I never get an email with new shows anymore. I also keep getting notices, after 4 to 7 days or more of waiting, where my ticket is pending, that the event is sold out. That's why I think they pick and choose who they will grant a ticket to. If something was close to being sold out when you requested the ticket, it shouldn't take so long to be refused. I think that the people running 1iota have a hidden criteria for these tickets, and if you have recently been to any one or two of their shows, they are not going to give you another ticket any time in the near future. If you go with friends and all have an account and a different person puts in for each event, that group will get to see a lot more shows. But if you go solo most of the time like I do, you better be prepared to have an empty slot on your calendar for the day in question most of the time. I couldn't even get one seat for the Aquaman screening. It wasn't on the website for long before I requested a ticket, luckily, since I don't get noticed anymore about new events, my friend saw it and told me. But as I said, if you do get a ticket, the shows and events are absolutely awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fooey99i9999i
50,Amazing!,"Short and simple. When in Queenstown, check this place out. It gets very busy from midday so get there early and watch all the action. When we arrived there was no queue, by the time we left people were queuing out the door. The Burgers are great quality and well worth the money. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmo1977
40,"Great experience, at The Late Late Show with James Corden","Went with my two young adult children to see the Late Late Show with James Cordon. We all enjoyed the experience, the warm-up guy (sorry can't remember his name). really stresses enthusiasm, but once the taping starts its not a big deal, you just have to do a lot of clapping. It was a fun experience and we would do it again just be prepared for it to take about four hours of your time from beginning to end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmercase
50,Great experience in L.A.!,"This was one of our first stops when we got to L.A. We stopped by and ate at The Farmer's Market, shopped at The Grove for a bit, then headed over to get in line for the show. It was easy for us to get tickets. You have to wait in a couple of different lines for a bit, but all the staff are nice and efficient. They've got the process down to an art and let you know what will happen before you go to the next line. They do confiscate your cell phone before you enter the studio, but rest assured you will get it back once the taping is over. We also got to see some Price is Right props while working out way towards Craig's studio (which added another little bit of fun to the experience)!Craig was hilarious, personable, foul mouthed, and went off script-and we loved every minute of it. The whole process took about 3 - 3.5 hours. He goes off air this Friday, but so excited we got to be a part of this experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegretchmyster
50,"It was worth the trip from Northern California to see Craig, Goeff, Secretariat and Michael.",I love Craig Ferguson since I first saw his show. My daughter and I have watched him since she was 10 years old. She is 20 now and we are still watching. She couldn't go to the show with me because she had to work but is very excited to watch the two episodes I was at. We will both miss you Craig and crew. Best wishes to all of you now and in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C371JNkarenb
40,worth the wait.,"As someone from the UK i've always admired how Craig found success in America and eventually became the successor to The Late Late Show and i knew that if i ever made it to LA this show would definitely be something i had to come and see. This summer i booked a trip and got tickets for the September 1st show and i couldn't be more excited. I've been to numerous tapings of The Tonight Show and Late Night with both Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon but Craig's style of hosting is something that can't be easily replicated by anyone else. As other reviewers have said, the wait is long and isn't the most pleasant in the heat but chatting to other people in the line who were from Europe made it more enjoyable and the 1iota staff were lovely and handed out umbrellas for the duration of the wait. Once you're all checked in and security checked you'll be directed to benches in the shade where there is a little shop where you can have a bathroom break and buy some merchandise so you can get a snake mug! After this the taping flies by and you'll be out before you know it so enjoy it! The audience warm up guy was hilarious and greeted everyone as we went in to be seated. One of the best parts of the taping was the audiences inside joke with Craig that he made references to throughout the show. I'm just so glad i got to see the show before Craig sadly leaves next month, i'll miss him hosting greatly. if you get the chance to visit before it ends, do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502rebeccaw
50,So much fun,I am so glad I took the time to do this while I was in LA. Yes there is a bit of time spent waiting before the show but it was well worth the wait. Craig Ferguson is hilarious and it was good to be able to see him live before he finishes up this year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kell_79
50,A fantastic time! Very glad I got to see the show live!,"My son and I have been Craig Ferguson fans for quite awhile now, so while we were in LA, I thought I'd take him to a taping of The Late, Late Show for his birthday.What everyone else says on here is true. You wait on the sidewalk for a long time in the hot sun. The 1iota folks will pass out umbrellas to make the wait more bearable, but bring some water. That being said, it wasn't a miserable wait.We went to the Farmer's Market behind CBS around 12:30 and had a nice leisurely lunch. Our ""line-up"" time was 2:30, but the instructions said to be in line by 2pm. We wandered around for a bit, and finally decided to head on over a bit earlier than 2pm. I'm glad we did; there was already a line of around 50 or so people.You are shuffled around from spot to spot, but I thought the process actually went pretty smoothly. And it's well worth it when you get into the studio and get to see the show! They were taping two shows (and Craig made a few jokes about it during the taping,) which was very cool.Craig was hilarious and very interactive with the audience both while the cameras were rolling and off. And the rest of the crew was great, friendly, and very professional.All in all, I'm very glad we got to see the show live, especially since Craig is leaving in December. And my son said he had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdM732
50,"Huge fan, great show",Always wanted to be a part of a studio audience and thrilled that my first time was for Craig's show. Been a fan for years and it was a delight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/437sandym
50,There is a wait - but get there early!,"We have been watching the show on and off and planned our trip around attending a taping. Due to transport issues we arrived 5min after the specified arrival time on our ticket. After waiting for more than an hour we were told because we were late we weren't going to get in. They made it seem like it was all our fault for not getting in but the tickets do state they over subscribe because some people don't turn up. So if everyone who gets priority tickets turns up 30-45min beforehand not everyone will get in. Anyway, they said we could come back the next day and they would let us in because we were turned away the day before. So we did, and got in. I was called up on stage during the warmup (must have been the Aussie accent) and won a free t-shirt. It was fun to watch how the show is taped - it is actually taped out of order - and it was fun to see some real life celebrities! I agree with a lot of the tips on here - bring water, wear something sensible, prepare for the wait - you may meet some interesting people in line - and get there early! It is pretty good value considering it is free! The show ends in December so if you want to go, get in soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacO2999SE
50,If you're a fan - Brilliant,"I was in L.A. about a week and a half (5 days when I landed and 4 at the end of my trip before I departed) and by a matter of bad timing on my part they were only shooting on one of the days I was there.However the one show was enough, the whole experience was amazing (baring the standing out in the sun for an hour, although they did bring out umbrellas) walking up the stairs and seeing the set was a bit of a surreal experience for me.Great show and really interesting to see a show being shot. A must if you are visiting L.A.Catch him before December.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alang431
50,Great experience - but be aware,"If you like Craig Ferguson this is worth it, especially as the show ends this year, but be aware of a few things.1) This is not ticketmaster - the tickets are free, but you need to be aware of how the system works. 1iota.com is where you go to set up an account and can request tickets for different dates. Almost always you will then be informed you are on a waitlist and are in limbo. 1iota does have a good system in which they will email you to ask you to go in to select your tickets and take them from waitlist to ""priority tickets"". Be aware this is a fluid situation - we were not planning on going to a second showing until the day of we received a notification that there were spots available. Pretty much try to get tickets first and then build your trip around that2) Priority...you keep using that word: So, ""Priority Tickets"" - like others I thought I had scored, initially, a great slot or quick line with the priority tickets, but that isn't really the case. As far as I can gather - since I got ""General Tickets"" for the last day - priority tickets give you the heads up that you should arrive early to get in line. Don't expect to show up at the last minute and sashay up to the front of the line, but enjoy that your tickets mean that they'd try to get you in ahead of those with general admission tickets.3) Read your ticket: Complaints generally seem to miss that the tickets told you everything you need to know. When you get your ""ticket"" from 1iota you need to print it out and they'll scan it at the door. The instructions list that you can't bring your phone, that you should leave any large bags behind, that the studio will be COLD, and dress-code. You can't really say on any of those scores that they haven't told you what you need to know (they even give advice on parking at the Grove nearby). If you get tickets, read them closely.4) Process: So after all of that all I can recommend is get there early. We decided to get in line around 2:15 the day of the showing (check in is at 3:30). We were already behind at least 15-20 people when we arrived. It is hot, it is a bit annoying, but the tickets are free and the annoyance is worth the trip. Worst comes to worst there are a few food places across the street and so you can grab food/drink if needbe. The 1iota people do as good a job as can be expected, and one time it was hot they came out and handed out umbrellas for people to use to prevent the heat.Biggest advice for line-up? Come early, bring a drink, sun-screen up ahead of time, bring friends if/when you need to trade off standing in line.5) You're in: As others have noted once you are finally through the gates you then will go through security. Honestly, this wouldn't take as long as it would if people would just read the directions. So many people had larger bags or needed to take time to fill out a short card as they had to turn-in to security their cell phones. You are then put in rows to sit for a bit as everyone goes through security. There is a gift shop to buy wares at. Real key - if you are worried about the bathroom this area is the LAST point at which you can use it. So, use it if needed. As you near about 4pm one of the 1iota staff will give you the heads up as to what it will mean to be a member of the audience - an interesting way of seeing the ""sausage get made"". Audiences are, ultimately, props to help the show succeed - you get some advice on laughing and what not - but a neat experience nonetheless.6) The show: You then get taken upstairs and are slotted in to seats in the audience. I have no idea what dictates how they do this and there doesn't appear to be any rhyme nor reason for where you end up. The studio is COLD (they aren't kidding on the ticket about dressing warmly) so be aware. You'll have the warm-up comedian help you understand your role on the show and prep you to make the show work. Before you know it the show starts and just sit back (well, not really, you need to be laughing and applauding!) and enjoy.The show will be over before you know it so soak in the whole experience. There is craziness to the process but the 1iota group does a good job. It's a great show, so see it before it goes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobC614
40,Funny,Good time once we got inside the CBS lot. Loved being at the show. Negative things were: 1) Long wait outside fence on busy street & sidewalk 2) Visitors need to read what they can bring inside studio - lady in front of me brought a very large handbag & security had to check her phones & cameras. C'mon people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OutOnTheRange
30,"Watch the Show , Not the Taping !","I've been a big fan of Craig's since I stumbled on the show late one night several years ago and actually planned our stop in LA to coincide with a taping ! Yeah , sad I hear you say ? Well actually it was disappointing on several levels. Firstly, the firm who are contracted by CBS to supply an audience (Iota) appear at first glance to be very professional but it all falls down to the staff on the day. It's easy to continually send e-mails but when it's raining & you are queued up outside on the street & have been promised umbrellas to not see them arrive till later ?Then after standing outside for several hours , delay, delay , OK let's go in ! Another wait for an hour, seated this time on steel seats, still in a wind tunnel while security takes everything bar your dentures ? Then finally inside the studio , to again stand around in lines for over 1/2 hour till inside. Take seats , front row , Great Right ? No , behind main Camera & got to watch monologue via TV , do that at home !! Show was very funny , Craig didn't react too much with the crowd during breaks which was disappointing but worst part was the Iota staff had informed us it was to be a double taping , hey worth all the waiting around , Right? No, end of taping , all up & bums rush out of the building !! I still watch the show but won't rush to see another taping! One other point is we had 'Priority Tickets' from Iota which equaled diddly squat in the long run. Also it's the 'Late, Late Show...........' and I can see why now !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57
30,disappointing,Weren't able to take cell phones or any sort of cameras into the studio. Craig didnt really pay any attention to the crowd and was serious in between takes. Plan to spend more time waiting than actually watching the taping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lozzy489
50,FREE AND FANTASTIC!!!!,"It was great to see a live taping of such a fun show!!! We had never done anything like this before, but if we visit LA again, it'll be one of the first activities on our ""to do"" list!!!Seeing the ""behind the scenes"" product of the show was very interesting....and they gave us free chocolate:0)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VCH_13
50,So good I went twice!!,I am a big fan of the show.....so it was a no-brainer that I would try to get tickets if I ever got to L.A. I had to wait until a few weeks prior to my trip to get confirmation that there would be a taping on the days I was in L.A......fortunately I got to go twice! The tickets were organised through a third party....and they were very easy to obtain.The first time I sat front row behind Michael the producer and was even part of the monologue! It was an amazing experience and would highly recommend it to anyone!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mafman74
50,Superfun,This was one of our best experiences in LA. You have to wait a while but there's enough to see and people of the show walk around to talk to everyone and provide umbrella's to protect from the sun. We had great seats in the front and got to see Queen Latifah! During the break there's a lot of entertainment and the show is hilarious. Parking was easy at the Grove.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TineM226
40,On the whole it was a great experience,"In a sense you are really just 'audience bate' for the show producers, bate to make Craig look good, the guests to feel welcome and for the taping to look good. Sure, you will have a good time and a laugh while doing it and best of all it doesn't cost you anything so well worth the experience.I parked in the grove mall lot right next door at it cost $6 so wasn't too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walshyfamily
50,Great time,"We were in Vegas and decided to make the drive just to see the Late Late show. We were not disappointed. As fans, we enjoyed seeing a show made that we watch nightly. It's about a 3 hour process and it goes quickly. I highly recommend any fan to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cubswin1234
50,A Great Time!,"We had a great time at the taping of the Craig Ferguson show. When we ordered our tickets from 1iota, there was no special guest scheduled to appear on the show. We were happily surprised to learn that Robin Williams was to be the guest (we didn't find this out until we were standing in line to get in). The wait outside of the studio was quite long, but the 1iota crew was there to pass out umbrellas to help block out the sun. We then had to go through security, after which we were seated on benches outside of the studio. After everyone was seated, we were told that we were going to have to wait another 45 minutes and that food and snacks were available for purchase. The cost was a bit high (like movie theater prices) and the wait wasn't actually 45 minutes, so I felt like we were a bit misled.Anyway, after the food buying was over, we were given a speech my the guy who manages the audience. He was actually funny and it helped to set a good tone for the show. We were then led up four flights of stairs to the studio. After being placed in seats, the warm-up comedian talked to us some more about the show. Shortly after, the show began. The show itself went by so quickly, and Craig was very friendly toward the audience, even between the taping. It was also fun to watch the show afterwards and to see ourselves on TV several times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
50,Love Craig Ferguson!,"It was one of the outstanding traits about Los Angeles that you can come and be a part of Hollywood when visiting, and in my opinion, Craig is the funniest man on TV today, so it was worthwhile. Went there summer of '12 (they don't go back further than Nov of 12 for the review date and that's why I have it down as such).You get to see how a show works too. Fun thing to be a part of. Only real complaint: If you regularly watch the show, Craig often says something to the effect of ""the warm of comedian-we call him a comedian, he's not really a comedian..."" Craig is correct on that. I've seen several other shows and they all had really good warm up comedians. This warm up comedian really is not all that funny. Told fart jokes if I remember correctly. Some people laughed, but I didn't think much. But hey, it's free, and it is more than worth it to see Craig!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeW45
50,A Real Treat,"Coming from Scotland, and not having seen Craig live for more than twenty years, we were very much looking forward to experiencing the show recording. There is a bit of waiting around before entering the studio. Then the new warm up guy does his bit and it's on with the show. Great fun and really funny. Easy to get tickets on 1iota. Book up if you're in the area. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bufty100
50,One Of THE Best FREE Deals In So Cal,"When you visit Hollywood you have amble opportunity to see many different ""LIVE"" TV shows here and there. I grew up in the Valley and used to even see Johnny Carson when he ventured out to Hollywood several times a year back in the early, early 60's. Also went to countess game shows and even some select tapings at CBS Television City. I was fortunate to live next door to a top CBS cameraman back then and he got me into some really special shows. I had not stepped on to the CBS lot for decades. Now I'm retired and I found tickets for Craig Ferguson on IOTA. That web company supplies a direct source for you to order tickets to many events. It could not have been easier. Picked the date and bam! I got an email and the tickets to print and then we were on our way. We got there a tad early and we were able to sit on a bench until they herded us into the chilly studio. Take a coat or sweater. Both of us are handicapped and they could not have been nicer in allowing us to take it easy during the wait outside...If you have a handicapped plate you can even park in the CBS lot. You even have time to hit the mini gift shop. We picked up the Late Late Show T. The warm up to the show was fun and then Craig Ferguson breezed through the next hour and half and it was all over way to quickly...BUT it was fun and more than worthwhile...Everyone was really nice and helpful. No flakes on this show. Plus the audience is really intimate. Only 140 are in the seats. Come to Hollywood and don't forget to catch the ""Late, Late Show""...good times for all (including Geoff the robot and Secretariat the horse)...and YOU!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artieb701
40,Live Audience,"RESERVING TICKETS:I reserved my tickets for FREE through 1iota.com about 2-3 months in advance. You are only allowed 2 tickets, and we had 4 people in our group, so another person had to sign up and request tickets as well. Do not use the same computer to create an account, as they will think you are the same person trying to get more tickets.PRIORITY TICKETS & CHECK-IN TIMEWe were given priority tickets for reserving them so far in advance. Our check-in time was 3pm and then about 3 days before the show was changed to 1:30pm. We arrived at CBS studios at the FAIRFAX (not beverly) entrance at 1pm. They informed us that only handicapped could park in the lot, and that we would need to park at the The Grove. We dropped 2 people off to get in line, there were already about 20-25 people lined up along the street. So we lost our priority ticket status, you probably have to get there about an hour before check in time to keep priority. However, even though there were many in front of us, we were still seated in the middle section of the studio in the 2nd row.PARKING:The directions he gave us to get to the Grove were incorrect. You will need to take a LEFT from the Fairfax Studio entrance, and The Grove parking garage will be on your LEFT. There are digital signs on each level that indicate exactly how many parking spaces are available at any time, however, it's a pain to roam the level trying to find which of the spots are open, I suggest just driving up a few levels as there is more spaces open the higher you go. There are elevators and escalators to take you up & down if you don't want to walk it. The first hour of parking is free, and $4 for the 2nd hour / $5 for 3rd hour /$1 each 15 minutes thereafter. There is a $24 daily max at 7th hour (420 min). We were there about 3 hours so we spent $9 (not bad). Certain stores in The Grove will validate parking though, so if you plan to do some shopping don't forget to ask an employee. When we came down from the parking garage we were thrust into the Grove & we were turned around and had to ask for directions on where Fairfax was. It was only about a 10 minute walk away. We felt very rushed though, so my suggestion would be to get there an hour early.THE WAITING:We only waited in the lined about 5 minutes before they starting checking people in, but it was hot and the sun was beating down. They did offer umbrellas to shield yourself from the sun. We had to present our tickets and then they walked us to a pavilion where purses were searched, and phones were taken and tagged for you to pick up after the show. We sat for 20 minutes or so while everyone was getting checked in. There were bathrooms (you will not be able to go once you leave the queue area, so go now) and the CBS gift shop that had a few souvenir type things to purchase. A funny guy named Ryan gave us the run down of the rules, and then the ""comedian"" Chunky B tried to rile us up. He is probably in his late 50's with a gruff voice, and lame dad jokes. He can be crude sometimes and he expects you to laugh. If you don't laugh, he'll tell you that you need to for the show, and even if you don't find something you still need to laugh, so we practiced laughing for a good 10 minutes. We were then escorted upstairs and had to wait on 1 of 3 red lines. Once everyone filed in we were taken into the studio where loud music was playing. Chunky B was waiting for us with candy. He did a little bit more of teaching us to laugh, and then they showed us a video montage of the Late Late Show. ---If you can not do stairs, one of the employees will escort you up the elevator.THE TAPING:Craig stands directly in front of the camera a lot of the time, so you don't really get to see his face. There are 3 huge TV screens hanging above the audience that you can see from. The actual taping is done out of order and edited together later. We went to the Thursday taping, so we saw both the Thurs and Fri show. We saw Anthony Edwards and Josh Wolf, and a local comedian. No interaction was allowed with Craig or the guests on the show. Craig did throw candy into the audience at the beginning of the show. No real crude jokes, but he does use foul language. During the ""commercial breaks"" Ryan and Chunky B would clap and get us enthused again, and kept reminding us no whistling as the monitors kept picking it up.AFTERWARD:We were filed down and people took our bracelet off, and we followed the flow of traffic down the stairs. There was a line on the main level to pick up your phone again. If you are in a hurry afterward, you may just want to leave your phone in the car as it takes a bit if there are a bunch of people in front of you.OVERALL:It was a cool experience to see how things are actually done, and if you are a Craig fan or one of the guests is someone you really like, it is worth going. Plan on about 3.5 - 4 hours for the total experience, get there early to avoid being rushed, don't even try to park at the Studio, just go straight to The Grove. Don't have a specific timed activity that you are planning on doing after the show, as you may get out at a different time, and traffic can be backed up. We were out by 4:25ish, had tickets to an event in Arcadia at 6 pm and didn't get there until 7:15 pm. .Also expect your face to hurt from all of the fake laughing. There were a few things that did make me genuinely laugh, but for the most part you are told to laugh at everything that is said, even if you don't think it's funny or don't understand what is going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeksTravel
50,Very cool - and FREE!,"Reserve your tickets for free online. You can choose the date you want to attend about 1-2 months in advance. The actual taping process is kind of long, so set aside about three hours. We got there early, so we were seated in the front row. This is a very cool way to spend your afternoon if you're a Craig fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BizzyCee
50,Late Late show taping.,"We went to the Thursday taping, what is nice about this is that they tape both Thursday and Friday's back to back so you get to sit in for two instead of one.The studio is very cold! Bring a jacket or wear a nice sweater.The warm up comedian Chunky, was pretty funny. If you are easily offended, do something else.Parking tip - there is very little parking on the site, you will need to park at ""The Grove"". Be sure to map quest this prior to coming to the studio. Also, parking is very expensive, so if you are budget conscious, plan on about $25 to park.Which reminds me, parking at ""The Grove"" is an experience in itself. There is a red carpet leading you out to the street, and the garage has its own concierge service. It is pretty cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieJay
50,Must-do for all Craig fans,"It's actually The Late Late Show... take note TA. :)I went to a taping of Craig Ferguson this last week and had a blast. It's definitely something every Craig fan should do at least once.The process was kind of long. Get there early if you want a good seat. They had us line up outside of the CBS lot on the sidewalk. I got there a good hour or so before the suggested arrival time of 3pm. After waiting until about 3:20 they finally checked our tickets and took us inside the gate to an outdoor seating area where they went over the show rules and the warmup comedian did his thing. From there, we went inside the building, up a few flights up stairs, and finally took our seats inside the studio. Once inside, the warmup comedian kept people going for a while longer, they showed a Late Late Show highlight video, then Craig came out and did his thing. The taping itself lasted about an hourish. We got out of there sometime between 5 and 6 if my memory serves me correct.You don't get to meet Craig or anyone on the show. He didn't really interact much with the crowd, but I didn't expect him to. The whole process obviously is most of an afternoon, so don't go in thinking it's just a 1 hour time commitment. It's well worth the time though if you're a fan. Besides, you might get to see a really cool celebrity guest!I shouldn't need to say it, but if you've ever watched Craig you'll know the show isn't exactly family friendly. It isn't something I would bring my kids to if I had any as there is a lot of adult humor and swearing. But like I said, if you've watched the show this should be well known.Oh, and it's free. How can you beat that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmazingJase
