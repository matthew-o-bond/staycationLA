10,Uber to LAX cost.,After being overcharged US$25 on a trip to LAX from Santa Monica I was finally offered a 13.99 credit for a future Uber ride. Many emails to various customer service agents only provided generic answers. Train your people to identify and solve the exact cause of the problem!So frustrating and unprofessional. No wonder you don't have a Rider contact phone number. It would be constantly manned dealing with complaints.Lesson to be learnt....always screen shot the initial trip cost......always!,Gary
10,Unreliable 信用できません,"This is unreliable and unprofessional shuttle service ever. After arriving to LAX, I let them know I am ready to be picked up. They assigned me a driver. After waiting 30 minutes, I called the driver asking when I am going to be picked up. Driver’s reply was he is not going to my destination area. He said “Sorry” and hang up. Then they sent me a message thanking me for using the service. I was still at LAX. Avoid this one.これは、信頼性が低く、プロフェッショナルではないシャトルサービスです。 LAXに到着した後、私は迎えに行く準備ができていることを彼らに知らせました。 彼らは私にドライバーを割り当てました。 30分待った後、私はドライバーに電話をかけて、迎えに行く時間を尋ねました。 ドライバーの返事は、彼が私の目的地に行かないということでした。 彼は「ごめんなさい」と言って電話を切りました。 それから彼らは私にサービスを使用してくれたことに感謝するメッセージを送った。 私はまだLAXにいました。 これは避けてください。",Torasan

10,Massive scam,Massive scam - common knowledge within shuttle service. Spoke to another carrier who when we relayed our experience guessed this company and said we were the second family here to be conned. They don’t show up and when you contact them claim you were a ‘ no show’. When you ring them you can here laughing in the background. As you would guess no refund. Common knowledge in LA that this bogus company is a scam. Even left my number for them to contact and when they did call back they phone call came back as a scam number. Avoid at all costs,Ryan west

10,Worse shuttle service,DON’T BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!! I just received a call at 2:17am telling me they cancelled my pick up at 4:15am to LAX airport. Two hours notice in the middle of the night. If you want reliable professional service this is not the company to use. You are better off hitch hiking.
