50,THE best way to explore Mt. Wilson MTB trails,Professionally organized shuttle operator. Met cool bunch of MTB enthusiasts on shuttle we could tag along to explore the world class trails on Mt. Wilson. I'll definitely do this again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xenon71
50,The only way to shuttle Mt. Wilson,"Mt. Wilson MTB Adventure is awesome. There is no point to organizing your own shuttle when they can do the work for you. We have used them a couple times now. We first did the Mt. Wilson Enduro Day with Tim, our shuttle driver. We packed in some awesome riding on Silver Moccasin up at Chilao Flat most of the day before riding Mt. Wilson to Chantry Flat. Tim kept feeding us more, and we just ate it up. It was an epic day thanks to Tim and Mt. Wilson MTB Adventure.For our second trip, we did a single run down the Garbrielino Trail. It was awesome to just show up and ride without worrying about logistics. If you are going to shuttle Mt. Wilson, go with Mt. Wilson MTB Adventure to do it right. We bought a 12 run shuttle package and can't wait for our next run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlekuhn
50,Big smiles Redbox - JPL CIA Gabrielino Trail,"I took the single run shuttle yesterday and instead of taking one of my usual frontside routes (1h15m to JPL) I jumped out at Redbox and rode the Gabrielino Trail down through Switzer and onto JPL parking lot to my car (2.5-3hours). This route is easygoing from Redbox to Switzer with one tricky rock garden near Switzer, Switzer itself is fun but plenty of tree root, creek crossing and rock gardens to negotiate. The next stage is enjoyable but there is recent treefall that you may have to clear off the trail and a few washout sections to approach with caution. The section in the Arroyo Seco valley is very river sandy and pretty easy to lose the trail completely. The final section has creek crossings and some fun jumps. Look out for hikers and horses on the lower Gabrielino Trail. Took me, a rookie, about 2hrs 45mins (including 20 minutes losing/finding the lower Gab trail). Great fun, *MTB Project app recommended to aid navigation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaconCeviche
50,Excellent Shuttle Service to the Top of Mt. Wilson,This was my first time shuttling to the top of Mt. Wilson. I will definitely be doing this again! The shuttle was on time and the driver was pleasant. No complaints. The Darkside was the bomb!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MtnBykGirl
40,Mt Wilson,"I'm a mature rider, 56 (yikes) and of strong intermediate to low advanced abilities. The Downieville DH is my fav' shuttle ride and 35+ mile days there is the norm'. .This was my first time riding Mt Wilson, using Chris and his shuttle.Quick e-mail response? Check.Quickly e-mailed me about a shuttle change and had me re-booked? Check.Shuttle on time? Check.Fast load/unload? Check.Gets you to your destination quickly? Check.Trail routes and conditions? Check.Courteous? Check.Enthusiasm? Check.What more could you want? Check.The negative reviews are by people who do NOT research before going, then complain when it's not designed for them. Trail conditions are not the responsibility of the shuttle Co.Idiots.I researched the company. They were courteous and responded promptly to inquiries and since I had never ridden there before he recommended the Enduro day, which I booked. Unfortunately not enough riders where going, and I fully understand the logistic costs for one rider, duh. Chris put me on the single run shuttle.I had a blast and went again the following day, single run ""Front side"". If your into astronomy or just great views, have the shuttle take you all the way up top to enjoy the views and checkout the telescopes and museum, then ride back down the hill to start ""Front side"".TRAILS: Since I actually researched the ride (you should too) by viewing numerous youtube videos, I knew exactly what I was getting. The trails were just as I had suspected, loose rocky topside and sandy flowy bottom side. Technical? There are no jumps, gaps, huge drops are park type features (maybe secretly), this is a state park not Mammoth people, duh. The trails themselves? Maybe less than a 1/4 overall would be (what I call) technical, with mini rock gardens, step drops (fun), several switchbacks, but all but maybe one or two are easily rideable, no dabs. There are only a few places where you can really open it up and boogey. The site lines along the trail are short, the brush can make it narrow with bar grabs here and there up top. Again, everything I had expected. The mid bottom trails are fast and flowy. Climbs? there were a couple, what I call transitional XC (non technical) gentle climbs. Very easy, the longest being less than a 1/2 mile (?).The exposure is real, but actually less than what I had built it up to in my mind. I walked one or two stupid short rocky sections that came up fast around a blind corner and I didn't have time (knowledge) to momentum over them. I could easily now. I never felt in any real peril of ""Going over the edge"", though if you day dream, your in trouble. Stay focused and stop to look around.So do your research, go have fun or listen to the lame negative reviews and go elsewhere.Peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbdbsb
20,Furthest Thing from a Downhill Day EVER!,"Wow. What a horrible time this was. Where to begin...?First of all, let's talk about communication. I booked this ""Enduro"" trip a few days out blindly. Their website is utter garbage; no where does it give you a map or itinerary of what is included in their various packages. Emailed and called Chris several times. Got one email back that didn't answer my questions in the least, nor did I get confirmation that this trip was actually booked enough to run until late the night before. Definitely not the experience I've had with professional shuttle services in Moab.Show up at the parking lot (parking is pretty plentiful at 10a on a weekday, thankfully) to a group of ~12. Chris and Bobby arrive in the van. Both are nice enough guys, but Chris dips out after 4 minutes and just tells us to listen to Bobby for directions. It's very clear that this business venture is not his bread and butter.The most exhilarating and genuinely life threatening part of the trip is being a passenger in this van with Bobby at the wheel. It is legit scary seeing how fast he drives on exposed, narrow mountain roads. You will absolutely be holding onto anything to avoid sliding around on the vinyl seats. I didn't know an Econoline could hang with a Civic Type-R until I booked this shuttle. However, the bike trailer is super legit and one of the nicest I've ever seen.If you survive the shuttle, Bobby will drop you at several places in the inner basin with extremely vague instructions on where the trails begin and where he will pick you up. Without Trailforks, finding these trails is utterly impossible. They all suffer from the classic California tradition of zero indication or signage of what a trail is called or where it goes.The trails themselves are pretty lame in my book. Not technical, very pedally, with a loose surface of sand and pea gravel that is great for marginal traction, especially in the very exposed, narrow sections. A few were overgrown and clearly had not had traffic for quite some time. Leads me to believe that the Enduro tour would be better called the ""Sucker's Shuttle."" I didn't ride anything I would ever choose to ride again on my own, and 90% of the people on the van were just there for the $20 Frontside Run shuttle. Shame on me.The final ""Frontside"" downhill run is hyped up to be one of the most epic downhill days in SoCal. Funny, given how the first few miles were climbing. Then more climbing in the middle, followed by a lot more climbing at the end. If you are expecting a Porcupine Rim-type experience, this is not it. Leave your big bike at home, since this trail is best on something with under 140mm travel given the endless switchbacks and numerous climbs.There is nothing technical or particularly fast about this trail. No rock slabs, jumps, gaps, or notable features on any kind other than ""Chutes"", which is just a super short, blown out, moon dust and gravel alternate line that parallels the main trail. This entire run must earn a black diamond only because of the exposure, which is a constant hazard most often found at the end of blind turns, near switchbacks or any of the many places where the trail has eroded and washed out to the point where there is a 1 ft off camber tread to ride by on. Use caution since visibility is awful; the scrub oak on either side of the single track is like riding in a corn field. As soon as you get a head of steam, the trail throws a deadly 90Â° turn with a 400 ft drop off at you that you can't see until you're 10 ft away from it.Organization is laughable. We lost 2 riders that started the first run with us, never to be seen again. No cell service, no CB radio and not even a list of passengers. If you miss the van on the Enduro tour, good luck!All in all, I was super disappointed. I didn't find the run fun at all; nothing redeeming, and long before the final run, I just wanted to be done. Not a great start to a SoCal mini-vacation, especially since there are dozens of trails that are much more fun and rewarding even with their more intense climbs. I guess you need to have more realistic expectations. Pay closer attention to the YouTube videos than I did, and understand that this is more of a moderate to aggressive XC run than a true DH shuttle day.I heard the words ""World Class"" uttered by some very friendly local guys, but I wholeheartedly disagree. These are some seriously dismal bike trails, and I wouldn't even consider them good hiking trails. ""Mediocre"" would be a genuine compliment in my book.But you won't know for sure unless you give it a try, I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weinerdrizzle3000
50,Great time exploring Mt Wilson,"Was in LA for a few days, so I took the the shuttle up with Chris to checkout the trails. Did Eaton saddle one day, and âThe Darksideâ the second (both Mt Wilson and Rim trail). The trails were great, although Rim is pretty sketchy, so be careful. Chris runs an excellent operation. Makes it super easy to book and ride through the website and is a very fair price. Highly recommend if your in the area and like to ride mountain bikes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erik586
50,Great service...Super Friendly,"The trails on Mt. Wilson are legendary. I've ridden here like 5 times, each time I learn something new. There are tons of other trails that I never even do. Chris (owner/operator) is super friendly, full of information and happy to help. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markcT7697TV

50,Mt Wilson MTB backdoor,Attended the Mt Lowe Railway Ramada overlook at the end of the Mt. Lowe Railway roadbed. It being a backdoor to Mt Wilson. Beginning at Millard Campground (overnight camping available) the trail extends 6.8 miles to the site of the Mt Lowe Hotel (ruins). Parallels the Grand Canyon of the San Gabrials. Moderately difficult with a very fast downhill return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
50,"Great riding, easy shuttle",Our driver did everything he could to accommodate us. He was a good driver and never made anyone second guess our trip up (I have been in some sketchy shuttles). The riding on mt. Lowe and dark side is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8414VZandrewm
50,The individual and personal tailored experiences with family of 5 on the mountain was first class!,"My family of 5 (wife and 3 boys) spent the day with Ken (Guide) and Chris Ashford who runs the business on an all day excursion that was OUTSTANDING, Personalized tour that could not have gone better! They responded to all my questions prior to arriving, had all the bikes ready to go, provided lunch and water, had a overview of the day and the shuttle to the top was SAFE and guided tour on the way down was ideal. We split the group (family) in two and one ride was more aggressive with KEN who showed us all the technical stuff and Chris took my wife and younger child around an easier path. We all made it back to the base and will definitely be going again with the crew at MTB Adventure! Thank you for your guidance and help Chris and Ken!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreggF442
50,Great mountain biking experience in the San Gabriel Mountains,"Mt. Wilson MTB Adventures delivers a great experience for anyone wanting guidance on where to ride in the San Gabriel mountains and a ride to the top of the mountain! Highly recommend this service to any mountain biking from beginner to expert and the price they charge is very affordable! Great for a group experience, with comfortable, large vans and a bike trailer that is easy to get your bike on and off of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712kelly

50,MTB Adventure's goes above and beyond,What a treasure it is to have this shuttle service available to the MTB community.Chris and team go out of their way to make their customers happy.I've ridden the shuttle at least 20 times. Yesterday's run was one of my favorites. The mountains are green the temperature was perfect and hardly anyone on the trail at 3PM.I always have my trail bell but it wasn't really needed yesterday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vjculture
50,New Year's Day 2017,"As a bike shop employee, we rarely get to ride with our co-workers, customers and friends so I started putting together New Year's Day rides quite a few years ago. We usually have large groups of people that show up and some of the rides we have done are best as a shuttle type of ride. Thankfully Chris of Mt. Wilson MTB Adventures operates on New Year's Day! He was able to get our group of 19 people to Eaton Saddle even on snow covered roads. He was a great host and explained the route to the group to help with any confusion once we got unloaded. I would recommend tapping in to his knowledge of the area and also take advantage of the clinics he offers to becoming a better rider.Thank you Chris!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannone2017

I just turned 67!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710keith
50,Excellent access to a new world of trails,"Most people think of shuttling as a way of ""cheating"" so you don't need to climb, but for those of us that love to climb, shuttles are still a vital part of the riding experience. The ability to be dropped off deep in the mountains and have access to an amazing network of trails that will bring you back to civilization is quite amazing. Similar to classic shuttles such as Cannell Plunge or The Whole E, Mt Wilson MTB Adventure can drop you off for equally as epic trails that will consume all of your climbing and DH strength!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaacW260
40,Great Mt. Bike trip!,"So easy to get to the top of the mountains in the Angeles Forest! Put your bike in the trailer, climb in the van, and enjoy the view as Chris drives you up the hill. We had lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ej322016

Anything from rocky alpine exposure to forest loam and everything in between. You are doing yourself a disservice if you aren't riding with Mt Wilson MTB adventure.Mt Wilson MTB adventure can help you plan a ride that can last from a few hours to a full day.

From easy fire roads to technical exposed single track.Such an amazing resource to have in the Los Angeles area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vjculture
50,Awesome!,A great service to shuttle up to the top and bike down. The trailer is easy to load bike onto and unload. This a great service for only $20 for ride up the mountain. I had a blast and Chris even helped me by showing me on the map the trails to take.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_Dub866
50,"Great service, great riding, great value","Simple as it can be, meet in the JPL parking lot, load up your bike, enjoy a scenic ride to the top of Mt Wilson, and enjoy the excellent network of trails on the way down. Just make sure you know which trails you want to take and where you're going as there are a lot of options. Mt Lowe to El Prieto has some excellent singletrack. It can get hot so go early (8AM is great) and bring plenty of water. Totally worth the $20. Will def do again. P.S. Make sure not to leave anything in the van (I learned from experience)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpeebo

50,Adventure Above the Clouds,What an amazing way to start the day! The Dawn Patrol shuttle for the Mt Wilson shuttle met at 5:50am at the Windsor Parking lot by JPL. We loaded up our bikes & headed up the hill without pedaling! Our driver Chris was so friendly & informative. All the other riders were nice & excited to ride too. We started off high above all the clouds - the sunrise & views were breath taking. The ride down was so fun! It has a bit of everything you could want on a mountain bike adventure. The trails are challenging & fun. A few spots I chose to walk. I loved every minute of it! Looking forward to going again & checking out some of the other trail options - like the Darkside & the Enduro Tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahd212

50,Big Mountain Riding in Los Angeles,"The network of trails in San Gabriel back country is unquestionable the most advanced in all of SoCal. If you want to test out your skills you have to plan a trip with Chris. That being said, you can take your time, walk down the chutes, be safe and still have the adventure of a lifetime. A friend, who is a pro racer, says this is the closest riding to Trans-Provence is all the world. And we all know that is the pinnacle of mountain biking.Chris and the guys who use the shuttle are some of the raddest people around, they will be cool and help you out, even though they are way faster than you. If you are going solo or with a group who have never ridden the san gabes the crew on the shuttle will help you find your way, you may even get someone to guide you back to the car.With three years of experience using SCOA to launch epic rides, I have nothing negative to say. Try it once, you'll get hooked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1422RFnickp

Part of the credit goes to the awesome trails in the Mt. Wilson Area but Chris from MWMTBA makes life simple with his flexibility and great pricing. Every time I leave town to ride I find myself asking why I didn't just stay in LA and shuttle with these guys.
