40,Old school since 1971,I've been coming to Griffith Park for decades and this was my first time to this hidden gem. The hike from the parking lot areas up to the top was pretty easy for the average hiker. It was nice seeing the different plants and trees growing in this part of the park and being well maintained. l look forward in visiting again in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
