50,hidden pearl,"I know I call it hidden peal is not totally appropriate, because this place is huge. I lived in Pasadena for a year almost twenty year ago, but I never went to this place and I did not even realize its existence. Now I have to make a trip there on purpose after I heard it from my friend. Its desert garden is magnificent. I have never seen any place with so many desert plants, their size are huge, they are so well maintained and must be very old. another good place to go is Chinese garden, where lunch is served by a small restaurant. It is located next to Japanese garden. It is still under construction but it is big and has taken a shape mimicking Summer Palace in Beijing, China. however, I feel the buildings they claim to be Chinese are more like Japanese style, with the roof extension going up with an exaggerated angle. Ancient Chinese buildings with these extensions tend to be more flat and often has animal statues sitting on them. another thing I'd like to mention is since the garden is so big, hiking inside is very exhausting, although it is good walk, in a sense of exercise. I am sure if they offer some transportation, scooter, bicycle etc for rent will not only improve the service, it probably will be profitable. They do have a small electrical cart running around, but the service is very minimally provided. intervals between them are too long, and the seat is very limited. In this garden, there are art galleries to visit too. I just wrote another review about Butchart garden of Victoria, BC, Canada. compare these gardens are not easy because the styles are totally different, but Huntington desert garden and library is not inferior to Butchart, although not as well known. Huntington is more natural, and Butchart is more artificial, if you want me to comment.",lee
50,A 'Lush' Desert Garden,"After visiting many desert gardens I was expecting the standard cacti on rocks display. What a surprise though.

The cactus garden is a feast for the eyes, challenging the observer to look, and then look closer to see hidden treasures of texture and light. In the Japanese garden, you will be able to walk down meandering paths, next to soaring stands of bamboo, and ponds filled with Koi fish and water turtles. Then visit the Bonzi tree garden, where exquisite examples of Bonzi trees in a setting next to a meditation garden. And no visit would be complete without a visit to the Rose garden!

Every single one of us thoroughly enjoyed being there. All of us want to return to see more (impossible to do in 1 day)! Great lawns for th 4 year old to run! Extensive pathways to wander through as you go from one area to another, so much to learn, so much to see...Parents were thrilled to see how much their teenagers enjoyed it! Snack bar got poor reviews from all, next time we'll head for the restaurant on site instead. Wanted to shop in the wonderful store which offered many things of beauty, fun and practicality. However, only 2 cashiers open and long lines were moving slowly. We were not the only ones to return our desired purchases to their shelves and leave without making any purchases at all! .... something the site needs to look at! A lot of money lost that day!

It is a real joy to walk around and there are many shaed places to sit. I would highly recommend it. My enthusiasm is real and i'm not someone paid to promote it.

Then the pine trees whose branches go tens of feet on the ground only to start up in new trees, etc. They even have an annual family pass. Simply, do not miss it.",Dudy D
50,The best of the Huntington,There are a lot of different gardens in the Huntington but this desert garden outperforms the rest. You can see so many different cacti. I am a huge cacti fan so I had marvelous time looking around different kind of species.,minimize940314
50,A Photographer's Dream,"I have already reviewed The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, an outstanding attraction. The desert garden was the first feature we went through on our visit. It features a great variety of desert plants from around the world, some of which I had not seen before. The landscaping was outstanding. I've included a few of my pictures.",H Joseph F
50,Spectacular Gardens!,"I felt like Alice in Wonderland. And the roses aren't even in bloom yet. The desert garden is beyond description! The colors, the amazing species you will not ever see anywhere else...just incredible. I have been a lifelong resident of California and never had been until 2 weeks ago. Since then, I've been 4 times and bought a membership. This is a must see in So Cal!",Jaspersonalized
50,Beautiful Desert Garden,This garden is a part of multiple gardens and art galleries at the Huntington. It has so many exotic plants and flowers from deserts. Highly recommend to stop by if you're at the Huntington!,Maximilian G
50,This is definitely the best desert garden!,"It has an amazing variety of collections. Beautiful settings and well designed desert garden. Even in December, you still can find many are flowering! In contracts of monster sized cacti, there are also many tiny varieties on ground. Grouped by different colored succulents, it makes a beautiful picture everywhere. Nice to walk through, great photo taken opportunities. Amazing garden indeed!",PortDoverBeach
50,Magnificent desert gardens,"This is my favorite area at the Huntington. This garden was planted originally over 100 years ago. It has been beautifully maintained and enhanced over all of those years. The plants, cacti and succulents are amazing. You will want to photograph all of them but there are thousands of specimens. Don't miss this wonderful garden if you visit the Huntington.",Jill B
40,A Century Old Desert Garden - The Historical Garden of the Huntingtons is Magical!,"The most significant thing to me about the cactus gardens at Huntington Library is the amazing work the ""founders"" put into making this amazingly stunningly beautiful cactus gardens at the Huntington Library.Henry Huntington and his wife with their gardeners put in this amazing desert area at the Huntington estate. The garden has delighted many for a century. The amount of labor and love to make this garden originally is what truly counts.There is of course a current gardening staff who maintains it and makes some changes. Unfotunately I watched as she mismanaged her gardener team on a Friday afternoon. She should listen to the wisdom of the past and her team more. She should remember the amazing gardeners that came before her. She should also treat the other gardeners with more respect. It is a great garden with the vision of the Huntington's and their gardener team.If interested in seeing it, make it a priority, We have visited Huntington Library many many times. Sometimes we have run out of time to visit given the number of things to see at the library.We give your thanks to the gardeners of a century ago who put so much love into this amazing desert garden in the San Gabriel Valley.",mini
50,Strolling in the desert garden,"The Huntington Library has several types of gardens - Chinese, Japanese, Desert, Rose Garden and even a hot house. I cannot say which one is the best because everyone is the best of it's kind.",Maria A
50,The best desert garden I have seen,"There are extensive cacti and other succulents in the Desert Garden. Most of them I have never seen before. They are arranged very nicely, you may many types planted together to become a beautiful photo opportunity.",RChangla
40,Desert was never like this,Cactus that amaze you and just go on and on. Do not forget to look up the size of these make you wonder how much care goes into this place.,John M
50,Beautiful place to visit even in the heat!,We arrived on a day with rolling blackouts so many of the buildings were closed for long periods of time. Received a reduced rate because of this and set off.Wonderful scenes with exotic flowers and trees but also plenty of seats to just relax and commune with nature when it got tiring. Loved the Japanese and Chinese gardens with the buildings but my favorite was the Desert garden. Great ( expensive) shop store.Too much to see in one day :( but a great need to keep coming back.,Colorteal
50,Wonderful,Great selection of cacti and succulents. A must see when you visit the Huntington Library. The path is beautiful. It is the best garden in the whole of Huntington Library.,GTSP

50,Desert Beauties,"A big garden with tons of species to see. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting the Huntington. It is lively and blooming this time of year. Clear paths, a lot of turns , I got somewhat lost but overall very nice garden. I enjoyed it.",Liz C

50,Awesome Place To Visit,We went to check this beautiful desert collection they got and it sure is nice to discover and see the big selection they got .. Must see,GENA2010
50,Beautiful,"If you like gardens, you'll love this. I could spend all day walking the grounds. They do a spectacular job maintaining and planning the gardens. Different times of year boast different displays so it's worth going back MANY times.",Roxp8982
50,The Most Beautiful and Comprehensive Desert Display,"As a gardener and garden writer, I travel the globe visiting gardens. The Huntington Desert Garden comprises the most spectacular display of cacti and succulents in 60 different beds that I’ve ever witnessed. With the lack of water a major issue for California gardeners, examining these 5000 species of drought resistant specimens is a lesson in water conservation combined with beauty. 5 STARS",StarLady99
50,Who Would Think a Desert Garden Could Look So Beautiful?,There are many other gardens to visit at The Huntington but make sure you don't miss the Desert Garden. Surprisingly compelling once you start to walk done one of the paths. The diversity of cacti and other succulents will keep you looking for more. If you are lucky enough to be there when the cacti are flowering you will be treated to spectacular colors arrayed among the spiny plants. The Huntington charges an entry fee of $20 for an adult (seniors get a better rate) but parking is free and the cost of admission is worth taking in all the natural and man-made beauty at this destination.,IslandGuy2014
50,Great place to take out of state visitors in the winter,Took some friends from Oregon here in February who could not believe the color and blooms at that time of year when they were still under months of grey. Amazing collection of succulents and cactus.,Cynthia A
50,Spectacular Desert Garden at the Huntington Library,"We always enjoy visiting the desert gardens at Huntington Library. It has a wide variety of desert plants and well worth several hours by itself.If one wants to see the desert gardens in particular, do it first. There is so much to see at Huntington Library and given their hours, we love to see them but always end up here at the end of the visit day and thus have to ""rush"" through a bit to see this spectacular desert garden at the Huntington Library.There is an admission fee to see Huntington Library - but once paid for - the desert gardens are included in the price.",mini
50,"Desert Garden, plus lots more + museum + library + art works","The Huntington Desert Garden is just a small part of the Huntington Library grounds. $20 admission for adults weekdays ($23 w/end), $15 seniors ($18 w/end), $12 students ($13 w/ends). Parking is easy & it's free (at least is now). You need a full day to explore. Similar to the Getty museum and/or Getty Villa in its setup. What's there: Gardens (Botanical, Australian, Children's, Chinese, Conservatory, Desert, Herb, Japanese, Jungle, Lily ponds, Palm, Rose, Shakespeare, Subtropical), Art (American, European & changing exhibitions), Library Exhibition Hall, outdoor sculptures. There's restrooms and cafe there - reasonable priced ($8 for a nice salad with salmon, $4 for fruit cup & cooked panini to name a few). Current exhibitions that were on today (July 24 2014): History of Science Exhibition. Take water, sunscreen & hat - lots of open spaces & it's located in a generally warm spot of LA. Be prepared for lots of walking - pretty flat, easy, though. I could go back there on a yearly basis, as there is so much I could spend more time looking at & exploring.",nswperson
50,Blooming Cacti....Imagine that!!,"I just love this place. Every time I visit this area, I have to stop by the Huntington Library. Every time, there is something wondrous for me to see. This time it was the blooming cacti! I could not believe all the different flowers cacti had! The humming birds and bees were having a ball! There were all different sizes and shapes of flowers to see. I was truly amazed at the beauty the desert had to offer. We also visited the Chinese and Japanese gardens which had their own beauty in January. A must see for the whole family. Make sure you bring your cameras because there are lots of great pictures waiting to be taken!!",8umble8ee
50,Definitely Worth a Trip,"The overall Huntington Library and Gardens are amazing. And the Desert Garden is the cherry on top. It's a stunning collection of cacti and succulents that would be worth visiting on it's own but is all the more amazing when you consider it's just one of several incredible gardens you can visit while at the Huntington.While technically in tiny San Marino, please know that the Huntington is at the south end of Pasadena and under 10 miles from downtown LA.Don't miss it!",Greg_K_Review

50,Best desert garden outside Arizona,"Hundreds of plants and cacti will make you feel like you are really in the desert. The paths here can handle a wheelchair, but it's not really paved, so it will be a struggle. Come when the desert flowers bloom.",Cruise_Ship_Tony
50,Amazing Cactuses,Never seen anything like it. The variety of plants and sizes was extraordinary. One of the best dry gardens I have ever seen.Just outstanding!!,remopigl
50,World Class Gardens,"Where to start with the gardens?? We visited the Rose Garden, Shakespeare Garden, Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Passed by the Australian Garden and spent some time in the Desert Garden. The Chinese Garden is still being developed but is very nice, built round a lake with a tea house. The Japanese Garden is outstanding and quite relaxing – built on the hillside with a house with ceremonial tea room, stream with moon bridge and a Zen Garden. The Desert Garden has a huge selection of mature succulents and covers several acres – amazing to see.We did not have time to see all the gardens but what we did see was great. Well worth a visit and highly recommended. We will be back next time we are in Los Angeles.",Whistledown

40,our favorite place to go....,"We have been members of the Huntington since 1992. There's so much to see and do, it's hard to do it all in one trip, so we come regularly, as much for the changing of the seasons as the various exhibitions. Our daughter has grown up with the Huntington in her backyard so to speak, and loves to go. Tip: if you can't get into the tea room or just want a small meal, there is a cafeteria behind the tea room where the food is very good, if a bit overpriced for basically take-out.You won't be disappointed no matter what time of year you go; even rainy days have their own special magic....",marynotmartha
50,Like being on another planet,"The huge, odd-shaped cacti will delight visitors of all types. We were fascinated by the many varieties of aloe plants, century plants, and bulbous trunked desert trees. Some cacti were blooming this January. My guest said she had never seen so many wierd shapes and huge desert plants. We were glad we were wearing comfortable shoes because the desert garden is big and the hike back up a long, slight hill to the museums takes longer than going down. This rates in the top ten of my favorite gardens of the world.",Linda M

Lovely paths, a variety of different gardens (the desert garden is just one of the climatic zones represented on the grounds). Always a delightful visit -- and the children's garden is a great place to bring young kids -- there's mists and echoes and all kinds of nifty experiences kids love.",Jimverbose
