50,A nursery of brilliant minds in a beautiful campus,"Caltech has a small, very walkable, beautiful campus. Its size belies its high concentration of mental power: this small campus has produced a disproportionate share of Nobel Prize winners in the sciences. The older buildings have a distinct Spanish influence (long corridors with wooden beams, carved doors, tiles, courtyards with pools and gardens), and beautifully landscaped gardens abound. An interesting walk would take you down the Olive Walk from the Athenaeum, the hotel for campus guests, to the area where the undergrad houses are located, to the various university buildings and labs. A water garden in the center of campus is the habitat of maybe hundreds of turtles, who love to bask in the sun. A bit farther afield is the athletic complex (football field, swimming pool, etc.). The campus has a number of sculptures, among them notable scientists linked to the Institute, many of them Nobel Prize winners. Walking through the campus is free!",Agnes Q

However, a little pond in front of it was not, and was populated by turtles that will come out if you stand by it. If you go, bring some fruit to feed the turtles - they definitely liked bananas and come out of the water to get it (not sure if this is encouraged so do it at your own risk!).

You will learn a lot from their experience !The campus is a quite and clean and small, the atmosphere is totally different than UCLA or UC Berekely, there are not many students around during my visit and I asked one of the student and he said usually they will go to studying even it is a Saturday or weekend, you can feel that how they love the science !It is an excellent university who obsessed in science !

The school bookstore has interesting unique items related to science. It also has a NASA JPL section. Caltech has various seminar series that are open to the general public which I found very educational. Exploring the campus reveals ""Caltech"" things like the fountain tiles at the entrance to Moore Laboratory with schematic diagrams. Caltech underground has a series of tunnels connecting various buildings that bring back WWII and cold war memories. I viewed the new supercomputer on a recent visit. Watching amazing trick plays by the Football Team or visiting the Seismological Laboratory can round off your visit to this great campus.

The strangest building is Cahill, the Department of Astrophysics and Astronomy. Wonderful is the Athenaeum, the building for gala receptions. There are no architectonical barriers. Every building combines functionality with architectural beauty.",GdN80100
50,Fabulous Campus to Walk Around,"A stunning campus full of buildings with interesting architecture (some old colonial, some 60s contemporary, some stunning modern) and glorious grounds to walk around. Amazing range of trees and some cool spots to sit like near the turtle pond. Good parking on campus. Tremendous place to walk and there seems to always be a breeze.",LoveWailea

50,Excellent university,"Nice spacious campus, a small community but very vibrant. Nice place to study in. Campus is close knitted and warm.",Pamela N
50,Beautiful campus,"This university has a beautiful campus. We don't have a park nearby, but this campus is even better than a park. I've also visited meetings and concerts here and have always had a good experience.",Swantje W
40,Nights at the Atheneum,"There's a Friday night beer garden in the summer at the Atheneum Club. You have to be a guest or member to attend, but it's a delightful Pasadena experience. The campus is beautiful, and with people eating and drinking and little kids running around playing on the greens -- it's one of my favorite summer experiences.",Jimverbose
50,Amazing Institution,"Beautiful, lovely grounds and buildings, students from all over the world...very intelligent people,",Rivka
40,Big Bang Theory,Had to visit the seting of my favorite TV show. Hoped to see Nerds in their natural habitat but I guess I will have to tune in to the TV show for that,Tom O
50,Best Science University in the World,"Caltech is widely regarded as the best science, math and engineering school in the world. Check out the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. For its relatively small size it has a sizable and extremely beautiful campus in Pasadena, California, tucked up against the San Gabriel mountains. It is well worth visiting and better yet, attending. I am biased, of course, because my son is a student there and loves it.",jmgradon
50,Get into the Faculty Club if you can,"The campus is a gem, interesting fountains created from millions of years old boulders from the surrounding hills. If you have access or a chance to stay or eat at the Faculty Club, called The Athenauem, be sure and do it. Einstein and many other luminaries lived here. Very upscale and classic spot.",ErnDev
50,Brains and Beautiful Gardens,"Practically every person you see walking this campus is brilliant; many of our best rocket scientists come from here.Even Einstein stayed at CalTech and rode his bike through the campus while thinking great thoughts. But the average person will especially love the lush gardens: the lily pond, the sunken garden with the water buffalo statue, the water features and pools. It's a hidden sanctuary in the heart of the city.",Tidetalker
50,The templum of modern science,"Caltech has been since almost a century one of the leading scientific institutions in the world. Entire fields of research originated here, think for instance about cosmology and modern astronomy.From the point of view of a tourist there is very little to see besides the pleasant atmosphere, the wonderful gardens and some precious buildings.But if you are not only a tourist but a science enthusiast then tarnsform the visit into a pilgrimage and go visit the Millikan LIbary, brush the nose of the Millikan statue in the East wing (a Caltech legend says that if you do so you shall surely return), chech the Atheneum where scientists like Einstein, George Ellery Hale, MIllikan, slept, enjoy the calm, relaxing beautiful atmosphere of one of the modern temples of science and knowledge",giulonragu
50,Amazing,"Just walking the grounds of this place makes you feel smarter! Truly lovely setting, and to be able to play tennis at this place every week as I do, is a real privilege.",Pat M
50,in the land of science,"Caltech is rated among the top three or four research institutions in the world. It is a special place, and given the high quality of its landscaping, it is a joy to stroll around. Who would guess that such an outwardly peaceful environment harbours a high powered scientific epicentre?",enroute55
40,"Good climate, maintained and new institutes","CALTECH is a well known college on the west coast of usa, california. Tok a college tour across CA. Nice campus, open for everyone to see. Cheap parking and well maintained and green campus with lots of nature. Did join a project presentation with great posters. Nice climate and old and new institute buildings mixed. Unfortunatly they don't offer a guided campus tour.",Wendler-Philipp
50,Not the prettiest campus around but . . .,"much nicer than I expected. We wandered around, had a coffee in one of the student union cafes and generally enjoyed the ambience. The flowers and other landscaping were nice, but some of the building were a little out of place (not the best mid-century examples). The original older buildings were very prototypical of California campuses of the early 20th century.",susanbeach11
50,"Beautiful campus, mecca of science",I love to stroll along the olive walk. Ending at the Atheneum - a beautiful faculty club built 80 years ago. Great place for weddings if you have contacts. Outstanding scientific lectures during the academic year and a medly of artistic performances.,sealbeachtraveler
50,Great Speakers,When I first moved to Pasadena I loved feeling like I was smart just because I was able to attend some of the lectures and understand what they were talking about. The school as a whole has a beautiful campus and is very welcoming to the community.,MarketingDiva
50,Beautiful Campus,Lovely buildings and campus in Pasadena. Home of many Nobel Laureates and the Seismographic Laboratory seen on TV after earthquakes.,worldrunner
50,Beautiful Campus -- Brilliant Lectures --,"A small school, beautiful campus. Quiet and serene.",TikiTownTraveler
50,Beautiful campus,A wonderful place to spend relaxing hours looking at the fish and turtle ponds and fantastic architecture.,Wil S
50,Best school around,"Made top ranked in the world last year, yet actually cares about their students. Small (as I remember it, the freshman class is around 400 each year), but extremely high quality.",1goofybird
50,A REAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY,"Cal Tech has always been ready to share their buildings, grounds and prestigious professors for good causes. I've held various events on the campus and enjoyed the cooperation of outstanding faculty members. The Atheneum provides a beautiful setting and good food. Beckman offers great programs",BETTY S
40,"Beautiful campus, friendly people","My husband works here, so I'm often on campus. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with eucalyptus and olive trees, fountains, & sculptures. The on-campus cafeteria has great quality food but is a little pricey for a college cafeteria. Be sure to check out the lily ponds, there are turtles and frogs (just don't feed them). Worth a visit if in Pasadena.",Jessica A
