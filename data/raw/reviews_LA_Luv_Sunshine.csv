50,My favorite antique shop & gift shop- in or out of the canyon!,"Luv & Sunshine is just that, a finely curated shop filled with loving treasures and lots of sunshine! The owner has given special attention to creating a sweet ambiance that allows you to travel around the world with her hand selected finds. They are always restocking items and you can ask about any piece in there to understand exactly where it came from, who made, and it’s special meaning... you don’t walk in and choose an item, these items choose you!I’ve purchased numerous gifts for friends (and yes, myself too- it’s so hard not too!)... from moonstone jewelry pieces to wall hangings, to textiles, to an antique Moroccan lamp... this list is endless. I’m always stopping in at various times in my life to see what magic awaits!I recommend getting on her mailing list or follow via IG for special announcements, sales, and events.",MissD819
