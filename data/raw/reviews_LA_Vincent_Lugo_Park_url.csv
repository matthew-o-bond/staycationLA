40,Great neighborhood park for kids,"Vincent Lugo Park is famous for its dinosour, dragons and theme play area for kids. It is not a big size park but it has enough sitting areas for family gatherings. It has a baseball field and now a walking trail. I love the new little workout machines that you can use for specific body parts and they are placed throughout the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicel926
